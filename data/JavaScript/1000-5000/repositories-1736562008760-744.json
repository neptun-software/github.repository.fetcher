There is one file per entry named after the domain, located in the\nsubdirectory starting with the first letter of the domain. Site icons\nare stored in folders corresponding to each of those entries in their own\n[folder][img]. Please ensure any JSON files that are edited conform to our [`.editorconfig`][editorconfig].\n\n## Guidelines\n\n1. **Don't break the build**: We have a simple continuous integration system\n   setup with GitHub Actions. If your pull request doesn't pass, it won't be\n   merged. GH Actions will only check your changes after you submit a pull request.\n2. **Use a Nice Icon**: SVG is the preferred format. If possible, please also run the image\n   through an optimizing utility such as [svgo][svgo] (command line) or [SVGOMG][SVGOMG] (web) to reduce the file size.\n   If an SVG icon is not available, the icon should be a PNG with a resolution of 32x32, 64x64, or 128x128.\n   If possible, run the PNG image through an optimizing utility such as [TinyPNG][tinypng] so that it ideally is below 3 kB in size.\n3. **HTTPS links**: All sites that support HTTPS should also be linked with an HTTPS address.\n4. **Similarweb top 200K**: A new site that is not already listed has to be within the\n   Similarweb top 200,000 global rankings. You can check the ranking of a site [here][similarweb].\n5. **No 2FA providers**: We do not list 2FA providers, such as [Authy][authy], [Duo][duo] or\n   [Google Authenticator][googleauthenticator].\n\n## Site Criteria\n\nThe following section contains rough criteria and explanations regarding\nwhat websites should be listed in 2fa.directory. If one of the following\ncriteria is met, it belongs in 2fa.directory:\n\n1. **Personal Info**: Any site that deals with personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, photo, age, address, etc.\n2. **Data**: This criterion relates to data that is either important or sensitive.\n   Websites detailed in Criteria 1 also fit this criteria.\n3. **Money**: Any site that deals with money.\n4. **Control**: This criteria is more general, in that it includes sites that\n   give access to things that may infringe upon criteria 1, 2, or 3. An example\n   of this is a website that allows remote access to a device.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding whether or not a site matches one of the\ncriteria, simply open an issue and we'll take a look.\n\n### Excluded Sites\n\nA list of excluded sites and categories has also been created with various categories and sites that we have opted not\nto list on 2fa.directory.\nYou should check the list in the [EXCLUSION.md file][exclude] to make sure that your site is eligible before submitting\na pull request.\n\n## New Sites\n\nFirst and foremost, make sure the new site meets our [definition\nrequirements][definitions] of two-factor authentication.\n\nIf you are adding multiple sites to the 2FA Directory, please create a new\ngit branch for each website, and submit a separate pull request for each branch.\nMore information regarding how to create new git branches can be found on\n[GitHub's Help Page][github-tutorial].\n\nAdding a new website should be pretty straightforward. Create a JSON file in\nthe corresponding [subdirectory][entries] as shown in the following example:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Site Name\": {\n    \"domain\": \"site.com\",\n    \"img\": \"site.com.png\",\n    \"tfa\": [\n      \"sms\",\n      \"call\",\n      \"email\",\n      \"totp\",\n      \"u2f\",\n      \"custom-software\",\n      \"custom-hardware\"\n    ],\n    \"documentation\": \"<link to site TFA documentation>\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"category1\",\n      \"category2\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- The domain should point to the main page of the service, not the login page (usually the root domain, not a\n  subdomain).\n- Categories must be selected from the values listed in [`categories.json`][categories].\n- The default value for the icon is `<domain>.svg`, but can be overridden by an `img`\n  field.\n- If you would like the site's link on 2fa.directory to be different from `https://<domain>`, you can use a `url` field to\n  specify this.\n\n#### Adding a site that _supports_ TFA\n\nSites that provide TFA can be noted with the `tfa` field and should contain the TFA methods supported.\nIf a site does provide TFA, it is strongly recommended that you add the `documentation`\nfield where public documentation is available.\nSites supporting TFA must not have a `contact` property.\n\nThe following is an example of a website that _supports_ TFA:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"YouTube\": {\n    \"domain\": \"youtube.com\",\n    \"tfa\": [\n      \"sms\",\n      \"call\",\n      \"totp\",\n      \"custom-software\",\n      \"u2f\"\n    ],\n    \"documentation\": \"https://www.google.com/intl/en-US/landing/2step/features.html\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"entertainment\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Adding a site that _does not_ support TFA\n\nIf a site does not provide TFA, the `contact` field should be included.\nInside this object,\n\n- The `twitter` field should be included if the site uses Twitter.\n- Facebook can also be included using the `facebook` field.\n- Email can be included using the `email` field.\n- Contact forms can be included using the `form` field.\n- Only email or a contact form can be added, not both. Emails are preferred over\n  contact forms.\n- The `language` field inside `contact` can be included for websites whose social\n  media pages/communication channels do not use English. The language codes should\n  be lowercase [ISO 639-1][iso-lang-wikipedia] codes.\n\nDo not add the `tfa`, `notes`, `documentation`, or `recovery` fields.\n\nThe following is an example of a website that _does not_ support TFA:\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Netflix\": {\n    \"domain\": \"netflix.com\",\n    \"contact\": {\n      \"facebook\": \"netflix\",\n      \"twitter\": \"Netflixhelps\"\n    },\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"entertainment\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Exceptions & Restrictions\n\nIf a site requires the user to do something out of the ordinary to set up 2FA or if 2FA is\nonly available to specific account types, you can document this using the `notes` field.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Site Name\": {\n    \"domain\": \"site.com\",\n    \"tfa\": [\n      \"totp\"\n    ],\n    \"documentation\": \"<link to site TFA documentation>\",\n    \"notes\": \"Specific text goes here.\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"category\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Adding a site that is only available or is prevalent in specific regions\n\nIf a site (with or without 2FA) is only available in certain countries or most users are located in certain countries -\nfor example a government site or a local retailer - you can note this with the `regions` field.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Site Name\": {\n    \"domain\": \"site.com\",\n    \"tfa\": [\n      \"totp\"\n    ],\n    \"documentation\": \"<link to site TFA documentation>\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"category\"\n    ],\n    \"regions\": [\n      \"us\",\n      \"ca\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe country codes should be lowercase [ISO 3166-1][iso-country-wikipedia] codes.\n\nIf you want to distinguish the entry from others of the same company or service in order to provide a unique name,\nuse `\"Site Name [CC]\"` where `CC` is the country code.\n\n#### Excluded Regions\n\nIf a site is available globally apart from a specific region, this can be noted using the `regions` array. Excluded\nregions should be prefixed with a `-` symbol to exclude the site from that region. Region codes and excluded region\ncodes should **not** be used together, as adding a region code automatically excludes the site from other regions. The\nexample below shows a site that is available in all regions apart from `us`.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Site Name\": {\n    \"domain\": \"site.com\",\n    \"tfa\": [\n      \"totp\"\n    ],\n    \"documentation\": \"<link to site TFA documentation>\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"category\"\n    ],\n    \"regions\": [\n      \"-us\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Other Properties\n\n- `additional-domains`\n  If a site exists at another domain in addition to the main domain that is listed in the\n  `domain` field, you can mark this with the `additional-domains` property.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Site Name\": {\n    \"domain\": \"site.com\",\n    \"additional-domains\": [\n      \"site.net\",\n      \"site.io\"\n    ],\n    \"tfa\": [\n      \"totp\"\n    ],\n    \"documentation\": \"<link to site TFA documentation>\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"category\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- `recovery`\n  The recovery field can be used to link to account recovery documentation about what to do\n  if you lose access to your 2FA method.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Site Name\": {\n    \"domain\": \"site.com\",\n    \"tfa\": [\n      \"totp\"\n    ],\n    \"documentation\": \"<link to site TFA documentation>\",\n    \"recovery\": \"<link to site TFA recovery documentation>\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"category\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n- `custom-software`/`custom-hardware`\n  If a site uses a proprietary software or hardware method, you can add specific details of what\n  is being used. Examples would be Authy or non-U2F security keys.\n\n```JSON\n{\n  \"Site Name\": {\n    \"domain\": \"site.com\",\n    \"tfa\": [\n      \"custom-software\",\n      \"custom-hardware\"\n    ],\n    \"custom-software\": [\n      \"Authy\"\n    ],\n    \"custom-hardware\": [\n      \"Yubico OTP\"\n    ],\n    \"documentation\": \"<link to site TFA documentation>\",\n    \"categories\": [\n      \"category\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Pro Tips\n\n- See Guideline #2 about icons. The SVG file should go in the corresponding\n  `img/` folder.\n\n- For the sake of organization and readability, it is appreciated if your site chunk\n  follows the same order as the example earlier in the document.\n\n- If a site supports TFA, their contact information is not needed and must be left out.\n\n## Categories\n\nEntries on 2fa.directory have to be put into categories. An entry can have one or many categories.\nBelow is a table of each available category, the name of the category, which title it has on 2fa.directory with a\ndescription.\n\n| Name             |           Title           | Description                                                                         |\n| ---------------- | :-----------------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| backup           |      Backup and Sync      | Online backup and cross-device file synchronization                                 |\n| banking          |          Banking          | Online banking platforms                                                            |\n| betting          |          Betting          | Betting and gambling                                                                |\n| cloud            |      Cloud Computing      | \"Serverless\" cloud computing                                                        |\n| communication    |       Communication       | Online communication platforms excluding email and social media                     |\n| creativity       |        Creativity         | Art and design software                                                             |\n| crowdfunding     |       Crowdfunding        |                                                                                     |\n| cryptocurrencies |     Cryptocurrencies      | Any site whose main purpose is handling cryptocurrencies                            |\n| developer        |         Developer         | Development software                                                                |\n| domains          |          Domains          | DNS registrars                                                                      |\n| education        |         Education         | Non-university education platforms                                                  |\n| email            |           Email           | Email providers                                                                     |\n| entertainment    |       Entertainment       | Audio/Video entertainment excluding games                                           |\n| finance          |          Finance          | Financial and pension services                                                      |\n| food             |           Food            | Food and beverage services                                                          |\n| gaming           |          Gaming           | Games and game platforms.

For the\npurposes of this site, two-factor authentication is defined as any service provided as a\nredundant layer for account _authentication_. Services that provide\n_authorization_ redundancy are certainly appreciated, but should not be\nconsidered two-factor authentication.\n\nAs an example, a site that prompts you for an authentication token following\nuser login would be considered two-factor authentication. A site that does not prompt you\nfor a token upon login, but prompts you for a token when you try to perform a\nsensitive action would not be considered two-factor authentication.\n\nFor context, check out the discussion in issue [#242][242].\n\n### Passwordless Authentication\n\nMany sites now offer passwordless authentication, replacing the traditional password (something you know) with a different factor, such as something you have or are. Examples include sites allowing users to log in using a U2F key or a magic link without requiring a second factor. While these methods enhance security, it's important to note that our 2FA Directory focuses on platforms providing two distinct factors for authentication. For passkey-specific options, we invite you to explore the [Passkeys Directory][passkeys-directory].

          "content": "# 2fa.directory excluded categories and websites\n\nBelow is a list of categories and websites that we, [the maintainers][maintainers], have opted to not list on\n[2fa.directory][website].\n\nOne of the primary concerns we seek to address with these exclusions is professional and academic web filters. We\nbelieve that the service that this site provides should be as accessible as possible, to help as many people as\npossible, in as many environments as possible. Dynamic web filters can block websites based solely on the existence of\nkeywords which could lead to this service being filtered for mentioning or linking out to categories of websites that\nweb admins have deemed unacceptable for their domain. While we believe that every site should try to protect its\nusers (which often includes enabling two-factor authentication), we also believe that accessibility to this list for all\nhas more value than listing every possible site and service.\n\nIf you want to make a copy (fork) of our site to list any of these sites you're welcome to do so as long as you comply\nwith our [license][license].\n\n## Categories\n\n#### Illegal content\n\nWebsites that serve illegal content or promote illegal activities cannot be listed in this repository.\nThis includes but is not limited to pirated content, hate speech, drugs, and weapons.\n\n#### Pornographic sites\n\nThe volunteers of [2factorauth][org_link] need to review all submissions to validate that the site/service provides\n2FA to its users in addition to verifying that the pull request meets our style guidelines, we've chosen to not list\nsites that primarily host and serve pornographic content. Given the volunteer-driven nature of this project, there is no\nguarantee that there will always be a maintainer available to review a submission that also does not have an objection\nto reviewing such material. Special consideration must also be given due to the potential for content in this category\nto quickly cross subjective personal boundaries that vary widely from person to person.\n\n#### Self-hosted services\n\nThe category \"self-hosted services/sites\" includes all types of software that are designed to be hosted by the end user.\nThese are excluded from the listing unless all these points are met:\n\n1. All [Site Criteria][site_criteria] and [Guidelines][guidelines] are met\n\n2. Public interest and public accessibility are given\n\n3. The site has an independent authentication database\n\n4. The underlying service supports built-in 2FA or through a first-party (developer) plugin\n\nThere are several reasons why we've opted to not list such sites and services.\n\n- [2fa.directory][website] is targeted towards consumers and not website administrators. As of right now, very few general\n  internet users choose to host their own websites and services. Therefore, we think that the effort on our part to\n  maintain such a list of self-hosted alternatives would outweigh the minimal theoretical change in the internet\n  landscape by listing such services.\n\n- If the core project doesn't support two-factor authentication but instead through plugins it would mean that we\n  would have to list all plugins that enable two-factor authentication for the service, something that is currently\n  impossible with our website layout.\n\n  If you have any questions regarding whether a site qualifies for listing, simply open an issue and we'll take a\n  look.\n\n#### Forums\n\nMost forums are self-hosted (and thus violate the aforementioned rule) or are hosted as subdomains which makes it\nimpossible to find a meaningful ranking for the site.\n\n#### Potentially controversial sites\n\nAny site that could damage the reputation of [2fa.directory][website] and/or lead to any controversy with either the\nmaintainers or users, should not be listed.\nThe group of active maintainers will decide on whether to include or exclude a site within a specific timeframe.\n\n[website]: https://2fa.directory\n[maintainers]: https://2fa.directory/about\n[license]: /LICENSE.md\n[org_link]: https://github.com/2factorauth\n[site_criteria]: CONTRIBUTING.md#site-criteria\n[guidelines]: CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines\n"

Our community-driven platform allows anyone to contribute to the list, making it the most comprehensive directory of its kind.\n\nWe hope that this directory can help consumers decide between alternative services based on the security they offer their customers. This project also serves as an indicator of a site's general security efforts.\n\n## Usage\n\n### General usage\n\nTo view the directory, go to [2fa.directory][site_url].  \nYou can either open one category at a time or use the search function to look up a website.\n\n### API usage\n\nWe welcome anyone to use our data; however, we discourage scraping the data directly from this Git repository as changes\nwe make might break your program. Instead, we recommend that you use our [API][api].\n\nAPI access is provided free of charge; however, distributing the data requires proper attribution per our [license][license].\nMaintaining the project does incur regular bills. Therefore, if you use the data for commercial purposes, please consider sponsoring us here on [GitHub][sponsor].\n\nWe love seeing the innovative ways you use the data! If you have the time, please [share][show_and_tell] your project with us. 😊\n\n## Contributing :pencil2:\n\n[2FA Directory][site_url] is only possible thanks to community contributions. We welcome all contributions to the project.  \nIf you want to contribute, please read all the guidelines in [CONTRIBUTING.md][contrib] before you start.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> For the [2FA Directory][site_url] website code, go to [2factorauth/2fa.directory][frontend].\n\n## License :balance_scale:\n\nThis code is distributed under the MIT license.\nA copy of the license can be found in [LICENSE.md][license].\n\nThe images inside `img/` are not subject to the repository's license; their respective authors own them.  \nWe intend to showcase and utilize these images in a manner that respects the original creators' work and complies with fair use principles.\n\n[api]: https://2fa.directory/api/\n[contrib]: /CONTRIBUTING.md\n[frontend]: https://github.com/2factorauth/frontend/\n[license]: /LICENSE.md\n[site_url]: https://2fa.directory/\n[sponsor]: https://github.com/sponsors/2factorauth/\n[show_and_tell]: https://github.com/2factorauth/twofactorauth/discussions/new?category=show-and-tell\n"
