          "content": "# 🙌 Contributing to Google Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client\n\nWelcome to Google Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client 👋 Thanks for deciding to read this guide and contribute!\n**Remember:** You don't need to think big even a typo fix might save our day and make you a hero.\nEvery contribution counts! 🔥\n\n## 🐛 Found a Bug?\n\nIf you find a bug, you can contribute by submitting an issue [here](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues/new?assignees=Melvin-Abraham&labels=%F0%9F%90%9B+bug&template=bug_report.yml&title=%5B%F0%9F%90%9B+Bug%5D%3A+)\n\n**Note:** Before creating a bug report issue, check if someone else has already submitted the particular issue [here](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues). If you do find one, give it a thumbs up to let us know the serverity of the bug. If you have additional info related to the bug, you may comment within the same issue.\n\n## 💡 Have a Great Idea?\n\nHave a feature in your mind that is missing? Share your thoughts with us by submitting an issue [here](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues/new?assignees=Melvin-Abraham&labels=%E2%9C%A8+enhancement&template=feature_request.yml&title=%5B%F0%9F%92%A1+Feature+Request%5D%3A+).\n\n**Note:** Before creating a suggestion issue, check if someone else has already submitted the particular suggestion [here](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues). If you do find one, give it a thumbs up to let us know the priority of the feature.\n\n## 📙 Contribution Guideline\n\n### Submitting an Issue\n\nBefore submitting your issue, please check that it was not reported already (open or closed) [here](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues). To narrow down the list to the issues that are frequently encountered by others check the [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-(FAQ)) or [duplicate issues](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aduplicate+is%3Aclosed).\n\nAlso provide as many details as possible to make things easier.\n\n### Submitting a Pull Request\n\nHow to submit a pull request?\n\n> Before you start, you will need to install [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) if not already installed in your machine.\n\n#### TL;DR\n\n1. Fork the repository.\n2. Checkout a topic branch for your submission.\n3. Push your new branch to GitHub.\n4. Submit a pull request to the `master` branch.\n\n#### Detailed guide\n\n1. Fork the project.\n\n2. Clone the fork on your machine.\n\n   ```console\n   $ git clone https://github.com/<Your-Username>/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client.git\n   ```\n\n3. Open Command Prompt/Terminal in the root of this project.\n\n4. Type the following (_This is just a one-time thing_)\n\n   ```console\n   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client.git\n   ```\n\n5. Pull lastest changes from the upstream repository if there are any new commits:\n\n   ```console\n   $ git pull upstream master\n   ```\n\n6. Checkout a topic branch for your submission.\n\n    ```console\n    $ git checkout -b feature/<some-feature-name>\n    ```\n\n7. Make appropriate changes to the code. Stage the files that you want to commit and then commit the changes with a proper commit message (you may refer [Commit Messages](#Commit-Messages)):\n\n   ```console\n   $ git commit -m \"<Your-Commit-Message>\"\n   ```\n\n8. Pull lastest changes from the upstream repository as specified in _Step 5_.\n\n9. For the most part the previous step will automatically merge all the changes from upstream. If it doesn't, it will give you Merge Conflict error wherein you need to manually resolve those conflicts.\n\n10. Finally, make a pull request from your fork to this repository.\n\n### Coding Styles\n\nThinking about the contributors, Google Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client follows some coding rules to enforce/keep the linting and code simple, readable, and understandable. Also, it's essential to:\n\n1. Have the [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) extension installed in your Editor.\n\n2. Make sure you have this line in your `settings.json` file to set the Prettier extension as default formatter. This would enforce the `.prettierrc` formatting to your code when you format:\n\n    ```json\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"esbenp.prettier-vscode\"\n    ```\n\n3. Check the [AirBnb JavaScript style guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)\n\n### Commit Messages\n\nGoogle Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client commit messages follows a pattern. So, to make sure everything is consistent and understandable, check out:\n\n1. [Semantic Commit Messages _(gist by joshbuchea)_](https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716)\n2. [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)\n\n### How to Build\n\nOnce you have cloned the repository, you can run/build this app locally on your own. Before you start, make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.\n\n#### Windows Build Note\n\nIf you are on **Windows**, you must install _Windows Build Tools_ to build native modules. Install the build tools with this one-liner. Start PowerShell as **Administrator** and run:\n\n```console\n> npm install --global windows-build-tools\n```\n\nOr, if you are using Yarn:\n\n```console\n> yarn global add windows-build-tools\n```\n\n#### Linux Build Note\n\nIf you are building on a **Linux** machine, the rpm build might fail if *rpm build tools* are not installed. If you happen to get a failed build on linux for rpm, try the following:\n\n1. If you are on Debian based distributions (like, Ubuntu, Debian, etc.), you can resolve this issue by installing the `rpm` package\n\n   ```console\n   $ sudo apt-get install rpm\n   ```\n\n2. If you are on a RedHat based distribution (like Fedora, OpenSUSE, CentOS, etc.), you can resolve this issue by installing `rpm-build` package\n\n   ```console\n   $ sudo yum install rpm-build\n   ```\n\nNow that you are ready with the pre-requisites, you can type the following to get up and running.\n\n#### Using `npm`\n----------------\n\n```bash\n# Get dependencies from npm (mandatory)\nnpm install\n\n# Run the Assistant\nnpm start\n\n# Build the Assistant\nnpm run dist\n```\n\n#### Using `yarn`\n-----------------\n\n```bash\n# Get dependencies from npm registry (mandatory)\nyarn\n\n# Run the Assistant\nyarn start\n\n# Build the Assistant\nyarn dist\n```\n\nMake sure you have the authentication part set up for testing your code. Refer the [Setup Authentication for Google Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/wiki/Setup-Authentication-for-Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client) guide for setting things up.\n\nOnce again, thank you for joining this journey and good luck contributing 🙏\n"

So, if you find any bugs or have any suggestion, feel free to post an _issue_ or a _pull request_.\r\n\r\n## Inspiration\r\n\r\nThe design is inspired by Google Assistant in Chrome OS and comes in both Light Mode _(beta)_ and Dark Mode 😉.\r\n\r\n![G Assist Screenshot](images/Assistant_light_dark.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Download\r\n\r\nYou can build the assistant on your machine if you prefer _(see [How to Build](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#how-to-build))_. If you don't want to build the project for yourself, you can download the Assistant Setup/Installer for the respective platform from [here (releases)](https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/releases). You can download from other official sources as well.\r\n\r\n### Windows (using `winget`)\r\n\r\n> If you are on **Windows 11**, chances are you have `winget` pre-installed.\r\n> If you are on older version of Windows (Windows 10) and don't have it installed, check out\r\n> [Install Winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget)\r\n> documentation section to learn how to install it.\r\n\r\n#### ⚡ Stable versions:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> winget install \"g-assist\" -e\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 🧪 Preview Versions (Pre-release versions):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> winget install \"g-assist-preview\" -e\r\n```\r\n\r\n### MacOS (using `brew`)\r\n\r\n> Visit [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/) to learn how to install `brew` if you don't have it\r\n> installed on your machine.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ brew install --cask google-assistant\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Linux (using `snap`)\r\n\r\n> Some linux distros like Ubuntu, KDE Neon, Manjaro, Zorin OS, etc. come pre-installed with\r\n> `snap`. For distros without out-of-the-box support for snaps, visit [Installing snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd)\r\n> documentation page.\r\n\r\nManually download from the Snapstore:\r\n\r\n[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/g-assist)\r\n\r\n#### ⚡ Stable versions:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ sudo snap install g-assist\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 🧪 Preview versions (Pre-release versions):\r\n\r\nIf you want to install release candidates:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ sudo snap install g-assist --candidate\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to install beta versions:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ sudo snap install g-assist --beta\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting Started\r\n\r\nIn order to use the client, you must have a _\"Key File\"_ and _\"Token\"_ for authentication which you can get by going through **Device Registration** process. You can go through the wiki given below to get started.\r\n\r\n\"*Setup Authentication for Google Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client*\" Wiki (For both **Device Registration** & **Authentication** help):\r\n> https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/wiki/Setup-Authentication-for-Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client\r\n\r\n#### Other References\r\n\r\nIf you want a user friendly registration method, use **Device Registration** UI:\r\n> https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/config-dev-project-and-account\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a CLI tool to complete the **Device Registration** and **Authentication** process manually, read the following:\r\n> https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/reference/device-registration/register-device-manual\r\n\r\nAfter you have registered your device and downloaded the required authentication files, you can head on to _Settings_ and set the _\"Key File Path\"_ and _\"Saved Tokens Path\"_ to the location where the respective files are located.\r\n\r\n## Want to Contribute?\r\n\r\nYou are more than welcome to contribute to all kinds of contributions:\r\n\r\n* 🤔 Request/Suggest a feature\r\n* 🐛 Report a bug\r\n* 📖 Make this documentation better\r\n* 💻 Contribute with the code\r\n\r\nBefore you start, we highly recommend you check the Google Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client's [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\r\n\r\n## Default Keyboard Shortcut\r\n\r\n* **Windows:** Win + Shift + A\r\n* **MacOS:** Cmd + Shift + A\r\n* **Linux:** Super + Shift + A\r\n\r\n**Note:** Keyboard shortcut is configurable in the settings\r\n\r\n## Other Libraries Used\r\n\r\n* **p5.js:**\r\n  * For visualization purpose when the user speaks through mic.\r\n  * Link: https://p5js.org/\r\n\r\n* **aud_player.js:**\r\n  * For playing audio through speakers.\r\n  * Link: https://github.com/ItsWendell/google-assistant-desktop-client/blob/develop/src/renderer/providers/assistant/player.js\r\n\r\n* **microphone.js:**\r\n  * For recording audio using Web API.\r\n  * Link: https://github.com/ItsWendell/google-assistant-desktop-client/blob/develop/src/renderer/providers/assistant/microphone.js\r\n\r\n* **google-assistant:**\r\n  * Node.js implementation of the Google Assistant SDK\r\n  * Link: https://github.com/endoplasmic/google-assistant\r\n\r\n* **bumblebee-hotword:**\r\n  * A minimalist hotword / wake word for the web, based on Porcupine\r\n  * Link: https://github.com/jaxcore/bumblebee-hotword\r\n\r\n[downloads]: <https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/releases>\r\n[issues]: <https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/issues>\r\n[build]: <https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/actions/workflows/main.yml>\r\n[license]: <https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>\r\n[commits]: <https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/commits/master>\r\n[top-lang]: <https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client>\r\n[next-milestone]: <https://github.com/Melvin-Abraham/Google-Assistant-Unofficial-Desktop-Client/discussions/576>\r\n"
