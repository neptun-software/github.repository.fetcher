Fork web-animations/web-animations-js.\n1. `git clone git@github.com:$GITHUB_USER/web-animations-js.git`\n1. `git submodule update --init --recursive` (Necessary for running tests.)\n1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and make sure `npm` is in your $PATH\n1. Run `npm install` in the respository to pull in development dependencies.\n1. Run `npm install -g grunt-cli` to get the build tools for the command line.\n\n### Contributing\n\nNote that development should occur against the `dev` branch, not `master`. This\nis the default target for pull requests.\n\n1. In your fork of web-animations-js, `git checkout dev` or create a new branch whose parent is dev.\n1. Run `grunt` to build the polyfill.\n1. Run `grunt test` to run polyfill and web-platform-tests tests.\n1. Commit changes to your fork.\n1. Create a pull request from your fork of web-animations-js to\n   [web-animations/web-animations-js/dev](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js/tree/dev).\n1. Ensure that you've signed the [Google Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/clas).\n\n\n## Debugging tests\n\nYou can run the tests in an interactive mode with `grunt debug`. This starts the\nKarma server once for each polyfill target for each test framework.\nNavigate to `http://localhost:9876/debug.html` to open the test runner in your\nbrowser of choice, all test results appear in the Javascript console.\nTest failures can be accessed via `window.failures` and `window.formattedFailures`\nonce the tests have completed.\n\nThe polyfill target and tests can be specified as arguments to the `debug` task.\nExample: `grunt debug:web-animations-next:test/web-platform-tests/web-animations/animation/pause.html`\nMultiple test files may be listed with comma separation. Specifying files will output their URL in the command line.\nExample: `http://localhost:9876/base/test/web-platform-tests/web-animations/animation/pause.html`\n\n\n## Design notes\n\n[Design diagrams](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9rpPoIDv3vTNlZxOVp6a2tNa1E&usp=sharing)\n\n\n## Publishing a release\n\n1.  Clone a fresh copy of [web-animations-js](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js).\n\n1.  Make sure you are on the `dev` branch.\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout dev\n    ```\n\n1.  Determine the version number for the release\n\n    * Increment the first number and reset others to 0 when there are large breaking changes\n    * Increment the second number and reset the third to 0 when there are significant new, but backwards compatible features\n    * Otherwise, increment the third number\n\n1.  Add versioned release notes to `History.md`, for example:\n\n        ### 3.13.37 — *November 1, 2001*\n\n          * Fixed a bug where nothing worked\n\n    Use the following to generate a summary of commits, but edit the list to contain only\n    relevant information.\n\n        git log --first-parent `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 master`..dev --pretty=format:\"  * %s\"\n\n1.  Specify the new version inside `package.json` (for NPM), for example:\n\n    ```js\n      \"version\": \"3.13.37\",\n    ```\n\n1.  Build the polyfill with `npm install && grunt` then update `docs/experimental.md`'s Build Target Comparison with the current gzipped sizes.\n\n1.  Commit and push the above changes to web-animations-js/dev.\n\n    ```sh\n    # Create a commit with above changes\n    git push origin dev\n    ```\n\n1.  Merge to local master branch:\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout master\n    git merge dev --no-edit --quiet\n    ```\n\n1.  Build and commit minified JavaScript files.\n\n    ```sh\n    npm install\n    grunt\n    # Optional \"grunt test\" to make sure everything still passes.\n    git add -f *.min.js{,.map}\n    git rm --ignore-unmatch .gitignore\n    git commit -m 'Add build artifacts from '`cat .git/refs/heads/dev`\n    git push origin master\n    ```\n\n1.  Draft a [new release](https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js/releases).\n\n    *  For the **tag version**, put the new version number of this release.\n    *  For the **target**, select \"master\".\n    *  For the **title**, look at previous releases for examples.\n    *  For the **description**, copy the release notes from `History.md` added in step #2.\n\n1. Once you've pushed to web-animations-js, run `npm publish` from that checked-out folder\n\n   To do this, you'll need to be a collaborator [on the NPM project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-animations-js), or have a collaborator help you.\n\n1. If there are any breaking changes to the API in this release you must notify web-animations-changes@googlegroups.com.\n\n   Only owners of the group may post to it so you may need to request ownership or ask someone to post it for you.\n\n## Testing architecture\n\nThis is an overview of what happens when `grunt test` is run.\n\n1. Polyfill tests written in mocha and chai are run.\n    1. grunt creates a karma config with mocha and chai adapters.\n    1. grunt adds the test/js files as includes to the karma config.\n    1. grunt starts the karma server with the config and waits for the result.\n    1. The mocha adaptor runs the included tests and reports the results to karma.\n    1. karma outputs results to the console and returns the final pass/fail result to grunt.\n1. web-platform-tests/web-animations tests written in testtharness.js are run.\n    1. grunt creates a karma config with karma-testharness-adaptor.js included.\n    1. grunt adds the web-platform-tests/web-animations files to the custom testharnessTests config in the karma config.\n    1. grunt adds failure expectations to the custom testharnessTests config in the karma config.\n    1. grunt starts the karma server with the config and waits for the result.\n    1. The testharness.js adaptor runs the included tests (ignoring expected failures) and reports the results to karma.\n    1. karma outputs results to the console and returns the final pass/fail result to grunt.\n1. grunt exits successfully if both test runs passed.\n\n"

Custom effects should now be created by setting the onsample attribute of a KeyframeEffect.\n\n    For example, this is deprecated:\n\n        var myEffect = new KeyframeEffect(\n           element,\n           function(timeFraction, target, effect) {\n              target.style.opacity = timeFraction;\n           },\n           1000);\n        var myAnimation = document.timeline.play(myEffect);\n\n    and this should be used insead:\n\n        var myEffect = new KeyframeEffect(element, [], 1000);\n        effect.onsample = function(timeFraction, effect, animation) {\n           effect.target.style.opacity = timeFraction;\n        };\n        var myAnimation = document.timeline.play(myEffect);\n\n### 2.1.0 - *June 15 2015*\n  * Fix bug affecting GroupEffects with infinite iteration children\n  * Add GroupEffect.firstChild and GroupEffect.lastChild\n  * Add initial values for most CSS properties\n  * Allow `timeline.play()` to be called with no arguments\n  * Add AnimationEffect.clone\n  * Add GroupEffect.append and GroupEffect.prepend\n  * Add AnimationEffect.remove\n  * Add Animation.ready and Animation.finished promises\n\n### 2.0.0 - *April 5 2015*\n\n  * Improve behavior of group Animation playback rate.\n  * Rename Animation to KeyframeEffect.\n  * Rename AnimationSequence to SequenceEffect.\n  * Rename AnimationGroup to GroupEffect.\n  * Rename AnimationPlayer to Animation.\n  * Remove KeyframeEffect.effect and add KeyframeEffect.getFrames.\n  * Rename Animation.source to Animation.effect.\n  * Rename Timeline.getAnimationPlayers to Timeline.getAnimations.\n  * Rename Element.getAnimationPlayers to Element.getAnimations.\n\n### 1.0.7 - *March 10 2015*\n\n  * Improve performance of constructing groups and sequences.\n  * Remove support for animating zoom.\n  * Add bower file.\n\n### 1.0.6 - *February 5 2015*\n\n  * Implement playbackRate setter for group players.\n  * Fix pausing a group player before its first tick.\n  * Fix cancelling a group player before its first tick.\n  * Fix excess CPU use on idle pages where custom effects and groups were used.\n  * Suppress AnimationTiming.playbackRate deprecation warning for cases where AnimationTiming.playbackRate == 1.\n\n### 1.0.5 - *January 6 2015*\n\n  * Fix loading the polyfill in an SVG document\n  * Fix a problem where groups didn't take effect in their first frame\n  * Don't rely on performance.now\n\n### 1.0.4 - *December 8 2014*\n\n  * Fix a critical bug where deprecation logic wasn't being loaded\n    when `web-animations-next` and `web-animations-next-lite` were\n    executed on top of a native `element.animate`.\n\n### 1.0.3 - *December 4 2014*\n\n  * Fix a critical bug on iOS 7 and Safari <= 6. Due to limitations,\n    inline style patching is not supported on these platforms.\n\n### 1.0.2 - *November 28 2014*\n\n  * Deprecated `AnimationTiming.playbackRate`.\n\n    For example, this is no longer supported:\n\n        var player = element.animate(\n            keyframes,\n            {duration: 1000, playbackRate: 2});\n\n    Use `AnimationPlayer.playbackRate` instead:\n\n        var player = element.animate(\n            keyframes,\n            {duration: 1000});\n        player.playbackRate = 2;\n\n    If you have any feedback on this change, please start a discussion\n    on the public-fx mailing list:\n    http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-fx/\n\n    Or file an issue against the specification on GitHub:\n    https://github.com/w3c/web-animations/issues/new\n\n### 1.0.1 - *November 26 2014*\n\n  * Players should be constructed in idle state\n  * `play()` and `reverse()` should not force a start times\n  * Add `requestAnimationFrame` ids and `cancelAnimationFrame`\n\n### 1.0.0 — *November 21 2014*\n\n  The web-animations-js hackers are pleased to announce the release of\n  a new codebase for the Web Animations Polyfill:\n  https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js\n\n  The previous polyfill has been moved to:\n  https://github.com/web-animations/web-animations-js-legacy\n\n  The new codebase is focused on code-size -- our smallest target is\n  now only 33kb or 11kb after gzip.\n\n  We've implemented native fallback. If the target browser provides\n  Web Animations features natively, the Polyfill will use them.\n\n  We now provide three different build targets:\n\n  `web-animations.min.js` - Tracks the Web Animations features that\n  are supported natively in browsers. Today that means Element.animate\n  and Playback Control in Chrome. If you’re not sure what features you\n  will need, start with this.\n\n  `web-animations-next.min.js` - All of web-animations.min.js plus\n  features that are still undergoing discussion or have yet to be\n  implemented natively.\n\n  `web-animations-next-lite.min.js` - A cut down version of\n  web-animations-next, removes several lesser used property handlers\n  and some of the larger and less used features such as matrix\n  interpolation/decomposition.\n\n  Not all features of the previous polyfill have been ported to the\n  new codebase; most notably mutation of Animations and Groups and\n  Additive Animations are not yet supported. These features are still\n  important and will be implemented in the coming weeks.\n"
