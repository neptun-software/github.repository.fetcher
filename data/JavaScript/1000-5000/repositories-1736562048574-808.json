          "content": "# Contributing\n\nPRs are the preferred way to spike ideas and address issues, if you have time.\nIf you plan on contributing frequently, please feel free to ask to become a\nmaintainer; the more the merrier.\n\n## Technical overview\n\nWe use [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/) to manage our mono-repo.\n\n- The site can be found in `site/`.\n- All packages can be found in `packages/`.\n\n## Getting started\n\nTo get started, run `yarn`.\n\n### Tests\n\nTo run your tests in watch mode, run:\n\n```\njest --watch\n```\n\nTo narrow down the tests that are run, you can use the `--testPathPattern`\noption:\n\n```\njest --watch --testPathPattern skatejs\n```\n\nThe above would run only tests that have paths that match `skatejs`, for\nexample.\n\n### Documentation / website\n\nTo document a package or work on the website, run `yarn start`. This will\nstartup a `webpack-dev-server` and you can dev as normal.\n\n### Other commands\n\nHere are some other commands that you may need to run from time to time, for\nwhatever reason:\n\n- `yarn build` builds all distributions.\n- `yarn clean` cleans your working copy.\n- `yarn netlify` compiles the website.\n- `yarn precommit` runs the pre-commit hook.\n- `yarn start` runs the website in dev mode.\n- `yarn test` runs all the tests.\n\n## Core team\n\nThe Skate core team is a group of contributors that have demonstrated a lasting\nenthusiasm for the project and community. The core team has admin privileges on\nall repos within the org.\n\n### Core team responsibilities\n\nThe core team has the following responsibilities:\n\n- Being available to answer high-level questions about Skate's vision and\n  future.\n- Being available to review longstanding / forgotten pull requests.\n- Occasionally check the issues, offer input and assign labels; triage.\n- Looking out for up-and-coming members of the Skate community who might want to\n  serve as core team members.\n- Performing releases.\n\nThe core team – and all contributors – are open source _volunteers_; membership\non the core team is expressly _not_ an obligation. The core team is\ndistinguished as leaders in the community and while they are a good group to\nturn to when someone needs an answer to a question, they are still volunteering\ntheir time, and may not be available to help immediately.\n\n### Core team members\n\nThe current core team members, ordered by time of addition:\n\n- [@treshugart](https://github.com/treshugart)\n\n### Adding new core team members\n\nThe process for adding new core team members is as follows:\n\n- An existing core team member reaches out privately to see if the individual is\n  interested. If they are, open a pull request adding them to the list.\n- Existing core team members review the pull request. The person merging the PR\n  is responsible for adding them to the\n  [\"Core\" GitHub team](https://github.com/orgs/skatejs/teams/core) and for\n  adding them as an owner to the npm package. (`npm owner add <npmusername>`)\n\n> Note: If you feel like you have demonstrated a lasting enthusiasm for the\n> Skate project and community, yet nobody has reached out to you about joining\n> the core team, feel free to ping one of the existing core team members\n> _privately_ about the possibility of joining the core team.\n"

[Todo list](https://codesandbox.io/s/8zjp9qqj9l)\n\n### Cli\n\nThere's a CLI to get you up and running: [https://skatejs.netlify.com/packages/cli](https://skatejs.netlify.com/packages/cli).\n\n```sh\n$ npm i -g @skatejs/cli\n$ skatejs\n```\n\n## Polyfills\n\nSkate builds upon the\n[Custom Elements](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/custom/) and\n[the Shadow DOM](https://w3c.github.io/webcomponents/spec/shadow/) standards.\nIt is capable of operating without the Shadow DOM &mdash; it just means you\ndon't get any encapsulation of your component's HTML or styles. It also means\nthat it's up to you to provide a way to project content (i.e. `<slot>`). It's\nhighly recommended you use Shadow DOM whenever possible.\n\nThough most modern browsers support these standards, some still need polyfills\nto implement missing or inconsistent behaviours for them.\n\nFor more information on the polyfills, see\n[the web components polyfill documentation](https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs), emphasis on the caveats.\n\n## Browser Support\n\nSkate supports all evergreens and IE11, and is subject to the browser support\nmatrix of the polyfills.\n\n## Backers\n\nSupport us with a monthly donation and help us continue our activities.\n[Become a backer](https://opencollective.com/skatejs#backer)!\n\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/0/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/0/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/1/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/1/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/2/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/2/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/3/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/3/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/4/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/4/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/5/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/5/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/6/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/6/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/7/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/7/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/8/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/8/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/9/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/9/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/10/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/10/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/11/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/11/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/12/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/12/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/13/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/13/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/14/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/14/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/15/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/15/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/16/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/16/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/17/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/17/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/18/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/18/website)\n[![](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/19/avatar.svg)](https://opencollective.com/skatejs/backer/19/website)\n\n## Sponsors\n\nBecome a sponsor and get your logo on our README on Github with a link to your\nsite.
