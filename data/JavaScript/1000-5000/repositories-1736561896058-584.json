Let another team member review your pull request and approve.\n\n\nNote: these guidelines are closely following [vagrant's contributing guidelines](https://raw.github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n"

Same goes for [Sean Cribbs](https://twitter.com/seancribbs), not only behind Basho's Webmachine, but also behind [Webmachine-Ruby](https://github.com/seancribbs/webmachine-ruby).\n\n* [Loïc Hoguin](https://twitter.com/lhoguin) and his [cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy) for working in the same direction, but with [a less sexy outcome](https://raw.github.com/nevar/cowboy/a597393265d9d69df3f9b0fe660087a208e86641/guide/rest_flow_diagram.svg) :)\n\n* [Philipp Meier](https://twitter.com/ordnungswprog) and his [clojure-liberator](http://clojure-liberator.github.com/) for working in the same direction, but with [a less sexy outcome](http://philipp.meier.name/t/liberator-flow-color.png) :)\n\n* [Stephane Bortzmeyer](https://twitter.com/bortzmeyer), another straight thinker, for coming up with [Cosmogol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-bortzmeyer-language-state-machines)\n\n### Others\n\n* [Cyril Rohr](https://twitter.com/crohr) - http://crohr.me/journal/2011/http-status-codes-flowchart.html\n"
