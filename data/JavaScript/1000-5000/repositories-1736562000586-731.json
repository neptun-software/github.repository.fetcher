You could apply for a new key and replace in [UrlUtil.js](https://github.com/attentiveness/reading/blob/master/app/utils/UrlUtil.js), it will work properly.\nReference this issue: [Cannot convert undefined or null to object](https://github.com/attentiveness/reading/issues/127).\nI apologize to inconvenience you.\n\n## Release Note\n\n[Reading Release Note](https://github.com/attentiveness/reading/releases)\n\n## Contributing\n\n**For more information about contributing PRs and issues, see our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/attentiveness/reading/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).**\n\n## License\n\nApache License 2.0\n"
