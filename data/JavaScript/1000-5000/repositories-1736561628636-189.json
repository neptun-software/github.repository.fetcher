It evolved\nalong with Node.js and eventually became very widely depended upon.\n\nA lot has changed since 2010 and I've decided to re-think what a simple\nHTTP client library should look like.\n\nThis new library, `r2`, is a completely new approach from `request`.\n\n* Rather than being built on top of the Node.js Core HTTP library and\n  shimmed for the browser, `r2` is built on top of the browser's\n  Fetch API and shimmed for Node.js.\n* APIs are meant to be used with async/await, which means they are\n  based on promises.\n\n```javascript\nconst r2 = require('r2')\n\nlet html = await r2('https://www.google.com').text\n```\n\nSimple JSON support.\n\n```javascript\nlet obj = {ok: true}\n\nlet resp = await r2.put('http://localhost/test.json', {json: obj}).json\n```\n\nSimple headers support.\n\n```javascript\nlet headers = {'x-test': 'ok'}\n\nlet res = await r2('http://localhost/test', {headers}).response\n```\n\nBeing written to the Fetch API is a huge benefit for browser users.\n\nWhen running through browserify `request` is ~2M uncompressed and ~500K compressed. `r2` is only 66K uncompressed and 16K compressed.\n"
