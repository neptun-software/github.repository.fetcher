          "content": "# Changelog\n\n## 4.3.0\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- 302b466: Introduce a new entrypoint: `style-dictionary/enums` for most of the library's hard-coded string values. Most of these are built-in hooks names. This provides better type-safety for consumers as well as various maintainability related benefits for this library. [See documentation for more info](https://styledictionary.com/reference/enums).\n- 5aad797: Add tailwind preset example, remove unused .editorconfig file\n- bd8be17: Add support for native .TS token & config file processing.\n- 209085d: Add `tokenMap` properties to Dictionary, which is a JavaScript Map structure of the tokens, which makes it easy to iterate as well as access tokens. Also add `convertTokenData` utility that allows to seemlessly convert between Map, Object or Array of tokens, and deprecate the `flattenTokens` utility in favor of that one.\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- 2966cfd: handle DTCG-format tokens in typescript/es6-declarations formatter\n- 4a7bca7: add accessControl field to Android Compose template\n- f694f67: Fix Prettier imports, see https://prettier.io/docs/en/api#custom-parser-api-removed for more info.\n- fd8cdb4: handle DTCG-format tokens in javascript/es6 formatter\n- 6a6a409: Move prettier to dependencies since style-dictionary isn't really a prettier plugin and a direct dependency seems more accurate here.\n- 8a9cfa0: Fix `outputReferencesTransformed` util, would return `true` for tokens which original values were not strings.\n- 7a661bb: Fix font-style and font-weight logic for fonts.css.template.js\n\n## 4.2.0\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- 0fcf229: Add a new built-in format javascript/esm that outputs an ES module JS default export.\n- d7b5836: Mark javascript/esm as nested, use Prettier on all JavaScript/TypeScript formats, use 3.x.x peerDependency so the user's installation is used when possible.\n- 4bf68a3: Apply stripMeta from \"json\" format to the new \"javascript/esm\" as well.\n- 8f1b4f0: Add new utility in `style-dictionary/utils` -> `stripMeta` for stripping metadata from tokens.\n  This utility is used now as an opt-in for the built-in `'json'` format by using `options.stripMeta`, which if set to `true` will strip Style Dictionary meta props.\n  You can specify `keep`/`strip` (allow/blocklist) for granular control about which properties to keep or strip.\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- 5e3a5af: Update .d.ts/js files type imports to use correct extensions rather than extensionless. This fixes some incompatibilities with latest TypeScript \"NodeNext\" moduleResolution.\n\n## 4.1.4\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- a67ed31: Pass PlatformConfig as options param to platform-applied preprocessors.\n- 19aee32: Fix `convertToBase64` util to support converting binary files such as fonts, for both Browser and NodeJS.\n\n## 4.1.3\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- 9376247: Make `defaultMessage` param in FileHeader type optional.\n- 43ccb42: (#1305): fix reference sorting in `sortByReference` function for DTCG token format, ensuring token references are declared after their targets\n- 26728b9: Fix `filterTokens` utility to deal with random metadata properties throughout token groups, without throwing errors.\n\n## 4.1.2\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- e9cce6a: Reuse static hooks in the constructor to set instance hooks prop, to avoid discarding built-in hooks overwrites by consumers.\n- b48d0e9: Add missing type interfaces, most notably the ExpandConfig types.\n\n## 4.1.1\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- 5db3521: Add `iosSwiftEnumOpts.className` and `iosSwiftAnyOpts.className` formats property documentation\n- 23f8a25: Use cp and rmdir commands for `copy_assets` do and undo methods, since they affect directories, not files.\n\n## 4.1.0\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- ccf27b7: Prevent duplicate redundant calls to StyleDictionary class methods by caching platform specific config & tokens results.\n\n  Added reusable methods:\n\n  - `getPlatformTokens()` -> grabs the `tokens`/`allTokens`(new! `exportPlatform` does not return this) for a specific platform, after running platform specific preprocessors and transforms. This replaces the old `exportPlatform` method which is now deprecated and will be removed in v5.\n  - `getPlatformConfig()` -> grabs the processed/transformed `PlatformConfig` for a specific platform, replaces the now deprecated `getPlatform` method which will be removed in v5.\n\n  The reasons for deprecating those methods and replacing them with new ones is to reduce method ambiguity and make them more pure.\n\n  Add new options object to methods:\n\n  - `getPlatformTokens`\n  - `getPlatformConfig`\n  - `exportPlatform` (deprecated, see above)\n  - `getPlatform` (deprecated, see above)\n  - `formatPlatform`\n  - `formatAllPlatforms`\n  - `buildPlatform`\n  - `buildAllPlatforms`\n  - `cleanPlatform`\n  - `cleanAllPlatforms`\n\n  with property `cache`, which if set to `false`, will disable this caching of generating the platform specific config / tokens, e.g.:\n\n  ```js\n  await sd.exportPlatform('css', { cache: false });\n  await sd.buildAllPlatforms('css', { cache: false });\n  ```\n\n  Expectation is that this is usually not useful for majority of users, unless for example you're testing multiple runs of StyleDictionary while changing tokens or platform configs in between those runs.\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- 2ec9a44: `size/rem` transform to leave 0 (string or number) values as is, since 0 doesn't need a unit.\n- f317430: Added link to logging documentation inside all of the warnings and errors that refer to verbosity.\n- 6275983: Respect `formatting` options in scss map-deep/map-flat formats, those that make sense:\n\n  - `commentPosition`\n  - `commentStyle`\n  - `indentation`\n\n  Also export a new type interface `FormattingOverrides`, which is a limited version of `FormattingOptions`.\n  These contain the formatting options that can be overridden by users, whereas the full version is meant for the format helper utilities such as `createPropertyFormatter`/`formattedVariables`.\n\n## 4.0.1\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- e6cbf73: Fix type information for Config.parser\n- e8aea2f: Fix transitive color transform advanced example, migrate chroma-js to colorjs.io\n- 7afcffd: Fix bugs with expand tokens where they would run before instead of after user-configured preprocessors, and would fatally error on broken references. Broken refs should be tolerated at the expand stage, and errors will be thrown after preprocessor lifecycle if the refs are still broken at that point.\n- 922b6aa: Update memfs esm-fork dependency to allow named import Volume.\n- 61b6984: Fix 'filePath' missing from falsy token values\n- 3ae67e3: Upgrade memfs esm fork to publish types and bumping stream to fix unclear licensing issue with transitive dependency.\n\n## 4.0.0\n\n> For a more comprehensive migration guide from version 3.x.x to version 4.0.0,\n> [visit the migration guide page](https://v4.styledictionary.com/version-4/migration/)\n\n### Major Changes\n\n- 6cc7f31: BREAKING:\n\n  - `usesReference` util function is now `usesReferences` to be consistent plural form like the other reference util functions.\n  - `getReferences` first and second parameters have been swapped to be consistent with `resolveReferences`, so value first, then the full token object (instead of the entire dictionary instance).\n  - `getReferences` accepts a third options parameter which can be used to set reference Regex options as well as an unfilteredTokens object which can be used as a fallback when references are made to tokens that have been filtered out. There will be warnings logged for this.\n  - `format.formatter` removed old function signature of `(dictionary, platform, file)` in favor of `({ dictionary, platform, options, file })`.\n  - Types changes:\n\n    - Style Dictionary is entirely strictly typed now, and there will be `.d.ts` files published next to every file, this means that if you import from one of Style Dictionary's entrypoints, you automatically get the types implicitly with it. This is a big win for people using TypeScript, as the majority of the codebase now has much better types, with much fewer `any`s.\n    - There is no more hand-written Style Dictionary module `index.d.ts` anymore that exposes all type interfaces on itself. This means that you can no longer grab types that aren't members of the Style Dictionary class directly from the default export of the main entrypoint. External types such as `Parser`, `Transform`, `DesignTokens`, etc. can be imported from the newly added types entrypoint:\n\n    ```ts\n    import type { DesignTokens, Transform, Parser } from 'style-dictionary/types';\n    ```\n\n    Please raise an issue if you find anything missing or suddenly broken.\n\n    - `Matcher`, `Transformer`, `Formatter`, etc. are still available, although no longer directly but rather as properties on their parents, so `Filter['matcher']`, `Transform['transformer']`, `Format['formatter']`\n\n- dcbe2fb: - The project has been fully converted to [ESM format](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html), which is also the format that the browser uses.\n  For users, this means you'll have to either use Style Dictionary in ESM JavaScript code, or dynamically import it into your CommonJS code.\n  - `StyleDictionary.extend()` method is now asynchronous, which means it returns `Promise<StyleDictionary.Core>` instead of `StyleDictionary.Core`.\n  - `allProperties` / `properties` was deprecated in v3, and is now removed from `StyleDictionary.Core`, use `allTokens` and `tokens` instead.\n  - Templates and the method `registerTemplate` were deprecated in v3, now removed. Use Formats instead.\n  - The package now uses [package entrypoints](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html), which means that what is importable from the package is locked down to just the specified entrypoints: `style-dictionary` & `style-dictionary/fs`. If more is needed, please raise an issue explaining which file you were importing and why you need it to be public API.\n- f2ed88b: BREAKING: File headers, when registered, are put inside the `hooks.fileHeaders` property now, as opposed to `fileHeader`.\n  Note the change from singular to plural form here.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    fileHeader: {\n      foo: (defaultMessages = []) => ['Ola, planet!', ...defaultMessages, 'Hello, World!'],\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    hooks: {\n      fileHeaders: {\n        foo: (defaultMessages = []) => ['Ola, planet!', ...defaultMessages, 'Hello, World!'],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- 79bb201: BREAKING: Logging has been redesigned a fair bit and is more configurable now.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"log\": \"error\" // 'error' | 'warn'  -> 'warn' is the default value\n  }\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"log\": {\n      \"warnings\": \"error\", // 'error' | 'warn'  -> 'warn' is the default value\n      \"verbosity\": \"verbose\", // 'default' | 'verbose' | 'silent'  -> 'default' is the default value\n      \"errors\": {\n        \"brokenReferences\": \"console\" // 'console' | 'throw' -> 'throw' is the default value\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Log is now and object and the old \"log\" option is now \"warnings\".\n\n  This configures whether the following five warnings will be thrown as errors instead of being logged as warnings:\n\n  - Token value collisions (in the source)\n  - Token name collisions (when exporting)\n  - Missing \"undo\" function for Actions\n  - File not created because no tokens found, or all of them filtered out\n  - Broken references in file when using outputReferences, but referring to a token that's been filtered out\n\n  Verbosity configures whether the following warnings/errors should display in a verbose manner:\n\n  - Token collisions of both types (value & name)\n  - Broken references due to outputReferences & filters\n  - Token reference errors\n\n  And it also configures whether success/neutral logs should be logged at all.\n  Using \"silent\" (or --silent in the CLI) means no logs are shown apart from fatal errors.\n\n- f2ed88b: BREAKING: Actions, when registered, are put inside the `hooks.actions` property now, as opposed to `action`.\n  Note the change from singular to plural form here.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    action: {\n      'copy-assets': {\n        do: () => {}\n        undo: () => {}\n      }\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    hooks: {\n      actions: {\n        'copy-assets': {\n          do: () => {}\n          undo: () => {}\n        }\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- a4542f4: BREAKING: StyleDictionaryInstance.properties & .allProperties have been removed. They were deprecated in v3 in favor of .tokens and .allTokens.\n- 5e167de: BREAKING: moved `formatHelpers` away from the StyleDictionary class and export them in `'style-dictionary/utils'` entrypoint instead.\n\n  Before\n\n  ```js\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n\n  const { fileHeader, formattedVariables } = StyleDictionary.formatHelpers;\n  ```\n\n  After\n\n  ```js\n  import { fileHeader, formattedVariables } from 'style-dictionary/utils';\n  ```\n\n- f2ed88b: Filters, when registered, are put inside the `hooks.filters` property now, as opposed to `filter`.\n  Note the change from singular to plural form here.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    filter: {\n      'colors-only': (token) => token.type === 'color,\n    },\n    platforms: {\n      css: {\n        files: [{\n          format: 'css/variables',\n          destination: '_variables.css',\n          filter: 'colors-only',\n        }],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    hooks: {\n      filters: {\n        'colors-only': (token) => token.type === 'color,\n      },\n    },\n    platforms: {\n      css: {\n        files: [{\n          format: 'css/variables',\n          destination: '_variables.css',\n          filter: 'colors-only',\n        }],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  In addition, when using [`registerFilter`](/reference/api#registerfilter) method, the name of the filter function is now `filter` instead of `matcher`.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js title=\"build-tokens.js\" del={5} ins={6}\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n\n  StyleDictionary.registerFilter({\n    name: 'colors-only',\n    matcher: (token) => token.type === 'color',\n  });\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```js title=\"build-tokens.js\" del={5} ins={6}\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n\n  StyleDictionary.registerFilter({\n    name: 'colors-only',\n    filter: (token) => token.type === 'color',\n  });\n  ```\n\n  > These changes also apply for the `filter` function (previously `matcher`) inside `transforms`.\n\n- f2ed88b: BREAKING: Transform groups, when registered, are put inside the `hooks.transformGroups` property now, as opposed to `transformGroup`.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    // register it inline or by SD.registerTransformGroup\n    transformGroup: {\n      foo: ['foo-transform'],\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    hooks: {\n      transformGroups: {\n        foo: ['foo-transform'],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- 502dbd1: BREAKING: All of our hooks, parsers, preprocessors, transforms, formats, actions, fileHeaders and filters, support async functions as well now. This means that the formatHelpers -> fileHeader helper method is now asynchronous, to support async fileheader functions.\n\n  ```js\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n\n  const { fileHeader } = StyleDictionary.formatHelpers;\n\n  StyleDictionary.registerFormat({\n    name: 'custom/css',\n    // this can be async now, usually it is if you use fileHeader format helper, since that now always returns a Promise\n    formatter: async function ({ dictionary, file, options }) {\n      const { outputReferences } = options;\n      return (\n        // this helper is now async! because the user-passed file.fileHeader might be an async function\n        (await fileHeader({ file })) +\n        ':root {\\n' +\n        formattedVariables({ format: 'css', dictionary, outputReferences }) +\n        '\\n}\\n'\n      );\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n- f2ed88b: BREAKING: Formats, when registered, are put inside the `hooks.formats` property now, as opposed to `format`.\n  The `formatter` handler function has been renamed to `format` for consistency.\n\n  The importable type interfaces have also been renamed, `Formatter` is now `FormatFn` and `FormatterArguments` is now `FormatFnArguments`.\n  Note that you can also use `Format['format']` instead of `FormatFn`, or `Parameters<Format['format']>` instead of `FormatFnArguments`, so these renames may not matter.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```ts\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n  import type { Formatter, FormatterArguments } from 'style-dictionary/types';\n\n  // register it with register method\n  StyleDictionary.registerFormat({\n    name: 'custom/json',\n    formatter: ({ dictionary }) => JSON.stringify(dictionary, null, 2),\n  });\n\n  export default {\n    // OR define it inline\n    format: {\n      'custom/json': ({ dictionary }) => JSON.stringify(dictionary, null, 2),\n    },\n    platforms: {\n      json: {\n        files: [\n          {\n            destination: 'output.json',\n            format: 'custom/json',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```ts\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n  import type { FormatFn, FormatFnArguments } from 'style-dictionary/types';\n\n  // register it with register method\n  StyleDictionary.registerFormat({\n    name: 'custom/json',\n    format: ({ dictionary }) => JSON.stringify(dictionary, null, 2),\n  });\n\n  export default {\n    // OR define it inline\n    hooks: {\n      formats: {\n        'custom/json': ({ dictionary }) => JSON.stringify(dictionary, null, 2),\n      },\n    },\n    platforms: {\n      json: {\n        files: [\n          {\n            destination: 'output.json',\n            format: 'custom/json',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- e83886c: BREAKING: preprocessors must now also be explicitly applied on global or platform level, rather than only registering it. This is more consistent with how the other hooks work and allows applying it on a platform level rather than only on the global level.\n\n  `preprocessors` property that contains the registered preprocessors has been moved under a wrapping property called `hooks`.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    // register it inline or by SD.registerPreprocessor\n    // applies automatically, globally\n    preprocessors: {\n      foo: (dictionary) => {\n        // preprocess it\n        return dictionary;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    // register it inline or by SD.registerPreprocessor\n    hooks: {\n      preprocessors: {\n        foo: (dictionary) => {\n          // preprocess it\n          return dictionary;\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    // apply it globally\n    preprocessors: ['foo'],\n    platforms: {\n      css: {\n        // or apply is per platform\n        preprocessors: ['foo'],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- 2f80da2: BREAKING: `className`, `packageName`, `mapName`, `type`, `name`, `resourceType` and `resourceMap` options for a bunch of built-in formats have been moved from `file` to go inside the `file.options` object, for API consistency reasons.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"files\": [\n      {\n        \"destination\": \"tokenmap.scss\",\n        \"format\": \"scss/map-deep\",\n        \"mapName\": \"tokens\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"files\": [\n      {\n        \"destination\": \"tokenmap.scss\",\n        \"format\": \"scss/map-deep\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"mapName\": \"tokens\"\n        }\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n  ```\n\n- f2ed88b: BREAKING: Transforms, when registered, are put inside the `hooks.transforms` property now, as opposed to `transform`.\n  The `matcher` property has been renamed to `filter` (to align with the Filter hook change), and the `transformer` handler function has been renamed to `transform` for consistency.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    // register it inline or by SD.registerTransform\n    transform: {\n      'color-transform': {\n        type: 'value',\n        matcher: (token) => token.type === 'color',\n        transformer: (token) => token.value,\n      },\n    },\n    platforms: {\n      css: {\n        // apply it per platform\n        transforms: ['color-transform'],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n  After\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    // register it inline or by SD.registerTransform\n    hooks: {\n      transforms: {\n        'color-transform': {\n          type: 'value',\n          filter: (token) => token.type === 'color',\n          transform: (token) => token.value,\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    platforms: {\n      css: {\n        // apply it per platform\n        transforms: ['color-transform'],\n      },\n    },\n  };\n  ```\n\n- 90095a6: BREAKING: Allow specifying a `function` for `outputReferences`, conditionally outputting a ref or not per token. Also exposes `outputReferencesFilter` utility function which will determine whether a token should be outputting refs based on whether those referenced tokens were filtered out or not.\n\n  If you are maintaining a custom format that allows `outputReferences` option, you'll need to take into account that it can be a function, and pass the correct options to it.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js\n  StyleDictionary.registerFormat({\n    name: 'custom/es6',\n    formatter: async (dictionary) => {\n      const { allTokens, options, file } = dictionary;\n      const { usesDtcg } = options;\n\n      const compileTokenValue = (token) => {\n        let value = usesDtcg ? token.$value : token.value;\n        const originalValue = usesDtcg ? token.original.$value : token.original.value;\n\n        // Look here 👇\n        const shouldOutputRefs = outputReferences && usesReferences(originalValue);\n\n        if (shouldOutputRefs) {\n          // ... your code for putting back the reference in the output\n          value = ...\n        }\n        return value;\n      }\n      return `${allTokens.reduce((acc, token) => `${acc}export const ${token.name} = ${compileTokenValue(token)};\\n`, '')}`;\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n  After\n\n  ```js\n  StyleDictionary.registerFormat({\n    name: 'custom/es6',\n    formatter: async (dictionary) => {\n      const { allTokens, options, file } = dictionary;\n      const { usesDtcg } = options;\n\n      const compileTokenValue = (token) => {\n        let value = usesDtcg ? token.$value : token.value;\n        const originalValue = usesDtcg ? token.original.$value : token.original.value;\n\n        // Look here 👇\n        const shouldOutputRefs =\n          usesReferences(original) &&\n          (typeof options.outputReferences === 'function'\n            ? outputReferences(token, { dictionary, usesDtcg })\n            : options.outputReferences);\n\n        if (shouldOutputRefs) {\n          // ... your code for putting back the reference in the output\n          value = ...\n        }\n        return value;\n      }\n      return `${allTokens.reduce((acc, token) => `${acc}export const ${token.name} = ${compileTokenValue(token)};\\n`, '')}`;\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n- 122c8f6: BREAKING: expose getReferences and usesReference utilities as standalone utils rather than requiring them to be bound to dictionary object. This makes it easier to use.\n- 0b81a08: BREAKING: no longer wraps tokens of type asset in double quotes. Rather, we added a transform `asset/url` that will wrap such tokens inside `url(\"\")` statements, this transform is applied to transformGroups scss, css and less.\n- a4542f4: BREAKING: StyleDictionary to be initialized with a new API and have async methods. Use:\n\n  ```js\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n\n  /**\n   * old:\n   *   const sd = StyleDictionary.extend({ source: ['tokens.json'], platforms: {} });\n   *   sd.buildAllPlatforms();\n   */\n  const sd = new StyleDictionary({ source: ['tokens.json'], platforms: {} });\n  await sd.buildAllPlatforms();\n  ```\n\n  You can still extend a dictionary instance with an extended config, but `.extend()` is only used for this, it is no longer used to initialize the first instance:\n\n  ```js\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n\n  const sd = new StyleDictionary({ source: ['tokens.json'], platforms: {} });\n  const extended = await sd.extend({\n    fileHeader: {\n      myFileHeader: (defaultMessage) => {\n        return [...defaultMessage, 'hello, world!'];\n      },\n    },\n  });\n  ```\n\n  To ensure your initialized StyleDictionary instance is fully ready and has imported all your tokens, you can await `hasInitialized`:\n\n  ```js\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n\n  const sd = new StyleDictionary({ source: ['tokens.json'], platforms: {} });\n  await sd.hasInitialized;\n  console.log(sd.allTokens);\n  ```\n\n  For error handling and testing purposes, you can also manually initialize the style-dictionary config:\n\n  ```js\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n\n  const sd = new StyleDictionary({ source: ['tokens.js'], platforms: {} }, { init: false });\n  try {\n    await sd.init();\n  } catch (e) {\n    // handle error, e.g. when tokens.js file has syntax errors and cannot be imported\n  }\n  console.log(sd.allTokens);\n  ```\n\n  The main reason for an initialize step after class instantiation is that async constructors are not a thing in JavaScript, and if you return a promise from a constructor to \"hack it\", TypeScript will eventually trip over it.\n\n  Due to being able to dynamically (asynchronously) import ES Modules rather than synchronously require CommonJS modules, we had to make the APIs asynchronous, so the following methods are now async:\n\n  - extend\n  - exportPlatform\n  - buildAllPlatforms & buildPlatform\n  - cleanAllPlatforms & cleanPlatform\n\n  In a future release, most other methods will be made async or support async as well, such as parsers, transforms, formats etc.\n\n- f2ed88b: BREAKING: Parsers, when registered, are put inside the `hooks.parsers` property now, as opposed to `parsers`.\n  `parsers` property has been repurposed: you will now also need to explicitly apply registered parsers by name in the `parsers` property, they no longer apply by default.\n  When registering a parser, you must also supply a `name` property just like with all other hooks, and the `parse` function has been renamed to `parser` for consistency.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    // register it inline or by SD.registerPreprocessor\n    parsers: [\n      {\n        pattern: /\\.json5$/,\n        parse: ({ contents, filePath }) => {\n          return JSON5.parse(contents);\n        },\n      },\n    ],\n  };\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```js\n  export default {\n    hooks: {\n      parsers: {\n        name: 'json5-parser',\n        pattern: /\\.json5$/,\n        parser: ({ contents, filePath }) => {\n          return JSON5.parse(contents);\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    // apply it globally by name reference\n    parsers: ['json5-parser'],\n  };\n  ```\n\n- bcb5ef3: Remove reliance on CTI token structure across transforms, actions and formats.\n\n  Breaking changes:\n\n  - Token type will now be determined by \"type\" (or \"$type\") property on the token, rather than by checking its CTI attributes. This change has been reflected in all of the format templates as well as transform \"matcher\" functions that were previously checking `attributes.category` as the token type indicator.\n  - Types are mostly aligned with [DTCG spec types](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/#types), although a few additional ones have been added for compatibility reasons:\n    - asset -> string type tokens where the value is a filepath to an asset\n    - icon -> content type string tokens where the content resembles an icon, e.g. for icon fonts like [Microsoft codicons](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-codicons)\n    - html -> HTML entity strings for unicode characters\n    - content -> regular string content e.g. text content which sometimes needs to be wrapped in quotes\n  - Built-in name transforms are now reliant only on the token path, and are renamed from `name/cti/casing` to just `name/casing`. `name/ti/camel` and `name/ti/constant` have been removed. For example `name/cti/kebab` transform is now `name/kebab`.\n  - Transform `content/icon` has been renamed to `html/icon` since it targets HTML entity strings, not just any icon content.\n  - `font/objC/literal`, `font/swift/literal` and `font/flutter/literal` have been removed in favor of `font/objC/literal`, `font/swift/literal` and `font/flutter/literal`, as they do he exact same transformations.\n  - `typescript/module-declarations` format to be updated with current DesignToken type interface.\n\n  Before:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"color\": {\n      \"red\": {\n        \"value\": \"#FF0000\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  After:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"color\": {\n      // <-- this no longer needs to be \"color\" in order for the tokens inside this group to be considered of type \"color\"\n      \"red\": {\n        \"value\": \"#FF0000\",\n        \"type\": \"color\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- 7b82150: BREAKING: For formats using the `fileHeader` `formatHelpers` utility, it will no longer display a timestamp in the fileHeader output by default. This is now an opt-in by setting `file.formatting.fileHeaderTimestamp` to `true`. The reason for making this opt-in now is that using Style Dictionary in the context of a CI (continuous integration) pipeline is a common use-case, and when running on pull request event, output files always show a diff in git due to the timestamp changing, which often just means that the diff is bloated by redundancy.\n\n  New:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"platforms\": {\n      \"css\": {\n        \"files\": [\n          {\n            \"destination\": \"variables.css\",\n            \"format\": \"css/variables\",\n            \"options\": {\n              \"formatting\": {\n                \"fileHeaderTimestamp\": true\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  or:\n\n  ```js\n  import { fileHeader } from 'style-dictionary/utils';\n\n  const headerContent = await fileHeader({ formatting: { fileHeaderTimestamp: true } });\n  ```\n\n### Minor Changes\n\n- 39f0220: Allow not throwing fatal errors on broken token references/aliases, but `console.error` instead.\n\n  You can also configure this on global/platform `log` property:\n\n  ```json\n  {\n    \"log\": {\n      \"errors\": {\n        \"brokenReferences\": \"console\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This setting defaults to `\"error\"` when not configured.\n\n  `resolveReferences` and `getReferences` `warnImmediately` option is set to `true` which causes an error to be thrown/warned immediately by default, which can be configured to `false` if you know those utils are running in the transform/format hooks respectively, where the errors are collected and grouped, then thrown as 1 error/warning instead of multiple.\n\n  Some minor grammatical improvements to some of the error logs were also done.\n\n- 8450a45: Some fixes for Expand utility:\n\n  - Array values such as `dashArray` property of `strokeStyle` tokens no longer get expanded unintentionally, `typeof 'object'` check changed to `isPlainObject` check.\n  - Nested object-value tokens (such as `style` property inside `border` tokens) will now also be expanded.\n  - When references are involved during expansion, the resolved value is used when the property is an object, if not, then we keep the reference as is.\n    This is because if the reference is to an object value, the expansion might break the reference.\n\n- c06661d: Re-add and update example basic, fix copySync command in CLI, fix android templates to use $type for DTCG tokens.\n- dcbe2fb: FileSystem that is used by Style Dictionary can now be customized:\n\n  ```js\n  import { setFs } from 'style-dictionary/fs';\n  setFs(myFileSystemShim);\n  ```\n\n  By default, it uses an in-memory filesystem shim `@bundled-es-modules/memfs` in browser context, `node:fs` built-in module in Node context.\n\n- 3485467: Fix some inconsistencies in some of the templates, usually with regards to spaces/newlines\n- 606af51: Rename `typeW3CDelegate` utility function to `typeDtcgDelegate`, as using \"W3C\" is highly discouraged when the standard isn't a W3C standard yet.\n- 4225d78: Added the following transforms for CSS, and added them to the `scss`, `css` and `less` transformGroups:\n\n  - `fontFamily/css` -> wraps font names with spaces in `'` quotes\n  - `cubicBezier/css` -> array value, put inside `cubic-bezier()` CSS function\n  - `strokeStyle/css/shorthand` -> object value, transform to CSS shorthand\n  - `border/css/shorthand` -> object value, transform to CSS shorthand\n  - `typography/css/shorthand` -> object value, transform to CSS shorthand\n  - `transition/css/shorthand` -> object value, transform to CSS shorthand\n  - `shadow/css/shorthand` -> object value (or array of objects), transform to CSS shorthand\n\n  The main intention here is to ensure that Style Dictionary is compliant with [DTCG draft specification](https://design-tokens.github.io/community-group/format/) out of the box with regards to exporting to CSS, where object-value tokens are not supported without transforming them to shorthands (or expanding them, which is a different feature that was added in `4.0.0-prerelease.27`).\n\n- cedf8a0: Preprocessors are a new feature added to style-dictionary, which allows you to do any type of processing of the token dictionary **after** parsing, **before** resolving and transforming.\n  See [preprocessor docs](https://v4.styledictionary.com/reference/hooks/preprocessors/) for more information.\n- cb94554: 'size/rem' transform to not transform tokens that already have a unit, such as `\"4px\"`, this should not be transformed to `\"4rem\"`.\n- a4542f4: options.log to be respected in all error logging, including platform specific logs.\n- 122c8f6: Expose a new utility called resolveReferences which takes a value containing references, the dictionary object, and resolves the value's references for you.\n\n  ```js\n  import StyleDictionary from 'style-dictionary';\n  import { resolveReferences } from 'style-dictionary/utils';\n\n  const sd = new StyleDictionary({\n    tokens: {\n      foo: { value: 'foo' },\n      bar: { value: '{foo}' },\n      qux: { value: '{bar}' },\n    },\n  });\n\n  console.log(resolveReferences(sd.tokens.qux.value, sd.tokens)); // 'foo'\n  ```\n\n- 0410295: Improve and test the error handling of standalone usage of reference utilities.\n- 8b6fff3: Fixes some noisy warnings still being outputted even when verbosity is set to default.\n\n  We also added log.warning \"disabled\" option for turning off warnings altogether, meaning you only get success logs and fatal errors.\n  This option can be used from the CLI as well using the `--no-warn` flag.\n\n- 2da5130: Added `outputReferencesTransformed` utility function to pass into outputReferences option, which will not output references for values that have been transitively transformed.\n- 606af51: Support the use of \"value\"/\"type\"/\"description\" as token names or token group names, at the sacrifice of now no longer being able to combine non-DTCG and DTCG syntax within the same token dictionary.\n- 7418c97: Add a couple of utilities for converting a regular Style Dictionary tokens object/file(s) to DTCG formatted tokens:\n\n  - `convertToDTCG`\n  - `convertJSONToDTCG`\n  - `convertZIPToDTCG`\n\n  [Documentation of these utilities](https://v4.styledictionary.com/reference/utils/dtcg/)\n\n- 294fd0e: Support Design Token Community Group Draft specification for Design Tokens, by adding support for $value, $type and $description properties.\n- aff6646: Allow passing a custom FileSystem Volume to your Style Dictionary instances, to ensure input/output files are read/written from/to that specific volume.\n  Useful in case you want multiple Style Dictionary instances that are isolated from one another in terms of inputs/outputs.\n\n  ```js\n  import { Volume } from 'memfs';\n  // You will need a bundler for memfs in browser...\n  // Or use as a prebundled fork:\n  import memfs from '@bundled-es-modules/memfs';\n  const { Volume } = memfs;\n\n  const vol = new Volume();\n\n  const sd = new StyleDictionary(\n    {\n      tokens: {\n        colors: {\n          red: {\n            value: '#FF0000',\n            type: 'color',\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      platforms: {\n        css: {\n          transformGroup: 'css',\n          files: [\n            {\n              destination: 'variables.css',\n              format: 'css/variables',\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      },\n    },\n    { volume: vol },\n  );\n\n  await sd.buildAllPlatforms();\n\n  vol.readFileSync('/variables.css');\n  /**\n   * :root {\n   *   --colors-red: #FF0000;\n   * }\n   */\n  ```\n\n  This also works when using extend:\n\n  ```js\n  const extendedSd = await sd.extend(cfg, { volume: vol });\n  ```\n\n- 261a2cb: Handle transition timingFunction prop in cubicBezier/css transform. Handle typography fontFamily prop in fontFamily/css transform.\n- e83886c: Allow expanding tokens on a global or platform-specific level. Supports conditionally expanding per token type, or using a function to determine this per individual token.\n- af5cc94: Create `formatPlatform` and `formatAllPlatforms` methods.\n  This will return the outputs and destinations from the format hook for your dictionary, without building these outputs and persisting them to the filesystem.\n  Additionally, formats can now return any data type instead of requiring it to be a `string` and `destination` property in `files` is now optional.\n  This allows users to create formats intended for only formatting tokens and letting users do stuff with it during runtime rather than writing to files.\n- c06661d: Re-add and update example basic, fix copySync command in CLI, fix android templates to use $type for DTCG tokens.\n- 4556712: Make css transforms for strokeStyle, cubicBezier and fontFamily transitive, to deal with the use case where they are used within border, transition and typography tokens and those tokens have **other** properties that contain references.\n\n### Patch Changes\n\n- 894f37c: Update glob esm browser fork to latest, resolve unclear licensing issue.\n- cb78c3d: Update `typeDtcgDelegate` utility to remove the $type on token group level between parsing/preprocessing step.\n- 5079154: Fix deepExtend util bug with overriding behavior for tokens.\n- c1dd5ec: Allow overriding CSS formatting with commentStyle and commentPosition props.\n  For commentStyle, options are 'short' or 'long'.\n  For commentPosition, options are 'above' or 'inline'.\n\n  We also ensure that the right defaults are picked for CSS, SASS/SCSS, Stylus and Less.\n\n  This also contains a fix for ensuring that multi-line comments are automatically put \"above\" rather than \"inline\".\n\n- 2f80da2: All formats using `createPropertyFormatter` or `formattedVariables` helpers now respect the `file.options.formatting` option passed by users to customize formatting.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```js\n  {\n    platforms: {\n      css: {\n        transformGroup: 'css',\n        buildPath,\n        files: [\n          {\n            destination: 'variables.css',\n            format: 'css/variables',\n            options: {\n              formatting: { indentation: '    ' },\n            },\n          },\n        ]\n      }\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n- 24584b4: Conditionally only run dev scripts when CWD is style-dictionary, so our consumers don't run it by accident\n- 044123c: Patch StyleDictionary main type file to export default instead of \"export =\" which does not work in ESM.\n- cb94554: Fix typeDtcgDelegate util $type property position to be allowed anywhere in the object, not just at the top.\n- 8e297d6: Fix outputReferences for DTCG spec tokens, by using token.original.$value instead of token.original.value.\n- 59f3eb0: Expose flattenTokens utility.\n- 72f020d: Pass outputReferenceFallbacks option to the relevant utilities, so the option actually works.\n- 39547fb: Fix parsers async support, use resolved filePath instead of raw.\n- 3138313: Allow transitive transforms to return undefined, by doing this the transformer can mark itself as \"deferred\" for that specific token. This is useful when references in properties other than \"value\" need to be resolved first.\n- cd9f484: Escape double quotes for ts outputStringLiterals\n- 0c1a36f: Fix small issue in type DTCG delegate utility type tracking.\n- d008c67: Fix a couple of spots where DTCG option wasn't properly taken into account, more tests added.\n- 6cfce97: Fix logging to be ordered by platform when building or cleaning platforms. This now happens in parallel, resulting in the logs being ordered randomly which was a small regression to the logging experience.\n- 6fb81ad: Allow falsy token values for outputReferences, e.g. `0`.\n- 0972b26: Pass SD options to fileheaders and filters, to make it easier to use and adjust according to config or options like usesDTCG.\n- 2335f13: Allow using registerHook methods to override hooks that are already registered with the same name.\n- 24d41c3: Allow outputReferences to work on non-string values.\n- 0c1a36f: Expose `typeDtcgDelegate` utility. Don't take `value` into account anymore to determine that it's a design token, use `$value`.\n- 061c67e: Hotfix to address outputReferencesTransformed util not handling object-value tokens properly.\n- 8d2f6d8: Make sure fs-node.js file is published to NPM.\n- 738686b: Allow transformGroup to be combined with transforms, where standalone transforms will be added after the group's transforms.\n- c708325: Moving the @zip.js/zip.js dependency from a devDependency to a normal dependency.\n- cd48aac: Only run postinstall scripts when NODE_ENV isn't production (e.g. npm install --production or --omit=dev). To avoid errors running husky/patch-package.\n- a5bafac: Colors that are not recognized by tinycolor2 as valid color formats (e.g. `linear-gradient(...)`) are now ignored by the builtin color transforms filter functions.\n- 4ec34fd: Pass options to all of the filter functions in our built-in transforms, to check for `usesDTCG` and `$type` property.\n- daa78e1: fix(types): Added missing type exports\n- e859036: Fix Windows support by using a Linux/Windows + Node/Browser compatible path utility. Upgrade to latest Glob version. Apply posix: true to prevent breaking change glob update.\n- 6e226aa: Pass the original ref path to the `getReferences` util result tokens.\n- 1dd828c: Fix issue in browser-bundled glob, bump.\n- 3f09277: Pass dictionary options to preprocessor functions.\n- c2cbd1b: Publish the postinstall-dev script to NPM.\n- 0972b26: Add unfilteredAllTokens property in dictionary object for formats, which is an unfiltered version of allTokens property, or a flattened version of the unfilteredTokens property.\n- 47face0: Token merging behavior changed so that upon token collisions, metadata props aren't accidentally merged together.\n- f8c40f7: fix(types): add missing type keyword for type export from index.d.ts\n- 77ae35f: Fix scenario of passing absolute paths in Node env, do not remove leading slash in absolute paths.\n- 63681a6: Fix a couple of type imports issues in .d.ts files\n- 261a2cb: Allow border type tokens to be empty, every property is optional.\n- ba03ee9: Fix for expand utility on platform level to adjust the token's path property.\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

          "content": "# Contributing to the Style Dictionary\n\nThis is a labor of love, and we work hard to provide a useful framework. We greatly value feedback and contributions from our community. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we welcome your issues and pull requests. Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.\n\n## Filing Bug Reports\n\nYou can file bug reports on the [GitHub issues][issues] page.\n\nIf you are filing a report for a bug or regression in the framework, it's extremely helpful to provide as much information as possible when opening the original issue. This helps us reproduce and investigate the possible bug without having to wait for this extra information to be provided. Please read the following guidelines prior to filing a bug report.\n\n1. Search through existing [issues][issues] to ensure that your specific issue has not yet been reported. If it is a common issue, it is likely there is already a bug report for your problem.\n2. Ensure that you have tested the latest version of the framework. Although you may have an issue against an older version of the framework, we cannot provide bug fixes for old versions. It's also possible that the bug may have been fixed in the latest release.\n3. Provide as much information about your environment, npm version, and relevant dependencies as possible. For example, let us know what version of Node.js you are using, what other node modules, what ES version, etc. If possible, send us a github repository we can take a look at.\n4. Provide a minimal test case that reproduces your issue or any error information you related to your problem. We can provide feedback much more quickly if we know what operations you are calling in the framework. If you cannot provide a full test case, provide as much code as you can to help us diagnose the problem. Any relevant information should be provided as well, like whether this is a persistent issue, or if it only occurs some of the time.\n\n## Submitting Pull Requests\n\nWe are always happy to receive code and documentation contributions to the framework. Please be aware of the following notes prior to opening a pull request:\n\n1. This framework is released under the [Apache license][license]. Any code you submit will be released under that license. For substantial contributions, we may ask you to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][cla].\n2. For any significant features or API changes please reach out to us to avoid any duplicate effort.\n3. Adding to the included transforms, transformGroups, and formats, please read [this section](#what-should-be-included).\n\n## Package Manager and dependencies\n\nWe use npm as our package manager. After downloading the repo, please use the command \"npm ci\" to ensure you use the package-lock dependency tree. Note that you need NPM 5.7.0 or higher to use this command.\n\n## Code Style\n\nWe use ESLint on the code to ensure a consistent style. Any new code committed must pass our ESLint tests. Take a look at our [ESLint file][eslint].\n\n### Code Rules\n\n1. **Do not mutate token names or values in a format.** Mutations like this should happen in a transform.\n1. **Be as generic as possible.** Do not hard-code any values or configuration in formats.\n1. **Fail loudly.** Users should be aware if something is missing or configurations aren't correct. This will help debug any issues instead of failing silently.\n1. **Rely on few dependencies.** This framework is meant to be extended and allows for customization. We don't want to bring a slew of dependencies that most people don't need.\n\n### Commit Rules\n\nWe follow [conventional commits'](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.2/#specification) specification.\n\nPlease follow the spec to have a successful commit.\n\n## What should be included?\n\nAnything that contributes to the idea of creating cross-platform styles.\n\n### What transforms/transform groups/formats should be included?\n\nIf it has a generic and flexible enough use-case, it can be included. We would like to keep this type of code to a minimum because we don't want to be a swiss army knife that does everything out of the box. Instead, we want to focus on core tasks that are useful to the largest number of projects. The spirit of this framework is to allow flexibility and modularity which helps anyone fit it to their needs. This is why you can write your own transforms, and formats with the register methods.\n\n### Where do things go?\n\nWe separate each function/method into its own file and group them into directories. The times we break that is for transforms and formats, but we might change that in the future. Keep the files/methods as self-contained as possible, they should each do one task.\n\n## Testing\n\nAny new features should implement the proper unit tests. We use Jest to test our framework.\n\nIf you are adding a new transform, action, or format: please add new unit tests. You can see examples in **\\_\\_tests\\_\\_**/formats.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe use [Astro](https://astro.build/) to transform the markdown files into a documentation website. To preview it locally, run `npm run docs:start`.\n\n[issues]: https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/issues\n[license]: https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/blob/main/LICENSE\n[cla]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement\n[eslint]: https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/blob/main/eslint.config.js\n"

It provides a single place to create and edit your styles, and exports these tokens to all the places you need - iOS, Android, CSS, JS, HTML, sketch files, style documentation, etc. It is available as a CLI through npm, but can also be used like any normal node module if you want to extend its functionality.\n\nWhen you are managing user experiences, it can be quite challenging to keep styles consistent and synchronized across multiple development platforms and devices. At the same time, designers, developers, PMs and others must be able to have consistent and up-to-date style documentation to enable effective work and communication. Even then, mistakes inevitably happen and the design may not be implemented accurately. Style Dictionary solves this by automatically generating style definitions across all platforms from a single source - removing roadblocks, errors, and inefficiencies across your workflow.\n\nFor detailed usage head to https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary\n\n## Watch the Demo on YouTube\n\n[![Watch the video](/docs/src/assets/fake_player.png)](http://youtu.be/1HREvonfqhY)\n\n## Experiment in the playground\n\nTry the browser-based Style Dictionary playground: [https://www.style-dictionary-play.dev/](https://www.style-dictionary-play.dev/), built by the folks at [\\<div\\>RIOTS](https://divriots.com/).\n\n## Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Usage](#usage)\n- [Example](#example)\n- [Quick Start](#quick-start)\n- [Design Tokens](#design-tokens)\n- [Extending](#extending)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Installation\n\n_Note that you must have node (and npm) installed._\n\nIf you want to use the CLI, you can install it globally via npm:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -g style-dictionary\n```\n\nOr you can install it like a normal npm dependency. This is a build tool and you are most likely going to want to save it as a dev dependency:\n\n```bash\n$ npm install -D style-dictionary\n```\n\nIf you want to install it with yarn:\n\n```bash\n$ yarn add style-dictionary --dev\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### CLI\n\n```bash\n$ style-dictionary build\n```\n\nCall this in the root directory of your project. The only thing needed is a `config.json` file. There are also arguments:\n\n| Flag                    | Short Flag | Description                                                |\n| ----------------------- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| --config \\[path\\]       | -c         | Set the config file to use. Must be a .json file           |\n| --platform \\[platform\\] | -p         | Only build a specific platform defined in the config file. |\n| --help                  | -h         | Display help content                                       |\n| --version               | -v         | Display the version                                        |\n\n### Node\n\nYou can also use the style dictionary build system in node if you want to [extend](#extending) the functionality or use it in another build system like Grunt or Gulp.\n\n```javascript\nconst StyleDictionary = require('style-dictionary').extend('config.json');\n\nStyleDictionary.buildAllPlatforms();\n```\n\nThe `.extend()` method is an overloaded method that can also take an object with the configuration in the same format as a config.json file.\n\n```javascript\nimport { formats, transformGroups } from 'style-dictionary/enums';\n\nconst StyleDictionary = require('style-dictionary').extend({\n  source: ['tokens/**/*.json'],\n  platforms: {\n    scss: {\n      transformGroup: transformGroups.scss,\n      buildPath: 'build/',\n      files: [\n        {\n          destination: 'variables.scss',\n          format: formats.scssVariables,\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n    // ...\n  },\n});\n\nStyleDictionary.buildAllPlatforms();\n```\n\n## Example\n\n[Take a look at some of our examples](examples/)\n\nA style dictionary is a collection of design tokens, key/value pairs that describe stylistic attributes like colors, sizes, icons, motion, etc. A style dictionary defines these design tokens in JSON or Javascript files, and can also include static assets like images and fonts. Here is a basic example of what the package structure can look like:\n\n```\n├── config.json\n├── tokens/\n│   ├── size/\n│       ├── font.json\n│   ├── color/\n│       ├── font.json\n│   ...\n├── assets/\n│   ├── fonts/\n│   ├── images/\n```\n\n### config.json\n\nThis tells the style dictionary build system how and what to build. The default file path is `config.json` or `config.js` in the root of the project, but you can name it whatever you want by passing in the `--config` flag to the [CLI](https://styledictionary.com/getting-started/using_the_cli/).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"source\": [\"tokens/**/*.json\"],\n  \"platforms\": {\n    \"scss\": {\n      \"transformGroup\": \"scss\",\n      \"buildPath\": \"build/\",\n      \"files\": [\n        {\n          \"destination\": \"scss/_variables.scss\",\n          \"format\": \"scss/variables\"\n        }\n      ]\n    },\n    \"android\": {\n      \"transformGroup\": \"android\",\n      \"buildPath\": \"build/android/\",\n      \"files\": [\n        {\n          \"destination\": \"font_dimens.xml\",\n          \"format\": \"android/fontDimens\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n| Property                             | Type              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| :----------------------------------- | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| source                               | Array             | An array of file path [globs](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) to design token files.

The style definition size.font.small.value is \"10px\" for example. The style definition size.font.base.value is automatically aliased to the value found in size.font.medium.value and both of those resolve to \"16px\".\n\nNow what the style dictionary build system will do with this information is convert it to different formats, enabling these values to be used in any type of codebase. From this one file you can generate any number of files like:\n\n```scss\n$size-font-small: 10px;\n$size-font-medium: 16px;\n$size-font-large: 24px;\n$size-font-base: 16px;\n```\n\n```xml\n<dimen name=\"font-small\">10sp</dimen>\n<dimen name=\"font-medium\">16sp</dimen>\n<dimen name=\"font-large\">24sp</dimen>\n<dimen name=\"font-base\">16sp</dimen>\n```\n\n```objc\nfloat const SizeFontSmall = 10.00f;\nfloat const SizeFontMedium = 16.00f;\nfloat const SizeFontLarge = 24.00f;\nfloat const SizeFontBase = 16.00f;\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe style dictionary framework comes with some example code to get you started. Install the node module globally, create a directory and `cd` into it.\n\n```bash\n$ npm i -g style-dictionary\n$ mkdir MyStyleDictionary\n$ cd MyStyleDictionary\n```\n\nNow run:\n\n```bash\n$ style-dictionary init basic\n```\n\nThis command will copy over the example files found in [example](examples/) in this repo. Now you have an example project set up. You can make changes to the style dictionary and rebuild the project by running:\n\n```bash\n$ style-dictionary build\n```\n\nTake a look at the documentation for the example code.\n\n## Design Tokens\n\nA design token is an attribute to describe something visually. It is atomic (it cannot be broken down further). Design tokens have a name, a value, and optional attributes or metadata. The name of a token can be anything, but we have a proposed naming structure that we find works really well in the next section.\n\n### Category/Type/Item Structure\n\nWhile not exactly necessary, we feel this classification structure of design tokens makes the most sense semantically. Design tokens can be organized into a hierarchical tree structure with the top level, category, defining the primitive nature of the token. For example, we have the color category and every token underneath is always a color. As you proceed down the tree to type, item, sub-item, and state, you get more specific about what that color is. Is it a background color, a text color, or a border color? What kind of text color is it? You get the point. Now you can structure your token json files like simple objects:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"size\": {\n    \"font\": {\n      \"base\": { \"value\": \"16\" },\n      \"large\": { \"value\": \"20\" }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe CTI is implicit in the structure, the category and type is 'size' and 'font', and there are 2 tokens 'base' and 'large'.\n\nStructuring design tokens in this manner gives us consistent naming and accessing of these tokens. You don't need to remember if it is button_color_error or error_button_color, it is color_background_button_error!\n\nYou can organize and name your design tokens however you want, there are no restrictions. But we have a good amount of helpers if you do use this structure, like the 'attribute/cti' transform which adds attributes to the token of its CTI based on the path in the object. There are a lot of name transforms as well for when you want a flat structure like for Sass variables.\n\nAlso, the CTI structure provides a good mechanism to target transforms for specific kinds of tokens. All of the transforms provided by the framework use the CTI of a token to know if it should be applied. For instance, the 'color/hex' transform only applies to tokens of the category 'color'.\n\nYou can also add a _comment_ to a design token:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"size\": {\n    \"font\": {\n      \"base\": {\n        \"value\": \"16\",\n        \"comment\": \"the base size of the font\"\n      },\n      \"large\": {\n        \"value\": \"20\",\n        \"comment\": \"the large size of the font\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe comment will appear in the output files, where relevant or the output format supports comments.\n\n## Extending\n\nThe style dictionary build system is made to be extended. We don't know exactly how everyone will want to use style dictionaries in their project, which is why you can create custom transforms and formats.\n\n```javascript\nconst StyleDictionary = require('style-dictionary').extend('config.json');\nimport { transforms, transformTypes } from 'style-dictionary/enums';\n\nStyleDictionary.registerTransform({\n  name: transforms.timeSeconds,\n  type: transformTypes.value,\n  filter: function (token) {\n    return token.type === 'time';\n  },\n  transform: function (token) {\n    return (parseInt(token.original.value) / 1000).toString() + 's';\n  },\n});\n\nStyleDictionary.buildAllPlatforms();\n```\n\nFor more information on creating your own transforms and formats, take a look at our [docs](https://styledictionary.com).\n\n## Version 4\n\nIn May 2021, we started [an issue / RFC, \"What would you like to see in Style-Dictionary 4.0?\"](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/issues/643) to gather feedback on what the community would like to see.\nFortunately, in August 2023, the folks at [Tokens Studio](https://tokens.studio/) contacted us about co-maintaining this project, and leading the v4 release (and beyond)!\n\nWe have started working on the biggest and most important changes, like migrating to ESM, making the library browser-compatible out of the box, and supporting asynchronicity in Style-Dictionary's various APIs. There will be multiple prereleases to battle-test these changes before a final v4.0 is released.\n\nYou can follow [this roadmap board](https://github.com/orgs/amzn/projects/4/views/1?layout=board) to keep an eye on the developments for v4.0, we will also keep adding to this board when we encounter changes we'd like to see in v4.0 that would entail a breaking change. Absence of something in this roadmap does not mean we don't see value in it, but rather that it could also be added in a (non-breaking) minor release within v4.x.x.\n\n### From the folks at Tokens Studio\n\nHi everyone! I'm Joren from Tokens Studio, a big fan of this project (see [Style-Dictionary-Play](https://www.style-dictionary-play.dev/), [Token Configurator](https://configurator.tokens.studio/), [sd-transforms](https://github.com/tokens-studio/sd-transforms)) and the main pusher behind leading a 4.0 release of this project, I think it would be good to explain from our perspective why we've made the move to collaborate with Amazon on this.\n\nAt Tokens Studio, we're a huge fan of Design Tokens and the workflows they enable. We believe exporting design tokens to various platforms is a key ingredient in ensuring that the journey from design to implementation code is smooth.\nIn our minds, Style-Dictionary has been the most popular and most flexible library for reaching that goal, and so we want to build on top of that.\nRather than starting our own spinoff tool, we much prefer bringing Style-Dictionary further, together with its vibrant community of contributors, which is why we reached out to Danny Banks.\n\nI think it's important to stress that it is our shared vision to keep Style-Dictionary as an agnostic (so not \"Tokens Studio\"-specific) and flexible tool. As Tokens Studio, while we are highly incentivized to see this project progress further to strengthen our product journey, we value the open source community highly and want to make sure this library remains the go-to tool for exporting Design Tokens, whether you use Tokens Studio or not.\n\nWe are very open to feedback and collaboration, feel free to reach out to us in [our Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/tokens-studio/shared_invite/zt-1p8ea3m6t-C163oJcN9g3~YZTKRgo2hg) -> `style-dictionary-v4` channel!\n\n## Mascot\n\nThe mascot for Style Dictionary is [\"Pascal\"](https://github.com/amzn/style-dictionary/issues/97) the chameleon (seen below). You can also find them blending in as the logo throughout the documentation.\n\n<img src=\"docs/src/assets/logo.png\" alt=\"Style Dictionary logo and mascot\" title=\"&quot;Pascal&quot;\" width=\"240\" />\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease help make this framework better.
