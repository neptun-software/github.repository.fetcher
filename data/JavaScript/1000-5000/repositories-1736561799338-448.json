          "content": "# Change logs for Labella.js\n\n## v1.x.x\n\n### 1.1.4 (2017-05-24)\n\nMove `karma-phantomjs-launcher` to devDependencies where it should be.\n\n### 1.1.3 (2017-05-24)\n\nEnsure that labella does not sort the nodes within the input array and return the list of nodes in the same order that it was supplied. ([#23](https://github.com/twitter/labella.js/issues/23))\n\nIf you specify `force.node([n1, n2, n3])`, you should get `[n1, n2, n3]` back from `force.nodes()` with updated `currentPos` for `n1`, `n2` and `n3`.\n\n### 1.1.2 (2016-03-18)\n\nUse original order if labels are at the same position and has no good reason to change order. This was the intended behavior, but the way it was written sometimes it changes the order, so I ensure that it will keep the original order in this version.\n\n### 1.1.1 (2016-02-17)\n\nFix the bug in *overlap* distribution algorithm. Thanks @GjjvdBurg. **After upgrading to this version, Labella may position the labels slightly different if you use the overlap algorithm and your labels exceed one row.**\n\n### 1.1.0 (2016-02-17)\n\nSeparate utilities and extra code for evaluation/demo into a separate bundle *labella-extra* to keep the main bundle as lean as possible. Now the *dist* directory contains four files:\n\n- *labella.js* and *labella.min.js* : Core functionalities. This is what you will need for regular use.\n- *labella-extra.js* and *labella-extra.min.js* (introduced in this version) : Same with the above bundle plus `labella.util` and `labella.metrics`, which are special modules for demo/evaluation.\n\nOther than that, No API change, just refactoring.\n\n- Use [webpack](https://webpack.github.io) to make the library support UMD instead of using a custom template.\n- Refactor a few classes to ES6\n\n### 1.0.0 (2016-01-23)\n\nReplace *force-directed simulation* with *constraint-based layout* and use [VPSC](https://github.com/tgdwyer/WebCola/wiki/What-is-VPSC%3F) quadratic solver to compute positions that best satisfy the constraints. This method is much faster and does not rely on number of iterations like a simulation, therefore the computation can return results immediately and does not need to be asynchronous anymore. This improves overall performance and leads to several changes to the API.\n\n<a name=\"migrate-0.x.x-1.x.x\"></a>\n#### New API\n\n- `force.compute()` is a replacement for `force.start()` and `force.on()`. Usage is slightly different because `force.compute()` is synchronous and the nodes' positions are ready immediately after the call while `force.start()` was asynchronous.\n\n```diff\nvar force = new labella.Force()\n  .nodes(nodes)\n-   .on('end', function(){\n-     draw(force.nodes());\n-   })\n-   .start(100);\n+   .compute();\n+ draw(force.nodes());\n```\n\n- New **Force** option `lineSpacing` is available for setting the minimum gap between lines.\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- The following **Force** functions are deprecated: `.on()`, `.start()`, `.stop()`, `.resume()`, `.step()` and `.isStable()`.\n- The following **Force** options are deprecated: `damping`, `epsilon` and `roundsPerTick`\n- `node.getLevel()` is renamed to `node.getLayerIndex()`\n\n## v0.x.x\n\n### 0.1.1 (2015-11-21)\n\n#### Breaking changes\n\n- For the **Force**, use ```options.minPos``` and ```options.maxPos``` to set ```options.layerWidth``` for the **Distributor** inside it instead of having to specify ```options.layerWidth``` explicitly.\n- Change ```options.labelHeight``` in **Renderer** to ```options.nodeHeight```.\n\n### 0.1.0 (2015-11-20)\n\nFirst release. Hello, world!"

The API has changed. `force.start()` and `force.on()` are deprecated. Both are replaced by `force.compute()` which has to be called slightly differently. Please read the [change logs](CHANGELOG.md#migrate-0.x.x-1.x.x).\n\n### Install\n\n```\nnpm install labella --save\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nbower install labella --save\n```\n\n### Example\n\n```javascript\n// idealPos: The most preferred position for each label\n// width:    The width of each label\nvar nodes = [\n  new labella.Node(1, 50), // idealPos, width\n  new labella.Node(2, 50),\n  new labella.Node(3, 50),\n  new labella.Node(3, 50),\n  new labella.Node(3, 50),\n];\n\nvar force = new labella.Force()\n  .nodes(nodes)\n  .compute();\n\n// The rendering is independent from this library.\n// User can use canvas, svg or any library to draw the labels.\n// There is also a built-in helper for this purpose. See labella.Renderer\ndraw(force.nodes());\n```\n\n### Import into your project\n\n##### Choice 1. Global\n\nAdding this library via ```<script>``` tag is the simplest way. By doing this, ```labella``` is available in the global scope.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"labella.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n##### Choice 2: AMD\n\nIf you use requirejs, Labella.js support AMD out of the box.\n\n```javascript\nrequire(['path/to/labella'], function(labella) {\n  // do something\n});\n```\n\n##### Choice 3: node.js / browserify\n\nLabella.js also supports usage in commonjs style.\n\n```javascript\nvar labella = require('path/to/labella');\n```\n\n### Files\n\nThe *dist* directory contains four variations of this library:\n\n- *labella.js* and *labella.min.js* : Core functionalities. This is what you will need for regular use.\n- *labella-extra.js* and *labella-extra.min.js* (since v1.1.0) : Same content with the above bundle plus `labella.util` and `labella.metrics`, which are special modules for demo/evaluation.\n\n### Author\n\nKrist Wongsuphasawat / [@kristw](https://twitter.com/kristw)\n\nCopyright 2015 Twitter, Inc.
