By contrast,\r\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\r\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\r\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\r\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\r\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\r\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\r\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\r\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\r\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\r\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\r\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\r\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\r\nknow their rights.\r\n\r\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\r\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\r\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\r\n\r\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\r\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\r\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\r\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\r\nauthors of previous versions.\r\n\r\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\r\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\r\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\r\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\r\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\r\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\r\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\r\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\r\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\r\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\r\n\r\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\r\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\r\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\r\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\r\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n  0. Definitions.\r\n\r\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\r\n\r\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\r\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\r\n\r\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\r\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\r\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\r\n\r\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\r\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\r\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\r\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\r\n\r\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\r\non the Program.\r\n\r\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\r\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\r\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\r\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\r\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\r\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\r\n\r\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\r\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\r\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\r\n\r\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\r\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\r\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\r\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\r\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\r\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\r\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\r\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\r\n\r\n  1. Source Code.\r\n\r\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\r\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\r\nform of a work.\r\n\r\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\r\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\r\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\r\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\r\n\r\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\r\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\r\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\r\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\r\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\r\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\r\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\r\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\r\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\r\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\r\n\r\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\r\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\r\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\r\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\r\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\r\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\r\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\r\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\r\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\r\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\r\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\r\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\r\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\r\nSource.\r\n\r\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\r\nsame work.\r\n\r\n  2. Basic Permissions.\r\n\r\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\r\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\r\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\r\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\r\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\r\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\r\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\r\n\r\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\r\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\r\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\r\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\r\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\r\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\r\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\r\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\r\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\r\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\r\n\r\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\r\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\r\nmakes it unnecessary.\r\n\r\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\r\n\r\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\r\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\r\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\r\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\r\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\r\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\r\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\r\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\r\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\r\ntechnological measures.\r\n\r\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\r\n\r\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\r\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\r\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\r\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\r\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\r\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\r\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n\r\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\r\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\r\n\r\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\r\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\r\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\r\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\r\n\r\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\r\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\r\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\r\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\r\n\r\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\r\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\r\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\r\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\r\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\r\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\r\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\r\n\r\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\r\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\r\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\r\n    work need not make them do so.\r\n\r\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\r\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\r\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\r\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\r\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\r\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\r\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\r\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\r\nparts of the aggregate.\r\n\r\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\r\n\r\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\r\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\r\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\r\nin one of these ways:\r\n\r\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\r\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange.\r\n\r\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\r\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\r\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\r\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\r\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\r\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\r\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\r\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\r\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\r\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\r\n\r\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\r\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\r\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\r\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\r\n    with subsection 6b.\r\n\r\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\r\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\r\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\r\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\r\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\r\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\r\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\r\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\r\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\r\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\r\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\r\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\r\n\r\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\r\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\r\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\r\n    charge under subsection 6d.\r\n\r\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\r\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\r\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\r\n\r\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\r\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\r\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\r\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\r\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\r\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\r\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\r\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\r\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\r\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\r\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\r\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\r\n\r\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\r\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\r\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\r\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\r\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\r\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\r\nmodification has been made.\r\n\r\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\r\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\r\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\r\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\r\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\r\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\r\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\r\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\r\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\r\nbeen installed in ROM).\r\n\r\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\r\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\r\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\r\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\r\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\r\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\r\nprotocols for communication across the network.\r\n\r\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\r\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\r\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\r\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\r\nunpacking, reading or copying.\r\n\r\n  7. Additional Terms.\r\n\r\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\r\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\r\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\r\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\r\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\r\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\r\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\r\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\r\n\r\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\r\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\r\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\r\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\r\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\r\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\r\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\r\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\r\n\r\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\r\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\r\n\r\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\r\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\r\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\r\n\r\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\r\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\r\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\r\n\r\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\r\n    authors of the material; or\r\n\r\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\r\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\r\n\r\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\r\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\r\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\r\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\r\n    those licensors and authors.\r\n\r\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\r\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\r\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\r\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\r\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\r\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\r\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\r\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\r\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\r\n\r\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\r\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\r\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\r\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\r\n\r\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\r\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\r\nthe above requirements apply either way.\r\n\r\n  8. Termination.\r\n\r\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\r\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\r\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\r\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\r\nparagraph of section 11).\r\n\r\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\r\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\r\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\r\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\r\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\r\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\r\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\r\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\r\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\r\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\r\nyour receipt of the notice.\r\n\r\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\r\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\r\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\r\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\r\nmaterial under section 10.\r\n\r\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\r\n\r\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\r\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\r\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\r\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\r\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\r\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\r\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\r\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\r\n\r\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\r\n\r\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\r\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\r\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\r\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\r\n\r\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\r\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\r\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\r\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\r\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\r\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\r\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\r\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\r\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\r\n\r\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\r\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\r\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\r\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\r\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\r\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\r\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\r\n\r\n  11. Patents.\r\n\r\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\r\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\r\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\r\n\r\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\r\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\r\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\r\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\r\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\r\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\r\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\r\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\r\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\r\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\r\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\r\n\r\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\r\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\r\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\r\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\r\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\r\npatent against the party.\r\n\r\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\r\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\r\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\r\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\r\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\r\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\r\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\r\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\r\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\r\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\r\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\r\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\r\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\r\n\r\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\r\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\r\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\r\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\r\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\r\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\r\nwork and works based on it.\r\n\r\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\r\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\r\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\r\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\r\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\r\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\r\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\r\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\r\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\r\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\r\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\r\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\r\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\r\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\r\n\r\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\r\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\r\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\r\n\r\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\r\n\r\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\r\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\r\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\r\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\r\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\r\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\r\n\r\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\r\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\r\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\r\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\r\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\r\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\r\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\r\ncombination as such.\r\n\r\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\r\n\r\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\r\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\r\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\naddress new problems or concerns.\r\n\r\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\r\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\r\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\r\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\r\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\r\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\r\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\r\nby the Free Software Foundation.\r\n\r\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\r\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\r\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\r\nto choose that version for the Program.\r\n\r\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\r\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\r\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\r\nlater version.\r\n\r\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\r\n\r\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\r\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\r\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\r\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\r\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\r\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\r\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\r\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n\r\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\r\n\r\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\r\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\r\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\r\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\r\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\r\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\r\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\r\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\r\nSUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\r\n\r\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\r\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\r\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\r\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\r\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\r\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\r\n\r\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n\r\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\r\n\r\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\r\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\r\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\r\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n\r\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\r\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n\r\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n    (at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\r\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\r\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n\r\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\r\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n\r\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\r\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\r\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\r\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n\r\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\r\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\r\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\r\n\r\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\r\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\r\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\r\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\r\n\r\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\r\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\r\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\r\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\r\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\r\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>."

If you need to support IE < 11 consider using [fullPage.js v3](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/tree/3.1.2).\r\nIt also provides touch support for mobile phones, tablets and touch screen computers.\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for supporting fullpage.js.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n### Commercial license\r\nIf you want to use fullPage to develop non open sourced sites, themes, projects, and applications, the Commercial license is the appropriate license. With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. Which means, you won't have to change your whole application source code to an open source license. [[Purchase a Fullpage Commercial License]](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/pricing/)\r\n\r\n### Open source license\r\nIf you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the [GNU GPL license v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), you may use fullPage under the terms of the GPLv3.\r\n\r\n**You will have to provide a prominent notice that fullPage.js is in use. The credit comments in the JavaScript and CSS files should be kept intact** (even after combination or minification).\r\n\r\n[Read more about fullPage's license](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/pricing/).\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nAs you can see in the example files, you will need to include:\r\n - The JavaScript file `fullpage.js` (or its minified version `fullpage.min.js`)\r\n - The css file `fullpage.css`\r\n\r\n **Optionally**, when using `css3:false`, you can add the [easings file](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/tree/master/vendors/easings.min.js) in case you want to use other easing effects apart from the one included in the library (`easeInOutCubic`).\r\n\r\n### Install using bower or npm\r\n**Optionally**, you can install fullPage.js with bower or npm if you prefer:\r\n\r\nTerminal:\r\n```shell\r\n// With bower\r\nbower install fullpage.js\r\n\r\n// With npm\r\nnpm install fullpage.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Including files\r\n```html\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"fullpage.css\" />\r\n\r\n<!-- This following line is optional. Only necessary if you use the option css3:false and you want to use other easing effects rather than \"easeInOutCubic\". -->\r\n<script src=\"vendors/easings.min.js\"></script>\r\n\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"fullpage.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing Webpack, Browserify or Require.js? Check [how to use fullPage.js with module loaders](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/Use-module-loaders-for-fullPage.js).\r\n\r\n### Optional use of CDN\r\nIf you prefer to use a CDN to load the needed files, fullPage.js is in CDNJS:\r\nhttps://cdnjs.com/libraries/fullPage.js\r\n\r\n### Required HTML structure\r\nStart your HTML document with the compulsory [HTML DOCTYPE declaration](https://www.corelangs.com/html/introduction/doctype.html) on the 1st line of your HTML code. You might have troubles with sections heights otherwise. The examples provided use HTML 5 doctype `<!DOCTYPE html>`.\r\n\r\nEach section will be defined with an element containing the `section` class.\r\nThe active section by default will be the first section, which is taken as the home page.\r\n\r\nSections should be placed inside a wrapper (`<div id=\"fullpage\">` in this case). The wrapper can not be the `body` element.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"fullpage\">\r\n\t<div class=\"section\">Some section</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"section\">Some section</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"section\">Some section</div>\r\n\t<div class=\"section\">Some section</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to define a different starting point rather than the first section or the first slide of a section, just add the class `active` to the section and slide you want to load first.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"section active\">Some section</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn order to create a landscape slider within a section, each slide will be defined by default with an element containing the `slide` class:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\t<div class=\"slide\"> Slide 1 </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"slide\"> Slide 2 </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"slide\"> Slide 3 </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"slide\"> Slide 4 </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see a fully working example of the HTML structure in the [`simple.html` file](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/examples/simple.html).\r\n\r\n### Initialization\r\n\r\n#### Initialization with Vanilla Javascript\r\nAll you need to do is call fullPage.js before the closing `</body>` tag.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\r\n\t//options here\r\n\tautoScrolling:true,\r\n\tscrollHorizontally: true\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Initialization with jQuery\r\nYou can use fullpage.js as a jQuery plugin if you want to!\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$(document).ready(function() {\r\n\t$('#fullpage').fullpage({\r\n\t\t//options here\r\n\t\tautoScrolling:true,\r\n\t\tscrollHorizontally: true\r\n\t});\r\n\r\n\t// Example of how to use fullpage.js methods\r\n\t$.fn.fullpage.setAllowScrolling(false);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Vanilla JS example with all options\r\nA more complex initialization with all options set could look like this:\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\nvar myFullpage = new fullpage('#fullpage', {\r\n\t// Navigation\r\n\tmenu: '#menu',\r\n\tlockAnchors: false,\r\n\tanchors:['firstPage',

the sections (using the `anchors` option or the attribute `data-anchor` in each section), then you will be able to use anchor links also to navigate directly to a certain slide inside a section.\r\n\r\nThis would be an example of a link with an anchor: https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#secondPage/2 (which is the URL you will see once you access to that section/slide manually)\r\nNotice the last part of the URL ends in `#secondPage/2`.\r\n\r\nHaving the following initialization:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\r\n\tanchors:['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage']\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe anchor at the end of the URL `#secondPage/2` defines the section and slide of destination respectively. In the previous URL, the section of destination will be the one defined with the anchor `secondPage` and the slide will be the 2nd slide, as we are using the index `2` for it. (the fist slide of a section has index 0, as technically it is a section).\r\n\r\nWe could have used a custom anchor for the slide instead of its index if we would have used the attribute `data-anchor` on the HTML markup like so:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"section\">\r\n\t<div class=\"slide\" data-anchor=\"slide1\"> Slide 1 </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"slide\" data-anchor=\"slide2\"> Slide 2 </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"slide\" data-anchor=\"slide3\"> Slide 3 </div>\r\n\t<div class=\"slide\" data-anchor=\"slide4\"> Slide 4 </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nIn this last case, the URL we would use would be `#secondPage/slide3`, which is the equivalent to our previous `#secondPage/2`.\r\n\r\nNote that section anchors can also be defined in the same way, by using the `data-anchor` attribute, if no `anchors` array is provided.\r\n\r\n**Be careful!** `data-anchor` tags can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE).\r\n\r\n### Creating smaller or bigger sections\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/BKjRYm) fullPage.js provides a way to remove the full height restriction from its sections and slides. It is possible to create sections which height is smaller or bigger than the viewport. This is ideal for footers.\r\nIt is important to realise that it doesn't make sense to have all of your sections using this feature. If there is more than one section in the initial load of the site, fullPage.js won't scroll at all to see the next one as it will be already in the viewport.\r\n\r\nTo create smaller sections just use the class `fp-auto-height` in the section you want to apply it. It will then take the height defined by your section/slide content.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"section\">Whole viewport</div>\r\n<div class=\"section fp-auto-height\">Auto height</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Responsive auto height sections\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/MzByMa) A responsive auto height can be applied by using the class `fp-auto-height-responsive`. This way sections will be fullscreen until the responsive mode gets fired. Then they'll take the size required by their content, which could be bigger or smaller than the viewport.\r\n\r\n### State classes added by fullpage.js\r\nFullpage.js adds multiple classes in different elements to keep a record of the status of the site:\r\n\r\n- `active` is added the current visible section and slide.\r\n- `active` is added to the current menu element (if using the `menu` option).\r\n- A class of the form `fp-viewing-SECTION-SLIDE` is added to the `body` element of the site. (eg: [`fp-viewing-secondPage-0`](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/#secondPage)) The `SECTION` and `SLIDE` parts will be the anchors (or indexes if no anchor is provided) of the current section and slide.\r\n- `fp-responsive` is added to the `body` element when the entering in the responsive mode\r\n- `fp-enabled` is added to the `html` element when fullpage.js is enabled. (and removed when destroyed).\r\n- `fp-destroyed` is added to the fullpage.js container when fullPage.js is destroyed.\r\n\r\n### Lazy Loading\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/eNLBXo) fullPage.js provides a way to lazy load images, videos and audio elements so they won't slow down the loading of your site or unnecessarily waste data transfer.\r\nWhen using lazy loading, all these elements will only get loaded when entering in the viewport.\r\nTo enable lazy loading all you need to do is change your `src` attribute to `data-src` as shown below:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<img data-src=\"image.png\">\r\n<video>\r\n\t<source data-src=\"video.webm\" type=\"video/webm\" />\r\n\t<source data-src=\"video.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n</video>\r\n ```\r\n\r\nIf you already use another lazy load solution which uses `data-src` as well, you can disable the fullPage.js lazy loading by setting the option `lazyLoading: false`.\r\n\r\n### Auto play/pause embedded media\r\n\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/pXEaaK) **Note**: the autoplay feature might not work on some mobile devices depending on the OS and browser (i.e. [Safari on iOS](https://webkit.org/blog/6784/new-video-policies-for-ios/) version < 10.0).\r\n\r\n#### Play on section/slide load:\r\nUsing the attribute `autoplay` for videos or audio, or the param `autoplay=1` for youtube iframes will result in the media element playing on page load.\r\nIn order to play it on section/slide load use instead the attribute `data-autoplay`. For example:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<audio data-autoplay>\r\n\t<source src=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/horse.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\">\r\n</audio>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Pause on leave\r\nEmbedded HTML5 `<video>` / `<audio>`  and Youtube iframes are automatically paused when you navigate away from a section or slide. This can be disabled by using the attribute `data-keepplaying`. For example:\r\n```html\r\n<audio data-keepplaying>\r\n\t<source src=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/horse.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\">\r\n</audio>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Use extensions\r\nfullpage.js [provides a set of extensions](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/) you can use to enhance its default features. All of them are listed as [fullpage.js options](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#options).\r\n\r\nExtensions requires you to use the minified file [`fullpage.extensions.min.js`](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/blob/master/dist/fullpage.extensions.min.js) that is inside the [`dist` folder](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/tree/master/dist) instead of the usual fullPage.js file (`fullpage.js` or `fullpage.min.js`).\r\n\r\nOnce you acquire the extension file, you will need to add it before fullPage. For example, if I want to use the Continuous Horizontal extension, I would have include the extension file and then the extensions version of the fullPage file.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"fullpage.continuousHorizontal.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"fullpage/fullpage.extensions.min.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn activation key and a license key will be required for each extension. [See more details about it here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/How-to-activate-a-fullPage.js-extension).\r\n\r\nThen you will be able to use and configure them as explained in [options](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#options).\r\n\r\n## Options\r\n\r\n### licenseKey\r\n \r\n(default `null`). **This option is compulsory.** If you use fullPage in a non open source project, then you should use the license key provided on the purchase of the fullPage Commercial License. If your project is open source and it is compatible with the GPLv3 license you can [request a license key](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/requestKey.html). Please read more about licenses [here](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#license) and [on the website](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/pricing/). Example of usage:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\r\n\tlicenseKey: 'YOUR_KEY_HERE'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### controlArrows\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Determines whether to use control arrows for the slides to move right or left.\r\n\r\n### controlArrowsHTML\r\n\r\n(default `['<div class=\"fp-arrow\"></div>', '<div class=\"fp-arrow\"></div>'],`).\r\nProvides a way to define the HTML structure and the classes that you want to apply to the control arrows for sections with horizontal slides. The array contains the structure for both arrows. The first item is the left arrow and the second, the right one.\r\n\r\n### verticalCentered\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Vertically centering of the content using flexbox. You might want to wrap your content in a `div` to avoid potential issues. (Uses `flex-direction: column; display: flex; justify-content: center;`)\r\n\r\n### scrollingSpeed\r\n\r\n(default `700`) Speed in milliseconds for the scrolling transitions.\r\n\r\n### sectionsColor\r\n\r\n(default `none`) Define the CSS `background-color` property for each section.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\r\n\tsectionsColor: ['#f2f2f2', '#4BBFC3', '#7BAABE', 'whitesmoke', '#000'],\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### anchors\r\n\r\n(default `[]`) Defines the anchor links (#example) to be shown on the URL for each section. Anchors value should be unique. The position of the anchors in the array will define to which sections the anchor is applied. (second position for second section and so on). Using anchors forward and backward navigation will also be possible through the browser. This option also allows users to bookmark a specific section or slide. **Be careful!** anchors can not have the same value as any ID element on the site (or NAME element for IE).\r\nNow anchors can be defined directly in the HTML structure by using the attribute `data-anchor` as explained here.\r\n\r\n### lockAnchors\r\n\r\n(default `false`) Determines whether anchors in the URL will have any effect at all in the library. You can still using anchors internally for your own functions and callbacks, but they won't have any effect in the scrolling of the site. Useful if you want to combine fullPage.js with other plugins using anchor in the URL.\r\n\r\n### easing\r\n\r\n(default `easeInOutCubic`) Defines the transition effect to use for the vertical and horizontal scrolling.\r\nIt requires the file `vendors/easings.min.js` or [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/) for using some of [its transitions](https://api.jqueryui.com/easings/). Other libraries could be used instead.\r\n\r\n### easingcss3\r\n\r\n(default `ease`) Defines the transition effect to use in case of using `css3:true`. You can use the [pre-defined ones](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_transition-timing-function.asp) (such as `linear`, `ease-out`...) or create your own ones using the `cubic-bezier` function. You might want to use [Matthew Lein CSS Easing Animation Tool](https://matthewlein.com/ceaser/) for it.\r\n\r\n### loopTop\r\n\r\n(default `false`) Defines whether scrolling up in the first section should scroll to the last one or not.\r\n\r\n### loopBottom\r\n\r\n(default `false`) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll to the first one or not.\r\n\r\n### loopHorizontal\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Defines whether horizontal sliders will loop after reaching the last or previous slide or not.\r\n\r\n### css3\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Defines whether to use JavaScript or CSS3 transforms to scroll within sections and slides. Useful to speed up the movement in tablet and mobile devices with browsers supporting CSS3. If this option is set to `true` and the browser doesn't support CSS3, a fallback will be used instead.\r\n\r\n### autoScrolling\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Defines whether to use the \"automatic\" scrolling or the \"normal\" one. It also has affects the way the sections fit in the browser/device window in tablets and mobile phones.\r\n\r\n### fitToSection\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Determines whether or not to fit sections to the viewport or not. When set to `true` the current active section will always fill the whole viewport. Otherwise the user will be free to stop in the middle of a section.\r\n\r\n### fitToSectionDelay\r\n\r\n(default 1000) If `fitToSection` is set to true, this delays the fitting by the configured milliseconds.\r\n\r\n### scrollBar\r\n\r\n(default `false`) Determines whether to use scroll bar for the **vertical sections** on site or not. In case of using scroll bar, the `autoScrolling` functionality will still work as expected. The user will also be free to scroll the site with the scroll bar and fullPage.js will fit the section in the screen when scrolling finishes.\r\n\r\n### paddingTop\r\n\r\n(default `0`) Defines the top padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingTop: '10px', paddingTop: '10em'...) Useful in case of using a fixed header.\r\n\r\n### paddingBottom\r\n\r\n(default `0`) Defines the bottom padding for each section with a numerical value and its measure (paddingBottom: '10px', paddingBottom: '10em'...). Useful in case of using a fixed footer.\r\n\r\n### fixedElements\r\n\r\n(default `null`) Defines which elements will be taken off the scrolling structure of the plugin which is necessary when using the `css3` option to keep them fixed. It requires a string with the Javascript selectors for those elements. (For example: `fixedElements: '#element1, .element2'`)\r\n\r\n### normalScrollElements\r\n\r\n(default `null`) [Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/RmVazM) If you want to avoid the auto scroll when scrolling over some elements, this is the option you need to use. (useful for maps, scrolling divs etc.) It requires a string with the Javascript selectors for those elements. (For example: `normalScrollElements: '#element1, .element2'`). This option should not be applied to any section/slide element itself.\r\n\r\n### bigSectionsDestination\r\n\r\n(default `null`) [Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/vYLdMrx) Defines how to scroll to a section which height is bigger than the viewport and when not using `scrollOverflow:true`. (Read [how to create smaller or bigger sections](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#creating-smaller-or-bigger-sections)). By default fullPage.js scrolls to the top if you come from a section above the destination one and to the bottom if you come from a section below the destination one. Possible values are `top`, `bottom`, `null`.\r\n\r\n### keyboardScrolling\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Defines if the content can be navigated using the keyboard.\r\n\r\n### touchSensitivity\r\n\r\n(default `5`) Defines a percentage of the browsers window width/height, and how far a swipe must measure for navigating to the next section / slide\r\n\r\n### skipIntermediateItems\r\n\r\n(default `false`). Determines whether to skip the scroll animation when navigating between non-consecutive vertical sections or horizontal slides. The possible values are `true`, `false`, `sections`, and `slides`, allowing you to apply this behavior vertically, horizontally, or in both directions.\r\n\r\n### continuousVertical\r\n\r\n(default `false`) Defines whether scrolling down in the last section should scroll down to the first one and if scrolling1 up in the first section should scroll up to the last one. Not compatible with `loopTop`, `loopBottom` or any scroll bar present in the site (`scrollBar:true` or `autoScrolling:false`).\r\n\r\n### continuousHorizontal\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether sliding right in the last slide should slide right to the first one or not, and if scrolling left in the first slide should slide left to the last one or not. Not compatible with `loopHorizontal`. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### scrollHorizontally\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether to slide horizontally within sliders by using the mouse wheel or trackpad. It can only be used when using: `autoScrolling:true`. Ideal for story telling. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### interlockedSlides\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Determines whether moving one horizontal slider will force the sliding of sliders in other section in the same direction. Possible values are `true`, `false` or an array with the interlocked sections. For example `[1,3,5]` starting by 1. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### dragAndMove\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Enables or disables the dragging and flicking of sections and slides by using mouse or fingers. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1. Possible values are:\r\n  - `true`: enables the feature.\r\n  - `false`: disables the feature.\r\n  - `vertical`: enables the feature only vertically.\r\n  - `horizontal`: enables the feature only horizontally.\r\n  - `fingersonly`: enables the feature for touch devices only.\r\n  - `mouseonly`: enables the feature for desktop devices only (mouse and trackpad).\r\n\r\n### offsetSections\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Provides a way to use non full screen sections based on percentage. Ideal to show visitors there's more content in the site by showing part of the next or previous section. Requires fullPage.js >= 3.0.1.\r\nTo define the percentage of each section the attribute `data-percentage` must be used. The centering of the section in the viewport can be determined by using a boolean value in the attribute `data-centered` (default to `true` if not specified). For example:\r\n``` html\r\n<div class=\"section\" data-percentage=\"80\" data-centered=\"true\">\r\n```\r\n\r\n### resetSliders\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether or not to reset every slider after leaving its section. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### fadingEffect\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether to use a fading effect or not instead of the default scrolling one. Possible values are `true`, `false`, `sections`, `slides`. It can therefore be applied just vertically or horizontally, or to both at the time. It can only be used when using: `autoScrolling:true`. Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### animateAnchor\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Defines whether the load of the site when given an anchor (#) will scroll with animation to its destination or will directly load on the given section.\r\n\r\n### recordHistory\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Defines whether to push the state of the site to the browser's history. When set to `true` each section/slide of the site will act as a new page and the back and forward buttons of the browser will scroll the sections/slides to reach the previous or next state of the site. When set to `false`, the URL will keep changing but will have no effect on the browser's history. This option is automatically turned off when using `autoScrolling:false`.\r\n\r\n### menu\r\n\r\n(default `false`) A selector can be used to specify the menu to link with the sections. This way the scrolling of the sections will activate the corresponding element in the menu using the class `active`.\r\nThis won't generate a menu but will just add the `active` class to the element in the given menu with the corresponding anchor links.\r\nIn order to link the elements of the menu with the sections, an HTML 5 data-tag (`data-menuanchor`) will be needed to use with the same anchor links as used within the sections. Example:\r\n```html\r\n<ul id=\"myMenu\">\r\n\t<li data-menuanchor=\"firstPage\" class=\"active\"><a href=\"#firstPage\">First section</a></li>\r\n\t<li data-menuanchor=\"secondPage\"><a href=\"#secondPage\">Second section</a></li>\r\n\t<li data-menuanchor=\"thirdPage\"><a href=\"#thirdPage\">Third section</a></li>\r\n\t<li data-menuanchor=\"fourthPage\"><a href=\"#fourthPage\">Fourth section</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n```\r\n```javascript\r\nnew fullpage('#fullpage', {\r\n\tanchors: ['firstPage', 'secondPage', 'thirdPage', 'fourthPage', 'lastPage'],\r\n\tmenu: '#myMenu'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note:** the menu element should be placed outside the fullpage wrapper in order to avoid problem when using `css3:true`. Otherwise it will be appended to the `body` by the plugin itself.\r\n\r\n### navigation\r\n\r\n(default `false`) If set to `true`, it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles.\r\n\r\n### navigationPosition\r\n\r\n(default `none`) It can be set to `left` or `right` and defines which position the navigation bar will be shown (if using one).\r\n\r\n### navigationTooltips\r\n\r\n(default []) Defines the tooltips to show for the navigation circles in case they are being used. Example: `navigationTooltips: ['firstSlide', 'secondSlide']`. You can also define them by using the attribute `data-tooltip` in each section if you prefer.\r\n\r\n### showActiveTooltip\r\n\r\n(default `false`) Shows a persistent tooltip for the actively viewed section in the vertical navigation.\r\n\r\n### slidesNavigation\r\n\r\n(default `false`) If set to `true` it will show a navigation bar made up of small circles for each landscape slider on the site.\r\n\r\n### slidesNavPosition\r\n\r\n(default `bottom`) Defines the position for the landscape navigation bar for sliders. Admits `top` and `bottom` as values. You may want to modify the CSS styles to determine the distance from the top or bottom as well as any other style such as color.\r\n\r\n### scrollOverflow\r\n\r\n(default `true`) defines whether or not to create a scroll for the section/slide in case its content is bigger than the height of it. It requires the default value `scrollBar: false`. In order to prevent fullpage.js from creating the scrollbar in certain sections or slides use the class `fp-noscroll`. For example: `<div class=\"section fp-noscroll\">` You can also prevent scrolloverflow from getting applied on responsive mode when using `fp-auto-height-responsive` in the section element.\r\n\r\n### scrollOverflowReset\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Possible values are `true`, `false`, `sections`, `slides`. When set to `true` it scrolls up the content of the section/slide with a scroll bar when leaving to another section/slide. This way the section/slide will always show the start of its content even when scrolling from a section underneath it. Adding the class `fp-no-scrollOverflowReset` on the section or slide will disable this feature for that specific panel.\r\n\r\n### scrollOverflowMacStyle\r\n\r\n(default `false`) When active, this option will use a \"mac style\" for the scrollbar instead of the default one, which will look quite different in Windows computers.\r\n\r\n### sectionSelector\r\n\r\n(default `.section`) Defines the Javascript selector used for the plugin sections. It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.\r\n\r\n### slideSelector\r\n\r\n(default `.slide`) Defines the Javascript selector used for the plugin slides.  It might need to be changed sometimes to avoid problem with other plugins using the same selectors as fullpage.js.\r\n\r\n### responsiveWidth\r\n\r\n(default `0`) A normal scroll (`autoScrolling:false`) will be used under the defined width in pixels. A class `fp-responsive` is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's width is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.\r\n\r\n### responsiveHeight\r\n\r\n(default `0`) A normal scroll (`autoScrolling:false`) will be used under the defined height in pixels. A class `fp-responsive` is added to the body tag in case the user wants to use it for their own responsive CSS. For example, if set to 900, whenever the browser's height is less than 900 the plugin will scroll like a normal site.\r\n\r\n### responsiveSlides\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). When set to `true` slides will be turned into vertical sections when responsive mode is fired. (by using the `responsiveWidth` or `responsiveHeight` options detailed above). Requires fullpage.js >= 3.0.1.\r\n\r\n### parallax\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether or not to use the parallax backgrounds effects on sections / slides. Not compatible with `fp-auto-height` sections, `offsetSerctions` and `dragAndMove`.op [Read more about how to apply the parallax option](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/Extension---Parallax).\r\n\r\n### parallaxOptions\r\n\r\n(default: `{ type: 'reveal', percentage: 62, property: 'translate'}`).\r\n\r\nAllows to configure the parameters for the parallax backgrounds effect when using the option `parallax:true`. [Read more about how to apply the parallax option](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/Extension---Parallax).\r\n\r\n### dropEffect\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether or not to use the drop effect on sections / slides. [Read more about how to apply the drop effect option](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/Extension-Drop-Effect).\r\n\r\n### dropEffectOptions\r\n\r\n(default: `{ speed: 2300, color: '#F82F4D', zIndex: 9999}`). \r\n\r\nAllows to configure the parameters for the drop effect when using the option `dropEffect:true`.[Read more about how to apply the drop effect option](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/Extension-Drop-Effect).\r\n\r\n### waterEffect\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether or not to use the water effect on sections / slides. [Read more about how to apply the water effect option](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/Extension-Water-Effect).\r\n\r\n### waterEffectOptions\r\n\r\n(default: `{ animateContent: true, animateOnMouseMove: true}`). \r\n\r\nAllows to configure the parameters for the water effect when using the option `waterEffect:true`.[Read more about how to apply the water effect option](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/Extension-Water-Effect).\r\n\r\n### cards\r\n\r\n(default `false`) [Extension of fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/extensions/). Defines whether or not to use the cards effect on sections/slides. [Read more about how to apply the cards option](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js/wiki/Extension-Cards).\r\n\r\n### cardsOptions\r\n\r\n(default: `{ perspective: 100, fadeContent: true, fadeBackground: true}`).\r\n\r\nAllows you to configure the parameters for the cards effect when using the option `cards:true`.

If you want to use any other lazy loading library you can disable this fullpage.js feature.\r\n\r\n### lazyLoadThreshold\r\n(default `0`) Specifies the number of adjacent vertical sections and horizontal slides whose media elements should be lazy-loaded relative to the current one. Use a number to specify how many previous and next sections or slides should be preloaded.\r\n\r\n### observer\r\n\r\n(default `true`) Defines whether or not to observe changes in the HTML structure of the page. When enabled, fullPage.js will automatically react to those changes and update itself accordingly. Ideal when adding, removing or hidding sections or slides.\r\n\r\n### credits\r\n\r\n(default `{enabled: true, label: 'Made with fullpage.js', position: 'right'}`). \r\nDefines whether to use fullPage.js credits. As per clause 0, 4, 5 and 7 of the GPLv3 licecense, those using fullPage.js under the GPLv3 are required to give prominent notice that fullPage.js is in use. We recommend including attribution by keeping this option enabled.\r\n\r\n## Methods\r\nYou can see them in action [here](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/examples/methods.html)\r\n\r\n### getActiveSection()\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/VdpzRN/) Gets an Object (type [Section](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#callbacks)) containing the active section and its properties.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfullpage_api.getActiveSection();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### getActiveSlide()\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/VdpzRN/) Gets an Object (type [Slide](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#callbacks)) containing the active slide and its properties.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfullpage_api.getActiveSlide();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### getScrollY() & getScrollX\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/GRyGqro) `getScrollY` Gets the Y position of the fullPage wrapper. `getScrollX` gets the X position of the active horizontal slide.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfullpage_api.getScrollY();\r\nfullpage_api.getScrollX();\r\n```\r\n\r\n### moveSectionUp()\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/GJXNMN) Scrolls one section up:\r\n```javascript\r\nfullpage_api.moveSectionUp();\r\n```\r\n---\r\n### moveSectionDown()\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/jPvVZx) Scrolls one section down:\r\n```javascript\r\nfullpage_api.moveSectionDown();\r\n```\r\n---\r\n### moveTo(section, slide)\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/doqOmY) Scrolls the page to the given section and slide.

Note this won't disable the keyboard scrolling. You\r\nwould need to use `setKeyboardScrolling` for it.\r\n\r\n- `directions`: (optional parameter) Admitted values: `all`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` or a combination of them separated by commas like `down, right`. It defines the direction for which the scrolling will be enabled or disabled.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n\r\n//disabling scrolling\r\nfullpage_api.setAllowScrolling(false);\r\n\r\n//disabling scrolling down\r\nfullpage_api.setAllowScrolling(false, 'down');\r\n\r\n//disabling scrolling down and right\r\nfullpage_api.setAllowScrolling(false, 'down, right');\r\n```\r\n---\r\n### setKeyboardScrolling(boolean, [directions])\r\n[Demo](https://codepen.io/alvarotrigo/pen/GJXNwm) Adds or remove the possibility of scrolling through sections by using the keyboard (which is active by default).\r\n\r\n- `directions`: (optional parameter) Admitted values: `all`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` or a combination of them separated by commas like `down, right`.
