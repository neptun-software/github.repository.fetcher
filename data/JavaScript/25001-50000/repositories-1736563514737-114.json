          "content": "# About this CHANGELOG\n\nThis file will include all API breakage, new features, and upgrade info in\nlocalForage's lifetime.\n\n### [1.10.0](https://github.com/localForage/localForage/releases/tag/1.10.0)\n\n* Avoid uncaught error in `dropInstance`. You can now catch errors thrown by `dropInstance`, see #807.\n\n### [1.9.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.9.0)\n\n* Fixed TypeScript definition for `getItem`. It now notes that `getItem` can return `null`, so this change may cause TypeScript code that didn't account for `null` values to fail. See #980.\n\n### [1.8.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.8.1)\n\n* Reverted the ESM/`module` field change in #940, which broke many builds. See: #979. Sorry about that! ðŸ˜“\n\n### [1.8.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.8.0)\n\n* No changes to code, but added a `module` field in `package.json` for better ESM support. See: #940.\n\n### [1.7.4](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.7.4)\n\n* Use `openKeyCursor` instead of `openCursor` for `key()` retrieval. Props to @MeMark2 for the fix, and thanks to @lincolnthree and @f for additional testing!\n\n### [1.7.3](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.7.3)\n\n* Add `.npmignore` file to reduce package size when installed via npm.\n\n### [1.6](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.6.0)\n\n* Add `dropInstance()` method to localforage.\n* Improve IDB driver reliability when a connection gets closed.\n\n### [1.5.7]\n\n* Fix IE8 localStorage support detection.\n\n### [1.5.6]\n\n* Upgrade lie to 3.1.1 to work with yarn.\n\n### [1.5.5]\n\n* Roll back dropInstance breaking change.\n\n### [1.5.4]\n\n* Set `null` as `undefined` (for Edge).\n\n### [1.5.3]\n\n* Check whether localStorage is actually usable.\n\n### [1.5.2]\n\n* Prevent some unnecessary logs when calling `createInstance()`.\n\n### [1.5.1]\n\n* Try to re-establish IDB connection after an InvalidStateError.\n* Added Generics to `iterate()` TS Typings.\n* Define custom drivers syncronously when `_support` isn't a function.\n* Use the custom driver API for internal drivers, which makes possible to override parts of their implementation.\n\n### [1.5](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.5.0)\n* **Major storage engine change for Safari**: We now use IndexedDB as the storage engine for Safari v10.1 (and above). This means that **pre-existing Safari** `>= 10.1` users will experience \"data loss\" **after upgrading your site from a previous version of localForage to v1.5**. In fact no data is lost but the engine will change so localForage will seem empty.\n  * You can use the [localForage 1.4 compatibility plugin](https://github.com/localForage/localForage-compatibility-1-4) after the upgrade so that all your Safari users (both old & new) continue to use the WebSQL driver.\n  * Alternativelly you can force a connection to WebSQL using [localForage's config](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/#settings-api-setdriver) to either keep using your existing WebSQL database or migrate to IndexedDB.\n\n### [1.4.2](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.4.2)\n* Fixes #562.\n\n### [1.4.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.4.1)\n* Fixes #520; browserify builds work properly\n\n### [1.4](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.4.0)\n* Fixes #516; this version should always load the correct driver without that bug.\n\n### [1.3](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.3.0)\n* We now use ES6 for our source code and `webpack` to bundle the `dist/` files.\n\n### [1.2](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.2.0)\n* Iterate through the entire database using `iterate()`. ([#283](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/283); fixes [#186](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/186))\n\n### [1.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.1.0)\n* Custom drivers can be created using `defineDriver()`. ([#282](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/282); fixes [#267](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/267))\n\n### [1.0.3](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.0.3)\n* `config()` accepts a new option: `driver`, so users can set the driver during config rather than using `setDriver()`. ([#273](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/273); fixes [#168](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/168))\n\n### [1.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.0.0)\n\n* It is no longer necessary to queue commands using `ready()` when using RequireJS. ([723cc94e06](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/commit/723cc94e06af4f5ba4c53fa65524ccd5f6c4432e))\n* `setDriver` now accepts an array of drivers to be used, in order of preference, instead of simply a string. The string option is still supported. (eg. now one can use `setDriver(['WebSQL', 'localStorage'])` instead of `setDriver('WebSQL')`)\n* node-style, error-first argument method signatures are used for callbacks. Promises don't use error-first method signatures; instead they supply an error to the promise's `reject()` function.\n\n### [0.9](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.9.1)\n\nThis release drops support for some legacy browsers, though not actually the\nones you might think. localForage's new policy is to support the current\nversion of all major browsers plus up to three versions back.\n\n* Add built versions without the Promises polyfill to `dist/` directory. ([#172](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/172))\n* **Drop support for Firefox 3.5. Minimum version is now Firefox 25.** (Technically, Firefox 4+ seems to work.)\n* **Drop support for Chrome 31 and below. Minimum version is now Chrome 32.**\n* Fix a **lot** of bugs. Especially in Internet Exploder.\n* Switch to Mocha tests and test on [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).\n* Add a `keys()` method. ([#180](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/180))\n* Check for localStorage instead of assuming it's available. ([#183](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/183))\n\n### [Version 0.8](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.8.1)\n\n* Add support for web workers. ([#144](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/144), [#147](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/147)).\n\n### [Version 0.6.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.6.1)\n\n* Put built versions back in `dist/` directory.\n\n### [Version 0.6.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.6.0)\n\n* Add `localforage.config`. ([#40](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/140))\n* Fix iFrame bug in WebKit. ([#78](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/issues/78))\n* Improve error handling. ([#60](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/issues/60))\n* Remove support for `window.localForageConfig`. ([#135](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/issues/135))\n\n### [Version 0.4](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.4.0)\n\n* Built versions of localForage are now in the top-level directory. ([2d11c90](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/commit/2d11c90))\n\n### [Version 0.3](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.3.0)\n\n* Check code quality in test suite ([#124](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/124))\n* `_initDriver()` is called after first public API call ([#119](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/119))\n\n### [Version 0.2.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.2.1)\n\n* Allow configuration of WebSQL DB size ([commit](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/commit/6e78fff51a23e729206a03e5b750e959d8610f8c))\n* Use bower for JS dependencies instead of `vendor/` folder ([#109](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/109))\n\n### [Version 0.2.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.2.0)\n\n* Add support for ArrayBuffer, Blob, and TypedArrays ([#54](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/54), [#73](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/73))\n\n### [Version 0.1.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.1.1)\n\n* Added config options to allow users to set their own database names, etc. ([#100](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/100))\n\n---\n\n### March 16th, 2014\n\n* Moved Backbone adapter to its own repository ([b7987b3091855379d4908376b668b4b51a6fedfe](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/commit/b7987b3091855379d4908376b668b4b51a6fedfe))\n\n### March 13th, 2014\n\n* Changed `localforage.driver` to a function instead of the string directly ([49415145021b0029d2521182de6e338e048fe5b1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/commit/49415145021b0029d2521182de6e338e048fe5b1))\n\n### March 4th, 2014\n\n* Changed the IndexedDB database name from `asyncStorage` to `localforage` ([f4e0156a29969a79005ac27b303d7e321a720fc6](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/commit/f4e0156a29969a79005ac27b303d7e321a720fc6))\n"

Open source software (and thus all software) exists because\nof people like you. <3\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to localForage, it's as simple as opening a pull\nrequest on GitHub. After that someone will code review your work and either\nask you to fix any errors or merge the code into master. Here are a few tips:\n\n* **all drivers must have the same public API**: refer to [the API tests](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/blob/master/test/test.api.coffee) for how we ensure this, but simply put: all drivers should share the _exact same_ outward-facing API\n* **do your work on a feature branch**: this keeps things clean and easy\n* **try to rebase master into your branch**: this keeps the commit history clean and avoids merge commits inside feature branches\n* **write tests**: if you're adding new features, _please_ write tests; likewise, if you're fixing a bug that wasn't previously caught by a test, please add one\n* **run `grunt build` before you commit**: this will build out the files in the `dist/` folder and ensure your tests pass\n\nPlease commit changes at the top-level folder along with your changes in the\n`src/` folder--**do not make these changes separate commits**. These are the\nbuilt versions of `localforage.js` and `localforage.min.js`, which are\nused by bower.\n\nIf you have any questions, need some help, or anything else, don't feel shy!\nThe team behind this library is often available on IRC\n([irc.mozilla.org](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC) on the `#apps` channel).\n\n## Coding Style\n\nAll code can be tested for style by running the unit tests (`npm test`). This will make sure your code conforms to our styleguide. (You can read the rules in `.jshint` and `.jscsrc`.)\n\n## Features localForage will reject\n\n### node.js support\n\nlocalForage is a browser library with a specific focus on client-side,\noffline storage. It is not a general-purpose storage library and is not meant\nto allow for the same API on the client and the server. Implementing the\nlocalForage API wouldn't be hard (it's just localStorage with callbacks and\nES6 promises), but it's a job for another library.\n\n### Legacy browser support\n\nBasically this means anything before IE 8. I know there are hacky ways to\nsupport storage with cookies or IE Userdata or whatever, but anything worse\nthan localStorage isn't worth investing into.\n"

See [the wiki for detailed compatibility info][supported browsers].\n\nTo use localForage, just drop a single JavaScript file into your page:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"localforage/dist/localforage.js\"></script>\n<script>localforage.getItem('something', myCallback);</script>\n```\nTry the [live example](http://codepen.io/thgreasi/pen/ojYKeE).\n\nDownload the [latest localForage from GitHub](https://github.com/localForage/localForage/releases/latest), or install with\n[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```bash\nnpm install localforage\n```\n\n[supported browsers]: https://github.com/localForage/localForage/wiki/Supported-Browsers-Platforms\n\n## Support\n\nLost? Need help? Try the\n[localForage API documentation](https://localforage.github.io/localForage). [localForage APIæ–‡æ¡£ä¹Ÿæœ‰ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆã€‚](https://localforage.docschina.org)\n\nIf you're having trouble using the library, running the tests, or want to contribute to localForage, please look through the [existing issues](https://github.com/localForage/localForage/issues) for your problem first before creating a new one. If you still need help, [feel free to file an issue](https://github.com/localForage/localForage/issues/new).\n\n# How to use localForage\n\n## Callbacks vs Promises\n\nBecause localForage uses async storage, it has an async API.\nIt's otherwise exactly the same as the\n[localStorage API](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/localstorage/).\n\nlocalForage has a dual API that allows you to either use Node-style callbacks\nor [Promises](https://www.promisejs.org/). If you are unsure which one is right for you, it's recommended to use Promises.\n\nHere's an example of the Node-style callback form:\n\n```js\nlocalforage.setItem('key', 'value', function (err) {\n  // if err is non-null, we got an error\n  localforage.getItem('key', function (err, value) {\n    // if err is non-null, we got an error. otherwise, value is the value\n  });\n});\n```\n\nAnd the Promise form:\n\n```js\nlocalforage.setItem('key', 'value').then(function () {\n  return localforage.getItem('key');\n}).then(function (value) {\n  // we got our value\n}).catch(function (err) {\n  // we got an error\n});\n```\n\nOr, use `async`/`await`:\n\n```js\ntry {\n    const value = await localforage.getItem('somekey');\n    // This code runs once the value has been loaded\n    // from the offline store.\n    console.log(value);\n} catch (err) {\n    // This code runs if there were any errors.\n    console.log(err);\n}\n```\n\nFor more examples, please visit [the API docs](https://localforage.github.io/localForage).\n\n## Storing Blobs, TypedArrays, and other JS objects\n\nYou can store any type in localForage; you aren't limited to strings like in\nlocalStorage. Even if localStorage is your storage backend, localForage\nautomatically does `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` when getting/setting\nvalues.\n\nlocalForage supports storing all native JS objects that can be serialized to\nJSON, as well as ArrayBuffers, Blobs, and TypedArrays. Check the\n[API docs][api] for a full list of types supported by localForage.\n\nAll types are supported in every storage backend, though storage limits in\nlocalStorage make storing many large Blobs impossible.\n\n[api]: https://localforage.github.io/localForage/#data-api-setitem\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can set database information with the `config()` method.\nAvailable options are `driver`, `name`, `storeName`, `version`, `size`, and\n`description`.\n\nExample:\n```javascript\nlocalforage.config({\n    driver      : localforage.WEBSQL, // Force WebSQL; same as using setDriver()\n    name        : 'myApp',\n    version     : 1.0,\n    size        : 4980736, // Size of database, in bytes. WebSQL-only for now.\n    storeName   : 'keyvaluepairs', // Should be alphanumeric, with underscores.\n    description : 'some description'\n});\n```\n\n**Note:** you must call `config()` _before_ you interact with your data. This\nmeans calling `config()` before using `getItem()`, `setItem()`, `removeItem()`,\n`clear()`, `key()`, `keys()` or `length()`.\n\n## Multiple instances\n\nYou can create multiple instances of localForage that point to different stores\nusing `createInstance`. All the configuration options used by\n[`config`](#configuration) are supported.\n\n``` javascript\nvar store = localforage.createInstance({\n  name: \"nameHere\"\n});\n\nvar otherStore = localforage.createInstance({\n  name: \"otherName\"\n});\n\n// Setting the key on one of these doesn't affect the other.\nstore.setItem(\"key\", \"value\");\notherStore.setItem(\"key\", \"value2\");\n```\n\n## RequireJS\n\nYou can use localForage with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):\n\n```javascript\ndefine(['localforage'], function(localforage) {\n    // As a callback:\n    localforage.setItem('mykey', 'myvalue', console.log);\n\n    // With a Promise:\n    localforage.setItem('mykey', 'myvalue').then(console.log);\n});\n```\n\n## TypeScript\n\nIf you have the [`allowSyntheticDefaultImports` compiler option](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) set to `true` in your [tsconfig.json](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html) (supported in TypeScript v1.8+), you should use:\n\n```javascript\nimport localForage from \"localforage\";\n```\n\nOtherwise you should use one of the following:\n\n```javascript\nimport * as localForage from \"localforage\";\n// or, in case that the typescript version that you are using\n// doesn't support ES6 style imports for UMD modules like localForage\nimport localForage = require(\"localforage\");\n```\n\n## Framework Support\n\nIf you use a framework listed, there's a localForage storage driver for the\nmodels in your framework so you can store data offline with localForage. We\nhave drivers for the following frameworks:\n\n* [AngularJS](https://github.com/ocombe/angular-localForage)\n* [Angular 4 and up](https://github.com/Alorel/ngforage/)\n* [Backbone](https://github.com/localForage/localForage-backbone)\n* [Ember](https://github.com/genkgo/ember-localforage-adapter)\n* [Vue](https://github.com/dmlzj/vlf)\n* [NuxtJS](https://github.com/nuxt-community/localforage-module)\n\nIf you have a driver you'd like listed, please\n[open an issue](https://github.com/localForage/localForage/issues/new) to have it\nadded to this list.\n\n## Custom Drivers\n\nYou can create your own driver if you want; see the\n[`defineDriver`](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/#driver-api-definedriver) API docs.\n\nThere is a [list of custom drivers on the wiki][custom drivers].\n\n[custom drivers]: https://github.com/localForage/localForage/wiki/Custom-Drivers\n\n# Working on localForage\n\nYou'll need [node/npm](http://nodejs.org/) and\n[bower](http://bower.io/#installing-bower).\n\nTo work on localForage, you should start by\n[forking it](https://github.com/localForage/localForage/fork) and installing its\ndependencies. Replace `USERNAME` with your GitHub username and run the\nfollowing:\n\n```bash\n# Install bower globally if you don't have it:\nnpm install -g bower\n\n# Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username:\ngit clone git@github.com:USERNAME/localForage.git\ncd localForage\nnpm install\nbower install\n```\n\nOmitting the bower dependencies will cause the tests to fail!\n\n## Running Tests\n\nYou need PhantomJS installed to run local tests. Run `npm test` (or,\ndirectly: `grunt test`). Your code must also pass the\n[linter](http://jshint.com/).\n\nlocalForage is designed to run in the browser, so the tests explicitly require\na browser environment. Local tests are run on a headless WebKit (using\n[PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org)).\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, tests will be run against all browsers that\nlocalForage supports on Travis CI using [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/).\n\n## Library Size\nAs of version 1.7.3 the payload added to your app is rather small. Served using gzip compression, localForage will add less than 10k to your total bundle size:\n\n<dl>\n  <dt>minified</dt><dd>`~29kB`</dd>\n  <dt>gzipped</dt><dd>`~8.8kB`</dd>\n  <dt>brotli'd</dt><dd>`~7.8kB`</dd>\n</dl>\n\n# License\n\nThis program is free software; it is distributed under an\n[Apache License](https://github.com/localForage/localForage/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n---\n\nCopyright (c) 2013-2016 [Mozilla](https://mozilla.org)\n([Contributors](https://github.com/localForage/localForage/graphs/contributors)).\n"
