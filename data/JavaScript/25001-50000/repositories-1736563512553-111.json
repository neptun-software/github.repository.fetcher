          "content": "# High-level architecture\n\n## Rollup packages\n\n- The [`rollup`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rollup) npm package contains both Rollup's Node.js JavaScript interface and the command-line-interface (CLI).\n- There is a separate browser build available as [`@rollup/browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/browser). It exposes the same JavaScript interface as the Node.js build but does not include the CLI and also requires writing a plugin to encapsulate file reading. Instead of native code dependencies, this build has a bundled WASM artifact included that can be loaded in the browser. This is what the [Rollup REPL](https://rollupjs.org/repl) uses.\n- For every supported platform-architecture combination, there is a separate package containing the native code. These are not listed in the committed `package.json` file but are added dynamically during publishing as `optionalDependencies`. The `README.md` and `package.json` files for those dependencies can be found in the [`npm`](npm) folder. The corresponding binaries are built and published from [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/build-and-tests.yml) whenever a new release version tag is pushed. The actual loading of the native code is handled by [`native.js`](native.js) which is copied into the output folder during build. So to add a new platform-architecture combination, you need to\n  - add a new package in the `npm` folder\n  - update the `native.js` file\n  - add the corresponding triple to the [`package.json`](package.json) file as napi-rs depends on this\n  - extend the [GitHub Actions workflow](.github/workflows/build-and-tests.yml) to build the new package\n- There is also a separate `@rollup/wasm-node` package that is identical to the `rollup` package in that it contains the Node.js JavaScript interface and the CLI but does not contain any native code. Instead, it includes a WebAssembly artifact that runs in Node.js. This package and the corresponding artifact only built on GitHub Actions and published via the [`publish-wasm-node-package.js`](scripts/publish-wasm-node-package.js) script.\n\n## Building Rollup\n\n### JavaScript interface and CLI\n\n- The [`rollup.config.ts`](rollup.config.ts) orchestrates building the ESM and CommonJS versions of the JavaScript interface, the CLI, which is an extension of and shares code with the CommonJS build, and the browser build.\n  - `npm run build:js` builds all JavaScript artifacts. However, as it includes the browser build, it requires the browser Web Assembly artifact to be built first, otherwise the build will fail.\n- The JavaScript interface contains the core logic.\n  - It is mostly environment agnostic.\n    - To achieve full environment independence in the browser build, [`replace-browser-modules.ts`](build-plugins/replace-browser-modules.ts) replaces some modules with modified browser versions that reside in the [`browser` folder](browser).\n    - The most prominent difference is the fact that there is no fallback logic for the `resolveId` and `load` plugin hooks. If there is no plugin implementing those hooks for a file, the browser build will fail.\n  - The entry point for the Node.js build is [`node-entry.ts`](src/node-entry.ts) while the browser build uses [`browser-entry.ts`](src/browser-entry.ts). Those are mostly identical except that the browser build does not expose the watch mode interface.\n- The CLI is a wrapper around the JavaScript interface.\n  - It resides in the [`cli` folder](cli) with the entry point [cli.ts](cli/cli.ts).\n  - The logic to read configuration files resides in [loadConfigFile.ts](cli/run/loadConfigFile.ts) and is exposed as a separate export via `import { loadConfigFile } from \"rollup/loadConfigFile\"`.\n  - Only the CLI is able to handle arrays of configurations. Those are handled sequentially in [`run/index.ts`](cli/run/index.ts).\n  - The CLI handles several CLI-only options that are specific to the Node.js environment like setting environment variables or handling std-in, see [Command line flags](docs/command-line-interface/index.md#command-line-flags).\n\n### Native code and Web Assembly\n\nThe `rollup` package relies on optional dependencies to provide platform-specific native code. These are not listed in the committed `package.json` file but are added dynamically during publishing. This logic is handled by [`napi-rs`](https://napi.rs) via `npm run prepublish:napi` from [`scripts/prepublish.js`](scripts/prepublish.js).\n\nAs native modules do not work for the browser build, we use [`wasmpack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/) to build a WebAssembly artefact. This is triggered from `npm run build` via `npm run build:wasm`. There is also a separate Node wasm build that is again triggered from GitHub actions via `npm run build:wasm:node`.\n\nFrom JavaScript, native code is imported by importing [`native.js`](native.js). This module, or its WebAssembly version [`native.wasm.js`](native.wasm.js), is [copied](build-plugins/emit-native-entry.ts) as `native.js` into the output folder during build (via [`publish-wasm-node-package.js`](scripts/publish-wasm-node-package.js) for WebAssembly). Imports of this module are [declared external](build-plugins/external-native-import.ts).\n\nThe Rust entrypoints are [`bindings_napi/src/lib.rs`](rust/bindings_napi/src/lib.rs) for the native modules and [`bindings_wasm/src/lib.rs`](rust/bindings_wasm/src/lib.rs) for WebAssembly.\n\n## The build and generate phases\n\nBuilding an output has two phases\n\n- The \"build\" phase builds a module graph from the input files and decides, which code should be included in the output\n  - It is triggered by calling the `rollup(inputOptions)` function exported by the JavaScript interface\n  - It returns a \"bundle\" object that has `generate` and `write` methods\n- The \"generate\" phase generates the output files from the bundle by calling `.generate(outputOptions)` or `.write(outputOptions)`\n  - The main difference is that `.write` will write the files to disk while `.generate` just returns the output in-memory. Hence `.write` requires the [`file`](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-file) or [`dir`](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-dir) options to be set while `.generate` does not.\n  - It is possible to generate multiple outputs from the same bundle e.g. with different formats\n  - As code-splitting is also part of the \"generate\" phase, outputs can also use [`preserveModules`](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-preservemodules) to keep the file structure or [`inlineDynamicImports`](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-inlinedynamicimports) to inline dynamic imports, albeit at the cost of some semantic changes.\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart LR\n    classDef default fill: transparent, color: black;\n    classDef graphobject fill: #ffb3b3, stroke: black;\n    classDef command fill: #ffd2b3, stroke: black, text-align: left;\n    build(\"rollup\\n<code>input: main.js</code>\"):::command\n    --> bundle(bundle):::command\n    --> generate1(\".generate\\n<code>file: main.mjs,\\nformat: 'es'</code>\"):::command\n\n    bundle\n    -->generate2(\".generate\\n<code>file: main.cjs,\\nformat: 'cjs'</code>\"):::command\n```\n\nOn the highest level, all of this is orchestrated by the `rollupInternal` function in [`rollup.ts`](src/rollup/rollup.ts). This function\n\n- Parses and normalizes the input options via [`normalizeInputOptions`](src/utils/options/normalizeInputOptions.ts)\n- Initializes the [`Graph`](src/Graph.ts) instance\n- Triggers the actual build phase via `Graph.build()`\n- Generates the \"bundle\" object with the `.generate` and `.write` methods\n- These methods in turn first parse and normalize the output options via [`normalizeOutputOptions`](src/utils/options/normalizeOutputOptions.ts)\n- Then they create a [`Bundle`](src/Bundle.ts) instance that manages one output\n- Last, they trigger the actual generate phase via `Bundle.generate()`\n\n### The build phase\n\nTo understand this phase from a plugin perspective, have a look at [Build Hooks](https://rollupjs.org/plugin-development/#build-hooks), which also contains a graph to show in which order these hooks are executed. In detail, `Graph.build` performs the following steps\n\n- It generates the module graph. This is orchestrated by the [`ModuleLoader`](src/ModuleLoader.ts) class. This class\n  - Reads all entry points provided by the [`input`](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#input) option and additional entry points emitted from plugins via [`this.emitFile()`](https://rollupjs.org/plugin-development/#this-emitfile).\n  - For each module, it first creates a [`Module`](src/Module.ts) instance.\n  - Then it loads and transforms the code via the corresponding plugin hooks.\n  - The resulting code and sourcemaps are passed to the `Module` instance via `Module.setSource()`.\n  - This parses the code into the Rollup AST, which consists of the classes defined in the [ast folder](src/ast/nodes). For details see also [below](#parsing-the-ast).\n  - In the process, it also collects all static and dynamic dependencies of the module.\n  - These are then again loaded and transformed by the `ModuleLoader`, a process that repeats until the graph is complete.\n- It sorts the modules by their execution order to assign an `execIndex` to each module in [`executionOrder.ts`](src/utils/executionOrder.ts).\n- It marks which statements in each module are included in the output, also known as \"tree-shaking\"\n  - This happens in several passes. Each pass starts with calling `.include` on the `Module` instance.\n  - This again calls `.include` on the top-level AST node, that is then propagated to the child nodes. At several stages, inclusion will only happen if a statement or expression has \"side effects\", which is determined by calling its `.hasEffects` method. Usually, it means mutating a variable that is already included or performing an action where we cannot determine whether there are side effects like calling a global function.\n  - Nodes that are already included are included again for each pass as it is possible that with each pass, some additional child nodes may need to be included. Whenever something new is included, another pass will be scheduled once the current pass is finished.\n  - In the end, it sets `.included` flags on the AST nodes that are then picked up by the rendering logic in the \"generate\" phase.\n\n### The generate phase\n\nTo understand this phase from a plugin perspective, have a look at [Output Generation Hooks](https://rollupjs.org/plugin-development/#output-generation-hooks), which again contains a graph to show in which order these hooks are executed. In detail `Bundle.generate` performs the following steps\n\n- Assign modules to chunks via [`chunkAssignment.ts`](src/utils/chunkAssignment.ts)\n- Determine the exports for each chunk by tracing the included inter-module dependencies\n- Render the chunks, which is orchestrated by the [`renderChunks`](src/utils/renderChunks.ts) helper\n  - Render the chunks with placeholders for chunk hashes by calling `Chunk.render()`\n    - Determine how dynamic imports and `import.meta` references should be resolved and store this on the corresponding AST nodes.\n    - Determine the final deconflicted variable names and store those on the AST nodes as well in [`deconflictChunk.ts`](src/utils/deconflictChunk.ts)\n    - Render each module by calling the `.render` methods of their AST nodes. This is also where tree-shaken nodes are removed from the output.\n    - Render the format specific wrapper with imports and exports for this chunk by calling the corresponding [finaliser](src/finalisers).\n  - Transform the rendered chunks via the [`renderChunk`](https://rollupjs.org/plugin-development/#renderchunk) plugin hook\n  - Determine the final chunk hashes based on the actual rendered content and the chunk dependency graph and replace the placeholders\n\n## Parsing the AST\n\nRollup parses code within the native/WebAssembly code. As most of Rollup is still TypeScript-based, this then needs to be transformed to a JavaScript representation. To do that efficiently, a binary buffer is constructed in Rust that can be passed without copying to TypeScript where it is further transformed.\n\n- The conversion to a buffer happens mostly within [`converter.rs`](rust/parse_ast/src/convert_ast/converter.rs). Here we also make sure that the buffer follows the format of the [ESTree specification](https://github.com/estree/estree).\n- While the converter is still mostly hand-written, it relies on auto-generated constants to ensure that the encoder and decoder match. These are generated together with the decoders from [`generate-ast-converters.js`](scripts/generate-ast-converters.js) via `npm run build:ast-converters`. The definitions for the auto-generated converters can be found in [`ast-types.js`](scripts/ast-types.js), which is also the first file that needs to be extended to support additional AST nodes.\n\nThere are two ways Rollup parses code into an abstract syntax tree\n\n- When a plugin calls [`this.parse`](https://rollupjs.org/plugin-development/#this-parse). This is a synchronous operation that returns a JSON-AST of the provided code.\n  - This will likely be deprecated eventually in favor of an asynchronous method that also does not directly return the JSON representation but rather a Proxy-based representation with efficient methods for traversal and manipulation.\n  - For this, the buffer is decoded within the auto-generated file [`bufferToAst.ts`](src/utils/bufferToAst.ts).\n- When a module has been loaded. In this case, it is triggered in the `setSource` method of the [`Module`](src/Module.ts) class.\n  - Here, the buffer is directly used to generate the class-based Rollup-internal AST.\n  - The actual conversion happens in the auto-generated file [`bufferParsers.ts`](src/ast/bufferParsers.ts).\n\nIn general, when extending the AST parsing capabilities, the following places need to be touched:\n\n- declare any new AST nodes or additional AST attributes in [`ast-types.js`](scripts/ast-types.js).\n- write the encoder in Rust in [`converter.rs`](rust/parse_ast/src/convert_ast/converter.rs).\n- create the corresponding TypeScript classes in [`ast/nodes`](src/ast/nodes).\n"

BREAKING CHANGES\n\n#### General Changes\n\n- The minimal required Node version is now 18.0.0 (#5142)\n- The browser build now relies on a WASM artifact that needs to be provided as well (#5073)\n- The NodeJS build now relies on an optional native binary; for unsupported platforms, users can use the `@rollup/wasm-node` package that has the same interface as Rollup but relies on WASM artifacts (#5073)\n- The `INVALID_IMPORT_ASSERTION` error code has been replaced with `INVALID_IMPORT_ATTRIBUTE` (#5073)\n- Rollup will now warn for `@__PURE__` and `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` annotations in invalid locations (#5165)\n- If an entry module starts with a shebang comment `#!...`, this comment will be prepended to the output for `es` and `cjs` formats (#5163)\n- File hashes will now use url-safe base64 encoded hashes (#5155)\n- The maximum hash length has been reduced to 22 characters (#5155)\n- The `RollupWarning` type has been removed in favor of the `RollupLog` type (#5147)\n\n#### Changes to Rollup Options\n\n- Acorn plugins are no longer supported, the `acornInjectPlugins` option has been removed (#5073)\n- The `acorn` option has been removed (#5073)\n- `output.externalImportAssertions` has been deprecated in favor of `output.externalImportAttributes` (#5073)\n- `inlineDynamicImports`, `manualChunks` and `preserveModules` have been removed on input option level: Please use the corresponding output options of the same names (#5143)\n- Removed output options (#5143):\n  - `output.experimentalDeepDynamicChunkOptimization`: This option is no longer needed as Rollup now always runs the full chunking algorithm\n  - `output.dynamicImportFunction`: Use the `renderDynamicImport` plugin hook instead\n  - `output.namespaceToStringTag`: Use `output.generatedCode.symbols` instead\n  - `output.preferConst`: Use `output.generatedCode.constBindings` instead\n\n#### Plugin API Changes\n\n- For `this.resolve`, the default of the `skipSelf` option is now `true` (#5142)\n- `this.parse` now only supports the `allowReturnOutsideFunction` option for now (#5073)\n- Import assertions now use the [new import attribute AST structure](https://github.com/estree/estree/blob/master/experimental/import-attributes.md) ( #5073)\n- \"assertions\" have been replaced with \"attributes\" in various places of the plugin interface (#5073)\n- If the import of a module id is handled by the `load` hook of a plugin, `rollup.watch` no longer watches the actual file if the module id corresponds to a real path; if this is intended, then the plugin is responsible for calling `this.addWatchFile` for any dependency files (#5150)\n- The normalized input options provided by `buildStart` and other hooks no longer contain an `onwarn` handler; plugins should use `onLog` instead (#5147)\n- `this.moduleIds` has been removed from the plugin context: Use `this.getModuleIds()` instead (#5143)\n- The `hasModuleSideEffects` flag has been removed from the `ModuleInfo` returned by `this.getModuleInfo()`: Use `moduleSideEffects` on the `ModuleInfo` instead (#5143)\n\n### Features\n\n- Improve parsing speed by switching to a native SWC-based parser (#5073)\n- Rollup will now warn for `@__PURE__` and `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` annotations in invalid locations (#5165)\n- The parser is now exposed as a separate export `parseAst` (#5169)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Rollup no longer tries to watch virtual files if their name corresponds to an actual file name; instead, plugins handle watching via `this.addWatchFile()` (#5150)\n\n###

Rollup now requires at least Node 14.18.0 to run (#4548 and #4596)\n- The browser build has been split into a separate package `@rollup/browser` (#4593)\n- The node build uses the `node:` prefix for imports of builtin modules (#4596)\n- Some previously deprecated features have been removed (#4552):\n  - Some plugin context functions have been removed:\n    - `this.emitAsset()`: use `this.emitFile()`\n    - `this.emitChunk()`: use `this.emitFile()`\n    - `this.getAssetFileName()`: use `this.getFileName()`\n    - `this.getChunkFileName()`: use `this.getFileName()`\n    - `this.isExternal()`: use `this.resolve()`\n    - `this.resolveId()`: use `this.resolve()`\n  - The `resolveAssetUrl` plugin hook has been removed: use `resolveFileUrl`\n  - Rollup no longer passes `assetReferenceId` or `chunkReferenceId` parameters to `resolveFileUrl`\n  - The `treeshake.pureExternalModules` option has been removed: use `treeshake.moduleSideEffects: 'no-external'`\n  - You may no longer use `true` or `false` for `output.interop`. As a replacement for `true`, you can use \"compat\"\n  - Emitted assets no longer have an `isAsset` flag in the bundle\n  - Rollup will no longer fix assets added directly to the bundle by adding the `type: \"asset\"` field\n- Some features that were previously marked for deprecation now show warnings when used (#4552):\n  - Some options have been deprecated:\n    - `inlineDynamicImports` as part of the input options: use `output. inlineDynamicImports`\n    - `manualChunks` as part of the input options: use `output. manualChunks `\n    - `maxParallelFileReads`: use `maxParallelFileOps\n    - `output.preferConst`: use `output.generatedCode.constBindings`\n    - `output.dynamicImportFunction`: use the `renderDynamicImport` plugin hook\n    - `output.namespaceToStringTag`: use `output.generatedCode.symbols`\n    - `preserveModules` as part of the input options: use `output. preserveModules `\n  - You should no longer access `this.moduleIds` in plugins: use `this.getModuleIds()`\n  - You should no longer access `this.getModuleInfo(...).hasModuleSideEffects` in plugins: use `this.getModuleInfo(...).moduleSideEffects`\n- Configuration files are only bundled if either the `--configPlugin` or the `--bundleConfigAsCjs` options are used. The configuration is bundled to an ES module unless the `--bundleConfigAsCjs` option is used. In all other cases, configuration is now loaded using Node's native mechanisms (#4574 and #4621)\n- The properties attached to some errors have been changed so that there are fewer different possible properties with consistent types (#4579)\n- Some errors have been replaced by others (ILLEGAL_NAMESPACE_REASSIGNMENT -> ILLEGAL_REASSIGNMENT, NON_EXISTENT_EXPORT -> MISSING_EXPORT) (#4579)\n- Files in `rollup/dist/*` can only be required using their file extension (#4581)\n- The `loadConfigFile` helper now has a named export of the same name instead of a default export (#4581)\n- When using the API and sourcemaps, sourcemap comments are contained in the emitted files and sourcemaps are emitted as regular assets (#4605)\n- Watch mode no longer uses Node's EventEmitter but a custom implementation that awaits Promises returned from event handlers (#4609)\n- Assets may only be deduplicated with previously emitted assets if their source is a `string` (#4644)\n- By default, Rollup will keep external dynamic imports as `import(…)` in commonjs output unless `output.dynamicImportInCjs` is set to false (#4647)\n\n#### Changes to Rollup Options\n\n- As functions passed to `output.banner/footer/intro/outro` are now called per-chunk, they should be careful to avoid performance-heavy operations (#4543)\n- `entryFileNames/chunkFileNames` functions now longer have access to the rendered module information via `modules`, only to a list of included `moduleIds` (#4543)\n- The path of a module is no longer prepended to the corresponding chunk when preserving modules (#4565)\n- When preserving modules, the `[name]` placeholder (as well as the `chunkInfo.name` property when using a function) now includes the relative path of the chunk as well as optionally the file extension if the extension is not one of `.js`, `.jsx`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.mts`, or `.cts` (#4565)\n- The `[ext]`, `[extName]` and `[assetExtName]` placeholders are no longer supported when preserving modules (#4565)\n- The `perf` option no longer collects timings for the asynchronous part of plugin hooks as the readings were wildly inaccurate and very misleading, and timings are adapted to the new hashing algorithm (#4566)\n- Change the default value of `makeAbsoluteExternalsRelative` to \"ifRelativeSource\" so that absolute external imports will no longer become relative imports in the output, while relative external imports will still be renormalized ( #4567)\n- Change the default for `output.generatedCode.reservedNamesAsProps` to no longer quote properties like `default` by default (#4568)\n- Change the default for `preserveEntrySignatures` to \"exports-only\" so that by default, empty facades for entry chunks are no longer created (#4576)\n- Change the default for `output.interop` to \"default\" to better align with NodeJS interop (#4611)\n- Change the default for `output.esModule` to \"if-default-prop\", which only adds \\_\\_esModule when the default export would be a property (#4611)\n- Change the default for `output.systemNullSetters` to `true`, which requires at least SystemJS 6.3.3 (#4649)\n\n#### Plugin API Changes\n\n- Plugins that add/change/remove imports or exports in `renderChunk` should make sure to update `ChunkInfo.imports/importedBindings/exports` accordingly (#4543)\n- The order of plugin hooks when generating output has changed (#4543)\n- Chunk information passed to `renderChunk` now contains names with hash placeholders instead of final names, which will be replaced when used in the returned code or `ChunkInfo.imports/importedBindings/exports` (#4543 and #4631)\n- Hooks defined in output plugins will now run after hooks defined in input plugins (used to be the other way around) ( #3846)\n\n### Features\n\n- Functions passed to `output.banner/footer/intro/outro` are now called per-chunk with some chunk information (#4543)\n- Plugins can access the entire chunk graph via an additional parameter in `renderChunk` (#4543)\n- Chunk hashes only depend on the actual content of the chunk and are otherwise stable against things like renamed/moved source files or changed module resolution order (#4543)\n- The length of generated file hashes can be customized both globally and per-chunk (#4543)\n- When preserving modules, the regular `entryFileNames` logic is used and the path is included in the `[name]` property. This finally gives full control over file names when preserving modules (#4565)\n- `output.entryFileNames` now also supports the `[hash]` placeholder when preserving modules (#4565)\n- The `perf` option will now collect (synchronous) timings for all plugin hooks, not just a small selection (#4566)\n- All errors thrown by Rollup have `name: RollupError` now to make clearer that those are custom error types (#4579)\n- Error properties that reference modules (such as id and ids) will now always contain the full ids. Only the error message will use shortened ids (#4579)\n- Errors that are thrown in response to other errors (e.g. parse errors thrown by acorn) will now use the standardized cause property to reference the original error (#4579)\n- If sourcemaps are enabled, files will contain the appropriate sourcemap comment in `generateBundle` and sourcemap files are available as regular assets (#4605)\n- Returning a Promise from an event handler attached to a RollupWatcher instance will make Rollup wait for the Promise to resolve (#4609)\n- There is a new value \"compat\" for output.interop that is similar to \"auto\" but uses duck-typing to determine if there is a default export (#4611)\n- There is a new value \"if-default-prop\" for esModule that only adds an `__esModule` marker to the bundle if there is a default export that is rendered as a property (#4611)\n- Rollup can statically resolve checks for `foo[Symbol.toStringTag]` to \"Module\" if foo is a namespace (#4611)\n- There is a new CLI option `--bundleConfigAsCjs` which will force the configuration to be bundled to CommonJS (#4621)\n- Import assertions for external imports that are present in the input files will be retained in ESM output (#4646)\n- Rollup will warn when a module is imported with conflicting import assertions (#4646)\n- Plugins can add, remove or change import assertions when resolving ids (#4646)\n- The `output.externalImportAssertions` option allows to turn off emission of import assertions (#4646)\n- Use `output.dynamicImportInCjs` to control if dynamic imports are emitted as `import(…)` or wrapped `require(…)` when generating commonjs output (#4647)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Chunk hashes take changes in `renderChunk`, e.g. minification, into account (#4543)\n- Hashes of referenced assets are properly reflected in the chunk hash (#4543)\n- No longer warn about implicitly using default export mode to not tempt users to switch to named export mode and break Node compatibility (#4624)\n- Avoid performance issues when emitting thousands of assets (#4644)\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n- [#3846](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3846): [v3.0] Run output plugins

[#3428](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3428): Fix conditional exports in Node 13.0 - 13.7 (@lukastaegert)\n\n## 2.0.0\n\n_2020-03-06_\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- Rollup now requires at least Node 10 to run, or a sufficiently modern browser (#3346)\n- The file structure of Rollup's ESM builds has changed:\n\n  - The main ESM entry point is now at `rollup/dist/es/rollup.js` instead of `rollup/dist/rollup.es.js`\n  - The ESM browser build is at `rollup/dist/es/rollup.browser.js` instead of `rollup/dist/rollup.browser.es.js`\n\n  In general, the ESM builds now follow the same naming scheme as the CJS builds but are located in the `rollup/dist/es` subfolder instead of `rollup/dist` (#3391)\n\n- The \"watch.chokidar\" option no longer accepts a `boolean` value but only an object of parameters that is passed to the bundled Chokidar instance. Chokidar installations by the user will be ignored in favour of the bundled instance ( #3331)\n- Modules that are completely tree-shaken will no longer be listed as part of any chunks in `generateBundle`\n- The `experimentalOptimizeChunks` and `chunkGroupingSize` options have been removed\n- [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) plugins can only be used if they accept a passed-in acorn instance instead of importing it themselves. See https://github.com/acornjs/acorn/pull/870#issuecomment-527339830 for what needs to be done to make plugins compatible that do not support this yet (#3391)\n- Emitted chunks now have the TypeScript type `Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`. A `Buffer` can still be used, though ( #3395)\n- The TypeScript types no longer use ESTree types for AST nodes but a very generic type that does not contain information specific to certain node types (#3395)\n- The signature of the `writeBundle` plugin hook has been changed to match `generateBundle`: The bundle object is now passed as second parameter instead of first and the first parameter is the output options (#3361)\n- The following plugin hooks have been removed:\n  - ongenerate: use `generateBundle` instead\n  - onwrite: use `writeBundle` instead\n  - transformBundle: use `renderChunk` instead\n  - transformChunk: use `renderChunk` instead\n- You can no longer access `this.watcher` on the plugin context.\n- The `transform` hook can no longer return `dependencies`.\n- The `treeshake.pureExternalModules` option will now show a deprecation warning when used: use `treeshake.moduleSideEffects: 'no-external'` instead\n- Using `import.meta.ROLLUP_ASSET_URL_<..>` and `import.meta.ROLLUP_CHUNK_URL_<..>` in code will now show warnings: use `import.meta.ROLLUP_FILE_URL_<..>` instead\n- The `resolveAssetUrl` hook will now show a deprecation warning when used: use `resolveFileUrl` instead\n- The following plugin context functions will show warnings when used:\n  - `this.emitAsset`: use `this.emitFile`\n  - `this.emitChunk`: use `this.emitFile`\n  - `this.getAssetFileName`: use `this.getFileName`\n  - `this.getChunkFileName`: use `this.getFileName`\n  - `this.isExternal`: use `this.resolve`\n  - `this.resolveId`: use `this.resolve`\n- Directly adding properties to the bundle object in the `generateBundle` is deprecated will show a warning (removing properties is allowed, though): Use `this.emitFile`\n- Accessing `chunk.isAsset` on the bundle is deprecated: Use `chunk.type === 'asset'` instead\n- The error code for a missing `name` property when targeting UMD has been changed to `MISSING_NAME_OPTION_FOR_IIFE_EXPORT` to emphasize this is needed for the IIFE part of UMD (#3393)\n\n### Features\n\n- Rollup now bundles [Chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) for a better watch experience (#3331)\n- Rollup now bundles [acorn](https://github.com/acornjs/acorn) again, removing its only external dependency (#3391)\n- Do not consider empty imports from side-effect-free modules for chunking and hoist side-effect imports if necessary ( #3369)\n- Rollup can now be imported as an ES module in Node via `import {rollup} from 'rollup'`. Note that this relies on Node's experimental [conditional package exports](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v13.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_conditional_exports) feature and is therefore itself experimental (#3391)\n- `systemjs` can be used as format alias for `system` (#3381)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Unknown output options now trigger a warning when using the JavaScript API (#3352)\n- Rollup will no longer introduce Node types into TypeScript projects that do not use them (#3395)\n- Generate correct sourcemaps when tree-shaking occurs in a multi-file bundle (#3423)\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n-

output as an array\n  - transform -> use plugin API\n  - useStrict -> output.strict\n- In general, output options can no longer be used as input options (#2409)\n- `bundle.generate` and `bundle.write` now return a new format (#2293)\n- Several plugin hooks have become deprecated and will display warnings when used (#2409):\n  - transformBundle\n  - transformChunk\n  - ongenerate\n  - onwrite\n- Plugin transform dependencies are deprecated in favour of using the `this.addWatchFile` plugin context function ( #2409)\n- Accessing `this.watcher` in plugin hooks is deprecated in favour of the `watchChange` plugin hook and the `this.addWatchFile` plugin context function (#2409)\n- Using dynamic import statements will by default create a new chunk unless `inlineDynamicImports` is used (#2293)\n- Rollup now uses acorn@6 which means that acorn plugins must be compatible with this version; acorn is now external for non-browser builds to make plugins work (#2293)\n\n### Features\n\n- The `--dir` ClI option can now be aliased as `-d` (#2293)\n- The `--input` option now supports named entry points via `=` (#2293)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Both the `--input` option as well as the default

Changes\n\n- `optimizeChunks` is renamed to `experimentalOptimizeChunks` to reflect this feature is not production-ready yet ( #2575)\n\n### Features\n\n- Plugins can iterate all module ids via `this.moduleIds` (#2565)\n- Plugins can get graph information about a module via `this.getModuleInfo(id)` (#2565)\n- Plugins and JS API users get more information about the generated chunks: `dynamicImports`, `facadeModuleId`, `isDynamicEntry`, `name` (#2575)\n- Tree-shaken dynamic imports will no longer create chunks or influence chunking in any way (#2575)\n- Dynamic imports will no longer follow the `entryFileNames` but the `chunkFileNames` property reflecting those are solely internally used (#2575)\n- If there are chunk naming conflicts, entry chunks will always take precedence (#2575)\n- If an entry facade is created, only the facade chunk is marked as `isEntry` (#2575)\n- Dynamic chunks will only be marked as `isEntry` if they are actually entry chunks as well; thus there is now a 1-to-1 correspondence between modules listed in `input` and chunks marked as `isEntry` (#2575)\n- Chunks no longer contain imports for variables that are tree-shaken in the chunk but used in other chunks (#2584)\n- Chunks will always import re-exported variables directly from the chunk where they are originally exported from ( #2584)\n- Null characters will be pruned from chunk ids to allow for virtually created chunks and make `rollup-plugin-multi-entry` compatible with code-splitting and thus the upcoming 1.0 version (#2590)\n- Simplify the UMD wrapper code as much as possible, especially if there are no exports (#2594)\n- The UMD wrapper will now work in strict mode by checking for `self` before `this` when determining the global variable (#2594)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- If a facade is created for a dynamic entry point, this facade will be imported instead of the facaded chunk (#2575)\n- Manual chunks that include multiple entry points will have proper facades created for all entry points if necessary ( #2575)\n- If missing exports are shimmed, the shim variable will not be global but created on a per-module basis and is deconflicted with variables having the same name (#2584)\n- Missing export shims work properly in SystemJS (#2584)\n- `preserveModules` now handles dynamic namespace imports (#2584)\n- Fix chunk execution order in certain scenarios (#2584)\n- Exports and assignments using destructuring syntax will properly update the exported variables when generating SystemJS output (#2587)\n- Hashes in chunk names will now also take dynamic imports into account (#2596)\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n- [#2565](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/2565): Provide module graph information on the plugin context ( @samccone)\n-

The returned `id` (which by default is a filepath) is passed to the `load` function, which can optionally be overridden, and which is applied to all modules including the entry module. This allows custom resolver and loading logic for integration with third party systems (e.g. JSPM) or, eventually, in-browser usage ([#30](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/30))\n- A statement cannot appear after later statements from the same bundle ([#34](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/34))\n- Tricky cyclical dependencies are handled ([#36](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/36))\n- `sourcemap` option is used by CLI (was omitted previously)\n\n## 0.8.3\n\n- Correctly rename functions that have arguments with the same name ([#32](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/32))\n- Ensure unused default exports are given a legal name ([#33](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/33))\n\n## 0.8.2\n\n- Support `moduleId` and `moduleName` via CLI ([#24](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/24))\n\n## 0.8.1\n\n- Anonymous functions that are exported as default are converted to named function declarations for correct hoisting, rather than being bound to functions ([#29](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/29))\n- Automatically-generated default export names are deconflicted with local definitions ([#29](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/29))\n\n## 0.8.0\n\n- Top-level variable declarations with multiple declarators are split up, to avoid unnecessary code importing and incorrectly-ordered statements ([#26](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/26))\n- `this` at the top level is `undefined` ([#28](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/28))\n\n## 0.7.8\n\n- Avoid using `path.parse` - unsupported in node 0.10\n\n## 0.7.7\n\n- Promise `source-map-support` from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` ([#23](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/23))\n\n## 0.7.6\n\n- Better placement of `export default` statements ([#21](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/21))\n- Prevent function calls and property assignments from being treated as rebinding for sake of unbound default exports\n- Add `--external foo,bar,baz` option to CLI (equivalent to `external: ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']`)\n- Add CLI tests\n\n## 0.7.5\n\n- Prevent accidental conflicts with the global namespace ([#20](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/20))\n\n## 0.7.4\n\n- More precise statement re-ordering to satisfy `export default` constraint (fixes bug introduced in 0.7.3)\n\n## 0.7.3\n\n- Default exports are not bound. To enable this, statements within a module are sorted to retain their original order ([#15](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/15))\n- Better positioning of comments ([#14](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/14))\n- Various fixes to get Travis-CI rigged up\n\n## 0.7.2\n\n- Fix sourcemap paths on Windows ([#6](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/6))\n\n## 0.7.1\n\n- Named functions can be used as default exports from a bundle\n- Method calls are assumed to mutate the owner (i.e. `foo.bar()` mutates `foo`) ([#13](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/13))\n- `options.indent` can be used to control indentation of resulting bundle. `options.true` (default) means ' auto', `options.false` means empty string. Alternatively specify whitespace e.g. `' '` or `'\\t'` ([#5](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues/5))\n\n## 0.7.0\n\n- Ensure statements are always separated by a newline ([#9](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/9))\n- Use CommonJS `exports` correctly (UMD exports)\n- Throw error if `moduleName` is required but missing (UMD exports)\n- Attach IIFE global to `this` rather than `window`\n- Allow names inside bundle to the the names of `Object.prototype` properties ([#12](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/12))\n- Keep exports live ([#11](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/11))\n\n## 0.6.5\n\n- Add sourceMappingURL comment to code, as appropriate\n- Higher resolution sourcemaps\n\n## 0.6.4\n\n- Fix CJS bundling with default export\n\n## 0.6.3\n\n- Fix exports and external module imports with some output formats\n- Fix endless cycle bug on Windows ([#3](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/pull/3)) - thanks @Bobris\n\n## 0.6.2\n\n- Permit assignments to properties of imported bindings\n\n## 0.6.1\n\n- Support for basic transformers\n\n## 0.6.0\n\n- BREAKING - `rollup.rollup` and `bundle.write` both take a single options argument\n- BREAKING - external modules must be declared upfront with `options.external: [...]`\n- Non-relative module paths will be resolved by looking for `jsnext:main` fields in the appropriate `package.json` files. This behaviour can be overridden by passing an alternative `resolveExternal` function\n- Fix sourcemap options\n- Include CLI files in npm package (duh)\n\n## 0.5.0\n\n- Command line interface\n- Sourcemap generation\n- Correct behaviour with `export { x as y } from 'z'`\n\n## 0.4.1\n\n- More import name deconflicting\n\n## 0.4.0\n\n- Self-hosting! `rollup.rollup` now rolls up rollup\n- Fix bug with comments inside a statement later being appended to it\n- Prevent shadowing of external modules\n- Rewrite computed property identifiers where necessary\n- Preserve original statement order where possible\n- Internal refactoring\n\n## 0.3.1\n\n- Saner deconflicting\n- Rename namespace imports from external modules correctly\n\n## 0.3.0\n\n- Basic functionality present, mostly spec-compliant\n\n## 0.2.1\n\n- Include dist files in npm package (duh)\n\n## 0.2.0\n\n- First release capable of doing anything useful\n- Still lots of basic functionality missing\n\n## 0.1.0\n\n- Initial experiment\n"

          "content": "# Contribute\n\n## Introduction\n\nFirst, thank you for considering contributing to rollup! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great community! 😊\n\nWe welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with\n\n- **QA**: file bug reports, the more details you can give the better (i.e. [REPL](https://rollupjs.org/repl/)-links or repos that demonstrate the specific issue)\n- **Marketing**: writing blog posts, howto's, printing stickers, ...\n- **Community**: presenting the project at meetups, organizing a dedicated meetup for the local community, ...\n- **Code**: take a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/issues). Even if you can't write code, commenting on them, showing that you care about a given issue matters. It helps us triage them.\n- **Money**: we welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/rollup).\n\n## Your First Contribution\n\nWorking on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ course, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\n### Setting up the Rust toolchain\n\nRollup now includes some Rust code. To compile it, you need to set up the Rust toolchain. If you haven't installed it yet, please see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install to learn how to download Rustup and install Rust.\n\nMake sure you use the same toolchain version as specified in the `/rust/rust-toolchain.toml` file. You should be able to install it with the following commands:\n\n```shell\nrustup toolchain install stable\nrustup default stable\n```\n\nYou should also install the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target:\n\n```shell\nrustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown\n```\n\nIn the end, run\n\n```shell\nrustup update\n```\n\nIf everything is set up correctly, `npm run build` should complete successfully. The first build will be rather slow, but subsequent builds will be much faster.\n\nFor local development and tests, it is even faster to run `npm run build:quick`, which does not perform a Rust production build, does not build WASM artefacts, and only builds the CommonJS version of Rollup. Note that with this build, a few tests will fail that rely on the other artefacts, see below.\n\n### Git configuration to enable symlinks\n\nThe unit tests in this projects make use of symlinks in the git project. On Windows, this may not work as expected without extra configuration. To configure git to create symlinks on windows, you need to enable the Windows \"Developer Mode\" setting, and also set the `core.symlinks` git feature using either of the following commands:\n\n```bash\n# Global setting\ngit config --global core.symlinks true\n\n# Local setting\ngit config core.symlinks true\n```\n\nAfter applying this setting, you may need to reset your local branch to ensure the files get rewritten as symlinks. Note that this step is destructive and you will want to push any changes you have made prior to resetting your branch.\n\n```bash\ngit reset --hard\n```\n\n### Installing dependencies\n\nRunning `npm install` will install the necessary dependencies. If it fails, it might be because the Rust toolchain is not yet set up for WebAssembly, see above.\n\n### How to run one test on your local machine\n\nWith `npm run test` you can run all tests together.\n\nTo save time for quick iterations, you can add `solo:true` to the `_config.js` file of any given test to run just this one test. To further speed up rebuilds, note that most tests just need the CommonJS build of Rollup.\n\nFor those tests, it is enough to run\n\n```shell\nnpm run build:quick\nnpm run test:quick\n\n```\n\nNote that this does not run the browser tests and a few CLI tests will fail.\n\n### How to write tests\n\nFor any new feature or bug fix, sufficient test coverage is crucial.\n\nNote that Rollup does not really have unit tests, only the external APIs are tested with the full Rollup build. While this may seem unusual, the tests are still very stable and fast. This provides us with the ability to perform major refactorings of the code base while ensuring full compatibility with the previous versions.\n\nThere are different test categories. Most of these tests are directory-based where you have a directory with a `_config.js` file that contains the test description and configuration and several code files. See [/test/types.d.ts](./test/types.d.ts) for a full list of available test configuration options for all directory based test types. By default, unless specified otherwise, the `main.js` file is the entry point for the test. To run the tests in an IDE, configure a [\"Mocha\" compatible test runner](https://mochajs.org/#editor-plugins) that uses `test/test.js` as the entry point.\n\n- **[`test/function`](./test/function/samples)**: These tests bundle to CommonJS and then run the entry point provided by `main.js`. The `assert` function from `node:assert` is injected as a global variable, so you can make inline assertions in the code. You can also use the `exports` configuration key to make assertions on the exported values. These are very stable and meaningful tests and should be your first choice for new tests.\n  - For regression testing when Rollup produces invalid code or crashes\n  - For testing plugin interactions. To do so, import `node:assert` in your `_config.js` file and make assertions in your plugin hooks as needed.\n  - For testing expected bundling errors, warnings and logs (use the `error`, `generateError`, `warnings` and `logs` configuration keys)\n  - For asserting on the generated bundle object (use the `bundle` configuration key)\n- **[`test/form`](./test/form/samples)**: These tests bundle to all output formats and do not run the code. They compare the bundled code against an `_expected` directory that contains the output for all formats. If the format is not important, you can specify an `_expected.js` file instead, which will be compared against the output when bundling to ES module format.\n  - For testing tree-shaking\n  - For testing code that does not run on all supported NodeJS platforms\n- **[`test/chunking-form`](./test/chunking-form/samples)**: Similar to the `form` tests, these tests support multiple output files and assets. Instead of a single file, there is a directory for each output format.\n- **[`test/cli`](./test/cli/samples)**: These tests run the Rollup CLI with a given configuration. They can compare the generated files against provided files and make assertions on stderr output. They can also optionally run the generated files.\n- **[`test/watch`](./test/watch)**: Test that watch mode works as expected. These tests are actually in the `index.js` file and only use the `samples` directory for input files.\n- **[`test/browser`](./test/browser/samples)**: These tests bundle with the browser build of Rollup. They compare the output to an `_expected` directory and allow to make assertions on bundling errors. Note that you need to provide all input files via plugins.\n- **[`test/sourcemaps`](./test/sourcemaps/samples)**: Tests to make assertions on the generated sourcemaps.\n- **[`test/incremental`](./test/incremental)**: For testing the caching behaviour of Rollup. As these tests need to run Rollup more than once, it was not easily possible to implement them as directory-based tests.\n- **[`test/file-hashes`](./test/file-hashes/samples)**: Relevant for testing that different outputs have different file hashes. With the new hashing algorithm, these tests are not as important as they used to be and are kept mostly for historical reasons.\n- **[`test/hooks`](./test/hooks)**: Do not add new tests here. These tests were the original tests for the plugin interface. For new tests, `function` tests are preferred as they are much easier to maintain.\n- **[`test/misc`](./test/misc)**: General tests that do not fit into the other categories.\n\n### Developing with the website\n\nRunning\n\n```shell\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nwill start the website locally in development mode via Vite. This will give you a live preview of the documentation. It will also verify that the documentation does not contain any dead links.\n\nA special feature of the website is that the REPL at `http://localhost:5173/repl/` is directly using the browser build of your local copy of Rollup created via Vite. It even supports full hot module replacement, which means that when you change anything within Rollup, the REPL will automatically rebundle the current code using your latest changes. This can come in very handy when working on a bug or tree-shaking improvement to allow extremely fast iterations.\n\n## Navigating the codebase\n\nSee the [architecure documentation](ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the codebase and a high-level explanation of how Rollup works.\n\n## Submitting code\n\nAny code change should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it. The pull request should also contain tests.\n\n## Code review process\n\nThe bigger the pull request, the longer it will take to review and merge. Try to break down large pull requests in smaller chunks that are easier to review and merge.\n\nIt is also always helpful to have some context for your pull request. What was the purpose? Why does it matter to you? Does it resolve any known Github issues? Adding a line \"resolves #<issue number>\" (e.g. \"resolves #23\") to the description of your pull request or of a specific commit will automatically close this issue once the pull request is merged.\n\n## Financial contributions\n\nWe also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/rollup). Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be \"merged\" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.\n\n## Questions\n\nIf you require technical assistance, [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rollupjs) or [Discord](https://is.gd/rollup_chat) are usually the best places to start.

It uses the standardized ES module format for code, instead of previous idiosyncratic solutions such as CommonJS and AMD. ES modules let you freely and seamlessly combine the most useful individual functions from your favorite libraries. Rollup can optimize ES modules for faster native loading in modern browsers, or output a legacy module format allowing ES module workflows today.\n\n## Quick Start Guide\n\nInstall with `npm install --global rollup`. Rollup can be used either through a [command line interface](https://rollupjs.org/command-line-interface/) with an optional configuration file or else through its [JavaScript API](https://rollupjs.org/javascript-api/). Run `rollup --help` to see the available options and parameters. The starter project templates, [rollup-starter-lib](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-lib) and [rollup-starter-app](https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-app), demonstrate common configuration options, and more detailed instructions are available throughout the [user guide](https://rollupjs.org/introduction/).\n\n### Commands\n\nThese commands assume the entry point to your application is named main.js, and that you'd like all imports compiled into a single file named bundle.js.\n\nFor browsers:\n\n```bash\n# compile to a <script> containing a self-executing function\nrollup main.js --format iife --name \"myBundle\" --file bundle.js\n```\n\nFor Node.js:\n\n```bash\n# compile to a CommonJS module\nrollup main.js --format cjs --file bundle.js\n```\n\nFor both browsers and Node.js:\n\n```bash\n# UMD format requires a bundle name\nrollup main.js --format umd --name \"myBundle\" --file bundle.js\n```\n\n## Why\n\nDeveloping software is usually easier if you break your project into smaller separate pieces, since that often removes unexpected interactions and dramatically reduces the complexity of the problems you'll need to solve, and simply writing smaller projects in the first place [isn't necessarily the answer](https://medium.com/@Rich_Harris/small-modules-it-s-not-quite-that-simple-3ca532d65de4). Unfortunately, JavaScript has not historically included this capability as a core feature in the language.\n\nThis finally changed with ES modules support in JavaScript, which provides a syntax for importing and exporting functions and data so they can be shared between separate scripts. Most browsers and Node.js support ES modules. However, Node.js releases before 12.17 support ES modules only behind the `--experimental-modules` flag, and older browsers like Internet Explorer do not support ES modules at all. Rollup allows you to write your code using ES modules, and run your application even in environments that do not support ES modules natively. For environments that support them, Rollup can output optimized ES modules; for environments that don't, Rollup can compile your code to other formats such as CommonJS modules, AMD modules, and IIFE-style scripts. This means that you get to _write future-proof code_, and you also get the tremendous benefits of...\n\n## Tree Shaking\n\nIn addition to enabling the use of ES modules, Rollup also statically analyzes and optimizes the code you are importing, and will exclude anything that isn't actually used. This allows you to build on top of existing tools and modules without adding extra dependencies or bloating the size of your project.\n\nFor example, with CommonJS, the _entire tool or library must be imported_.\n\n```js\n// import the entire utils object with CommonJS\nvar utils = require('node:utils');\nvar query = 'Rollup';\n// use the ajax method of the utils object\nutils.ajax('https://api.example.com?search=' + query).then(handleResponse);\n```\n\nBut with ES modules, instead of importing the whole `utils` object, we can just import the one `ajax` function we need:\n\n```js\n// import the ajax function with an ES import statement\nimport { ajax } from 'node:utils';\n\nvar query = 'Rollup';\n// call the ajax function\najax('https://api.example.com?search=' + query).then(handleResponse);\n```\n\nBecause Rollup includes the bare minimum, it results in lighter, faster, and less complicated libraries and applications. Since this approach is based on explicit `import` and `export` statements, it is vastly more effective than simply running an automated minifier to detect unused variables in the compiled output code.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n### Importing CommonJS\n\nRollup can import existing CommonJS modules [through a plugin](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/commonjs).\n\n### Publishing ES Modules\n\nTo make sure your ES modules are immediately usable by tools that work with CommonJS such as Node.js and webpack, you can use Rollup to compile to UMD or CommonJS format, and then point to that compiled version with the `main` property in your `package.json` file. If your `package.json` file also has a `module` field, ES-module-aware tools like Rollup and [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) will [import the ES module version](https://github.com/rollup/rollup/wiki/pkg.module) directly.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
