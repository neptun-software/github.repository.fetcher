To use `nodemon`, replace the word `node` on the command line when executing your script.\n\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/nodemon.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/nodemon)\n[![Backers on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/backers/badge.svg)](#backers) [![Sponsors on Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/sponsors/badge.svg)](#sponsors)\n\n# Installation\n\nEither through cloning with git or by using [npm](http://npmjs.org) (the recommended way):\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g nodemon # or using yarn: yarn global add nodemon\n```\n\nAnd nodemon will be installed globally to your system path.\n\nYou can also install nodemon as a development dependency:\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev nodemon # or using yarn: yarn add nodemon -D\n```\n\nWith a local installation, nodemon will not be available in your system path or you can't use it directly from the command line. Instead, the local installation of nodemon can be run by calling it from within an npm script (such as `npm start`) or using `npx nodemon`.\n\n# Usage\n\nnodemon wraps your application, so you can pass all the arguments you would normally pass to your app:\n\n```bash\nnodemon [your node app]\n```\n\nFor CLI options, use the `-h` (or `--help`) argument:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -h\n```\n\nUsing nodemon is simple, if my application accepted a host and port as the arguments, I would start it as so:\n\n```bash\nnodemon ./server.js localhost 8080\n```\n\nAny output from this script is prefixed with `[nodemon]`, otherwise all output from your application, errors included, will be echoed out as expected.\n\nYou can also pass the `inspect` flag to node through the command line as you would normally:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --inspect ./server.js 80\n```\n\nIf you have a `package.json` file for your app, you can omit the main script entirely and nodemon will read the `package.json` for the `main` property and use that value as the app ([ref](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/14)).\n\nnodemon will also search for the `scripts.start` property in `package.json` (as of nodemon 1.1.x).\n\nAlso check out the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) or [issues](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues) for nodemon.\n\n## Automatic re-running\n\nnodemon was originally written to restart hanging processes such as web servers, but now supports apps that cleanly exit. If your script exits cleanly, nodemon will continue to monitor the directory (or directories) and restart the script if there are any changes.\n\n## Manual restarting\n\nWhilst nodemon is running, if you need to manually restart your application, instead of stopping and restart nodemon, you can type `rs` with a carriage return, and nodemon will restart your process.\n\n## Config files\n\nnodemon supports local and global configuration files. These are usually named `nodemon.json` and can be located in the current working directory or in your home directory. An alternative local configuration file can be specified with the `--config <file>` option.\n\nThe specificity is as follows, so that a command line argument will always override the config file settings:\n\n- command line arguments\n- local config\n- global config\n\nA config file can take any of the command line arguments as JSON key values, for example:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"verbose\": true,\n  \"ignore\": [\"*.test.js\", \"**/fixtures/**\"],\n  \"execMap\": {\n    \"rb\": \"ruby\",\n    \"pde\": \"processing --sketch={{pwd}} --run\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe above `nodemon.json` file might be my global config so that I have support for ruby files and processing files, and I can run `nodemon demo.pde` and nodemon will automatically know how to run the script even though out of the box support for processing scripts.\n\nA further example of options can be seen in [sample-nodemon.md](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/sample-nodemon.md)\n\n### package.json\n\nIf you want to keep all your package configurations in one place, nodemon supports using `package.json` for configuration.\nSpecify the config in the same format as you would for a config file but under `nodemonConfig` in the `package.json` file, for example, take the following `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"nodemon\",\n  \"homepage\": \"http://nodemon.io\",\n  \"...\": \"... other standard package.json values\",\n  \"nodemonConfig\": {\n    \"ignore\": [\"**/test/**\", \"**/docs/**\"],\n    \"delay\": 2500\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that if you specify a `--config` file or provide a local `nodemon.json` any `package.json` config is ignored.\n\n*This section needs better documentation, but for now you can also see `nodemon --help config` ([also here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/doc/cli/config.txt))*.\n\n## Using nodemon as a module\n\nPlease see [doc/requireable.md](doc/requireable.md)\n\n## Using nodemon as child process\n\nPlease see [doc/events.md](doc/events.md#Using_nodemon_as_child_process)\n\n## Running non-node scripts\n\nnodemon can also be used to execute and monitor other programs. nodemon will read the file extension of the script being run and monitor that extension instead of `.js` if there's no `nodemon.json`:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --exec \"python -v\" ./app.py\n```\n\nNow nodemon will run `app.py` with python in verbose mode (note that if you're not passing args to the exec program, you don't need the quotes), and look for new or modified files with the `.py` extension.\n\n### Default executables\n\nUsing the `nodemon.json` config file, you can define your own default executables using the `execMap` property. This is particularly useful if you're working with a language that isn't supported by default by nodemon.\n\nTo add support for nodemon to know about the `.pl` extension (for Perl), the `nodemon.json` file would add:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"execMap\": {\n    \"pl\": \"perl\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNow running the following, nodemon will know to use `perl` as the executable:\n\n```bash\nnodemon script.pl\n```\n\nIt's generally recommended to use the global `nodemon.json` to add your own `execMap` options. However, if there's a common default that's missing, this can be merged in to the project so that nodemon supports it by default, by changing [default.js](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/lib/config/defaults.js) and sending a pull request.\n\n## Monitoring multiple directories\n\nBy default nodemon monitors the current working directory. If you want to take control of that option, use the `--watch` option to add specific paths:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --watch app --watch libs app/server.js\n```\n\nNow nodemon will only restart if there are changes in the `./app` or `./libs` directory. By default nodemon will traverse sub-directories, so there's no need in explicitly including sub-directories.\n\nNodemon also supports unix globbing, e.g `--watch './lib/*'`. The globbing pattern must be quoted. For advanced globbing, [see `picomatch` documentation](https://github.com/micromatch/picomatch#advanced-globbing), the library that nodemon uses through `chokidar` (which in turn uses it through `anymatch`).\n\n## Specifying extension watch list\n\nBy default, nodemon looks for files with the `.js`, `.mjs`, `.coffee`, `.litcoffee`, and `.json` extensions. If you use the `--exec` option and monitor `app.py` nodemon will monitor files with the extension of `.py`. However, you can specify your own list with the `-e` (or `--ext`) switch like so:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -e js,pug\n```\n\nNow nodemon will restart on any changes to files in the directory (or subdirectories) with the extensions `.js`, `.pug`.\n\n## Ignoring files\n\nBy default, nodemon will only restart when a `.js` JavaScript file changes. In some cases you will want to ignore some specific files, directories or file patterns, to prevent nodemon from prematurely restarting your application.\n\nThis can be done via the command line:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore lib/ --ignore tests/\n```\n\nOr specific files can be ignored:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore lib/app.js\n```\n\nPatterns can also be ignored (but be sure to quote the arguments):\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ignore 'lib/*.js'\n```\n\n**Important** the ignore rules are patterns matched to the full absolute path, and this determines how many files are monitored. If using a wild card glob pattern, it needs to be used as `**` or omitted entirely. For example, `nodemon --ignore '**/test/**'` will work, whereas `--ignore '*/test/*'` will not.\n\nNote that by default, nodemon will ignore the `.git`, `node_modules`, `bower_components`, `.nyc_output`, `coverage` and `.sass-cache` directories and *add* your ignored patterns to the list. If you want to indeed watch a directory like `node_modules`, you need to [override the underlying default ignore rules](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md#overriding-the-underlying-default-ignore-rules).\n\n## Application isn't restarting\n\nIn some networked environments (such as a container running nodemon reading across a mounted drive), you will need to use the `legacyWatch: true` which enables Chokidar's polling.\n\nVia the CLI, use either `--legacy-watch` or `-L` for short:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -L\n```\n\nThough this should be a last resort as it will poll every file it can find.\n\n## Delaying restarting\n\nIn some situations, you may want to wait until a number of files have changed. The timeout before checking for new file changes is 1 second. If you're uploading a number of files and it's taking some number of seconds, this could cause your app to restart multiple times unnecessarily.\n\nTo add an extra throttle, or delay restarting, use the `--delay` command:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 10 server.js\n```\n\nFor more precision, milliseconds can be specified.  Either as a float:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2.5 server.js\n```\n\nOr using the time specifier (ms):\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2500ms server.js\n```\n\nThe delay figure is number of seconds (or milliseconds, if specified) to delay before restarting. So nodemon will only restart your app the given number of seconds after the *last* file change.\n\nIf you are setting this value in `nodemon.json`, the value will always be interpreted in milliseconds. E.g., the following are equivalent:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 2.5\n\n{\n  \"delay\": 2500\n}\n```\n\n## Gracefully reloading down your script\n\nIt is possible to have nodemon send any signal that you specify to your application.\n\n```bash\nnodemon --signal SIGHUP server.js\n```\n\nYour application can handle the signal as follows.\n\n```js\nprocess.on(\"SIGHUP\", function () {\n  reloadSomeConfiguration();\n  process.kill(process.pid, \"SIGTERM\");\n})\n```\n\nPlease note that nodemon will send this signal to every process in the process tree.\n\nIf you are using `cluster`, then each workers (as well as the master) will receive the signal. If you wish to terminate all workers on receiving a `SIGHUP`, a common pattern is to catch the `SIGHUP` in the master, and forward `SIGTERM` to all workers, while ensuring that all workers ignore `SIGHUP`.\n\n```js\nif (cluster.isMaster) {\n  process.on(\"SIGHUP\", function () {\n    for (const worker of Object.values(cluster.workers)) {\n      worker.process.kill(\"SIGTERM\");\n    }\n  });\n} else {\n  process.on(\"SIGHUP\", function() {})\n}\n```\n\n## Controlling shutdown of your script\n\nnodemon sends a kill signal to your application when it sees a file update. If you need to clean up on shutdown inside your script you can capture the kill signal and handle it yourself.\n\nThe following example will listen once for the `SIGUSR2` signal (used by nodemon to restart), run the clean up process and then kill itself for nodemon to continue control:\n\n```js\n// important to use `on` and not `once` as nodemon can re-send the kill signal\nprocess.on('SIGUSR2', function () {\n  gracefulShutdown(function () {\n    process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGTERM');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nNote that the `process.kill` is *only* called once your shutdown jobs are complete. Hat tip to [Benjie Gillam](http://www.benjiegillam.com/2011/08/node-js-clean-restart-and-faster-development-with-nodemon/) for writing this technique up.\n\n## Triggering events when nodemon state changes\n\nIf you want growl like notifications when nodemon restarts or to trigger an action when an event happens, then you can either `require` nodemon or add event actions to your `nodemon.json` file.\n\nFor example, to trigger a notification on a Mac when nodemon restarts, `nodemon.json` looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": {\n    \"restart\": \"osascript -e 'display notification \\\"app restarted\\\" with title \\\"nodemon\\\"'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nA full list of available events is listed on the [event states wiki](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/wiki/Events#states). Note that you can bind to both states and messages.\n\n## Pipe output to somewhere else\n\n```js\nnodemon({\n  script: ...,\n  stdout: false // important: this tells nodemon not to output to console\n}).on('readable', function() { // the `readable` event indicates that data is ready to pick up\n  this.stdout.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('output.txt'));\n  this.stderr.pipe(fs.createWriteStream('err.txt'));\n});\n```\n\n## Using nodemon in your gulp workflow\n\nCheck out the [gulp-nodemon](https://github.com/JacksonGariety/gulp-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's gulp workflow.\n\n## Using nodemon in your Grunt workflow\n\nCheck out the [grunt-nodemon](https://github.com/ChrisWren/grunt-nodemon) plugin to integrate nodemon with the rest of your project's grunt workflow.\n\n## Pronunciation\n\n> nodemon, is it pronounced: node-mon, no-demon or node-e-mon (like pokémon)?\n\nWell...I've been asked this many times before. I like that I've been asked this before. There's been bets as to which one it actually is.\n\nThe answer is simple, but possibly frustrating. I'm not saying (how I pronounce it). It's up to you to call it as you like. All answers are correct :)\n\n## Design principles\n\n- Fewer flags is better\n- Works across all platforms\n- Fewer features\n- Let individuals build on top of nodemon\n- Offer all CLI functionality as an API\n- Contributions must have and pass tests\n\nNodemon is not perfect, and CLI arguments has sprawled beyond where I'm completely happy, but perhaps it can be reduced a little one day.\n\n## FAQ\n\nSee the [FAQ](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/blob/master/faq.md) and please add your own questions if you think they would help others.\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all [our backers](https://opencollective.com/nodemon#backer)! 🙏\n\n[![nodemon backers](https://opencollective.com/nodemon/backers.svg?width=890)](https://opencollective.com/nodemon#backers)\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.

          "content": "# FAQ\n\nThis is being added to as common issues occur on the [issues](http://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues), and where appropriate the answers will be added here.\n\nThis is a working document, and if it makes sense, I'll take pull requests to help make it better.\n\n# How to clear the console on restart\n\nRather than being a(nother) feature in nodemon, and as per the [design principles](https://github.com/remy/nodemon#design-principles) you can clear the console using nodemon's existing architecture.\n\nIn your `nodemon.json` (or in your `package.json`) you can include the follow event handler to always clear the console when nodemon starts:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"events\": {\n    \"start\": \"cls || clear\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that on Windows, this will clear the scroll buffer too. If you try to use node to clear the screen, you may have a race condition between the boot time of your process and the start event. This method should be the fastest.\n\n# nodemon doesn't restart on .env change\n\nThis is an edge case with how nodemon watches files. This is because nodemon doesn't know if `.env` is a hidden file with no extension or a `*.env` without a filename.\n\nNonetheless, to trigger a change on `.env` (or similar files like `.bash_profile`), you need to explicitly tell nodemon to watch the file.\n\nHowever, now nodemon will *only* watch the `.env` file, so you need to add to what nodemon is watching, i.e. tell nodemon to _also_ watch the current working directory:\n\n```bash\n$ nodemon --watch .env --watch app app/index.js\n```\n\n# nodemon doesn't work with my REPL\n\nCreate an nodemon.json file with the setting:\n\n```js\n{\n  \"restartable\": false\n}\n```\n\nThis will leave the STDIN to your application rather than listening for the `rs` command to restart.\n\n# Strange/failing behaviour starting the (node-based) executable\n\nBy default, nodemon will try to fork your node scripts ([background reading](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/1025)), however, there are some edge cases where that won't suit your needs. Most of the time the default configuration should be fine, but if you want to force nodemon to spawn your node process, use the `--spawn` option.\n\n# My script arguments are being taken by nodemon\n\nUse the `--` switch to tell nodemon to ignore all arguments after this point. So to pass `-L` to your script instead of nodemon, use:\n\n```\n$ nodemon app.js -- -L -opt2 -opt3\n```\n\nnodemon will ignore all script arguments after `--` and pass them to your script.\n\n# Error: \"process failed, unhandled exit code (2)\"\n\nNodemon will look for exit signals from the child process it runs. When the exit code is `2`, nodemon throws an error. Typically this is because the arguments are bad for the executing program, but it can also be due other reasons.\n\nFor example, mocha@3.x will exit with `2` on failing tests. To handle the exit code in a way that nodemon can consume, manually exit the process, i.e.:\n\n```bash\nnodemon -x 'mocha test/bad.test.js || exit 1'\n```\n\n# You want to suppress the request for support message\n\nPerhaps you're [already supporting nodemon](https://opencollective.com/nodemon) or you're using it in CI and it needs to be quietened.\n\nInclude the environment value of `SUPPRESS_SUPPORT=1`.\n\n# Can't install nodemon: permission issue\n\nYou may need to install nodemon using `sudo` (which isn't recommended, but I understand it's unavoidable in some environments). If the install fails with this appearing in the npm error log, then you need the following workaround.\n\n```\ngyp WARN EACCES user \"root\" does not have permission to access the dev dir \"<some-local-dir>\"\n```\n\nTry to re-install adding `--unsafe-perm` to the arguments:\n\n```\nsudo npm install -g nodemon --unsafe-perm\n```\n\nRef [#713](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/713)\n\n# Help! My changes aren't being detected!\n\nnodemon (from 1.4.2 onwards) uses [Chokidar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar) as its underlying watch system.\n\nIf you find your files aren't being monitored, either nodemon isn't restarting, or it reports that zero files are being watched, then you may need the polling mode.\n\nTo enable polling use the legacy flag either via the terminal:\n\n```shell\n$ nodemon --legacy-watch\n$ nodemon -L # short alias\n```\n\nOr via the `nodemon.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"legacyWatch\": true\n}\n```\n\n## nodemon tries to run two scripts\n\nIf you see nodemon trying to run two scripts, like:\n\n```\n9 Dec 23:52:58 - [nodemon] starting `node ./app.js fixtures/sigint.js`\n```\n\nThis is because the main script argument (`fixtures/sigint.js` in this case) wasn't found, and a `package.json`'s main file _was_ found. ie. to solve, double check the path to your script is correct.\n\n## What has precedence, ignore or watch?\n\nEverything under the ignore rule has the final word. So if you ignore the `node_modules` directory, but watch `node_modules/*.js`, then all changed files will be ignored, because any changed .js file in the `node_modules` are ignored.\n\nHowever, there are defaults in the ignore rules that your rules will be merged with, and not override. To override the ignore rules see [overriding the underlying default ignore rules](#overriding-the-underlying-default-ignore-rules).\n\n## Overriding the underlying default ignore rules\n\nThe way the ignore rules work is that your rules are merged with the `ignoreRoot` rules, which contain `['.git', 'node_modules', ...]`. So if you ignore `public`, the ignore rule results in `['.git', 'node_modules', ..., 'public']`.\n\nSay you did want to watch the `node_modules` directory. You have to override the `ignoreRoot`. If you wanted this on a per project basis, add the config to you local `nodemon.json`. If you want it for all projects, add it to `$HOME/nodemon.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"ignoreRoot\": [\".git\"]\n}\n```\n\nNow when ignoring `public`, the ignore rule results in `['.git', 'public']`, and nodemon will restart on `node_modules` changes.\n\n## nodemon doesn't work with fedora\n\nFedora is looking for `nodejs` rather than `node` which is the binary that nodemon kicks off.\n\nA workaround is to make sure that `node` binary exists in the `PATH`:\n\n```bash\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/local/bin/node\n```\n\nAlternatively the `--exec nodejs` option can be used.\n\nFedora and Ubuntu package node as nodejs, because node.dpkg is\n\n> Description-en: Amateur Packet Radio Node program\n> The node program accepts TCP/IP and packet radio network connections and\n> presents users with an interface that allows them to make gateway connections\n> to remote hosts using a variety of amateur radio protocols.\n> They make the binary is nodejs, rather than node. So long as you're not using that Packet Radio Node Program mentioned above the workaround will work.\n\nThank you [@EvanCarroll](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/68#issuecomment-13672509)\n\n## Using nodemon with forever\n\nIf you're using nodemon with [forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) (perhaps in a production environment), you can combine the two together. This way if the script crashes, forever restarts the script, and if there are file changes, nodemon restarts your script. For more detail, see [issue 30](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/30).\n\nTo achieve this you need to add the following on the call to `forever`:\n\n* Use forever's `-c nodemon` option to tell forever to run `nodemon` instead of `node`.\n* Include the nodemon `--exitcrash` flag to ensure nodemon exits if the script crashes (or exits unexpectedly).\n* Tell forever to use `SIGTERM` instead of `SIGKILL` when requesting nodemon to stop. This ensures that nodemon can stop the watched node process cleanly.\n* Optionally add the `--uid` parameter, adding a unique name for your process. In the example, the uid is set to `foo`.\n\n```bash\nforever start --uid foo --killSignal=SIGTERM -c 'nodemon --exitcrash' server.js\n```\n\nTo test this, you can kill the server.js process and forever will restart it. If you `touch server.js` nodemon will restart it.\n\nTo stop the process monitored by forever and nodemon, call the following, using the `uid` we assigned above (`foo`):\n\n```bash\nforever stop foo\n```\n\nThis will stop both nodemon and the node process it was monitoring.\n\nNote that I _would not_ recommend using nodemon in a production environment - but that's because I wouldn't want it restart without my explicit instruction.\n\n## What does \"verbose\" give me?\n\nThe `--verbose` (or `-V`) puts nodemon in verbose mode which adds some detail to starting and restarting.\n\nAdditional restart information:\n\n* Which nodemon configs are loaded (local and global if found)\n* Which ignore rules are being applied\n* Which file extensions are being watch\n* The process ID of your application (the `child pid`)\n* The process ID of nodemon to manually trigger restarts via kill signals\n\nFor example:\n\n```text\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] v1.0.17\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] reading config /Users/remy/Sites/jsbin-private/nodemon.json\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] or send SIGHUP to 58118 to restart\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] ignoring: /Users/remy/Sites/jsbin-private/.git/**/* node_modules/**/node_modules\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] watching: /Users/remy/Sites/jsbin/views/**/* /Users/remy/Sites/jsbin/lib/**/* ../json/*.json config.dev.json\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] watching extensions: json,js,html\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] starting `node run.js`\n14 Apr 15:24:58 - [nodemon] child pid: 9292\n```\n\nWhen nodemon detects a change, the following addition information is shown:\n\n* Which file(s) triggered the check\n* Which (if any) rules the file matched to cause a subsequent restart\n* How many rules were matched and out of those rules, how many cause a restart\n* A list of all the files that _successfully_ caused a restart\n\nFor example, on `lib/app.js` being changed:\n\n```text\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] files triggering change check: ../jsbin/lib/app.js\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] matched rule: **/Users/remy/Sites/jsbin/lib/**/*\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] changes after filters (before/after): 1/1\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] restarting due to changes...\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] ../jsbin/lib/app.js\n\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] starting `node run.js`\n14 Apr 15:25:56 - [nodemon] child pid: 9556\n```\n\n## My .nodemonignore is being ignored\n\n_The legacy `.nodemonignore` was dropped in nodemon@3_\n\nThe new `nodemon.json` supersedes the `.nodemonignore` file, so if you have both, the `.nodemonignore` is not used at all.\n\nNote that if you have a `nodemon.json` in your `$HOME` path, then this will also supersede the old ignore file (and the _legacy_ format config is ignored).\n\n## nodemon does nothing\n\nOn Ubuntu globally installed node applications have been found to have no output when they're run. This _seems_ to be an issue with node not being correctly installed (possibly linked to the binary having to be called `nodejs`).\n\nThe solution (that's worked in the past) is to install [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) first and using it to install node, _rather_ than using `apt-get` (or similar tools) to install node directly.\n\n## If nodemon is facing the watch errors (Mac & Linux)\n\nTry the following command on terminal:\n\n```bash\necho fs.inotify.max_user_watches=582222 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p\n```\n\n## \"Port in use\" with --inspect flag and docker\n\nThe workaround is to use [kill-port](https://github.com/tiaanduplessis/kill-port) to close off the debugger port, used similarly to:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --delay 80ms --exec 'kill-port -k 9228/tcp; node --inspect=0.0.0.0:9228 ./app/http.js'\n```\n\n[Original suggestion here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/1050#issuecomment-323680697) and [addition information here](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/1346#issuecomment-401218386).\n\n## Windows: nodemon keeps restarting without changes\n\nThis _might_ be related to a Microsoft Windows release pertaining to the OS and breaking `fsevents` module (which is used by [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) - the underlying watch package).\n\nThe workaround is to run the following command:\n\n```bash\nfsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 1\n```\n\n[Futher reading thread](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/1354)\n\n## Error: Cannot find module 'internal/util/types'\n\nIf you see the error `Cannot find module 'internal/util/types'`, the error is solved with a clean npm cache and trying to reinstall the dependency you're working with.\n\nA start is to use the following commands:\n\n```\nsudo npm cache clean --force\nsudo npm i -g npm\n```\n\nOtherwise see [issue #1124](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/1124) for further suggestions.\n\n## No automatic restart when using Docker volumes [issue #419](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/419#issuecomment-391244911)\n\nSome Node.js Docker images do not seem to have the full suite of filesystem process utilities that allow `nodemon` to restart automatically when the code in a mounted volume changes. To handle this, and enable automatic restarts without using legacy mode, you can install the [procps](http://procps.sourceforge.net) package.\n\nHere's an example snippet of a Dockerfile:\n\n```\nFROM node:8.9.4-wheezy\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y procps\n```\n\n## \"scripts is disabled on this system\" on Windows\n\nBased on [this issue](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/1619), if you see the following on Windows:\n\n```\nPS> nodemon app.js\nnodemon : File C:\\…\\nodemon.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more\ninformation, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.\nAt line:1 char:1\n\nCategoryInfo : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException\nFullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess\n```\n\nThe solution is as follows by [Felipe Jacob](https://github.com/adelbs):\n\nIt's a security restriction of the Windows PowerShell.\n\n1. Open up a powershell command window (open it as administrator)\n2. To check out current restrictions type \"Get-ExecutionPolicy\"\n3. Enable powershell by typing \"Set-ExecutionPolicy remotesigned\"\n\n## How can I watch all file types in a folder?\n\nTo watch all file types, use `'*'`:\n\n```bash\nnodemon --ext '*' --watch public --exec 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer'\n```\n\n## Workaround for when --inspect flag is passed and the old process doesn't finish before starting a new process\n\nBased on [this issue](https://github.com/remy/nodemon/issues/2056).\n\nSometimes when using the `--inspect` flag, nodemon will try to start the a process before the old process is finished.\n\nThis will cause an error trying to up the new process because of the debugger service:\n\n```\n[0] [nodemon] restarting due to changes...\n[0] [nodemon] starting `node --inspect ./main/index.js`\n[0] Starting inspector on 127.0.0.1:9229 failed: address already in use\n```\n\nYour application will likely be running the old version code if you see that message, and you will need to stop the app and manually start it again to run the app with the newer code version.\n\nA common cause for this is when graceful shutdowns are doing async tasks, i.e:\n\n```\n// ensure this is `on` and not `once`\nprocess.on('SIGUSR2', async () => {\n  await db.disconnect()\n  process.kill(process.pid, 'SIGTERM');\n})\n```\n\nSimply removing the `await` keyword would likely fix the issue.\n\nIf even after that you still running into that problem, there's a workaround to force kill the debugger whenever nodemon triggers a restart.\n\nYou can create a `nodemon.json` file at the project root and add the following config:\n\n```\n{\n  \"events\": {\n    \"restart\": \"sh -c 'lsof -i :${PORT:-9229} -t | xargs kill'\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will run a shell command to kill the process running on the PORT 9229 (default node debug port) whenever nodemon triggers a restart.\n\nIt may fail sometimes, but it makes the hot reload works partially.\n"
