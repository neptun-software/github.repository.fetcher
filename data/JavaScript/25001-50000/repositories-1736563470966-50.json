Include steps to consistently reproduce the\nproblem, actual vs. expected results, and your OS and Brackets version number.\nDisable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug.\n[Read more guidelines for filing good bugs...](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue)\n\n**For feature requests** please first check our [feature backlog](http://bit.ly/BracketsBacklog) to\nsee if it's already there. You can upvote features you'd like to see.\n\n### Submitting a pull request\n\n**Before you start coding**, post to the [brackets-dev Google group](http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev)\nor the [#brackets IRC channel on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=brackets) about what\nyou're thinking of working on, so you can get early feedback. We don't want you to do tons of work\nand then have to rewrite half of it!\n\nFor more on what's expected in a good pull request, see [Contributing Code](#contributing-code) below.\n\n\n# Ways to Contribute\n\nThere are many ways you can contribute to the Brackets project:\n\n* **Fix a bug** or **implement a new feature** - read on below.\n* **[Write a Brackets extension](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-write-extensions)** and\n  tell us about it!\n* **Test Brackets** and [report bugs](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue)\n  you find. For sample testing steps, see\n  [Brackets smoke tests](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Smoke-Tests),\n  [smoke tests with a local server](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Server-Smoke-Tests), and\n  [UI walkthrough steps](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Localization-Tests).\n* **Write unit tests** for Brackets.\n* **Translate** Brackets into other languages (and help keep those translations up to date) - see\n  [localization README](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/src/nls/README.md).\n* **Write documentation** and help keep it up to date\n  (the [How to Use Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets) intro page\n  is one example).\n* **Try out some [Brackets extensions](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions)**\n  and give feedback to their authors.\n\n\n## Where Do I Start?\n\nTo start editing the Brackets code, read **[How to Hack on Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets)**.\nTo create your first Brackets extension, check out **[How to Write Extensions](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-write-extensions)**.\n\nHere are some ideas:\n\n* [Starter bugs](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues?labels=starter+bug&state=open) can\n  provide a good intro to the Brackets code.\n* [Extension ideas](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues?q=label%3A%22Extension+Idea%22)\n  are feature requests that we think would be best implemented as an add-on; it's up to the\n  Brackets community to write them!\n* [Starter features](http://bit.ly/BracketsBacklog) are a bit larger in scope. Be sure to discuss\n  these in the newsgroup before starting. _(To see starter features, click Filter Cards on the\n  right and then click the green \"Starter Feature\" label)._\n\nOnce you're ready to start coding, see the next section, [Contributing Code](#contributing-code).\n\n**I'm new to JavaScript. How can I contribute to Brackets?** Brackets is a lot more complicated\nthan the average website that uses JS. Better to start on some JS tutorials (like [Codecademy's](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript)\nor [MDN's](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Getting_Started)) and contribute\nin some of the other ways listed above. Testing is a great way to start thinking like a programmer\nbefore you've learned to code!\n\n\n## Contributing Code\n\nTo get started editing the Brackets code, read [How to Hack on Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets).\n\nBefore submitting any pull request, please make sure to:\n\n1. Discuss any major changes or questions beforehand in the [brackets-dev newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev).\n2. Consider whether your change would be better as an optional extension. Brackets is lightweight\n   and tightly focused - but highly extensible.\n3. Follow the [Pull Request Checklist](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Pull-Request-Checklist)\n   to ensure a good-quality pull request.\n4. Sign the [Brackets Contributor License Agreement](http://dev.brackets.io/brackets-contributor-license-agreement.html)\n   (we cannot merge before this).\n\nHigh quality code and a top-notch user experience are very important in Brackets, and we carefully\nreview pull requests to keep it that way. The better you follow the guidelines above, the more likely\nwe are to accept your pull request - and the faster the code review will go.\n\n \n## The Code Review Process\n\nBrackets committers are responsible for reviewing all pull requests, providing feedback, and\nultimately merging good code into `master`. The review process ensures all code is high quality,\nmaintainable, and well documented.\n\nOnce you've opened a pull request, a committer will generally respond to it within a week with an\ninitial set of comments (you don't need to ping anyone to find a reviewer). Some pull requests\nraise larger questions about UI design, product scope or architecture. Those are tagged to indicate\nthat review will take longer:\n\n* \\[PM\\] - needs high-level input from product management\n* \\[XD\\] - needs UI design / visual design discussion\n* \\[ARCH\\] - needs architectural discussion\n\nThe best way to avoid this sort of holdup is to discuss your changes on the newsgroup first!\n\nOnce your pull request is merged, it will appear in the next release of Brackets - generally within\ntwo weeks.\n\n**Interested in becoming a committer?** See the [Committer Policy](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Committer-Policy)\nfor details. Committers are expected to take a leading role in the project by making significant\ncode contributions, reviewing pull requests, and providing feedback and suggestions on the\ndirection of the project.\n\nEven if you're not a committer, you're still welcome to give feedback on any pull request!\n"

          "content": "\n| :warning: On September 1, 2021, Adobe will end support for Brackets. If you would like to continue using, maintaining, and improving Brackets, you may fork the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/brackets). Through Adobe’s partnership with Microsoft, we encourage users to migrate to [Visual Studio Code](https://aka.ms/brackets-to-vscode), Microsoft’s free code editor built on open source.\n| ---\n\n\nWelcome to Brackets! [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adobe/brackets.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adobe/brackets)\n-------------------\n\nBrackets is a modern open-source code editor for HTML, CSS\nand JavaScript that's *built* in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. \n\nWhat makes Brackets different from other web code editors?\n\n* **Tools shouldn't get in your way.** Instead of cluttering up your coding\nenvironment with lots of panels and icons, the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts \ncontext-specific code and tools inline.\n* **Brackets is in sync with your browser.** With Live Preview, Brackets\nworks directly with your browser to push code edits instantly and jump\nback and forth between your real source code and the browser view.\n* **Do it yourself.** Because Brackets is open source, and built with HTML, CSS\nand JavaScript, you can [help build](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) the best code editor for the web.\n\nBrackets may have reached version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our\n[trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsTrelloBoard) that we're anxious to add and other\ninnovative web development workflows that we're planning to build into Brackets. \nSo take Brackets out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite editor. \n\nYou can see some \n[screenshots of Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Screenshots)\non the wiki, [intro videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/CodeBrackets) on YouTube, and news on the [Brackets blog](http://blog.brackets.io/).\n\nHow to install and run Brackets\n-------------------------------\n#### Download\n\nInstallers for the latest stable build for Mac, Windows and Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) can be [downloaded here](http://brackets.io/).\n\n#### Usage\n\nBy default, Brackets opens a folder containing some simple \"Getting Started\" content.\nYou can choose a different folder to edit using *File > Open Folder*.\n\nMost of Brackets should be pretty self-explanatory, but for information on how\nto use its unique features, like Quick Edit and Live Preview, please read\n[How to Use Brackets](http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets). \nAlso, see the [release notes](http://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Release-Notes)\nfor a list of new features and known issues in each build.\n\nIn addition to the core features built into Brackets, there is a large and growing\ncommunity of developers building extensions that add all sorts of useful functionality.\nSee the [Brackets Extension Registry](https://registry.brackets.io/)\nfor a list of available extensions. For installation instructions,\nsee the [extensions wiki page](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions).\n\n#### Need help?\n\nHaving problems starting Brackets the first time, or not sure how to use Brackets?  Please \nreview [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting), which helps \nyou to fix common problems and find extra help if needed.\n\nHelping Brackets\n----------------\n\n#### I found a bug!\n\nIf you found a repeatable bug, and [troubleshooting](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting) \ntips didn't help, then be sure to [search existing issues](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues) first.\nInclude steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, screenshots, and your OS and\nBrackets version number. Disable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug.\n[Read more guidelines for filing good bugs.](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue)\n\n\n#### I have a new suggestion, but don't know how to program!\n\nFor feature requests please first check our [Trello board](http://bit.ly/BracketsBacklog) to\nsee if it's already there; you can upvote it if so. If not, feel free to file it as an issue as above; we'll\nmove it to the feature backlog for you.\n\n\n#### I want to help with the code!\n\nAwesome! _There are lots of ways you can help._ First read \n[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), \nthen learn how to [pull the repo and hack on Brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets).\n\nThe text editor inside Brackets is based on \n[CodeMirror](http://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror)&mdash;thanks to Marijn for\ntaking our pull requests, implementing feature requests and fixing bugs! See \n[Notes on CodeMirror](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Notes-on-CodeMirror)\nfor info on how we're using CodeMirror.\n\nAlthough Brackets is built in HTML/CSS/JS, it currently runs as a desktop \napplication in a thin native shell, so that it can access your local files.\n(If you just try to open the index.html file in a browser, it won't work yet.)\nThe native shell for Brackets lives in a separate repo, \n[adobe/brackets-shell](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell/).\n\n\nI want to keep track of how Brackets is doing!\n----------------------------------------------\n\nNot sure you needed the exclamation point there, but we like your enthusiasm.\n\n#### What's Brackets working on next?\n\n* In our [feature backlog](http://bit.ly/BracketsBacklog), the columns to the right\n  (starting from \"Development\") list the features that we're currently working on.\n  \"Ready\" shows what we'll be working on next.\n* Watch our [GitHub activity stream](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pulse).\n* Watch our [Waffle Kanban board](https://waffle.io/adobe/brackets): Work items in [![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/adobe/brackets.svg?label=ready&title=Ready)](http://waffle.io/adobe/brackets) are next. The entire development process is outlined in the [Developer Guide](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Developers-Guide).\n\n#### Contact info\n\n* **E-mail:** [admin@brackets.io](mailto:admin@brackets.io)\n* **Slack:** [Brackets on Slack](https://brackets.slack.com) (You can join by sending a mail to [admin@brackets.io](mailto:admin@brackets.io) with the subject line `slack registration request` specifying the email addresses you would like to register).\n* **Developers mailing list:** http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev\n* **Twitter:** [@brackets](https://twitter.com/brackets)\n* **Blog:** http://blog.brackets.io/\n* **IRC:** [#brackets on freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=brackets)\n\n---\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n"
