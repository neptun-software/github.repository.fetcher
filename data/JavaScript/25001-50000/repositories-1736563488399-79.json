Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nrepresentative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be\nfurther defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\nThis Code of Conduct also applies outside the project spaces when the Project\nSteward has a reasonable belief that an individual's behavior may have a\nnegative impact on the project or its community.\n\n## Conflict Resolution\n\nWe do not believe that all conflict is bad; healthy debate and disagreement\noften yield positive results. However, it is never okay to be disrespectful or\nto engage in behavior that violates the project’s code of conduct.\n\nIf you see someone violating the code of conduct, you are encouraged to address\nthe behavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly\nand easily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their\ndispute. If you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the\nbehavior is threatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing\nan environment where participants feel welcome and safe.\n\nReports should be directed to *Brendan Kenny (bckenny@google.com)*, the\nProject Steward(s) for *Lighthouse*. It is the Project Steward’s duty to\nreceive and address reported violations of the code of conduct. They will then\nwork with a committee consisting of representatives from the Open Source\nPrograms Office and the Google Open Source Strategy team. If for any reason you\nare uncomfortable reaching out to the Project Steward, please email\nopensource@google.com.\n\nWe will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.\nWe will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported\nincidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from\nthe project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the\nreport and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is taken.\nThe identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report\nsupplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as ongoing\nharassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without notice.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,\navailable at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html\n"

          "content": "# For Contributors\n\nWe'd love your help! This doc covers how to become a contributor and submit code to the project.\n\n## Where can I start?\n\nWe tag issues that are good candidates for those new to the code with [`good first issue`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). We recommend you start there!\n\n## Follow the coding style\n\nThe `.eslintrc.cjs` file defines all. We use [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) with [TypeScript `checkJs`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-checking-javascript-files.html#supported-jsdoc). Annotations are encouraged for all contributions.\n\n## Learn about the architecture\n\nSee [Lighthouse Architecture](./docs/architecture.md), our overview and tour of the codebase.\n\n## Contributing a patch\n\nIf you have a contribution for our [documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/), please submit it in the [developer.chrome.com repo](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/developer.chrome.com).\n\n1. Submit an issue describing your proposed change.\n1. The maintainers will respond to your issue promptly.\n1. If your proposed change is accepted, and you haven't already done so, sign a Contributor License Agreement (see details below).\n1. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes.\n1. Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the sample to which you are contributing.\n1. Submit a pull request.\n\n## Audit PRs\n\nIf proposing a new audit for Lighthouse, see the [new audit proposal guide](./docs/new-audits.md) and open an issue for discussion before starting.\n\nA PR for a new audit or changing an existing audit almost always needs the following:\n\n1. If new, add the audit to the [default config file](core/config/default-config.js) (or, rarely, one of the other config files) so Lighthouse will run it.\n\n1. **Unit tests**: in the matching test file (e.g. tests for `core/audits/my-swell-audit.js` go in `core/test/audits/my-swell-audit-test.js`).\n\n1. **Smoke (end-to-end) tests**: search through the [existing test expectations](cli/test/smokehouse/test-definitions/) to see if there's a logical place to add a check for your change, or (as a last resort) add a new smoke test.\n\n1. Run `yarn update:sample-json` to update the [sample Lighthouse result JSON](core/test/results/sample_v2.json) kept in the repo for testing. This will also pull any strings needed for localization into the correct files.\n\n### Audit `description` Guidelines\n\nKeep the `description` of an audit as short as possible. When a reference doc for the audit exists on\ndevelopers.google.com/web, the `description` should only explain *why* the user should care\nabout the audit, not *how* to fix it.\n\nDo:\n\n    Serve images that are smaller than the user's viewport to save cellular data and\n    improve load time. [Learn more](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/oversized-images).\n\nDon't:\n\n    Serve images that are smaller than the user's viewport to save cellular data and\n    improve load time. Consider using responsive images and client hints.\n\nIf no reference doc exists yet, then you can use the `description` as a stopgap for explaining\nboth why the audit is important and how to fix it.\n\n## Gatherer PRs\n\nGatherers have to interface with the inherently-complex real world and they also run *while* loading and/or testing the page, risking interfering with themselves. As a result, gatherers should strive to be as simple as possible and leave as much processing as possible to computed artifacts and audits.\n\nIt can be tempting to serialize the entire state of the world into the artifact the gatherer produces. Try to limit the artifact to exactly the information needed for current audits while leaving room for extensibility as needs change in the future.\n\nA PR adding or changing a gatherer almost always needs to include the following:\n\n1. If new, add the gatherer to the [default config file](core/config/default-config.js) (or, rarely, one of the other config files) so Lighthouse will run it.\n\n1. **Unit tests**: gatherer execution often takes place mostly on the browser side, either through protocol functionality or executing javascript in the test page. This makes gatherers difficult to unit test without extensive mocking, ending up mostly exercising the mocks instead of the actual gatherer.\n\n   As a result, we mostly rely on smoke testing for gatherers. However, if there are parts of a gatherer that naturally lend themselves to unit testing, the new tests would go in the matching test file (e.g. tests for `core/gather/gatherers/reap.js` go in `core/test/gather/gatherers/reap-test.js`).\n\n1. **Smoke (end-to-end) tests**: search through the [existing test expectations](cli/test/smokehouse/test-definitions/) to see if there's a logical place to add a check for your change, or (as a last resort) add a new smoke test if one is required.\n\n   It's most important to get true end-to-end coverage, so be sure that audits that consume the new gatherer output are in the expectations. Artifacts can also have expectations for those intermediate results.\n\n1. **Golden artifacts**: `sample_v2.json` is generated from a set of artifacts that come from running LH against `dbw_tester.html`. Those artifacts likely need to be updated after gatherer changes with `yarn update:sample-artifacts`, but limit to just the artifact being altered if possible. For example:\n\n   ```sh\n   # update just the Scripts artifact\n   yarn update:sample-artifacts Scripts\n   ```\n\n   This command works for updating `yarn update:sample-artifacts DevtoolsLog` or `Trace` as well, but the resulting `sample_v2.json` churn may be extensive and you might be better off editing manually.\n\n1. Run `yarn update:sample-json` to update the [sample Lighthouse result JSON](core/test/results/sample_v2.json) kept in the repo for testing. This will also pull any strings needed for localization into the correct files.\n\n## Protobuf errors\n\nIf there is an error in one of the proto tests (`proto-test.js` or `psi-test.js`), you may need to install `protobuf` locally for debugging. See the instructions for installing and running in the [proto readme](proto/README.md).\n\n## Adding Images to a Readme\n\nIf you are adding an image to a readme use the absolute path to the image for the specific commit hash where the image was introduced.  This requires multiple commits.\n\n1. Make the commit to introduce the image.\n1. Get the [absolute path](https://help.github.com/articles/getting-permanent-links-to-files/) to the image with the commit hash e.g. `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/e7997b3db01de3553d8cb208a40f3d4fd350195c/assets/example_dev_tools.png`\n1. Add to readme as an absolute reference to that image.\n\nIf you are updating an image that already exists: commit it, then update the readme to point the image with that new commits hash absolute url.\n\n## Pull request titles\n\nWe're using [conventional-commit](https://conventionalcommits.org/) for our commit messages. Since all PRs are squashed, we enforce this format for PR titles rather than individual git commits. A [`commitlint` bot](https://github.com/paulirish/commitlintbot) will update the status of your PR based on the title's conformance. The expected format is:\n\n> type(scope): message subject\n\n* The `type` must be one of: `new_audit` `core` `tests` `i18n`, `docs` `deps` `report` `cli` `clients` `misc`. (See [`.cz-config`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/.cz-config.js#L13))\n* The `scope` is optional, but recommended. Any string is allowed; it should indicate what the change affects.\n* The `message subject` should be pithy and direct.\n\nThe [commitizen CLI](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) can help to construct these commit messages.\n\n## Sign the Contributor License Agreement\n\nWe'd love to accept your sample apps and patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.\n\nPlease fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\n\n* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual).\n* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate).\n\nFollow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to\naccept your pull requests.\n\n## Tracking Errors\n\nWe track our errors in the wild with Sentry. In general, do not worry about wrapping your audits or gatherers in try/catch blocks and reporting every error that could possibly occur; `core/runner.js` and `core/gather/*-runner.js` already catch and report any errors that occur while running a gatherer or audit, including errors fatal to the entire run. However, there are some situations when you might want to explicitly handle an error and report it to Sentry or wrap it to avoid reporting. Generally, you can interact with Sentry simply by requiring the `core/lib/sentry.js` file and call its methods. The module exports a delegate that will correctly handle the error reporting based on the user's opt-in preference and will simply no-op if they haven't so you don't need to check.\n\n#### If you have an expected error that is recoverable but want to track how frequently it happens, *use Sentry.captureException*\n\n```js\nconst Sentry = require('./core/lib/sentry');\n\ntry {\n  doRiskyThing();\n} catch (err) {\n  Sentry.captureException(err, {\n    tags: {audit: 'audit-name'},\n    level: 'warning',\n  });\n  doFallbackThing();\n}\n```\n\n#### If you need to track a code path that doesn't necessarily mean an error occurred, *use Sentry.captureMessage*\n\nNOTE: If the message you're capturing is dynamic/based on user data or you need a stack trace, then create a fake error instead and use `Sentry.captureException` so that the instances will be grouped together in Sentry.\n\n```js\nconst Sentry = require('./core/lib/sentry');\n\nif (networkRecords.length === 1) {\n  Sentry.captureMessage('Site only had 1 network request', {level: 'info'});\n  return null;\n} else {\n  // do your thang\n}\n```\n\n#### Level Guide\n\n- `info` for events that don't indicate a bug but should be tracked\n- `warning` for events that might indicate unexpected behavior but is recoverable\n- `error` for events that caused an audit/gatherer failure but were not fatal\n- `fatal` for events that caused Lighthouse to exit early and not produce a report\n\n# For Maintainers\n\nThe [release guide](./docs/releasing.md).\n"

already in PageSpeed Insights!\n\n## Notable changes\n* The **Performance Category** had a number of scoring changes to align with other performance tools and to better reflect the state of the web.\n  - The Performance Score has been reweighted ([#12577](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/12577))\n  - The TBT and FCP score curves have been updated ([#12576](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/12576), [#12556](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/12556))\n  - CLS has been updated to its new, windowed\ndefinition ([#12554](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/12554))\n\n  See the [v8.0 Performance FAQ](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/v8-perf-faq.md) for more detail.\n\n  <a href=\"https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/v8-perf-faq.md\"><img width=\"500\" alt=\"the new metric weightings in the Lighthouse score calculator\"

Pick a metric to focus on the opportunities and diagnostics most relevant to improving just that metric:\n\n  <img width=\"350\" alt=\"the new metric filter in the lighthouse report\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/316891/120384128-61de6500-c2eb-11eb-9d15-5b92981d897e.png\">\n* The [Lighthouse Treemap](#treemap-release) is now available across all the major Lighthouse clients. If your site exposes source maps to Lighthouse, look for the \"View Treemap\" button to see a breakdown of your shipped JavaScript, filterable by size and coverage on load.\n\n## 🆕 New audits\n* The new audit `csp-xss` has been added to Best Practices to evaluate Content Security Policies and suggest ways of making them more secure. This can be a challenging audit to pass depending on hosting environment and page content, so for now it is unscored ([#12514](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/12514), [#12551](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/12551))\n\n## 🤖💥 Breaking changes for programmatic users\n* Legacy metrics `estimated-input-latency` and `first-cpu-idle` have been deprecated, unweighted, and hidden since Lighthouse 6. They have now been removed ([#12553](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/12553))\n* Starting with Node 13, Node is built with `full-icu` by default, so the very large `intl` polyfill has been removed from Lighthouse's dependencies. See the [readme FAQ](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#how-do-i-get-localized-lighthouse-results-via-the-cli) if you're stuck with `small-icu` but need localization support ([#12426](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/12426))\n* Long-time audit `uses-webp-images` has a new ID, `modern-image-formats`.

The only requirement is that source maps are accessible (either publicly, or securely from the same computer that is running the Lighthouse audit).\n\nWe even collect **code coverage** data from Chrome, and extrapolate the coverage of individual modules in a bundle. Note: this only takes into account a cold-load: code only used after user interaction will be marked as unused. Stay tuned for a future release, which will enable you to configure user flows and capture even more accurate performance insights.\n\nIf we detect a large module included by multiple bundles, we'll alert you of that too.\n\nYou can access Lighthouse Treemap from the report:\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39191/120411450-aed13400-c309-11eb-9746-2f07d5efd276.png\" width=\"350\">\n\nCurrently, only reports generated with the Lighthouse Node CLI will connect to the Lighthouse Treemap App. This functionality will be in  DevTools and PageSpeed Insights as of Lighthouse v8.0.\n\n[Demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/treemap/?gist=30a18304de56e7be08f10976a1b11702)\n\n## Core\n\n* add new CLS (all frames) to hidden metrics audit

name=\"7.0.0\"></a>\n# 7.0.0 (2020-12-16)\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v6.5.0...v7.0.0)\n\nLighthouse 7.0 includes a number of programmatic breaking changes and new audits in the **Accessibility** and **PWA** categories. There were some improvements in the accuracy of metric calculations, but it is not expected that **Performance** scores will change significantly for almost all sites. There may be larger changes in **Accessibility** and **PWA** scores due to the new audits.\n\nThis release is expected to ship in the DevTools of [Chrome 89](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule), and to PageSpeed Insights within 2 weeks.\n\n## Notable changes\n* A **full-page screenshot** is taken and used to improve the experience of viewing DOM element details. Now a thumbnail will be shown and clicking reveals a lightbox showing where in the page the DOM node lived. This screenshot increases the size of the Lighthouse JSON by ~33%. ([#11769](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11769), [#11768](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11768), [#11829](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11829), [#11846](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11846), [#11852](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11852))\n* The **PWA Category** changed fairly significantly.\n   - The _Installable_ group is powered entirely by the capability checks that enable Chrome's installable criteria. These are the same signals seen in the _Manifest_ pane in Chrome DevTools. As such, the \"Registers a service worker…\" audit moves to the _PWA Optimized_ group, and the \"Uses HTTPS\" audit is now included as part of the key \"installability requirements\" audit.\n   - The _Fast and reliable_ group has evaporated into thin air. 🌬 Now that revamped \"installability requirements\" audit includes offline-capability checking, we've removed the dedicated audits for checking if the current page and `start_url` respond with 200 when offline. Separately, the \"Page load is fast enough on mobile network\" audit was removed—while it's no longer part of the PWA section, we encourage folks building a PWA to consult the Performance category to ensure their web app is speedy and delightful.\n* A **nightly Lighthouse build** is now available as [`lighthouse@next`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lighthouse?activeTab=versions) on npm. Note that while automated tests pass before publishing, it's expected that this version will be more unstable than the regular releases ([#11792](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11792), [#11805](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11805), [#11810](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11810))\n* The accessibility-testing library **`axe-core`** has been updated to the latest 4.1.1 release. The accessibility audits are now faster, more robust, and include multiple new checks ([#11661](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11661))\n* Lighthouse runs a small benchmark at startup, and will now include a warning if the [test machine appears underpowered](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/throttling.md#cpu-throttling) and may be affecting the accuracy of the Lighthouse metrics ([#11350](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11350))\n* Joomla and October CMS detection has been added, so pages on those platforms will now get customized advice on some Lighthouse audits ([#11788](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11788))\n\n## New contributors\n\nThanks to Kohta Ito (@koh110) and Sam Stoelinga (@samos123) for their first contributions!\n\n## 🆕 New audits\n\n* The new `installable-manifest` PWA audit, mentioned above, uses Chrome's own installability criteria so it will always stay in sync with installability requirements ([#11745](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11745))\n* `third-party-facades` looks for third-party embeds in the test page that can be lazy loaded with a static \"facade\". If the embed isn't necessary for immediate interaction by a user, consider using one of the facades to speed up page load ([#11290](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11290))\n* With the axe version upgrade comes new audits ensuring accessible naming: `aria-treeitem-name`, `aria-command-name`, `aria-tooltip-name`, `aria-meter-name`, and `aria-progressbar-name` ([#11661](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11661))\n\n## ♻️ Removed audits\n\n* The update to latest `axe-core` also removes two audits that weren't checking much: [`layout-table`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/pull/1885) and [`video-description`](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core/pull/1737) ([#11661](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11661))\n* `works-offline` and `offline-start-url` audits were removed as their checks are now covered by the new `installable-manifest` implementation ([#11806](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11806))\n* The `load-fast-enough-for-pwa` audit has also been removed since Lighthouse's existing performance metrics more than cover the needs there ([#11764](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11764))\n* `without-javascript` has been removed ([#11711](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11711))\n\n## 💥 Breaking changes\n\n* Device-emulation config settings and CLI flags have changed to be clearer and have less overlap. If you've used `--emulated-form-factor` or other emulation-related configuration, you'll need to make changes. The new settings should be considerably simpler to use with custom Lighthouse runners using real devices, Puppeteer, or system-level throttling. See the [emulation docs](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/9dbb0a57ff523325bb04437c4202780756afda90/docs/emulation.md#changes-made-in-v7) for migration guidance. ([#11779](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11779))\n* When waiting for the page to be fully loaded, Lighthouse will now wait if there are active high-priority network requests. In rare cases, like where the app initialization is dependent on a single, slow-returning XHR, some performance metrics may worsen; however, the new measurements are now accurate. ([#11738](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11738), [#11851](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11851))\n* Support for Node 10 has been dropped. The minimum required Node version is now 12 ([#11656](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11656))\n\n## 🤖💥 Breaking changes for programmatic users\n\nThese changes are unlikely to affect end users, but may be important if you are writing custom configs, plugins, or processing the Lighthouse JSON output.\n\n* `ConsoleMessages` is a [new artifact](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/a6738e0033e7e5ca308b97c1c36f298b7d399402/types/artifacts.d.ts#L753-L802) that is a combination of the old `ConsoleMessages` and `RuntimeExceptions` artifacts, with some expanded data on items logged to the console. `RuntimeExceptions` has been removed ([#11663](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11663))\n* DOM \"node details\" data formerly spread throughout existing artifacts are now gathered in a [`NodeDetails`](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/a6738e0033e7e5ca308b97c1c36f298b7d399402/types/artifacts.d.ts#L150-L157) property on each element ([#11474](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11474), [#11695](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11695), [#11752](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11752))\n* The [`ImageElements` artifact](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/a6738e0033e7e5ca308b97c1c36f298b7d399402/types/artifacts.d.ts#L395-L440) has been [streamlined](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/11642) to better represent the data collected and how it's used ([#11703](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11703), [#11707](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11707), [#11733](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11733))\n* Previously, `extends: true` was allowed as an alias for `extends: 'lighthouse:default'` to [extend a config](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#config-extension) from the default Lighthouse config file. The boolean option has been removed to prepare the way for extending from any valid config file ([#11835](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11835))\n* A never-used feature to pass options from the config to gatherers has been removed to be compatible with future changes ([#11743](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/11743))\n\n## 🧱 Core\n\n### Improvements, bug

changelog](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v5.6.0...v6.0.0)\n\nWe expect this release to ship in the DevTools of Chrome 84.\n\n## Notable changes\n\nSo many! See the [**Lighthouse 6.0: What's New** blog post](https://web.dev/lighthouse-whats-new-6.0/) for an in-depth look.\n\n## 🆕 New audits\n\n* [Largest Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/lighthouse-largest-contentful-paint/) (LCP) is a new metric that measures the time from navigation until the largest content element in the viewport is rendered ([#9905](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9905), [#10213](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10213), [#10452](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10452), [#10529](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10529)).\n   - `largest-contentful-paint-element` is a companion audit that gives information about which element triggered the LCP ([#10517](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10517), [#10713](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10713)).\n* [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) (CLS) is a new metric that measures the amount of unexpected movement of content as a page loads ([#9037](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9037), [#10427](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10427), [#10495](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10495), [#10570](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10570), [#10728](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10728)).\n   - `layout-shift-elements` is another companion diagnostic that gives information about the elements that shifted as the page loaded ([#10702](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10702)).\n* `unused-javascript` is an audit that has been kicking around for some time but is only now turned on by default. It accounts for what JavaScript was loaded but never executed during page load and estimates the load time that could be saved via code splitting, dead code elimination, or judicious use of the delete key ([#9854](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9854)).\n* A PWA [`maskable-icon`](https://web.dev/maskable-icon-audit/) just looks better on your homescreen, so this new audit encourages you to have at least one available in your manifest ([#10370](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10370)).\n* `timing-budget` expands [budget assertions](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/7e4fa55/docs/performance-budgets.md) to now be settable on all the performance metrics ([#9901](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9901), [#9925](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9925)).\n* The new [`charset`](https://web.dev/charset) audit ensures a proper character encoding for page content ([#10284](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10284), [#10389](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10389), [#10689](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10689)).\n* `image-size-responsive` checks that images have an aspect ratio and resolution that match well with how they are displayed on a page ([#10460](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10460)).\n* Updating to the latest version of `axe-core` has unlocked a number of new accessibility audits: [`aria-hidden-body`](https://web.dev/aria-hidden-body/), [`aria-hidden-focus`](https://web.dev/aria-hidden-focus/), [`aria-input-field-name`](https://web.dev/aria-input-field-name/), [`aria-toggle-field-name`](https://web.dev/aria-toggle-field-name/), [`duplicate-id-active`](https://web.dev/duplicate-id-active/), [`duplicate-id-aria`](https://web.dev/duplicate-id-aria/), [`form-field-multiple-labels`](https://web.dev/form-field-multiple-labels/), [`heading-order`](https://web.dev/heading-order/) ([#9798](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9798)).\n\n## ⚗️ Experimental audits\n\nThese audits are not yet part of the default Lighthouse experience, but they will provide performance advice based on analysis of a page's JavaScript bundles. They can be tested today on the command line with the `--preset=experimental` flag.\n\n* `legacy-javascript` rummages through your bundles looking for polyfills and bundler transforms that aren't necessary or are outdated ([#10303](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10303), [#10568](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10568), [#10564](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10564)).\n* `duplicated-javascript` also takes a dive through a page's JavaScript looking for code that has ended up duplicated within bundles or across multiple bundles ([#10314](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10314)).\n* `unused-javascript` now runs by default (as mentioned above), but when run under `experimental`, the audit can use source maps to show what _original_ source code was never run and could be postponed or eliminated ([#10090](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10090)).\n\n## New contributors!\n\nThanks to @TGiles, @roelfjan, @chruxin, @warrengm, @alexgreencode, @mikedijkstra, @egsweeny, @johnsampson, @jazyan, @b3none, @mattjared, @Malvoz, @Beytoven, @Munter, @jayaddison, @msomji, @piotrzarycki, @awdltd, @mathiasbynens, @Carr1005, @staabm, @SphinxKnight, @sk-, @AndreasKubasa, @jantimon, @kmanuel, @Kikobeats, @RolandBurrows, @nxqamar, @catalinred, and @baseeee for their first contributions! So many!\n\n## 💥 Breaking changes\n\n* Performance metric scores [have been reweighted](https://web.dev/performance-scoring/) to better reflect a user's loading experience ([#9949](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9949)).\n* Metric score curves have been updated when running a desktop Lighthouse test to account for the faster connection and CPU ([#9911](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9911), [#10756](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10756)).\n* `frameNavigated` events are now used to track redirects, which means JS redirects are now accounted for when determining the run's `finalUrl` ([#10339](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10339)).\n* The emulated mobile device has moved from the Nexus 5x to the Moto G4 (but the existing DPR has been left unchanged) ([#10191](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10191), [#10749](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10749)).\n* The `mixed-content` preset has been removed as it was not widely used and takes too long to be added to the default Lighthouse experience ([#10159](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10159), [#10750](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10750)).\n* The `full` preset has been renamed `experimental` to signify that the code there may not be ready for running by default ([#9930](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9930), [#10311](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10311), [#10333](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10333), [#10585](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10585)).\n* The emulated Chrome UA string has been updated to Chrome 80 ([#9967](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9967)).\n* `installable-manifest`: icons in the Web app manifest must be fetchable to be considered installable ([#10168](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10168), [#10320](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10320))\n\n## 🤖💥 Breaking Changes for programmatic users\n\nThese changes are unlikely to affect end users, but may be important if you are writing custom configs, plugins, or processing the Lighthouse JSON output.\n\n* `LH.Audit.Context` passed into audits is now treated as immutable. If code previously pushed to `context.LighthouseRunWarnings` to get a top-level warning, it should now pass that back in `runWarnings` on the audit's product ([#10555](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10555)).\n* `Audit.computeLogNormalScore` has been redefined to specify log-normal curves with median and p10 points (dropping the \"point of diminishing returns\"). Existing audits have been moved to this new definition so that no score changes should occur ([#10715](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10715)).\n* A `loadFailureMode` setting has been added to `Config` passes to control behavior in case of page load failure. Previously this was implicitly controlled (e.g. no offline page available did not cause an error) ([#9987](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/9987))\n* `time-to-first-byte` has been renamed `server-response-time` to better reflect what is being measured by the audit ([#10735](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10735)).\n* `resource-summary`: `details.items.size` has been renamed to `transferSize` for clarity ([#10700](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10700), [#10743](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/10743)).\n\n## 🧱 Core\n\n### Improvements, bug fixes, clarifications\n\nThe following changes are considered to be bug fixes or updates to better match what was intended to be audited, but the changes may cause adjustments in

Usage`, a new performance diagnostic that shows a breakdown of third-party resources in the page and the time/bytes needed to load them ([#9067](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/9067))\n* `Total Blocking Time` an experimental new metric that serves as a companion to TTI to help prioritize unblocking the main thread.

See [the docs](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/82835eb6e4bcece5ac1ce9c575a8d2d9ecd995d1/docs#testing-on-a-site-with-an-untrusted-certificate) for testing a page in this situation.

Changelog](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/compare/v4.3.0...v5.0.0)\n\n## Major new features\n\n* [Stack packs](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-stack-packs) are a new way to present stack-specific advice wihin the Lighthouse report. This initial version detects if a site is running on WordPress and adds additional information to the report on how to take advantage of Wordpress plugins and configuration to improve performance. ([#7243](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/7243), [#8169](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8169), [#8633](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8633), [#8536](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8536), [#8778](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8778))\n* [Performance budgets](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/audits/budgets) are a new feature of Lighthouse to help prevent your site performance from regressing over time. Set budgets for the resources a page should load and have Lighthouse alert if the budgets aren't met. ([#8539](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8539), [#8522](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8522), [#8727](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8727), [#8709](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8709), [#8427](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8427), [#8708](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8708))\n* The HTML report has been redesigned!\n\n## New Audits\n\n* `apple-touch-icon` PWA audit ([#8857](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8857))\n* `max-potential-fid` (new in HTML report) ([#8729](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8729), [#8817](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8817))\n* `performance-budget` ([#8539](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8539))\n* `resource-summary` ([#8522](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8522))\n\n## Breaking changes\n* Node 10 (LTS) or later is now required. ([#8117](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8117))\n* `rawValue` has been removed from audit results. If the audit had a meaningful numeric result (like a metric), this result will now be on `numericValue`. ([#8343](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8343), [#8385](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8385), [#8421](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8421))\n* The accessibility category scoring has been reweighted based on severity.

([#7513](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/7513))\n* The deprecated `--disable-device-emulation` flag has been removed. Use `--emulated-form-factor`. ([#8289](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8289), [#8334](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8334))\n* The `dom-size` now ignores elements in `<head>` and limits scoring to only DOM nodes in the body. ([#7241](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/7241))\n* The `diagnostics` audit details have had their `type` value changed to `debugdata` ([#8298](https://github.com/googlechrome/lighthouse/pull/8298))\n* The format of the `screenshot-thumbnails` screenshots has changed. They are now a full image data URL.

Expect one by mid-May.\n_( Poke around recent PRs and issues if you're curious what we're up to ;)_\n\nIn the meantime, only a few changes here in 1.6.5:\n\n### Audits\n\n* Improve HTTPS audit by using network records rather than Security domain, which is broken on Android.(original pr #1918) (#2054)\n* Disable unused css rules audit for now, as we want to revisit correctness later (#1912)\n\n### Report\n* Add legend to decipher iconography left to us by the ancient ones (#1841)\n* Print doesn't cut off expanded audit details (#1870)\n* Biggin icons for a11y (#1856)\n* Tweak report colors so that we are WCAG2AA valid.\n\n### CLI\n* support multiple output modes (#1813)\n* add update-notifier. (#1890)\n\n### Testing\n* smokehouse:  fix flakiness of dom-size expectation (#1881)\n* include a normal CLI run in the travis build.\n\n### Misc\n* remove npm prepublish (#1889)\n\nThanks to @ebidel and @paulirish for merging this stuff back to stable branch.\n\n<a name=\"1.6.0\"></a>\n# 1.6.0 (2017-03-04)\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v1.5.2...1.6.0)\n\nThere were 44 PRs landed for this release. These are their stories.\n\n### New Contributors!\n\nHuge thanks to @sendilkumarn, who contributed [four epic PRs](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/commits?author=sendilkumarn). Also welcome to @tommycli, @narendrashetty, @mohsen1 and @dentemple. Readme tweaks are how it all starts. ;)\n\n### Notable Changes\n\n- **WebPageTest integration is in beta**\n\n  By popular demand, you will soon have a way to run Lighthouse on demand in the cloud. We've worked closely with WebPageTest to enable Lighthouse auditing and analysis from within a WPT run.\n  Our contribution [WPO-Foundation/webpagetest#825](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest/pull/825) was just merged and Lighthouse on WPT is currently in private beta.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"lighthouse-webpagetest-beta\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/23574976/96be73fa-003a-11e7-9f08-45e104ef2560.gif\"></p>\n\n- **Lighthouse's CLI output has taken a chill pill** - #1764\n\n  While you can view all Lighthouse results on the command line, it hasn't scaled well. A few screenworths of report was generally dumped to stdout right as Lighthouse finished up. Now, to keep your terminal happy, you will no longer see the reams of results printed to stdout.\n  The HTML report is saved to disk by default, and you can automatically open it with `lighthouse --view`.\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img alt=\"lighthouse --view flag\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/23574913/8f733424-0039-11e7-8ecd-3fe4758e735a.gif\"></p>\n\n  If you still want the stdout output, use `--output=pretty`. Oh so pretty.\n\n- **CI coverage for Windows via AppVeyor** - #1280\n\n<p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/23574765/2f787e50-0037-11e7-9bba-ccf57423a815.png\" width=\"450\"></p>\n\n  Thanks to a large effort from @XhmikosR, we now have an eye in the sky on Lighthouse's Windows compatibility. Now, all PRs are tested on both Linux and Windows.\n\n## New audits\n* **New audit**: DOM stats (total nodes, depth, width). (#1673) Get flagged if the size or depth of your DOM is big enough to cause big slowdowns.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/23575128/34caa486-003d-11e7-8cb1-98e7805900ce.png)\n\n* **New audit**: Total byte weight audit (#1759). An extra check to make sure folks don't ship 5MB webpages.\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/23575150/76da8292-003d-11e7-8288-1c58eb579d87.png)\n\n\n\n### Improvements\n* **CLI**: Add -`-chrome-flags` option to CLI. (#1761)\n* **CLI**: Add `--disable-storage-reset` flag to skip clearing cache and storage (#1675)\n* **Report:** Centralize perf audits within Performance section (#1724)\n* **Report:** Collapse sections when all audits pass (#1742)\n* **Config**: Allow extension of default config (#1731)\n* **Config**: Configurable blank page options (#1732)\n* **Config**: Configurable page timeout (#1672)\n* Disable throttling for non-performance passes (#1740)\n* Reduce build size by 33% (#1756)\n* Enhanced display URLs (#1793)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n* Improve reliability of TTI metric by extending trace (#1785)\n* Do not fail if chrome could not be killed (#1735)\n* Headless fix: reuse existing tab if creating new tab fails (#1760)\n* Fix code escaping (#1790)\n* Speculative fix for getCurrentTabURL (#1753)\n* Rewrite chrome:// URLs to compare them. (#1777)\n* Responsive image audit correctly handles SVG and duplicates (#1749)\n\n### Testing\n* Use download-chrome.sh to download Chrome on Windows too.\n* Add AppVeyor CI support for Windows testing.\n\n### Docs\n* Link to PWA Checklist (#1734)\n* Reorganization and new \"Using programmatically\" section (#1721)\n* fix typo in promise chain\n* minor yarn typo fix (#1736)\n* Fix typo s/console.err/console.error (#1772)\n\n### Refactor\n* DRY byte efficiency audits (#1635)\n* Add explicit strict null checks for TS. (#1763)\n* CSS consistency changes. (#1698)\n* Switch to two space indention. (#1693)\n* Refactor handlebar helpers into static methods\n\n### Report Improvements\n* Use ! for aggregation icon when some audits dont pass (#1789)\n* Clearer iconography in Perf metrics and Fancier Stuff (#1750)\n* Adopt the non-failure iconography for perf audits  (#1812)\n* Reformat the critical chain details (#1647)\n* Reformat the usertiming details (#1810)\n* Adjust table em color val for WCAG2AA. (#1743)\n* Better colors. Still accessible (#1758)\n* Brand the header (#1797)\n* Quazzle the tardiplums for best quality fleekdrops.\n\n### Report Bug fixes\n* Fix table overflow with Firefox. (#1704)\n* Use pre instead of inline code for listener snippets. (#1786)\n* Use the same favicon as the viewer. (#1657)\n* Tweak colors so that we are WCAG2AA valid. (#1686)\n* CSS icon alignment for FF (#1796)\n* Clean up table styling (#1726)\n\n\n\n<a name=\"1.5.1\"></a>\n## 1.5.1 (2017-02-10)\n\n[Full changelog](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/1.5.0...1.5.1) (2017-02-10)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- HTML hygiene - #1682, #1683, #1684\n- **Extension:** Rollback of `management` permission to study effect first (#1689) - #1687\n\n\n\n\n<a name=\"1.5.0\"></a>\n# 1.5.0 (2017-02-10)\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v1.4.1...1.5.0)\n\nThere were 128 PRs landed for this release. These are their stories.\n\n### New Contributors!\n\n@graph1994, @denar90, and @kiermasp\n\n### Notable Changes\n- **Dropped support for Node earlier than v6** - #1519\n\n  Node v6 became the [Node long-term-support version](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS#lts-schedule) in October 2016. After a suitable mourning period for v4 with a `--harmony` flag, Lighthouse has moved on and will only support v6+ going forward.\n- **Improved selection of First Contentful and Meaningful Paint events from unusual traces** - #1632, #1634\n\n  Lighthouse has banished the dreaded `-1` score that has long plagued runs for [certain sites](https://airhorner.com/).\n\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22815981/ea000d68-ef13-11e6-95f5-258e2cacdd54.png)\n\n  First Meaningful Paint is now detected much more robustly. While it is [not yet a completely solved problem](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/issues/1464), a large class of these errors should be eliminated. Reporting on these errors has also improved over the ambiguous `-1`, clearly differentiating between an issue with Lighthouse and an issue with the page being tested.\n- **Open local report in online report Viewer** - #1179\n\n  When viewing a Lighthouse HTML report generated locally—in the extension or from the command line—a new option is available in the \"Export...\" dropdown that allows you to upload to the [Lighthouse Online Viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/).\n\n  ![localreport](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22817784/3d865302-ef1e-11e6-9535-50937f5929ef.png)\n\n  ![viewer](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22817839/9b477ab6-ef1e-11e6-8fc7-bafbedfd2872.png)\n\n  You can then use the Viewer share button to get a report URL that you can share freely.\n\n  Behind the scenes, Viewer gets your permission via OAuth to create a GitHub [secret gist](https://help.github.com/articles/about-gists/#secret-gists) and saves the report there. Since it's done as _your_ gist, you maintain full control over the sharing of the report and you can delete it at any time. You can revoke the Viewer's permission to create gists under your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/applications).\n- **Performance metrics are injected into trace saved with `--save-assets` for viewing in timeline** - #1446\n\n  Lighthouse metrics like \"First meaningful paint\", \"Time to Interactive\", etc are mocked out as User Timing measures and injected back into the trace taken by Lighthouse.\n\n  ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/39191/21796487/f35ad136-d6bd-11e6-9447-2260adcf1d65.png)\n\n  If you save a run's trace with `--save-assets` and then open it in DevTools or [Timeline Viewer](https://chromedevtools.github.io/timeline-viewer/), you'll be able to see your key metrics in context with the full trace of the page load.\n- **Throttling and emulation information in report** - #1485, #1608, fc858ea\n\n  <img width=\"719\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-09 at 22 43 27\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22816879/3c913ac0-ef19-11e6-812b-7e728543318b.png\">\n\n  It's easy to forget what throttling and emulation settings were used for a particular Lighthouse run after some time has passed. The settings used are now saved in the raw JSON results and are printed at the top of the HTML report under the arrow dropdown.\n- **UI to interactively block certain page resources and measure the load performance difference**\n\n  The first version of the [Performance Experiment](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FYt5Es_Kf5IyC_bkTHj2G_a_sTvRvIq5iZCEN8VZY5o/edit#heading=h.cetla8h0y4o) project is landing in 1.5.0. When Lighthouse is run with the `--interactive` flag, a special report is generated that allows interactive selection of costly page resources. The experiment server then reruns Lighthouse on that page with those resources blocked.\n\n  <img width=\"720\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-09 at 23 45 34\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22818415/f19058e0-ef21-11e6-82f6-aa6b49013e11.png\">\n\n  This lets you experiment with your page load performance, interactively testing the effects of blocking or delaying assets in your critical path.\n\n### New Audits\n- **CSS usage** - #1421, #1479, #1466, #1496, #1557\n\n  Reports the number of unused style rules in your page and the byte/time savings of removing them:\n\n  <img width=\"831\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-09 at 23 43 17\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22818581/d4fd379c-ef22-11e6-9143-36cc7c7245ae.png\">\n- **Image optimization** - #1452, #1579\n\n  Reports images that are unoptimized and the byte/time savings of optimizing them:\n\n  <img width=\"630\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-09 at 23 43 49\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22818588/dd3994aa-ef22-11e6-8fee-7469a8866aa6.png\">\n- **Report Chrome's deprecated API warnings** - #1470\n\n  Lists console warnings from Chrome if your page is using deprecated APIs or features that have [interventions](https://chromestatus.com/features#intervention):\n\n  <img width=\"675\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-10 at 00 05 25\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22818969/b317e9d6-ef24-11e6-89db-9ee596ba8539.png\">\n- **Responsive image sizing** - #1497\n\n  Reports images that are too big and the potential byte/time savings of sizing them correctly for the given device:\n\n  <img width=\"758\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-02-09 at 23 44 23\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/316891/22818602/ef802c82-ef22-11e6-9e77-138bd743aca8.png\">\n\n### Improvements\n- **Audit:** Catch more obsolete cases in `no-old-flexbox` audit - #1374\n- **Audit:** Add extended timing data to `speed-index` audit results - #1430, #1558\n- **Audit:** Base bytes- and time-saved estimates on mean throughput for that load - #1536\n- **CLI:** Disable more Chrome background features that may interfere with auditing - #1416\n- **CLI:** Close tab when Lighthouse is done with it - #1543, #1592\n- **CLI:** Use `--output-path` when saving artifacts and assets from run - #1601\n- **CLI:** Update `--perf` config to include latest perf audits - #1640\n- **Extension:** Move from a persistent background page to an event page - #1487\n- **Extension:** ~~Option to disable other extensions during run for improved accuracy~~ - #1492, #1604 (see #1689)\n- **Gatherer:** Issue `all-event-listeners` collection commands in parallel to improve performance - #1667\n- **PerformanceExperiment:** Create server to rerun Lighthouse with new options on POST request - #1393\n- **PerformanceExperiment:** Add UI for options to block asset loading on rerun - #1455, #1577\n- **PerformanceExperiment:** Add report sidebar to switch between multiple Lighthouse run results - #1477, #1597\n- **Report:** Expand audit `<details>` on print - #1468\n- **Report:** Add table formatter for audit details - #1505, #1538, #1546, #1547, #1545, #1622, #1636, #1678\n- **Report:** Reduce visual noise by auto-collapsing audit details and removing redundant info - #1561, #1598, #1606, #1617\n- **Report:** Remove 'Coming Soon' results from report - #1637\n- **Report:** Share save and export code in report and Viewer - #1594\n- **Viewer:** Make Viewer a PWA - #1554, #1571\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Stop Lighthouse run if initial page request fails (404, domain not found, etc) - #1174, #1603, #1677\n- **Audit:** Check for proper mimetype in tags-that-block audit - #1432\n- **Audit:** Add proper parsing of meta viewport content - #1267\n- **Audit:** Ignore fragment in document URL comparison to correctly test offline loading - #1319, #1566\n- **Audit:** Filter out `goog_*` from user timings - #1563\n- **Audit:** Report proper first paint delay for blocking tags audits - #1555\n- **Audit:** Handle empty chain in critical-request-chains audit - #1620\n- **Audit:** Warn that `geolocation-on-start` gatherer cannot be run on insecure origins - #1679\n- **CLI:** Guard against launching multiple Chrome processes - #1436\n- **CLI:** Add support to find Chrome via `LIGHTHOUSE_CHROMIUM_PATH` variable on Windows - #1572\n- **PerformanceExperiment:** Fix various cross-browser report issues - #1593\n- **Report:** Improve filename eliding in audit details - #1437\n- **Report:** Various fixes for mobile and cross-browser issues - #1429, #1551, #1590, #1626\n- **Report:** Change generated HTML to be mostly valid;

These audits are informative and won't affect your best practices score.\n\n* Ensure proper origin isolation with COOP ([#16275](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16275))\n* Use a strong HSTS policy ([#16257](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16257))\n\n## Core\n\n* font-size: exclude invisible text ([#16281](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16281))\n\n## Deps\n\n* upgrade puppeteer to v23.10.4 ([#16279](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16279))\n* upgrade `trace_engine` to 0.0.38 ([#16269](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16269))\n\n## I18n\n\n* import ([#16283](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16283))\n* inject strings from trace engine npm package ([#16272](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16272))\n\n## Docs\n\n* update releasing instructions ([#16252](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16252))\n\n## Tests\n\n* update network target type expectations ([#16273](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16273))\n* devtools: sync e2e ([#16253](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16253))\n\n<a name=\"12.2.3\"></a>\n# 12.2.3 (2024-12-02)\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v12.2.2...v12.2.3)\n\nThis release is only for PageSpeed Insights and we expect it to ship within 2 weeks.\n\n## Notable Changes\n\nThe CPU throttling factor for PageSpeed Insights has been adjusted ([#16256](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16256)) to account for the low CPU performance benchmarks typical in PageSpeed production environments. In general, TBT metric times for all sites should improve when testing with PageSpeed Insights.\n\nAll other Lighthouse clients (Lighthouse CLI, the Node API, Lighthouse panel in DevTools, etc) should not be affected by this change.\n\n## Tests\n\n* inline-fs: fix error in Node 20 ([#16262](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/16262))\n\n <a name=\"12.2.2\"></a>\n# 12.2.2

Changelog](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/compare/v11.7.1...v12.0.0)\n\nWe expect this release to ship in the DevTools of [Chrome 126](https://chromiumdash.appspot.com/schedule), and to PageSpeed Insights within 2 weeks.\n\n## New Contributors\n\nThanks to our new contributors 👽🐷🐰🐯🐻!\n\n- Ashley Rich @A5hleyRich\n- MrAdib @JohnAdib\n\n## Notable Changes\n\n### PWA Category Removal\n\nAs per [Chrome’s updated Installability Criteria](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/update-install-criteria), Lighthouse [has removed the PWA category](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15455). For future PWA testing, users will be directed to use the [updated PWA documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/progressive-web-apps/).\n\n### SEO Category Reorganization\n\nThe SEO category has been updated to reflect the priorities of Google search in 2024. As such, several audits have been removed or moved to other categories:\n\n* The `is-crawlable` audit is now weighted high enough to fail the SEO category on its own. ([#15933](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15933))\n* The `viewport` and `font-size` audits are no longer priorities for SEO, but are still important for UX in general so they have been moved to the best practices category. ([#15930](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15930))\n* The `plugins` audit is no longer a priority for SEO and has been removed. ([#15928](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15928))\n* The `tap-targets` audit is no longer a priority for SEO and has been replaced with the `target-size` audit in accessibility. ([#15906](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15906))\n\n### Overall Savings Deprecation\n\nThe `overallSavingsMs` value on performance diagnostic audits has been deprecated ([#15902](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15902)). We recommend using `metricSavings.LCP` or `metricSavings.FCP` to understand the estimated metric savings of performance diagnostics.\n\n### 🆕 New Audits\n\n* The [`aria-conditional-attr`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-conditional-attr), [`aria-deprecated-role`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-deprecated-role) and [`aria-prohibited-attr`](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.9/aria-prohibited-attr) Axe checks have been added to the Lighthouse accessibility category. ([#15963](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15963))\n* The `redirects-http` audit has been brought back, but will only passively check for a http -> https redirect if the provided URL happens to be on http ([#13548](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/13548))\n\n### Other Audit Changes\n\n* The `layout-shifts-elements` audit is removed. Improved layout shift information can be found in the `layout-shifts` audit. ([#15931](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15931))\n* The `no-unload-listeners` audit is removed. Unload listeners are deprecated and are still flagged in the `deprecations` and `bf-cache` audits. ([#15874](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15874))\n* The `duplicate-id-active` audit is removed because it's corresponding Axe check is deprecated. ([#15900](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15900))\n* The `uses-rel-preload` and `preload-fonts` audits have been moved to the experimental config. Preload advice is still on hold and these audits were already in a disabled state. ([#15876](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15876))\n\n## 💥 Breaking Changes\n\n* split up `CSSUsage` artifact ([#15952](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/15952))\n* remove

Time to Interactive (TTI) no longer contributes to the performance score and is not displayed in the report. However, it is still accessible in the Lighthouse result JSON.\n\nWithout TTI, the weighting of Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) has increased from 15% to 25%. See the docs for a complete breakdown of [how the Performance score is calculated in 10.0](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/performance-scoring/#lighthouse-10), or [play with the scoring calculator](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/scorecalc/#FCP=3000&SI=5800&FMP=4000&TTI=7300&FCI=6500&LCP=4000&TBT=600&CLS=0.25&device=mobile&version=10&version=8).\n\n### Types for the Node package\n\nLighthouse now includes type declarations! Our [example TypeScript recipe](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/tree/main/docs/recipes/type-checking) demonstrates how to achieve proper type safety with Lighthouse.\n\n### Third-party Entity classification\n\nSince Lighthouse 5.3, the community-driven [`third-party-web`](https://github.com/patrickhulce/third-party-web) dataset has been used to summarize how every third-party found on a page contributes to the total JavaScript blocking time, via the `third-party-summary` audit. With Lighthouse 10.0, we are adding a new property to the JSON result (`entities`) to make further use of this dataset. Every origin encountered on a page is now classified as first-party or third-party within `entities`. In 10.0, this classification is used to power the existing third-party filter checkbox.\n\nIn a future version of Lighthouse, this will be used to group the table items of every audit based on the entity it originated from, and aggregate the impact of items from that specific entity.\n\n## 🆕 New Audits\n\n### Back/forward cache\n\nThe Back/forward cache (bfcache for short) is a browser optimization that serves pages from fully serialized snapshots when navigating back or forwards in session history. There are over 100 different reasons why a page may not be eligible for this optimization, so to assist developers Lighthouse now attempts to trigger a bfcache response and will list anything that prevented the browser from using the bfcache. [#14465](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/14465)\n\nFor more on bfcache, see [the web.dev article](https://web.dev/bfcache/).\n\nNote: This audit initially will not be available for PageSpeed Insights.\n\n### Preventing pasting to inputs\n\nThe audit `password-inputs-can-be-pasted-into` is now `paste-preventing-inputs`. This audit's logic works just as before, but rather than just considering `[type=password]` inputs, it now fails if _any_ non-readonly input element prevents the user from pasting. [#14313](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/14313)\n\n## Lighthouse documentation is now on developer.chrome.com\n\nOur documentation is no longer hosted on web.dev. For the most up to date audit docs, please go to [developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/)\n\n## 💥 Breaking changes\n\nUnder the hood, Lighthouse now uses the new user-flow supporting infrastructure by default, even for traditional navigation runs. You can opt out of this by: in the CLI, use `--legacy-navigation`; in DevTools: check “Legacy Navigation” in the settings menu. If you have a use case that necessitates this escape hatch, please file an issue. We plan to remove this legacy path in 11.0.\n\n### For Lighthouse result JSON (LHR) users\n\n#### Page URLs on the Lighthouse Result\n\nUntil now, there were two URL fields to describe a Lighthouse run:\n\n- `requestedUrl`: the url given by the users, which Lighthouse instructs Chrome to navigate to\n- `finalUrl`: the url after any server-initiated HTTP and JS-initiated redirects\n\nThis taxonomy cannot account for more complex scenarios, such as JS-initiated redirects, usage of the History API or soft-navigations. They were also ill-defined for timespan and snapshot modes. To account for that, Lighthouse 10.0 now has these URL fields:\n\n- (changed) `requestedUrl`: The URL that Lighthouse initially navigated to before redirects. This is the same as it was before for navigation mode, but now it will be `undefined` in timespan/snapshot.\n- (new) `mainDocumentUrl`: The URL of the last document requested during a navigation. It does not account for soft navigations or history API events made after the page loads. It is only available in navigation mode, and will be undefined in timespan and snapshot modes.\n- (new) `finalDisplayedUrl`: The URL displayed in the browser combobox at the end of a Lighthouse run. It accounts for soft navigations and history API events. Available in navigation, timespan, and snapshot modes.\n- (deprecated) `finalUrl`: Same value as `mainDocumentUrl`.\n\n#### Audit changes\n\n- `password-inputs-can-be-pasted-into` -> `paste-preventing-inputs`\n- `preload-lcp-image` -> `prioritize-lcp-image`\n- `third-party-summary` no longer uses a `link` value for `item.entity`, instead uses a raw `text` value\n- `full-page-screenshot` is no longer an audit, instead it is stored at `lhr.fullPageScreenshot`. To suppress collection of the full-page screenshot in the CLI, you must migrate from `--skip-audits full-page-screenshot` to `--disable-full-page-screenshot`.\n\n### For Node users\n\n- Node 14 is no longer supported, the minimum is now Node 16\n- In case you import paths within the lighthouse node package: `lighthouse-core/` and `lighthouse-cli/` folders are now simply `core/` and `cli/`\n- Converted from CommonJS to ES modules. You can still use lighthouse in CommonJS by using an dynamic import: `await import('lighthouse')`. For access to just the `lighthouse` function in CommonJS, you can also use `require('lighthouse/core/index.cjs')`\n- The CSV output for Lighthouse is much more useful now. Consult the PR for [an example of the new format](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/pull/13558)\n- `LHError` is now `LighthouseError`. If you are attempting to catch an error thrown by Lighthouse, be sure to account for this!\n\n#### Node API changes\n\nThe `lighthouse` function now has [better integration with Puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/puppeteer.md). Use `lighthouse(url, flags, config, page)` to run Lighthouse, passing an existing `Puppeteer.Page` handle as `page`.\n\nThe user flow api has moved to the top level node entrypoint and can be imported with `import {startFlow} from 'lighthouse'`.\n\nNew `flow.startNavigation()` and `flow.endNavigation()` functions let you define a user triggered navigation without any callback function. See the user flow docs for [an example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/user-flows.md#triggering-a-navigation-via-user-interactions).\n\nTo change settings for a single user flow step, define the settings overrides on the toplevel flags options `flow.snapshot({skipAduits: ['uses-http2']})` instead of on the `settingsOverride` property.\n\nTo give a flow step a custom name, use `flow.snapshot({name: 'Custom name'})`. Previously this was done via `stepName`.\n\n### For Lighthouse customization (custom config, gatherers, audits)\n\n- To work in Lighthouse 10.0, custom gatherers will need to implement the new Gatherer interface ([an example](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/recipes/custom-audit/memory-gatherer.js)). Otherwise, they will only work in [legacy navigation mode](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#using-legacy-configs-in-100) and older versions of Lighthouse\n- Lighthouse cannot use `passes` to load the page multiple times in navigation mode anymore. If you need to load the page multiple times, we recommend using a user flow. See our config docs for instructions on [how to convert to the new config format](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/configuration.md#legacy-configs)\n- The `ScriptElements` artifact is now `Scripts`, with a [slightly different shape](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/955586c4e05d501d69a79d4ef0297991b6805690/types/artifacts.d.ts#L317)\n- `Audit.makeOpportunityDetails` and `Audit.makeTableDetails` now accept an options object as the third parameter. This ends up being a breaking change for just `Audit.makeOpportunityDetails`.\n\n\n# Detailed changelog\n\n## Removed Audits\n\n* [BREAKING] apple-touch-icon: remove audit

Users who want more advanced usage, or want to run Lighthouse in an automated fashion should use the Node CLI.\n\n> **Note**\n> Lighthouse requires Node 18 LTS (18.x) or later.\n\n**Installation**:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g lighthouse\n# or use yarn:\n# yarn global add lighthouse\n```\n\n**Run it**: `lighthouse https://airhorner.com/`\n\nBy default, Lighthouse writes the report to an HTML file. You can control the output format by passing flags.\n\n### CLI options\n\n<!-- To update the help output:\n  node cli --help | pbcopy\n-->\n\n```\n$ lighthouse --help\n\nlighthouse <url> <options>\n\nLogging:\n  --verbose  Displays verbose logging  [boolean] [default: false]\n  --quiet    Displays no progress, debug logs, or errors  [boolean] [default: false]\n\nConfiguration:\n  --save-assets                  Save the trace contents & devtools logs to disk  [boolean] [default: false]\n  --list-all-audits              Prints a list of all available audits and exits  [boolean] [default: false]\n  --list-trace-categories        Prints a list of all required trace categories and exits  [boolean] [default: false]\n  --additional-trace-categories  Additional categories to capture with the trace (comma-delimited).

Without a value, the default will be `$PWD/latest-run`.\nlighthouse -GA=./gmailartifacts https://gmail.com\n```\n\n\n#### Notes on Error Reporting\n\nThe first time you run the CLI you will be prompted with a message asking you if Lighthouse can anonymously report runtime exceptions. The Lighthouse team uses this information to detect new bugs and avoid regressions. Opting out will not affect your ability to use Lighthouse in any way. [Learn more](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/blob/main/docs/error-reporting.md).\n\n## Using the Node module\nYou can also use Lighthouse programmatically with the Node module.\n\nRead [Using Lighthouse programmatically](./docs/readme.md#using-programmatically) for help getting started.\\\nRead [Lighthouse Configuration](./docs/configuration.md) to learn more about the configuration options available.\n\n## Viewing a report\n\nLighthouse can produce a report as JSON or HTML.\n\nHTML report:\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse/443ff2c8a297dfd2297dfaca86c4966a87c8574a/assets/example_audit.png\" alt=\"Lighthouse example audit\" width=\"500px\">\n\n### Online Viewer\n\nRunning Lighthouse with the `--output=json` flag generates a JSON dump of the run.\nYou can view this report online by visiting <https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/>\nand dragging the file onto the app. You can also use the \"Export\" button from the\ntop of any Lighthouse HTML report and open the report in the\n[Lighthouse Viewer](https://googlechrome.github.io/lighthouse/viewer/).\n\nIn the Viewer, reports can be shared by clicking the share icon in the top\nright corner and signing in to GitHub.\n\n> **Note**: shared reports are stashed as a secret Gist in GitHub, under your account.\n\n## Docs & Recipes\n\nUseful documentation, examples, and recipes to get you started.\n\n**Docs**\n\n- [Dealing with variance](./docs/variability.md)\n- [Using Lighthouse programmatically](./docs/readme.md#using-programmatically)\n- [Testing a site with authentication](./docs/authenticated-pages.md)\n- [Developing Plugins](./docs/plugins.md)\n- [Making a New Audit](./docs/new-audits.md)\n- [Testing on a mobile device](./docs/readme.md#testing-on-a-mobile-device)\n- [Lighthouse Architecture](./docs/architecture.md)\n\n**Recipes**\n\n- [Plugin](./docs/recipes/lighthouse-plugin-example) - example Lighthouse plugin\n- [Custom Audit example](./docs/recipes/custom-audit) - extend Lighthouse, run your own audits\n\n**Videos**\n\nThe session from Google I/O 2018 covers the new performance engine, upcoming Lighthouse REST API, and using the Chrome UX report to evaluate real-user data.\n\n[![Watch the Lighthouse @ Google I/O 2018 session.](https://img.youtube.com/vi/UvK9zAsSM8Q/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvK9zAsSM8Q)\n\nThe session from Google I/O 2017 covers architecture, writing custom audits,\nGitHub/Travis/CI integration, headless Chrome, and more:\n\n[![Watch the Lighthouse @ Google I/O 2017 session.](https://img.youtube.com/vi/NoRYn6gOtVo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NoRYn6gOtVo)\n\n_Click the image to watch the video on YouTube._\n\n## Develop\n\nRead on for the basics of hacking on Lighthouse. Also, see [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\nfor detailed information.\n\n### Setup\n\n```sh\n# yarn should be installed first\n\ngit clone https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse\n\ncd lighthouse\nyarn\nyarn build-all\n```\n\n### Run\n\n```sh\nnode cli http://example.com\n# append --chrome-flags=\"--no-sandbox --headless --disable-gpu\" if you run into problems connecting to Chrome\n```\n\n> **Getting started tip**: `node --inspect-brk cli http://example.com` to open up Chrome DevTools and step\nthrough the entire app. See [Debugging Node.js with Chrome\nDevTools](https://medium.com/@paul_irish/debugging-node-js-nightlies-with-chrome-devtools-7c4a1b95ae27#.59rma3ukm)\nfor more info.\n\n### Tests\n\n```sh\n# lint and test all files\nyarn test\n\n# run all unit tests\nyarn unit\n\n# run a given unit test (e.g. core/test/audits/byte-efficiency/uses-long-cache-ttl-test.js)\nyarn mocha uses-long-cache-ttl\n\n# watch for file changes and run tests\n#   Requires http://entrproject.org : brew install entr\nyarn watch\n\n## run linting, unit, and smoke tests separately\nyarn lint\nyarn unit\nyarn smoke\n\n## run tsc compiler\nyarn type-check\n```\n\n### Docs\n\nSome of our docs have tests that run only in CI by default. To modify our documentation, you'll need to run `yarn build-pack && yarn test-docs` locally to make sure they pass.\n\n**Additional Dependencies**\n- `brew install jq`\n\n## Lighthouse Integrations in Web Perf services\n\nThis section details services that have integrated Lighthouse data.

It looks fine to me.\n\nLighthouse reports the performance metrics as they would be experienced by a typical mobile user on a 4G connection and a mid-tier ~$200 phone. Even if it loads quickly on your device and network, users in other environments will experience the site very differently.\n\nRead more in our [guide to throttling](./docs/throttling.md).\n\n### Why does the performance score change so much?\n\nLighthouse performance scores will change due to inherent variability in web and network technologies, even if there hasn't been a code change. Test in consistent environments, run Lighthouse multiple times, and beware of variability before drawing conclusions about a performance-impacting change.\n\nRead more in our [guide to reducing variability](./docs/variability.md).\n\n### Can I configure the lighthouse run?\n\nYes! Details in [Lighthouse configuration](./docs/configuration.md).\n\n### How does Lighthouse use network throttling, and how can I make it better?\n\nGood question. Network and CPU throttling are applied by default in a Lighthouse run. The network\nattempts to emulate slow 4G connectivity and the CPU is slowed down 4x from your machine's default speed. If you\nprefer to run Lighthouse without throttling, you'll have to use the CLI and disable it with the\n`--throttling.*` flags mentioned above.\n\nRead more in our [guide to network throttling](./docs/throttling.md).\n\n### Are results sent to a remote server?\n\nNope. Lighthouse runs locally, auditing a page using a local version of the Chrome browser installed on the\nmachine. Report results are never processed or beaconed to a remote server.\n\n### How do I get localized Lighthouse results via the CLI?\n\nStarting in Lighthouse 8.0, Lighthouse relies entirely on native `Intl` support and no longer uses an `Intl` polyfill. If you're using Node 14 or later, there should be no issue because Node is now [built with `full-icu` by default](https://nodejs.medium.com/node-js-12-to-lts-and-node-js-13-is-here-e28d6a4a2bd#9514).\n\nHowever, if you're using a `small-icu` Node build, you may see Lighthouse log messages about your locale not being available. To remedy this, you can manually install ICU data by using the [`full-icu`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/full-icu) module and the [`--icu-data-dir` node flag](https://nodejs.org/api/intl.html#intl_providing_icu_data_at_runtime) at launch.\n\n### How do I author custom audits to extend Lighthouse?\n\n> **Tip**: see [Lighthouse Architecture](./docs/architecture.md) for more information\non terminology and architecture.\n\nLighthouse can be extended to run custom audits and gatherers that you author.\nThis is great if you're already tracking performance metrics in your site and\nwant to surface those metrics within a Lighthouse report.\n\nIf you're interested in running your own custom audits, check out our\n[Custom Audit Example](./docs/recipes/custom-audit) over in recipes.\n\n### How do I contribute?\n\nWe'd love help writing audits, fixing bugs, and making the tool more useful!\nSee [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\n---\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"./assets/lighthouse-logo_512px.png\" alt=\"Lighthouse logo\" height=\"150\">\n  <br>\n  <b>Lighthouse</b>, ˈlītˌhous (n): a <s>tower or other structure</s> tool containing a beacon light\n  to warn or guide <s>ships at sea</s> developers.\n</p>\n"
