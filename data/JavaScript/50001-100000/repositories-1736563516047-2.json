Create a new [issue](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/issues/new?assignees=&labels=streams:add&projects=&template=-----streams_add.yml&title=Add%3A+) and provide all the required information. If the request is approved, the link will be added to the playlist in the next update.\n\n2. Add the link to the playlist directly using a [pull request](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/pulls).\n\nRegardless of which option you choose, before posting your request please do the following:\n\n- Make sure the link you want to add works stably. To check this, open it in one of the players (for example, [VLC player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)) and watch the broadcast for at least a minute (some test streams are interrupted after 15-30 seconds).\n- Make sure the link is not already in the playlist. This can be done by [searching](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aiptv-org%2Fiptv+http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&type=code) the repository.\n- Find the ID of the channel you want to add in our [database](https://iptv-org.github.io/). If this particular channel is not in the database, then leave a request to add it [here](https://github.com/iptv-org/database/issues/new/choose) and wait until it is approved before continuing.\n- Make sure the channel is not blocklisted. This can be done by checking the [blocklist.csv](https://github.com/iptv-org/database/blob/master/data/blocklist.csv) file.\n- The link does not lead to the Xtream Codes server. [Why don't you accept links to Xtream Codes server?](FAQ.md#why-dont-you-accept-links-to-xtream-codes-server)\n- If you know that the broadcast only works in certain countries or it is periodically interrupted, do not forget to indicate this in the request.\n\nA requests without a valid channel ID or working link to the stream will be closed immediately.\n\nNote all links in playlists are sorted automatically by scripts so there is no need to sort them manually. For more info, see [Scripts](#scripts).\n\n### How to add a link to YouTube live?\n\nYou can use one of the services like [abskmj/youtube-hls-m3u8](https://github.com/abskmj/youtube-hls-m3u8) that allow you to create permanent link to the broadcast that can be opened in most players.\n\n### How to distinguish a link to an Xtream Codes server from a regular one?\n\nMost of them have this form:\n\n`http(s)://{hostname}:{port}/{username}/{password}/{channelID}` (port is often `25461`)\n\nTo make sure that the link leads to the Xtream Codes server, copy the `hostname`, `port`, `username` and `password` into the link below and try to open it in a browser:\n\n`http(s)://{hostname}:{port}/panel_api.php?username={username}&password={password}`\n\nIf the link answers, you're with an Xtream Codes server.\n\n### How to report a broken stream?\n\nFill out this [form](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/issues/new?assignees=&labels=broken+stream&projects=&template=---broken-stream.yml&title=Broken%3A+) and as soon as a working replacement appears, we will add it to the playlist or at least remove the non-working one.\n\nThe only thing before publishing your report is to make sure that:\n\n- The link is still in our playlists. You can verify this by [searching](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Aiptv-org%2Fiptv+http%3A%2F%2Fexample.com&type=code) the repository.\n- The link really doesn't work and is not just [geo-blocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geo-blocking). To check this, you can either use a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) or services such as [streamtest.in](https://streamtest.in/).\n\nAn issue without a valid link will be closed immediately.\n\n### How do I remove my channel from playlist?\n\nTo request removal of a link to a channel from the repository, you need to fill out this [form](https://github.com/iptv-org/iptv/issues/new?assignees=&labels=removal+request&projects=&template=-removal-request.yml&title=Remove%3A+) and wait for the request to be reviewed (this usually takes no more than 1 business day). And if the request is approved, links to the channel will be immediately removed from the repository.\n\nThe channel will also be added to our [blocklist](https://github.com/iptv-org/database/blob/master/data/blocklist.csv) to avoid its appearance in our playlists in the future.\n\nPlease note that we only accept removal requests from channel owners and their official representatives, all other requests will be closed immediately.\n\n## Stream Description Scheme\n\nFor a stream to be approved, its description must follow this template:\n\n```\n#EXTINF:-1 tvg-id=\"CHANNEL_ID\" tvg-shift=\"TIMESHIFT\",CHANNEL_NAME (RESOLUTION) [LABEL]\nSTREAM_URL\n```\n\n| Attribute      | Description                                                                                | Required | Valid values                                                                                                               |\n| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `CHANNEL_ID`   | Channel ID.                                                                                | Optional | Full list of supported channels with corresponding ID could be found on [iptv-org.github.io](https://iptv-org.github.io/). |\n| `TIMESHIFT`    | Indicates the shift of the program schedule.                                               | Optional | `-2`, `-1`, `1`, `2` etc                                                                                                   |\n| `CHANNEL_NAME` | Full name of the channel.

It is quite possible that someone already has a link to the channel you need and they just haven't added it to our playlist yet.\n\nBut keep in mind that not all TV channels are available for viewing online, and in this case there is little we can do about it.\n\n### Are you planning to include a Video On Demand (VOD) to the playlist?\n\nNo.\n\n### Why is the channel on the iptv-org.github.io but not in the playlist?\n\nThe site contains a list of all TV channels in the world and only those of them for which we have working stream links are included in the playlists.\n\n### Can I add a radio broadcast?\n\nYes, if it is a [visual radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_radio) in which a video and audio are shown at the same time.\n\n### Why don't you accept links to Xtream Codes server?\n\nXtream Codes streams tend to be very unstable, and often links to them fail very quickly, so it's easier for us to initially exclude them from the playlist than to search for expired ones every day.\n"
