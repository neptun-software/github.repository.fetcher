          "content": "# Contributing\n\nFrom opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is\nappreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change\nthe api please create an issue first. This way we can ensure that your precious\nwork is not in vain.\n\n## Issues\n\nMost of the time, if webpack is not working correctly for you, it is a simple configuration issue.\n\nIf you are still having difficulty after looking over your configuration carefully, please post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). Questions\nthat include your webpack.config.js, relevant files, and the full error message are more likely to receive responses.\n\n**If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, please [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/new).**\n\nDo you want to fix an issue? Look at the issues with a tag of [X5: work required (PR / Help Wanted)](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/labels/X5%3A%20work%20required%20%28PR%20%2F%20Help%20Wanted%29). Each issue should be tagged with a difficulty tag -\n\n- D0: My First Commit (Contribution Difficulty)\n- D1: Easy (Contribution Difficulty)\n- D2: Medium (Contribution Difficulty)\n- D3: Hard (Contribution Difficulty)\n\n## Contributing to the webpack ecosystem\n\nIf you have created your own loader/plugin please include it on the relevant documentation pages:\n\n- [List of loaders](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/) or [awesome-webpack](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack#loaders)\n- [List of plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins) or [awesome-webpack](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack#webpack-plugins)\n\n## Setup\n\n[Setup your local webpack repository](_SETUP.md)\n\n## Submitting Changes\n\nAfter getting some feedback, push to your fork and submit a pull request. We\nmay suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives, but for small changes\nyour pull request should be accepted quickly.\n\nSomething that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:\n\n- [Write tests](./test/README.md)\n- Follow the existing coding style\n- Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)\n- For a major fix/feature make sure your PR has an issue and if it doesn't, please create one. This would help discussion with the community, and polishing ideas in case of a new feature.\n- Make sure your PR's description contains GitHub's special keyword references that automatically close the related issue when the PR is merged. ([More info](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests))\n- When you have a lot of commits in your PR, it's good practice to squash all your commits in one single commit. ([Learn how to squash here](https://davidwalsh.name/squash-commits-git))\n\n## Documentation\n\nwebpack is insanely feature rich and documentation is a huge time sink. We\ngreatly appreciate any time spent fixing typos or clarifying sections in the\ndocumentation. [See a list of issues with the documentation tag](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/labels/documentation),\nor [check out the issues on the documentation website's repository](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org/issues).\n\n## Types\n\nwebpack is statically typed using JSDoc annotation and TypeScript. If you would like to export a new type which doesn't belong to a public API, then you can do so by declaring it in `webpack/lib/index.js`.\n\n`webpack/lib/index.js`\n\n```js\n/** @typedef {import(\"./NormalModuleFactory\").ResolveData} ResolveData */\n```\n\nThen, automatically generate the type declarations by running `yarn fix` locally, and the changes you have made will be reflected in `types.d.ts`.\n\n## Discussions\n\nGitter is only for small questions. To discuss a subject in detail, please send a link to your forum or blog in the Gitter chat.\n\n## Join the development\n\n- Before you join development, please [set up the project](./_SETUP.md) on your local machine, run it and go through the application completely. Use any command you can find and see what it does. Explore.\n\n  > Don't worry ... Nothing will happen to the project or to you due to the exploring. Only thing that will happen is, you'll be more familiar with what is where and might even get some cool ideas on how to improve various aspects of the project.\n\n- If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please feel free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.\n"

The main purpose is to bundle JavaScript\nfiles for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling,\nor packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n- Bundles [ES Modules](https://www.2ality.com/2014/09/es6-modules-final.html), [CommonJS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/), and [AMD](https://github.com/amdjs/amdjs-api/wiki/AMD) modules (even combined).\n- Can create a single bundle or multiple chunks that are asynchronously loaded at runtime (to reduce initial loading time).\n- Dependencies are resolved during compilation, reducing the runtime size.\n- Loaders can preprocess files while compiling, e.g. TypeScript to JavaScript, Handlebars strings to compiled functions, images to Base64, etc.\n- Highly modular plugin system to do whatever else your application requires.\n\n### Get Started\n\nCheck out webpack's quick [**Get Started**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started) guide and the [other guides](https://webpack.js.org/guides/).\n\n### Browser Compatibility\n\nWebpack supports all browsers that are [ES5-compliant](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es5/) (IE8 and below are not supported).\nWebpack also needs `Promise` for `import()` and `require.ensure()`. If you want to support older browsers, you will need to [load a polyfill](https://webpack.js.org/guides/shimming/) before using these expressions.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Concepts</h2>\n\n### [Plugins](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/)\n\nWebpack has a [rich plugin\ninterface](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/). Most of the features\nwithin webpack itself use this plugin interface. This makes webpack very\n**flexible**.\n\n|                   Name                    |       Status       |    Install Size     | Description                                                                             |\n| :---------------------------------------: | :----------------: | :-----------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n|    [mini-css-extract-plugin][mini-css]    |  ![mini-css-npm]   |  ![mini-css-size]   | Extracts CSS into separate files.

This allows you to bundle\n**any static resource** way beyond JavaScript. You can easily [write your own\nloaders](https://webpack.js.org/api/loaders/) using Node.js.\n\nLoaders are activated by using `loadername!` prefixes in `require()` statements,\nor are automatically applied via regex from your webpack configuration.\n\n#### Files\n\n|       Name        |   Status   | Install Size | Description                                              |\n| :---------------: |

This makes webpack fast\nand incredibly **fast** on incremental compilations.\n\n### Module Formats\n\nWebpack supports ES2015+, CommonJS and AMD modules **out of the box**. It performs clever static\nanalysis on the AST of your code. It even has an evaluation engine to evaluate\nsimple expressions. This allows you to **support most existing libraries** out of the box.\n\n### [Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)\n\nWebpack allows you to split your codebase into multiple chunks. Chunks are\nloaded asynchronously at runtime. This reduces the initial loading time.\n\n### [Optimizations](https://webpack.js.org/guides/production-build/)\n\nWebpack can do many optimizations to **reduce the output size of your\nJavaScript** by deduplicating frequently used modules, minifying, and giving\nyou full control of what is loaded initially and what is loaded at runtime\nthrough code splitting. It can also make your code chunks **cache\nfriendly** by using hashes.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Contributing</h2>\n\n**We want contributing to webpack to be fun, enjoyable, and educational for anyone, and everyone.** We have a [vibrant ecosystem](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home) that spans beyond this single repo. We welcome you to check out any of the repositories in [our organization](https://github.com/webpack) or [webpack-contrib organization](https://github.com/webpack-contrib) which houses all of our loaders and plugins.\n\nContributions go far beyond pull requests and commits. Although we love giving you the opportunity to put your stamp on webpack, we also are thrilled to receive a variety of other contributions including:\n\n- [Documentation](https://github.com/webpack/webpack.js.org) updates, enhancements, designs, or bugfixes\n- Spelling or grammar fixes\n- README.md corrections or redesigns\n- Adding unit, or functional tests\n- Triaging GitHub issues -- especially determining whether an issue still persists or is reproducible.\n- [Searching #webpack on twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=webpack) and helping someone else who needs help\n- Teaching others how to contribute to one of the many webpack's repos!\n- [Blogging, speaking about, or creating tutorials](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/awesome-webpack) about one of webpack's many features.\n- Helping others in our webpack [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack).\n\nTo get started have a look at our [documentation on contributing](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf you are worried or don't know where to start, you can **always** reach out to [Sean Larkin (@TheLarkInn) on Twitter](https://twitter.com/thelarkinn) or simply submit an issue and a maintainer can help give you guidance!\n\nWe have also started a series on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/webpack) called [The Contributor's Guide to webpack](https://medium.com/webpack/contributors-guide/home). We welcome you to read it and post any questions or responses if you still need help.\n\n_Looking to speak about webpack?_ We'd **love** to review your talk abstract/CFP! You can email it to webpack [at] opencollective [dot] com and we can give pointers or tips!!!\n\n<h3 align=\"center\">Creating your own plugins and loaders</h3>\n\nIf you create a loader or plugin, we would <3 for you to open source it, and put it on npm. We follow the `x-loader`, `x-webpack-plugin` naming convention.\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Support</h2>\n\nWe consider webpack to be a low-level tool used not only individually but also layered beneath other awesome tools. Because of its flexibility, webpack isn't always the _easiest_ entry-level solution, however we do believe it is the most powerful. That said, we're always looking for ways to improve and simplify the tool without compromising functionality. If you have any ideas on ways to accomplish this, we're all ears!\n\nIf you're just getting started, take a look at [our new docs and concepts page](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/). This has a high level overview that is great for beginners!!\n\nLooking for webpack 1 docs? Please check out the old [wiki](https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/contents), but note that this deprecated version is no longer supported.\n\nIf you want to discuss something or just need help, [here is our Gitter room](https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack) where there are always individuals looking to help out!\n\nIf you are still having difficulty, we would love for you to post\na question to [StackOverflow with the webpack tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/webpack). It is much easier to answer questions that include your webpack.config.js and relevant files! So if you can provide them, we'd be extremely grateful (and more likely to help you find the answer!)\n\nIf you are twitter savvy you can tweet #webpack with your question and someone should be able to reach out and help also.\n\nIf you have discovered a 🐜 or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on GitHub.\n\n### License\n\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.io/api/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.io/projects/git%2Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fwebpack%2Fwebpack?ref=badge_large)\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Core Team</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/sokra.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/sokra\">Tobias Koppers</a>\n        <p>Core</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Founder of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/jhnns.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/jhnns\">Johannes Ewald</a>\n        <p>Loaders &amp; Plugins</p>\n        <br>\n        <p>Early adopter of webpack</p>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\" width=\"20%\" valign=\"top\">\n        <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn.png?s=150\">\n        <br>\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/TheLarkInn\">Sean T.

[@google](https://github.com/google) for [Google Web Toolkit (GWT)](http://www.gwtproject.org/), which aims to compile Java to JavaScript. It features a similar [Code Splitting](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCodeSplitting.html) as webpack.\n- [@medikoo](https://github.com/medikoo) for [modules-webmake](https://github.com/medikoo/modules-webmake), which is a similar project. webpack was born because I wanted Code Splitting for modules-webmake.

You influenced the direction...\n- [@shama](https://github.com/shama), [@jhnns](https://github.com/jhnns) and [@sokra](https://github.com/sokra) for maintaining this project\n- Everyone who has written a loader for webpack.
