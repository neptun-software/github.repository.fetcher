Definitions\n\n\"You\" means any Legal Entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Us. \"Legal Entity\" means an entity which is not a natural person. \"Affiliates\" means other Legal Entities that control, are controlled by, or under common control with that Legal Entity. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such Legal Entity, whether by contract or otherwise, (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or securities which vote to elect the management or other persons who direct such Legal Entity or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n\"Contribution\" means any work of authorship that is Submitted by You to Us in which You own or assert ownership of the Copyright. If You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship, please follow the instructions in https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md.\n\n\"Copyright\" means all rights protecting works of authorship owned or controlled by You or Your Affiliates, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence including any extensions by You.\n\n\"Material\" means the work of authorship which is made available by Us to third parties.

Grant of Rights\n\n2.1 Copyright License\n\n(a) You retain ownership of the Copyright in Your Contribution and have the same rights to use or license the Contribution which You would have had without entering into the Agreement.\n\n(b) To the maximum extent permitted by the relevant law, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Copyright covering the Contribution, with the right to sublicense such rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce, modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution as part of the Material; provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.\n\n2.2 Patent License\n\nFor patent claims including, without limitation, method, process, and apparatus claims which You or Your Affiliates own, control or have the right to grant, now or in the future, You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, transferable, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license, with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of sublicensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in combination with the Material (and portions of such combination). This license is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the licensed rights infringes such patent claims; and provided that this license is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.\n\n2.3 Outbound License\n\nBased on the grant of rights in Sections 2.1 and 2.2, if We include Your Contribution in a Material, We may license the Contribution under any license, including copyleft, permissive, commercial, or proprietary licenses. As a condition on the exercise of this right, We agree to also license the Contribution under the terms of the license or licenses which We are using for the Material on the Submission Date.\n\n2.4 Moral Rights. If moral rights apply to the Contribution, to the maximum extent permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or our successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.\n\n2.5 Our Rights. You acknowledge that We are not obligated to use Your Contribution as part of the Material and may decide to include any Contribution We consider appropriate.\n\n2.6 Reservation of Rights. Any rights not expressly licensed under this section are expressly reserved by You.\n\n## 3. Agreement\n\nYou confirm that:\n\n(a) You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement.\n\n(b) You or Your Affiliates own the Copyright and patent claims covering the Contribution which are required to grant the rights under Section 2.\n\n(c) The grant of rights under Section 2 does not violate any grant of rights which You or Your Affiliates have made to third parties.\n\n(d) You have followed the instructions in https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md, if You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship Submitted.\n\n## 4. Disclaimer\n\nEXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES IN SECTION 3, THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n## 5. Consequential Damage Waiver\n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.\n\n## 6. Miscellaneous\n\n6.1 This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Canada excluding its conflicts of law provisions. Under certain circumstances, the governing law in this section might be superseded by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (\"UN Convention\") and the parties intend to avoid the application of the UN Convention to this Agreement and, thus, exclude the application of the UN Convention in its entirety to this Agreement.\n\n6.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or understandings.\n\n6.3 If You or We assign the rights or obligations received through this Agreement to a third party, as a condition of the assignment, that third party must agree in writing to abide by all the rights and obligations in the Agreement.\n\n6.4 The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of this Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such performance at any time in the future. A waiver of performance under a provision in one situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the provision in the future or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.\n\n6.5 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and which is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.\n\nThis agreement is derived from the Project Harmony CLA generator:\nhttps://www.harmonyagreements.org/\n\nHarmony (HA-CLA-E-ANY) Version 1.0\n"

If you visit the [Markdown Here Crowdin project page](https://crowdin.net/project/markdown-here) you'll find that it's quite easy to contribute. Feel free to add new translations, improve existing ones, or even create new language categories.\n\nIf you do make any translation changes, or if you have any questions or problems, please post to the MDH Google Group or create a Github issue. (I can't figure out a way to get notified when translations are updated, so you'll have to let me know that there are new ones to integrate.)\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [Emanuele D'Osualdo](https://github.com/bordaigorl) ([TeX math rendering](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/26))\n\n* [Dustin Engstrom](https://github.com/engstrom) ([PR #151](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/pull/151))\n\n\n### Translators\n\n* [lambdalice](https://github.com/lambdalice)\n  - Provided an entire Japanese translation and forced the MDH i18n work to get done.\n\n* [Antoine Proulx](https://crowdin.com/profile/magicienap)\n\n* [ebouchut](https://crowdin.com/profile/ebouchut)\n\n* [Lennaick](https://crowdin.com/profile/lennaick)\n\n* [leftaroundabout](https://crowdin.com/profile/leftaroundabout)\n\n* [Pierre Quillery](https://crowdin.com/profile/dandelionmood)\n\n* [Ko-Chih Wu](https://crowdin.com/profile/mecca831)\n\n* [Masahiro Umegaki](https://crowdin.com/profile/ume)\n\n* [dlkgenc](https://crowdin.com/profile/dlkgenc)\n\n* [turkish123](https://crowdin.com/profile/turkish123)\n\n* [sergiolunagarcia](https://crowdin.com/profile/sergiolunagarcia)\n\n* [Alexis Morelle](https://crowdin.com/profile/almorelle)\n\n* [Eugene Fryntov](https://crowdin.com/profile/efryntov)\n\n* [Oscar del Pozo](https://crowdin.com/profile/oskar7)\n\n* [Rafa Couto](https://crowdin.com/profile/rafacouto)\n\n* [yoroy](https://crowdin.com/profile/yoroy)\n\n* [nullepart](https://crowdin.com/profile/nullepart)\n\n* [sherkiv](https://crowdin.com/profile/sherkiv)\n\n* [LeahCim](https://crowdin.com/profile/LeahCim)\n\n* [Shen-Ta Hsiea](https://github.com/ibmibmibm)\n\n* [Erik Neves](https://crowdin.com/profile/7kire)\n\n* [J.

Not one thing else.\n\nThis means that:\n- It collects no user or usage data.\n- It does not read or modify any part of any site besides the contents of the focused edit control, and only when the user tells it to do so.\n- It makes no external requests at all. All rendering is done locally.\n\n## Optional third-party: LaTeX image rendering service\n\nIf you choose to use _Markdown Here_'s LaTeX math rendering feature, the contents of your math equations will be sent to a third party to create the image containing your math. (That image is created at the time that the browser displays it, which is usually when the image element is inserted into the page). By default that third-party service is [CodeCodgs](https://www.codecogs.com/pages/agreements/privacy_policy.php) although [other services](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks#tex) may be used.\n"

It also supports syntax highlighting (just specify the language in a fenced code block).\n\nWriting email with code in it is pretty tedious. Writing Markdown with code in it is easy. I found myself writing email in Markdown in the GitHub in-browser editor, then copying the preview into email. This is a pretty absurd workflow, so I decided to create a tool to write and render Markdown right in the email.\n\nTo discover what can be done with Markdown in *Markdown Here*, check out the [Markdown Here Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet) and the other [wiki pages](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki).\n\n<sup>&dagger;: And Google Groups posts, and Blogger posts, and Evernote notes, and Wordpress posts! [See more](#compatibility).</sup><br>\n<sup>&Dagger;: And TeX mathematical formulae!</sup>\n\n![screenshot of conversion](https://raw.github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/master/store-assets/markdown-here-image1.gimp.png)\n\n### Table of Contents\n**[Installation Instructions](#installation-instructions)**<br>\n**[Usage Instructions](#usage-instructions)**<br>\n**[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)**<br>\n**[Compatibility](#compatibility)**<br>\n**[Notes and Miscellaneous](#notes-and-miscellaneous)**<br>\n**[Building the Extension Bundles](#building-the-extension-bundles)**<br>\n**[Next Steps, Credits, Feedback, License](#next-steps)**<br>\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\n### Chrome\n\n#### Chrome Web Store\n\nGo to the [Chrome Web Store page for *Markdown Here*](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/elifhakcjgalahccnjkneoccemfahfoa) and install normally.\n\nAfter installing, make sure to reload your webmail or restart Chrome!\n\n#### Manual/Development\n\n1. Clone this repo.\n2. In Chrome, open the Extensions settings. (Wrench button, Tools, Extensions.)\n3. On the Extensions settings page, click the \"Developer Mode\" checkbox.\n4. Click the now-visible \"Load unpacked extension…\" button. Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo, then the `src` directory under that.\n5. The *Markdown Here* extension should now be visible in your extensions list.\n6. Reload your webmail page (and maybe application) before trying to convert an email.\n\n### Firefox and Thunderbird\n\n#### Mozilla Add-ons site\n\nGo to the [Firefox Add-ons page for *Markdown Here*](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-here/) and install normally.\n\nOr go to the \"Tools > Add-ons\" menu and then search for \"Markdown Here\".\n\nAfter installing, make sure to restart Firefox/Thunderbird!\n\n**Note:** It takes up to a month for Mozilla to approve changes to the Firefox/Thunderbird extension, so updates (features, fixes) will lag behind what is shown here. You can manually choose to install the newest version before it's reviewed from the list of versions: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-here/versions/](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-here/versions/)\n\n#### Manual/Development\n\n1. Clone this repo.\n2. Follow the instructions in the MDN [\"Your first WebExtension\"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension#installing) article.\n\n### Safari\n\n[Download the extension directly.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/markdown-here/markdown-here.safariextz) When it has finished downloading, double click it to install.\n\n#### Preferences\n\nTo get to the Markdown Here preferences, open the Safari preferences and then go to the \"Extensions\" tab. Then click the \"Click me to show Markdown Here options\" box.\n\n### Opera\n\nNote that *Markdown Here* only works with Opera versions 16 and higher (i.e., the ones that are based on Chromium).\n\nGo to the [Opera Add-ons store page for *Markdown Here*](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/markdown-here/) and install normally.\n\nAfter installing, make sure to reload your webmail or restart Chrome!\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nInstall it, and then…\n\n1. In Chrome/Safari/Opera, *make sure* you reload your web mail page before trying to use Markdown Here.\n2. In Chrome/Firefox/Safari/Opera, log into your Gmail, Hotmail, or Yahoo account and start a new email. In Thunderbird, start a new message.\n3. Make sure you're using the rich editor.\n   * In Gmail, click the \"Rich formatting\" link, if it's visible.\n   * In Thunderbird, make sure \"Compose messages in HTML format\" is enabled in your \"Account Settings\", \"Composition & Addressing\" pane.\n4. Compose an email in Markdown. For example:\n\n   <pre>\n   **Hello** `world`.\n\n   ```javascript\n   alert('Hello syntax highlighting.');\n   ```\n   </pre>\n\n5. Right-click in the compose box and choose the \"Markdown Toggle\" item from the context menu. Or click the button that appears in your address bar. Or use the hotkey (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>ALT</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd> by default).\n6. You should see your email rendered correctly from Markdown into rich HTML.\n7. Send your awesome email to everyone you know. It will appear to them the same way it looks to you.\n\n### Revert to Markdown\n\nAfter rendering your Markdown to pretty HTML, you can still get back to your original Markdown. Just right-click anywhere in the newly rendered Markdown and click \"Markdown Toggle\" -- your email compose body will change back to the Markdown you had written.\n\nNote that any changes you make to the pretty HTML will be lost when you revert to Markdown.\n\nIn Gmail, you can also use the browser's Undo command (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd> / <kbd>CMD</kbd>+<kbd>Z</kbd>, or from the Edit menu). Be warned that you might also lose the last few characters you entered.\n\n### Replies\n\nIn Gmail, Thunderbird, and Google Groups, you can use \"Markdown Toggle\" normally: just write your reply (top, bottom, inline, wherever) and then convert. The original email that you're replying to will be left alone. (Technically: Existing `blockquote` blocks will be left intact.)\n\nIn Hotmail and Yahoo (which don't put the original in a `blockquote`), and optionally in Gmail, Thunderbird, and Google Groups, you can ensure that only the part of the reply that you wrote gets converted by selecting what you want to convert and then clicking \"Markdown Toggle\" -- see the next section.\n\n### Selection/Piecemeal Conversion\n\nSometimes you don't want to convert the entire email; sometimes your email isn't entirely Markdown. To convert only part of the email, select the text (with your mouse or keyboard), right-click on it, and click the \"Markdown Toggle\" menu item. Your selection is magically rendered into pretty HTML.\n\nTo revert back to Markdown, just put your cursor anywhere in the block of converted text, right-click, and click the \"Markdown Toggle\" menu item again. Now it's magically back to the original Markdown.\n\n![screenshot of selection conversion](https://raw.github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/master/store-assets/markdown-here-image2.gimp.png)\n\n#### Things to know about converting/reverting a selection\n\n* If you select only part of a block of text, only that text will be converted. The converted block will be wrapped in a paragraph element, so the original line will be broken up. You probably don't want to ever do this.\n\n* You can select and revert multiple converted blocks at the same time. One upshot of this is that you can select your entire email, click \"Markdown Toggle\", and all portions of it that you had converted will be reverted.\n\n* If you don't have anything selected when you click \"Markdown Toggle\", *Markdown Here* will check if there are converted blocks anywhere in the message and revert them. If there no converted blocks are found, it will convert the entire email.\n\n### Options\n\nThe *Markdown Here* Options page can be accessed via the Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Thunderbird extensions list. The available options include:\n\n* Styling modifications for the rendered Markdown.\n* Syntax highlighting theme selection and modification.\n* TeX math formulae processing enabling and customization.\n* What the hotkey should be.\n\nFor Chrome and Firefox, any changes made in the *Markdown Here* Options are automatically synchronized between your other installations of that browser (if you have the sync feature enabled in the browser).\n\n![screenshot of options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/adam-p/markdown-here/master/store-assets/markdown-here-chrome-options-1.gimp.png)\n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSee the [Troubleshooting wiki page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Troubleshooting).\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\nSee the [Compatibility wiki page](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Compatibility).\n\n\n## Notes and Miscellaneous\n\n* *Markdown Here* uses [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/), with the limitation that GFM special links are not supported ([issue #11](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/11)); nor will they be, as MDH is not Github-specific.\n\n* Available languages for syntax highlighting (and the way they should be written in the fenced code block) can be seen on the [highlight.js demo page](https://highlightjs.org/demo).\n\n* Images embedded inline in your Markdown will be retained when you \"Markdown Toggle\". Gmail allows you to put images inline in your email -- this can be much easier than referencing an external image.\n\n* Email signatures are automatically excluded from conversion. Specifically, anything after the semi-standard `'-- '` (note the trailing space) is left alone.\n  * Note that Hotmail and Yahoo do *not* automatically add the `'-- '` to signatures, so you have to add it yourself.\n\n* The \"Markdown Toggle\" menu item shows up for more element types than it can correctly render. This is intended to help people realize that they're not using a rich editor. Otherwise they just don't see the menu item and don't know why.\n\n* Styling:\n  * The use of browser-specific styles (-moz-, -webkit-) should be avoided. If used, they may not render correctly for people reading the email in a different browser from the one where the email was sent.\n  * The use of state-dependent styles (like `a:hover`) don't work because they don't match at the time the styles are made explicit. (In email, styles must be explicitly applied to all elements -- stylesheets get stripped.)\n\n* For more tweaky features, visit the [Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks) section.\n\n## Building the Extension Bundles\n\n```\ncd utils\nnode build.js\n```\n\n\n### Chrome, Opera, and Firefox (WebExtension) extension\n\nCreate a file with a `.zip` extension containing these files and directories:\n\n```\nmanifest.json\ncommon/\nchrome/\n_locales\n```\n\n### Thunderbird (XUL) extension\n\nCreate a file with a `.xpi` extension containing these files and directories:\n\n```\nchrome.manifest\ninstall.rdf\ncommon/\nfirefox/\n```\n\n### Safari extension\n\nThe browser-specific code is located in the [`markdown-here-safari`](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here-safari) project.\n\nUse the Safari Extension Builder.\n\n## Next Steps\n\nSee the [issues list](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues) and the [Notes Wiki](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Development-Notes). All ideas, bugs, plans, complaints, and dreams will end up in one of those two places.\n\nFeel free to create a feature request issue if what you want isn't already there. If you'd prefer a less formal approach to floating an idea, post to our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/discussions).\n\nIt also takes a fair bit of work to stay up-to-date with the latest changes in all the applications and web sites where Markdown Here works.\n\n## Credits\n\n*Markdown Here* was coded on the shoulders of giants.\n\n* Markdown-to-HTML: [chjj/marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked)\n* Syntax highlighting: [isagalaev/highlight.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js)\n* HTML-to-text: [mtrimpe/jsHtmlToText](https://github.com/mtrimpe/jsHtmlToText)\n\n## Feedback\n\nAll bugs, feature requests, pull requests, feedback, etc., are welcome.
