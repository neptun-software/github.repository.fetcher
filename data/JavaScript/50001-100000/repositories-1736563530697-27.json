At this point it's a good idea to submit it as a bug report. Just keep in mind the following suggestions.\n\n### Creating Bug Reports\n\n[Github Issues Tracker](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues) is used to track all upcoming milestones and changes to the project.\n\n**Please create a fork of this [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/ca0rovs3/) to demonstrate bugs.**\n\nWhen submiting a bug report, include a set of steps to reproduce the issue and any related information, browser, OS etc. If we can't reproduce the issue then it will make solving things much more difficult.\n\nIf your bug uses a third party framework like Ember, Meteor, or Angular. Be sure to submit the issue to their respective issues boards. If you are confident the bug is part of the 'vanilla' SUI release, keep in mind not all maintainers are familiar with all framework and a simple test case is greatly appreciated.\n\nIf your bug is reproduced by a maintainer it will be assigned the [`confirmed bug`](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Confirmed+Bug%22) tag. Browsing this tag is a good way to keep track of known issues with SUI.\n\n#### Naming Issues\n\nSemantic UI boards use a special naming convention to help tag issue titles by the component the issue is related to.\n\n##### Bugs\nPlease tag titles in the format \"[Component] *Sub-type* should do *correct behavior*\". Please use standard [title case](http://www.titlecase.com) for titles, including the bracketed tag.\n\nFor example\n* [Dropdown] Multiple Selection Should Preserve \"Set Selected\" Order\n* [Validation] - E-mail Validation Should Handle Cyrillic\n* [Button] - Grouped Buttons Should Display Correctly on Mobile\n\n##### Enhancements\n\nFor new feature requests, you can use the format \"[Component] Add *new feature*\"\n\nFor example\n* [Dropdown] Add \"Clearable\" Setting\n* [Validation] Add Rules for Zipcode Validation\n* [API] Add \"onProgress\" callback setting\n\n\n### Tracking Issue Progress\n\nAs bugs and features are triaged they will be assigned to milestones. The best indication of when a change will land is to check the date on the  [upcoming milestones](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/milestones) page.\n\n### Creating Pull Requests\n\n**All pull requests should be merged into the `next` branch.**\n\nAnyone can jump on the issues board and grab off bugs to fix. This is probably the best way to become a contributor to Semantic. Be sure to adhere to the style guides when submitting code.\n\n* [Create a Pull Request](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/compare)\n* [View Open Issues](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues)\n"

Please reach out to me at jack@semantic-ui.com with bug reports\n\n**Critical Fix**\n- **CSS** - Fix extra semicolon causing CSS build of Semantic UI to fail compilation with various systems #7065 [React Issue](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/issues/4287) [CSS Repo Issue #81](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-CSS/issues/81) [CSS Issue #75](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-CSS/issues/75)\n\n**Breaking Changes**\n- **Gulp 4** -All tasks have been rewritten to work with Gulp 4. This should fix SUI to install correctly on Node 12 or greater (see [Gulp3 Issue](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2324) for more details)\n\n**Build**\n- **Node** - Updated scripts to build in Node 18 via vanilla install.\n- **Theme** - Allow site's global site theme to be missing #6876 **Thanks @cruzdanillo**\n- **Meteor** - Fix issue with misuse of `api.addAssets` #6790 **Thanks @gimco**\n- **Gulp** - Report errors in build #7005 **Thanks @bundyo**\n\n**Examples**\n- **Modal** - Fixed mutation observer was not properly disconnected\n- **Sticky** - Adds new example for sticky to highlight behavior when sticky/context height varies\n\n**Bug Fixes**\n- **Dropdown** - Fix issue where dropdown menu could not open to right when in `right menu` inside a `ui menu` (See examples/sticky.html) for use-case\n- **Sticky** - Fix issue where element might be `bound bottom` (fixed to bottom of context) if the sticky element is larger than the context\n- **Sticky** - Fix issue when sticky size is larger than context size caused context `min-height` not to be set correctly.\n- **Button** - Fix usage of loading on in labeled button #7023 thanks @flppv\n\n### Version 2.4.2 - Oct 21, 2018\n\n**Build**\n- Fix issue that could prevent `gulp build` from running due to updates to gulp dependencies **Thanks for assistance @himanshu230** [#6631](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6631) [#6622](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6622) [#6067](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6067)\n\n### Version 2.4.1 - Oct 13, 2018\n\n**Note**\n> If you are using the `semantic-ui-less` package with versions of LESS before 3.5 some `calc` values will not be computed correctly due to changes in variable interpolation. It is recommended that you upgrade to at least 3.5 to continue using new versions of SUI. For more information see [#6512](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6512)\n\n**Build**\n- **LESS** - SUI now supports less versions greater than `3.5.0` **Thanks @sciyoshi** [#6512](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6512)\n- **Gulp** - Migrated deprecated `gulp-util` to `replace-ext` **Thanks @stevelacy** [#6322](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6322)\n- **Gulp** - Updated all gulp dependencies to most recent released versions with modifications to tasks as necessary.\n\n**Bug Fixes**\n- **Dropdown** - `clearable` dropdown now works with dropdown that arent `on:click`, like `hover` or `manual` triggers. [#6594](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6594)\n- **Modal** - Fixed `fullscreen modal` having incorrect left offset with flex modals [#6587](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6587)\n- **Embed** - Embed will now correctly remove DOM metadata on `destroy`\n- **Grid** - Fix issue with `very relaxed vertically divided grid` having wrong margins on dividers\n\n### Version 2.4.0 - Sep 17, 2018\n\n> `2.4.0` includes a new component `placeholder`. To use this component in your existing SUI site, be sure to add `@placeholder: 'default';` to your `theme.config`. You can see an example in `theme.config.example`\n\n**New Components**\n- **Placeholder** - Added `ui placeholder` that can be used to show where content will soon appear.\n\n**New UI Type**\n- **Segment** - Added new `ui placeholder segment` used to reserve space for UI when content is missing or empty.\n\n**Major Enhancements**\n- **Dropdown** - Added `clearable` dropdowns. When `clearable: true` is specified an (X) will appear to clear dropdown selection [#2072](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2072)\n- **Modal/Dimmer** - Modals and dimmers now include a new setting `useFlex` which defaults to `auto`. Modals and dimmers will automatically revert to using non-flex layouts when there may be layout issues with using flexbox. Modals will fall back to JS position when `detachable: false` is used or with IE11/Edge (Absolutely positioned elements inside flex containers in IE behave differently).\n\n**Critical Bugs**\n- **Modal** - Fixed issue where `scrolling modal` would not allow for scrolling with touch devices. [#6449](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6449)\n- **Label** - Fixed issue where `basic label` were appearing incorrectly **Thanks @lasley / @ColinFrick** [#6582](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6582) [#6440](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6440)\n- **Menu/Dropdown** - Fixed `left menu` inside `ui menu` would display horizontally as `flex` [#6359](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6359)\n\n**Bugs**\n- **Dimmer** - Dimmer now sets `variation` at runtime, to support run-time swapping between `top aligned` and `middle aligned` using `.dimmer('setting', 'variation', 'top aligned')`\n- **Dropdown** - Fixed issue where `onChange` when used with `action: hide` would be missing the third param `$item` [#6555](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6555)\n- **Flag** - Add `uk` alias for `united kingdom` **Thanks @PhilipGarnero** [#6531](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6531)\n- **Icon** - Fixes missing `disk outline icon` alias [#6556](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6556)\n- **List** - Fixed issue where list `content` would not take up 100% width when used alongside `img` or `icon`\n- **Menu/Dropdown** - Fixes dropdown item margin not obeyed inside `labeled icon menu` [#6557](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6557)\n- **Modal** - Fixes `@mobileTopAlignedMargin` theming variable was not implemented\n- **Modal** - Modal now will remove `blurring` after undimming, to prevent issues with `position: fixed` [#6520](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6520)\n\n**Minor Changes**\n- **Dropdown** - `inline dropdown` `close icon` default right margin default spacing slightly modified.\n\n\n### Version 2.3.3 - July 8th, 2018\n\n**Bug Fixes**\n- **Search** - Passing in `cache: false` will now affect default settings for `apiSettings` when using a remote endpoint. Previously you would also have to pass in `apiSettings: { cache: false}` as well\n- **CSS** - Update LESS syntax to be compatible with LESS 3.0 **Thanks @sciyoshi** [#6447](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/pull/6447)\n- **Icon** - Several icon names have been deprecated due to incompatibility with `transition in` and `transition out` used in animations.\n\n* `linkedin in` is now `linkedin alternate`\n* `zoom in` is now `zoom-in`\n* `zoom out` is now `zoom-out`\n* `sign in` is now `sign-in`\n* `sign out` is now `sign-out`\n* `log out` is now `logout`\n* `in cart` is now `in-cart`\n\n### Version 2.3.2 - June 18, 2018\n\n**Enhancements**\n- **Modal** - Modal and Dimmer now prevent background page from scrolling on mobile or where touch events are present\n- **Button** - Add `inverted` and `inverted basic` variations for `primary` and `secondary` buttons  **Thanks @hammy2899** [#6242](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6242)\n\n**Theming**\n- **Global** - Add `hover` `down` `active` and `focus` variables for `@invertedPrimaryColor` and `@invertedSecondaryColor`\n\n**Bugs**\n- **Dropdown** Fixed bug that could cause dropdown to recursively trigger network requests specifically when using `apiSettings` with a url that returns valid response but with no results when clicking directly on the `dropdown icon`. **Thanks @vpeti** [#5231](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/5231) [#5809](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/5809)\n- **Statistics** - Fix issue where grouped statistics would have excess bottom margin if they are `:last-child`\n- **Label** - Fix `basic label` does not use `@basicBackground` variables **Thanks @levithomson**\n- **Modal** - Modal will not refocus a field if field is already focused **Thanks @nikolaybobrovskiy** [#6301](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6301)\n- **Icon** - Fix `wechat icon` not displaying due to typo **Thanks @alex-karo** [#6429](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6429)\n\n### Version 2.3.1 - Mar 18, 2018\n\n> **A Special Message about Flex Modals**\n> There will be an update shortly to resolve issues related to flex modals when using multiple modals and `detachable: false`, in order to not hold up this release, we've decided to move forward without a fix.\n\n> A general solution will most likely require branching code for IE11 which will disable flex (as IE11 doesnt correctly implement the latest spec for [absolute positioned flex containers](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2016/06/absolute-positioned-children)).\n\n**Critical Bugs**\n- **Dropdown** - Fixed issue in `2.3.0` that could cause multiselect dropdowns initialized by converting `<select>` to not add initial selected options. [#6123](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6123)\n- **Search** - Fixes using category search with `fullTextSearch: 'exact'` **@Thanks @prudho** returning duplicate results [#6223](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6223) [#6221](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6221)\n- **Icon** - Fixes `centered` and `bordered` icons appearing incorrectly with FA5 **Thanks @w96k** [#6192](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6192)\n- **Icons** - Fixes missing aliases/incorrect icons from Font Awesome 5 port in `2.3.0` **Thanks hammy2899** [#6181](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6181) [#6175](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6175) [#6176](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6176) [#6174](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6174) [#6175](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6175)\n- **Icons** - Fixed issue where `link icon` were appearing incorrectly due to changes in icons [#6180](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6180)\n\n**Enhancements**\n- **Search** - Adds disabled variation **Thanks @prudho** [#6225](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6225)\n- **Form Validation** - Form can now return their validation prompt dynamically based on their current value. **Thanks @xDaizu** [#6016](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6016) [#3864](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3864)\n\n**Bugs**\n- **Dropdown** - Fixed `onChange` missing `text` from callback when dropdown is set to `action: 'select'` **Thanks @martinduparc**  [#4183](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4183) [#4510](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4510)\n- **Icons** - Fixes some icons that were incorrectly named. **Thanks hammy2899** [#6181](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6181)\n- **Icons** - Added ability to choose whether solid, outline and brand icons should be included in your theme via the `@importSolidIcons`, `importRegularIcons` and `@importBrandIcons` variables **Thanks hammy2899**\n- **Icons** - Increased specifity on `fitted icon` to fix compatibility with other components [#6125](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6125)\n- **Visibility** - Fixed bug that could cause `onScreen` callback to not occur properly for elements that are taller than screen.\n- **Menu** - Fixes `disabled item` showing hover style for `secondary menu` **Thanks @tcmal** [#6268](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6268)\n- **CSS Variables** - Added use of `@normal` for normal font weight for all non-default themes included in repo. [#6227](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6227)\n- **Image** - Fixes margin being applied twice to `ui images` [#6224](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6224)\n- **Reveal** - Fix `whitespace: nowrap;` applying to content inside `slide reveal` and `move reveal`\n\n**Docs**\n- Fixes CDN links in docs **Thanks @KSH-code**\n- Fixed issue where iframes may not load correctly in `/examples/theming.html` #6269\n\n### Version 2.3.0 - Feb 20, 2018\n\n**Major Enhancements**\n- **Icons** - Font Awesome 5 is now included in Semantic UI **Thanks @hammy2899** [#6085](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/6085)\n\n- **Search** - Category search can now work with local search by adding a `category` property to any result and specifying `type: 'category'`\n\n```javascript\n  var categoryContent = [\n    { category: 'South America', title: 'Brazil' },\n    { category: 'South America', title: 'Peru' },\n    { category: 'North America', title: 'Canada' },\n    { category: 'Asia', title: 'South Korea' },\n    { category: 'Asia', title: 'Japan' },\n    { category: 'Asia', title: 'China' },\n    { category: 'Europe', title: 'Denmark' },\n    { category: 'Europe', title: 'England' },\n    { category: 'Europe', title: 'France' },\n    { category: 'Europe', title: 'Germany' },\n    { category: 'Africa', title: 'Ethiopia' },\n    { category: 'Africa', title: 'Nigeria' },\n    { category: 'Africa', title: 'Zimbabwe' },\n  ];\n  $('.ui.search')\n    .search({\n      type: 'category',\n      source: categoryContent\n    })\n  ;\n```\n\n- **Popup** - Popup can now position elements correctly even when they have a different offset context than their activating element. Like in [this example](https://jsfiddle.net/g853mc03/).\n\n- **Popup** - Popup will now align the center of the arrow (not the edge of the popup) when it would be reasonable (up to 2x arrow's offset from edge). [See this explanation](http://oi66.tinypic.com/2zr2ckk.jpg)\n\nTo preserve functionality `movePopup` default has remained as `true` (moving the popup to the same offset context), however now setting `movePopup: false` should now always position correctly. Be sure to use `movePopup: true` to avoid issues with `ui popup` inside `menu`, `input` or other places where it may inherit rules from its activating element or its context.\n\n- **Transition** - Adds new `glow` transition for highlighting an element on the page, and `zoom` animation for scaling elements without opacity tween.\n\n- **Modal** - Modal has been rewritten to use `flexbox`. No need to call `refresh()` to recalculate vertical centering.\n\n- **Modal** - Modals now have a setting `centered` which can be used to disable vertical centering.

This can be used to specify the offsetParent of the sticky element and avoid having to calculate on initialization (improving performance)\n- **Progress** - Progress now includes transitionEnd failback for progress bar animations, this will prevent labels from continuing to be updated if the `transitionEnd` css callback does not fire correctly\n- **Transition** - You can now specify `data-display` to specify the final display state for an animation in cases that it is detected incorrectly (you can also pass in as a setting)\n\n### Version 2.2.4 - August 25, 2016\n\n**Critical Bug**\n- **Search** - Fixed issue where keyboard navigation for search was broken in `2.2.3` due to regression [#4469](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4469)\n\n**Bugs**\n- **Build Tools** - Removed unnecessary `gulp-minify-css` package from deps [#4463](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4463)\n\n**Enhancements**\n- **Message** - Added additional variables for `@padding`\n\n### Version 2.2.3 - August 21, 2016\n\n**Enhancements**\n- **Form Validation** - Bracketed notation can now be omitted for rules, instead passing in bracketed values with the `value` parameter [#3313](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3313)\n- **Dropdown** - Using `search selection` with `selectOnKeydown` will now highlight the partial search matching the currently keyboard selected value\n- **Modal** - Modal now includes setting to enable/disable keyboard shortcuts\n- **Modal** - Modal will now focus first tabable element, not just `input` [#4370](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4370)\n\n**Bugs**\n- **Comments** - Adds missing sizes (mini, tiny etc) **Thanks @ilanus** [#4408](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4408)\n- **NPM** - Fixed `package.json` to allow either jQuery `2.x` or `3.x` [#4254](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4254)\n- **Button/Dropdown** - Fixed issue where `ui dropdown button` could have incorrect spacing for dropdown icon **Thanks @ilanus** [#4408](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4408)\n- **Form/Segment** - Fix typo causing `pointer-events: none` no to work on `loading segment` and `loading form`  **Thanks @YamiOdymel and @ilanus** [#4403](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4403)\n- **Icon** - `icons` can now receive `link` styling  **Thanks @tbracken** [#4399](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4399)\n- **Button** - Fixed `vertical buttons` with only 1 button having incorrect border radius **Thanks @Denhai** [#4107](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4107)\n- **Grid** - Fixed issue where `(x) aligned column` inside a `(x) aligned row` would not properly apply the `column` alignment\n- **Form** - Fixed issue where `disabled fields` with radio inputs would not correctly dim the label **Thanks @louwers** [#4366](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4366)\n- **Menu** - Fixed issue where `dropdown` in `vertical menu` would not correctly open `upward` when no space below **Thanks @gdaunton** [#4150 [#4156](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4156)\n- **Dropdown** - Using `search selection with `selectOnKeydown` and text content that includes html, will not apply html content (like images) to the text until dropdown blur, making sure that content can align correctly with the partial search content of the search input (which cannot include HTML)\n- **Dropdown** - Fixed issue where dropdown `clear` would not remove active state when `useLabels: true` and multiple dropdown **Thanks vinh123456789** [#4275](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4275) [#4366](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/89**)\n- **Dropdown** - `dropdown icon` no longer relies on stopping event propagation. This means using the dropdown icon will now cause other dropdowns to correctly hide. [#3998](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3998)\n- **Dropdown** - Fixes `action: select` not working correctly since `2.2` due to incorrect use of new function signature.

This can be useful for preventing known errors, like a popup which cannot place itself on screen, or `sticky` content which initializes before it is visible [#3713](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3713)\n- **All UI** - All UI now include _all_ sizing variations, `mini`, `tiny`, `small`, `large`, `big`, `huge`, `massive`. Headers remain with only 5 sizes `small-huge` to match `H1-H5`\n- **All UI** - Components that use event handlers on `document`, `body`, or a `settings.context` now all use DOM mutation observers to detect removal and prevent memory leaks\n- **Button** - Added compatibility with `primary` `secondary` `positive` `negative` buttons with the `basic` styling variation. [#3756](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3756)\n- **Card** - Added `raised` card variation **Thanks @yordis** [#2955](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2955)\n- **Dropdown** - All dropdowns, not just `selection dropdown`, will now select the first `menu item` that starts with a pressed keyboard key, for example \"N\" will select \"New\"\n- **Dropdown** - Dropdown now changes user selection on keyboard shortcuts immediately, this will save the extra `enter` key press to confirm selection in most cases. To enable previous pre `2.2` selection style use the setting `selectOnKeydown: false`\n- **Dropdown** - Dropdown will now automatically focus on `search` inside of a dropdown menu after it is opened.\n- **Dropdown** - Multiple select dropdown now sizes current dropdown input based on rendered width of a hidden element, not using an estimate based on character count. This means search will never break to a second line earlier than would normally fit in current line.\n- **Icons** -  Icons now use the latest Font Awesome `4.6.3` Icons. 80+ new icons+ are included. Thanks @BreadMaker for the PR and @davegandy for the font!\n- **Popup** - Added new `tooltip` popup type that works without javascript. Tooltips can specify positioning and some variations using `data` attributes, and will handle positioning automatically with CSS only.\n- **Progress** - Progress now uses a polling interval for updates. Rapidly updating the progress bar over a period quicker than the animation duration (for example with xhr `onprogress` events say every 50ms) will now appear smooth as butter.\n- **Table** - `definition table` now includes additional class names for forcing, or ignoring definition cell styles\n\n**New Settings**\n- **Build Tools** - Added new `autoInstall` option to allow for Semantic to be installed without user interaction. See [docs explanation](http://www.semantic-ui.com/introduction/advanced-usage.html[#Auto](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/Auto)-Install) for how to use. [#3616](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3616) **Thanks @algorithme**\n- **Dropdown** - Added `fullSearchSearch: 'exact'` setting, which requires exact matches for dropdown values [#3085](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3085) [#3994](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3994) **Thanks @ShawnCholeva**\n- **Dropdown** - Added new setting for search selection `hideAdditions` this will remove showing user additions inside the menu, making for a more intuitive adding process. Dropdowns now have a new state `empty` which will format an active dropdown with empty results. [#3791](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3791)\n- **Dropdown** - Adds new `allowReselection` option to trigger `onChange` events even when reselecting same value\n- **Dropdown** - Adds new setting `minCharacters` which sets the minimum number of characters required to start filtering results [#3886](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3886)\n\n- **Form Validation** - Added `depends` validation rule setting which will only validate a field if another specified field is not empty\n- **Popup** - Added new setting `boundary` and `scrollContext`. `boundary` lets you specify an element that the popup will try to position itself to be contained inside of. `scrollContext` lets you specify the element which when scrolled should hide the popup\n- **Popup** - Added new settings `observeChanges`, which is enabled by default. This will add special mutation observers to trigger `destroy` when the element is removed from the document, preventing memory leaks.\n- **Progress** - Added `onLabelUpdate` callback, this can be used to specify the exact text that should appear on the actual progress update, perhaps based on some external conditions\n- **Rating** - Added new setting `fireOnInit` for rating, which defaults to `false`. When set to true `onRate` will fire when rating is initialized [#3712](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3712)\n- **Search** - Added a new option `selectFirstResult`, which defaults to `false`. Will automatically highlight first result on search\n- **Search** - Search now includes a `showNoResults` setting for determining whether no results messages should be shown\n- **Shape** - Shape now lets you specify next side width using setting `width`, can use `next` or `initial` to specify whether it should use old or new side size\n- **Tab** - Added new setting `cacheType`, can either be `html` or `response` (default). HTML will cache resulting html after callbacks, `response` will cache the original response so that it can be played back identically on future loads [#2534](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2534)\n- **Tab** - Added new option `deactivate`, defaults to `siblings` which will only deactivate tab activators that are DOM siblings elements to the activating element. Setting it to <code>'all'</code> will deactivate any other tab element initialized at the same time.\n- **Visibility** - Added `onFixed` and `onUnfixed` callbacks for visibility `type: 'fixed'`\n- **Visibility** - Added `onLoad` and `onAllLoaded` callback for `type: 'image'` visibility\n- **Visibility** - Added `zIndex` setting for specifying zindex with `type: 'fixed'` [#3370](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3370)\n\n**New Behaviors**\n- **Dropdown** - Added new convenience method `restore placeholder text`\n- **Image** - `transition hidden image` now shows correctly as `visibility: hidden;` and not `display: none`. This will allow `offset` with `visibility` and `sticky` to work more seamlessly. `hidden image` will still remain `display: none;`\n- **Progress** - Added progress `is complete` for returning whether success, warning, or error conditions are met\n\n**CSS Enhancements**\n- **All UI** Extended variables which return exact pixel values in em (`@relativePX` and @px) up to 64px to allow for simple theming with exact values\n- **Button** - Added variables for configuring `disabled` background image and box shadow.\n- **Site** - Added colored box shadow defaults. `ui message` now includes individual colored border shadows based on new site defaults.\n- **Site** - Added new `@inputColor` and `@inputPlaceholderColor` global variables that now control placeholder text styles across all components.\n- **Table** - `definition table` now supports `definition` variation to specify definition styles on an element that is not `:first-child`\n- **Table** - `definition table` now supports `ignored` variation to force a `first-child` to ignore its default definition stylings\n\n**Critical Bug Fixes**\n- **All UI** - Using `component('setting, {})` to add multiple settings as an object literal, for example `error: {}`, will now deep extend the existing object instead of replacing it.\n- **API** - `beforeSend` would not correctly cancel request when `return false;` is used in callback. [#3660](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3660)\n- **API** - `cache: 'local'` would not return the localstorage cached results in some cases\n- **Divider** - Descenders like \"g\" are cut off in `horizontal divider` [#3585](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3585)\n- **Dropdown** - `forceSelection` will now automatically select values with multi dropdowns. When using `userAdditions` setting it will now automatically tokenize the current entered value\n- **Dropdown** - `search selection` would not let you move back in an entered search string with left arrow [#3596](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3596) **Thanks @Sanjo**\n- **Dropdown** - Fixed issue where value set using javascript DOM metadata would be cleared when a message or user addition triggered `refresh` [#3879](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3879) [#3622](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3622) **Thanks @mdehoog**\n- **Form Validation / Dropdown** - Using \"enter\" key in a `search dropdown` could cause a form to be submitted [#3676](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3676)\n- **Form Validation** - Fix issue with some foreign email addresses with extended charsets causing email validation to fail [#3955](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3955) [#3755](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3755)\n- **Form Validation** - Revalidating a field `on: blur` could cause fields not yet interacted with to be validated [#3606](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3606)\n- **Form** - Fixed issue with `(x) fields` and `equal width` fields where middle rows would be slightly smaller because they include both left and right padding in % width. (Edges only have one side padding). Field groups now use negative margins instead.\n- **Popup** - Fixed issue where clicking element inside popup removed from DOM (like clicking a multi select label) would cause popup to close [#3887](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3887)\n- **Rail** - Fixed incorrect width for `close rail` and `very close rail` caused by variable addition with mixed units `px` + `em` [#3835](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3835)\n- **Search** - Fixed bug where a previously XHR query could cause the next one to fail depending on the latency of the request [#2779](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2779)\n- **Search** - Fixed an issue where `onResult` returning `false` would not prevent the search menu from hiding. Clicking on an empty results message will also no longer close the search results. [#3856](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3856) [#3870](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3870)\n- **Sticky/Visibility** -  Added mutation observer to teardown element with `destroy` if removed from DOM context, fixing a possible memory leak\n- **Video** - Fixed issue with `.video('change')` behavior not properly changing video.\n\n**Bugs**\n- **API** - Using `onResponse` with `dataType` other than JSON or JSONP would cause an error. (Not allowing plain text responses to be translated) [#3653](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3653)\n- **Build Tools** - Fixed gulp help text incorrect for RTL tasks in build tools [#3858](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3858)\n- **Button** - `right icon` like `right arrow icon` would have additional margin inside an `icon button` [#3525](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3525)\n- **Button** - Fixed issue where `disabled loading button` would not remove `pointer-events` [#2933](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2933)\n- **Button** - Fixed typo in `green inverted button` [#3873](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3873)\n- **Button/Dropdown** - Button dropdowns using `default text` no longer receive incorrect font styling for placeholder text\n- **Checkbox** - Fixed issue where docs refer to `onEnable` and `onDisable` with checkbox but callback was called `onEnabled` and `onDisabled`, both callbacks will now be valid until 3.0 [#3761](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3761) [#3763](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3763)\n- **Checkbox** - Radio buttons received `indeterminate` styles when user has not yet interacted with the page in Chrome\n- **Dropdown** - `apiSettings` was not defaulting to use `cache: 'local'` as specified in the docs\n- **Dropdown** - `get value` would not return correct value when value was blank [#3766](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3766)\n- **Dropdown** - Added `1px` offset for current text so that the blinking text position cursor does not overlap first pixel of underlayed text.\n- **Dropdown** - Dropdown would open when an label delete x was clicked when not using `search selection` [#3789](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3789)\n- **Dropdown** - Dropdowns no longer re-open on selection when nested inside of a `<label>` [#3917](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3917)\n- **Dropdown** - Dropdowns with sub-menus would not properly activate on mobile [#3183](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3183)\n- **Dropdown** - Fixed bug where using `action: 'hide'` could cause `text` value not to be passed to `onChange` callback\n- **Dropdown** - Fixed issue where values with `\"` (double quotes) would not work with a dropdown using a select, because value would not be encoded as html entities\n- **Dropdown** - Long dropdown text entry with `allowAdditions` would cause input to mistakingly drop to next line early [#3743](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3743)\n- **Dropdown** - Regenerated dropdown will no longer ignore `disabled` property [#4010](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4010) **Thanks @eymengunay!**\n- **Dropdown** - Search selection would lose search input focus when clicking on a choice [#3790](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3790)\n- **Embed** - `API` setting is now disabled by default\n- **Form Validation** - Fixed issue where initializing form multiple times would not properly call `destroy` removing previous settings [#3798](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3798)\n- **Form** - Fix `equal width fields` sometimes not including right field spacing on mobile [#3913](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3913)\n- **Form** - Fixed issue where `inline` field was not being correctly inverted in color with `inverted form` [#4004](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4004) [#4005](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/4005) **Thanks @tbracken**\n- **Form** - Grouped `fields` and `field` would cause different margin collapse, making `fields` include larger gaps between content [#3717](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3717)\n- **Form** - Remove deprecated `size()` method in `prompt` [#3655](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/3655) **Thanks @SimonArdrey**\n- **Grid** - `centered` content would cause `justified` content to appear aligned left.

[#2520](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2520)\n- **Checkbox** - Fixed issue in chrome where radio checkbox would appear incorrectly when no default value was selected [#2505](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2505)\n- **Dropdown** - Fixed transparent tap color not being set correctly.

[#2524](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2524)\n- **Checkbox** - Fixed issue where radio checkbox were not properly receiving `checked` class [#2506](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI/issues/2506)\n- **Tab** - Tab now correctly obeys `cache` setting.

This is because `flex` rules require parent styling that the previous `table-row` rules did not.\n- **Modal** - Modal will now only close on buttons matching `deny` or `approve` selector. Any button that should hide modal on click should either match one of these selectors, or call `$('.ui.modal').modal('hide')` `onclick`.\n- **Grid** - `page grid` has been deprecated.  `page grids` used percentage gutters which made it unnecessarily difficult to style responsive page content. Moving forward we recommend using `ui container` a fixed width responsive container for holding page contents.\n- **Dropdown** - Dropdowns will now change opening directions automatically based on available screen space. If you need  to force a dropdown direction use `dropdown({ direction: 'upward'})`\n- **Form Validation** - Form validation now passes settings through a `fields` object. This is to make form initialization match other components. The previous syntax will continue to work but will produce deprecation notices in console\n- **Checkbox** - Checkbox `fireOnInit` now defaults to false. Checkboxes now also *do not require javascript* to function.\n- **Dropdown** - Dropdown item `description` now are floated in default theme and should be included before other `item` content\n- **Form** - `grouped inline field` no longer display horizontally. Use `inline field` instead for horizontal inline field groups.\n- **Input** - `pointer-events` have been removed from `icon` in `icon input` unless a `link icon` is used. This is to make sure the hitbox for focusing an input includes the icon.\n- **Popup** - Popups are no longer exclusive by default. Opening a popup will not necessarily close other visible popups. You can change this behavior by using the setting `exclusive: true`. Additionally the default theme now uses `1rem` size for standard popups.\n- **Colors** - Default colors have been adjusted, which may cause slight changes in your design. New colors have also been added to fill in missing gaps in [color naming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity_and_the_color_naming_debate#Berlin_and_Kay).\n- **Segment** - Segment no longer includes a [clearfix](http://learnlayout.com/clearfix.html) by default. You will need to specify a `clearing segment` to clear floated content.\n- **Rail** - Rail now uses `border-box` instead of `content-box`. This means manually specified rail widths will now need to account for padding. This was added to fix issues where rail `height: 100%` would incorrectly match content when a rail had padding.\n- **Menu** - `tiered menu` has been removed in `2.0`. This may be rewritten in the future, but was not up to the standards of the rest of the library and has been removed.\n- **Tab** - `onTabInit` and `onTabLoad` have been renamed to `onFirstLoad` and `onLoad` respectively. This is to conform to the naming conventions of other modules (no self reference). Previous callbacks will continue to work but will produce deprecation notices in console. Two new callbacks `onVisible` and `onRequest` have been added as well.\n- **Button** - `wide` variations using numbers `2 wide`, `3 wide` have been removed due to incompatibilities with some build tools. Please use `two wide`, or `three wide` instead.\n- **Video** - The undocumented `video` module has been renamed to `embed`. Behaviors remain the same, but users need to adjust their javascript init to `$('.ui.embed').embed();`\n- **API** - API `onFailure` will now be called **in all failure conditions**, when a request is errored (504, 404 etc), aborted (page change or CORS), or JSON does not pass `successTest` function. `onError` and `onAbort` will also fire for each specific failure condition.\n\n**New UI**\n- **Container** - Containers are fixed width containers meant for holding page contents, and are a simpler alternative to `ui page grid`, view more [examples in docs](http://www.semantic-ui.com/elements/container.html#examples)\n- **Multiselect** - New `multiple` dropdown types have been added. Many new dropdown improvements have been added including tagging/tokenizing features and loading data through API requests.\n- **Embed** - New embed component allows for responsive iframe embeds that maintain their aspect ratio. Embed can be used with YouTube or Vimeo videos, along with placeholder content to avoid loading third party libraries until a user chooses to interact with the video.\n\n**Major Enhancements (Please Read)**\n- **Site** - Added new colors `olive`, `violet`, `brown` and `grey`. These are available in all elements with color variations.  **Thanks @lemartialou**\n- **API** - API can now be used with mocked responses, and custom AJAX requests. `mockResponse` has been added to resolve request with a prespecified JSON object, or a synchronous function callback.\n- **API** `mockResponseAsync` has been added for custom asynchronous requests. This allows you to specify a custom async callback to resolve an API request, helping with integration with libraries like Ember or Angular that may wrap AJAX requests.\n- **API** - API callbacks now have an `onResponse` callback that can adjust a servers response before it is parsed by other callbacks for success or failure conditions. **Thanks @mnquintana**\n- **API** - API now provides a local caching setting to avoid server roundtrips for identical urls by using `cache: 'local'`. This is not enabled by default.  Local caching is useful for results that should return the same values across a single session, for example when querying an autocomplete.\n- **Card** - Cards now support multiple custom `content` blocks.

Clicking on fixed elements will not close sidebar.\n- **Transition** - Fixed bug with animations that contain the strings 'in' or 'out' as part of their names, for example \"swing\"\n- **Sticky** - Fixes issue with container size not being set explicitly on rail due to improper method renaming\n\n### Version 1.7.3 - January 16, 2015\n\n- **Installer** - Fix issue with component list in `semantic.json` not correctly overriding default components\n\n### Version 1.7.(1-2) - January 15, 2015\n\n**Bugs**\n\n- **Installer** - Fixes installer not including RTL parameter correctly\n- **UI** - Fixes `progress`, `ad`, and `sidebar` not loading `.override` files correctly\n- Removed undocumented components from `theme.config.example`\n\n### Version 1.7.0 - January 14, 2015\n\n**Major Changes**\n- **Project** - Right-to-left (RTL) support added. New gulp tasks for RTL file generation and install setting. Docs however do not yet support RTL.*Thanks @MohammadYounes for constant support with RTL!*.\n- **Project** - Install now let you specify the outputted file permissions (express/custom install)\n\n**Enhancements / Changes**\n- **Grid** - Added `equal width` variation using `flex-box`, `equal height` now also uses `flex-box` (this may have to be removed if causes unexpected browser issues)\n- **Sidebar** - Having a sidebar visible on page load is now much simpler. You can include ``ui visible sidebar`` on page load to have a sidebar element appear on page load. To close call `$('.ui.sidebar').sidebar('hide')`\n- **Sidebar** - Added documentation on using sidebar on a custom context. Sidebars using a custom context no longer add background colors like those initialized on `body`\n- **Site** - Form input highlighting color added (helps differentiate form colors with autocompleted fields). Default text highlighting color moved from highlighter yellow to a mellow blue.\n- **Dropdown** - Javascript Dropdown can now be disabled by adding ``disabled` class. No need to call `destroy`. **Thanks Psyton**\n- **Dropdown** - Search dropdown input can now have backgrounds. Fixes issues with autocompleted search dropdowns which have forced yellow \"autocompleted\" bg.\n- **Dropdown** - Fix issue with search selection not correctly matching when values are not strings\n- **Progress** - Progress bars can now display percent or amount left using `{value}` in text templates\n- **Dropdown** - New `upward dropdown` variation, which opens its menu upward.

Can adjust in `semantic.json` or during gulp install. You will need to run `npm install` to add the new gulp-chmod dependency *Thanks @PeterDaveHello*\n- **Sidebar** - `setup layout` not occurs synchronously if you initialize a sidebar without the proper html.
