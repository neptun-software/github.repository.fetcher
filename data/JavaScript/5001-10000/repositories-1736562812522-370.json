([#299])\n\n### v2.2.2 [[code][c2.2.2], [diff][d2.2.2]]\n\n[c2.2.2]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.2.2\n[d2.2.2]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v2.2.1...v2.2.2\n\n- Fix: Properties with the name `__proto__` are added to objects and arrays.\n  ([#199]) This also fixes a prototype pollution vulnerability reported by\n  Jonathan Gregson! ([#295]).\n\n### v2.2.1 [[code][c2.2.1], [diff][d2.2.1]]\n\n[c2.2.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.2.1\n[d2.2.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v2.2.0...v2.2.1\n\n- Fix: Removed dependence on minimist to patch CVE-2021-44906. ([#266])\n\n### v2.2.0 [[code][c2.2.0], [diff][d2.2.0]]\n\n[c2.2.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.2.0\n[d2.2.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v2.1.3...v2.2.0\n\n- New: Accurate and documented TypeScript declarations are now included. There\n  is no need to install `@types/json5`. ([#236], [#244])\n\n### v2.1.3 [[code][c2.1.3], [diff][d2.1.3]]\n\n[c2.1.3]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.1.3\n[d2.1.3]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v2.1.2...v2.1.3\n\n- Fix: An out of memory bug when parsing numbers has been fixed. ([#228],\n  [#229])\n\n### v2.1.2 [[code][c2.1.2], [diff][d2.1.2]]\n\n[c2.1.2]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.1.2\n[d2.1.2]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v2.1.1...v2.1.2\n\n- Fix: Bump `minimist` to `v1.2.5`. ([#222])\n\n### v2.1.1 [[code][c2.1.1], [diff][d2.1.1]]\n\n[c2.1.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.1.1\n[d2.1.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.1\n\n- New: `package.json` and `package.json5` include a `module` property so\n  bundlers like webpack, rollup and parcel can take advantage of the ES Module\n  build. ([#208])\n- Fix: `stringify` outputs `\\0` as `\\\\x00` when followed by a digit. ([#210])\n- Fix: Spelling mistakes have been fixed. ([#196])\n\n### v2.1.0 [[code][c2.1.0], [diff][d2.1.0]]\n\n[c2.1.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.1.0\n[d2.1.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v2.0.1...v2.1.0\n\n- New: The `index.mjs` and `index.min.mjs` browser builds in the `dist`\n  directory support ES6 modules. ([#187])\n\n### v2.0.1 [[code][c2.0.1], [diff][d2.0.1]]\n\n[c2.0.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.0.1\n[d2.0.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v2.0.0...v2.0.1\n\n- Fix: The browser builds in the `dist` directory support ES5. ([#182])\n\n### v2.0.0 [[code][c2.0.0], [diff][d2.0.0]]\n\n[c2.0.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v2.0.0\n[d2.0.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v1.0.1...v2.0.0\n\n- **Major**: JSON5 officially supports Node.js v6 and later. Support for Node.js\n  v4 has been dropped. Since Node.js v6 supports ES5 features, the code has been\n  rewritten in native ES5, and the dependence on Babel has been eliminated.\n\n- New: Support for Unicode 10 has been added.\n\n- New: The test framework has been migrated from Mocha to Tap.\n\n- New: The browser build at `dist/index.js` is no longer minified by default. A\n  minified version is available at `dist/index.min.js`. ([#181])\n\n- Fix: The warning has been made clearer when line and paragraph separators are\n  used in strings.\n\n- Fix: `package.json5` has been restored, and it is automatically generated and\n  committed when the version is bumped. A new `build-package` NPM script has\n  been added to facilitate this.\n\n### v1.0.1 [[code][c1.0.1], [diff][d1.0.1]]\n\n[c1.0.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v1.0.1\n[d1.0.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1\n\nThis release includes a bug fix and minor change.\n\n- Fix: `parse` throws on unclosed objects and arrays.\n\n- New: `package.json5` has been removed until an easier way to keep it in sync\n  with `package.json` is found.\n\n\n### v1.0.0 [[code][c1.0.0], [diff][d1.0.0]]\n\n[c1.0.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v1.0.0\n[d1.0.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v0.5.1...v1.0.0\n\nThis release includes major internal changes and public API enhancements.\n\n- **Major**: JSON5 officially supports Node.js v4 and later. Support for Node.js\n  v0.10 and v0.12 have been dropped.\n\n- New: Unicode property names and Unicode escapes in property names are\n  supported. ([#1])\n\n- New: `stringify` outputs trailing commas in objects and arrays when a `space`\n  option is provided. ([#66])\n\n- New: JSON5 allows line and paragraph separator characters (U+2028 and U+2029)\n  in strings in order to be compatible with JSON. However, ES5 does not allow\n  these characters in strings, so JSON5 gives a warning when they are parsed and\n  escapes them when they are stringified. ([#70])\n\n- New: `stringify` accepts an options object as its second argument. The\n  supported options are `replacer`, `space`, and a new `quote` option that\n  specifies the quote character used in strings. ([#71])\n\n- New: The CLI supports STDIN and STDOUT and adds `--out-file`, `--space`, and\n  `--validate` options. See `json5 --help` for more information. ([#72], [#84],\n  and [#108])\n\n- New: In addition to the white space characters space `\\t`, `\\v`, `\\f`, `\\n`,\n  `\\r`, and `\\xA0`, the additional white space characters `\\u2028`, `\\u2029`,\n  and all other characters in the Space Separator Unicode category are allowed.\n\n- New: In addition to the character escapes `\\'`, `\\\"`, `\\\\`, `\\b`, `\\f`, `\\n`,\n  `\\r`, and `\\t`, the additional character escapes `\\v` and `\\0`, hexadecimal\n  escapes like `\\x0F`, and unnecessary escapes like `\\a` are allowed in string\n  values and string property names.\n\n- New: `stringify` outputs strings with single quotes by default but\n  intelligently uses double quotes if there are more single quotes than double\n  quotes inside the string. (i.e. `stringify('Stay here.')` outputs\n  `'Stay here.'` while `stringify('Let\\'s go.')` outputs `\"Let's go.\"`)\n\n- New: When a character is not allowed in a string, `stringify` outputs a\n  character escape like `\\t` when available, a hexadecimal escape like `\\x0F`\n  when the Unicode code point is less than 256, or a Unicode character escape\n  like `\\u01FF`, in that order.\n\n- New: `stringify` checks for a `toJSON5` method on objects and, if it exists,\n  stringifies its return value instead of the object. `toJSON5` overrides\n  `toJSON` if they both exist.\n\n- New: To `require` or `import` JSON5 files, use `require('json5/lib/register')`\n  or `import 'json5/lib/register'`. Previous versions used `json5/lib/require`,\n  which still exists for backward compatibility but is deprecated and will give\n  a warning.\n\n- New: To use JSON5 in browsers, use the file at `dist/index.js` or\n  `https://unpkg.com/json5@^1.0.0`.\n\n- Fix: `stringify` properly outputs `Infinity` and `NaN`. ([#67])\n\n- Fix: `isWord` no longer becomes a property of `JSON5` after calling\n  `stringify`. ([#68] and [#89])\n\n- Fix: `stringify` no longer throws when an object does not have a `prototype`.\n  ([#154])\n\n- Fix: `stringify` properly handles the `key` argument of `toJSON(key)` methods.\n  `toJSON5(key)` follows this pattern.\n\n- Fix: `stringify` accepts `Number` and `String` objects as its `space`\n  argument.\n\n- Fix: In addition to a function, `stringify` also accepts an array of keys to\n  include in the output as its `replacer` argument. Numbers, `Number` objects,\n  and `String` objects will be converted to a string if they are given as array\n  values.\n\n\n### v0.5.1 [[code][c0.5.1], [diff][d0.5.1]]\n\n[c0.5.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v0.5.1\n[d0.5.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1\n\nThis release includes a minor fix for indentations when stringifying empty\narrays.\n\n- Fix: Indents no longer appear in empty arrays when stringified. ([#134])\n\n\n### v0.5.0 [[code][c0.5.0], [diff][d0.5.0]]\n\n[c0.5.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v0.5.0\n[d0.5.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v0.4.0...v0.5.0\n\nThis release includes major internal changes and public API enhancements.\n\n- **Major:** JSON5 officially supports Node.js v4 LTS and v5. Support for\n  Node.js v0.6 and v0.8 have been dropped, while support for v0.10 and v0.12\n  remain.\n\n- Fix: YUI Compressor no longer fails when compressing json5.js. ([#97])\n\n- New: `parse` and the CLI provide line and column numbers when displaying error\n  messages. ([#101]; awesome work by [@amb26].)\n\n\n### v0.4.0 [[code][c0.4.0], [diff][d0.4.0]]\n\n[c0.4.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v0.4.0\n[d0.4.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v0.2.0...v0.4.0\n\nNote that v0.3.0 was tagged, but never published to npm, so this v0.4.0\nchangelog entry includes v0.3.0 features.\n\nThis is a massive release that adds `stringify` support, among other things.\n\n- **Major:** `JSON5.stringify()` now exists!\n  This method is analogous to the native `JSON.stringify()`;\n  it just avoids quoting keys where possible.\n  See the [usage documentation](./README.md#usage) for more.\n  ([#32]; huge thanks and props [@aeisenberg]!)\n\n- New: `NaN` and `-NaN` are now allowed number literals.\n  ([#30]; thanks [@rowanhill].)\n\n- New: Duplicate object keys are now allowed; the last value is used.\n  This is the same behavior as JSON. ([#57]; thanks [@jordanbtucker].)\n\n- Fix: Properly handle various whitespace and newline cases now.\n  E.g. JSON5 now properly supports escaped CR and CRLF newlines in strings,\n  and JSON5 now accepts the same whitespace as JSON (stricter than ES5).\n  ([#58], [#60], and [#63]; thanks [@jordanbtucker].)\n\n- New: Negative hexadecimal numbers (e.g. `-0xC8`) are allowed again.\n  (They were disallowed in v0.2.0; see below.)\n  It turns out they *are* valid in ES5, so JSON5 supports them now too.\n  ([#36]; thanks [@jordanbtucker]!)\n\n\n### v0.2.0 [[code][c0.2.0], [diff][d0.2.0]]\n\n[c0.2.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v0.2.0\n[d0.2.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0\n\nThis release fixes some bugs and adds some more utility features to help you\nexpress data more easily:\n\n- **Breaking:** Negative hexadecimal numbers (e.g. `-0xC8`) are rejected now.\n  While V8 (e.g. Chrome and Node) supported them, it turns out they're invalid\n  in ES5. This has been [fixed in V8][v8-hex-fix] (and by extension, Chrome\n  and Node), so JSON5 officially rejects them now, too. ([#36])\n\n- New: Trailing decimal points in decimal numbers are allowed again.\n  (They were disallowed in v0.1.0; see below.)\n  They're allowed by ES5, and differentiating between integers and floats may\n  make sense on some platforms. ([#16]; thanks [@Midar].)\n\n- New: `Infinity` and `-Infinity` are now allowed number literals.\n  ([#30]; thanks [@pepkin88].)\n\n- New: Plus signs (`+`) in front of numbers are now allowed, since it can\n  be helpful in some contexts to explicitly mark numbers as positive.\n  (E.g. when a property represents changes or deltas.)\n\n- Fix: unescaped newlines in strings are rejected now.\n  ([#24]; thanks [@Midar].)\n\n\n### v0.1.0 [[code][c0.1.0], [diff][d0.1.0]]\n\n[c0.1.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v0.1.0\n[d0.1.0]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v0.0.1...v0.1.0\n\nThis release tightens JSON5 support and adds helpful utility features:\n\n- New: Support hexadecimal numbers. (Thanks [@MaxNanasy].)\n\n- Fix: Reject octal numbers properly now. Previously, they were accepted but\n  improperly parsed as base-10 numbers. (Thanks [@MaxNanasy].)\n\n- **Breaking:** Reject \"noctal\" numbers now (base-10 numbers that begin with a\n  leading zero). These are disallowed by both JSON5 and JSON, as well as by\n  ES5's strict mode. (Thanks [@MaxNanasy].)\n\n- New: Support leading decimal points in decimal numbers.\n  (Thanks [@MaxNanasy].)\n\n- **Breaking:** Reject trailing decimal points in decimal numbers now. These\n  are disallowed by both JSON5 and JSON. (Thanks [@MaxNanasy].)\n\n- **Breaking:** Reject omitted elements in arrays now. These are disallowed by\n  both JSON5 and JSON.\n\n- Fix: Throw proper `SyntaxError` instances on errors now.\n\n- New: Add Node.js `require()` hook. Register via `json5/lib/require`.\n\n- New: Add Node.js `json5` executable to compile JSON5 files to JSON.\n\n\n### v0.0.1 [[code][c0.0.1], [diff][d0.0.1]]\n\n[c0.0.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v0.0.1\n[d0.0.1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/compare/v0.0.0...v0.0.1\n\nThis was the first implementation of this JSON5 parser.\n\n- Support unquoted object keys, including reserved words. Unicode characters\n  and escape sequences aren't yet supported.\n\n- Support single-quoted strings.\n\n- Support multi-line strings.\n\n- Support trailing commas in arrays and objects.\n\n- Support comments, both inline and block.\n\n\n### v0.0.0 [[code](https://github.com/json5/json5/tree/v0.0.0)]\n\nLet's consider this to be Douglas Crockford's original [json_parse.js] — a\nparser for the regular JSON format.\n\n\n[json_parse.js]: https://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/master/json_parse.js\n[v8-hex-fix]: http://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=2240\n\n[@MaxNanasy]: https://github.com/MaxNanasy\n[@Midar]: https://github.com/Midar\n[@pepkin88]: https://github.com/pepkin88\n[@rowanhill]: https://github.com/rowanhill\n[@aeisenberg]: https://github.com/aeisenberg\n[@jordanbtucker]: https://github.com/jordanbtucker\n[@amb26]: https://github.com/amb26\n\n[#1]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/1\n[#16]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/16\n[#24]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/24\n[#30]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/30\n[#32]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/32\n[#36]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/36\n[#57]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/57\n[#58]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/58\n[#60]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/60\n[#63]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/63\n[#66]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/66\n[#67]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/67\n[#68]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/68\n[#70]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/70\n[#71]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/71\n[#72]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/72\n[#84]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/84\n[#89]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/89\n[#97]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/97\n[#101]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/101\n[#108]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/108\n[#134]: https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/134\n[#154]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/154\n[#181]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/181\n[#182]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/182\n[#187]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/187\n[#196]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/196\n[#199]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/199\n[#208]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/208\n[#210]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/210\n[#222]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/222\n[#228]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/228\n[#229]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/229\n[#236]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/236\n[#244]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/244\n[#266]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/266\n[#295]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/295\n[#299]: https://github.com/json5/json5/issues/299\n"

\\\nNo \\\\n's!\",\n  hexadecimal: 0xdecaf,\n  leadingDecimalPoint: .8675309, andTrailing: 8675309.,\n  positiveSign: +1,\n  trailingComma: 'in objects', andIn: ['arrays',],\n  \"backwardsCompatible\": \"with JSON\",\n}\n```\n\nA more real-world example is [this config file](https://github.com/chromium/chromium/blob/feb3c9f670515edf9a88f185301cbd7794ee3e52/third_party/blink/renderer/platform/runtime_enabled_features.json5)\nfrom the Chromium/Blink project.\n\n## Specification\nFor a detailed explanation of the JSON5 format, please read the [official\nspecification](https://json5.github.io/json5-spec/).\n\n## Installation and Usage\n### Node.js\n```sh\nnpm install json5\n```\n\n#### CommonJS\n```js\nconst JSON5 = require('json5')\n```\n\n#### Modules\n```js\nimport JSON5 from 'json5'\n```\n\n### Browsers\n#### UMD\n```html\n<!-- This will create a global `JSON5` variable. -->\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/json5@2/dist/index.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\n#### Modules\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\n  import JSON5 from 'https://unpkg.com/json5@2/dist/index.min.mjs'\n</script>\n```\n\n## API\nThe JSON5 API is compatible with the [JSON API].\n\n[JSON API]:\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON\n\n### JSON5.parse()\nParses a JSON5 string, constructing the JavaScript value or object described by\nthe string. An optional reviver function can be provided to perform a\ntransformation on the resulting object before it is returned.\n\n#### Syntax\n    JSON5.parse(text[, reviver])\n\n#### Parameters\n- `text`: The string to parse as JSON5.\n- `reviver`: If a function, this prescribes how the value originally produced by\n  parsing is transformed, before being returned.\n\n#### Return value\nThe object corresponding to the given JSON5 text.\n\n### JSON5.stringify()\nConverts a JavaScript value to a JSON5 string, optionally replacing values if a\nreplacer function is specified, or optionally including only the specified\nproperties if a replacer array is specified.\n\n#### Syntax\n    JSON5.stringify(value[, replacer[, space]])\n    JSON5.stringify(value[, options])\n\n#### Parameters\n- `value`: The value to convert to a JSON5 string.\n- `replacer`: A function that alters the behavior of the stringification\n  process, or an array of String and Number objects that serve as a whitelist\n  for selecting/filtering the properties of the value object to be included in\n  the JSON5 string. If this value is null or not provided, all properties of the\n  object are included in the resulting JSON5 string.\n- `space`: A String or Number object that's used to insert white space into the\n  output JSON5 string for readability purposes. If this is a Number, it\n  indicates the number of space characters to use as white space; this number is\n  capped at 10 (if it is greater, the value is just 10). Values less than 1\n  indicate that no space should be used. If this is a String, the string (or the\n  first 10 characters of the string, if it's longer than that) is used as white\n  space. If this parameter is not provided (or is null), no white space is used.\n  If white space is used, trailing commas will be used in objects and arrays.\n- `options`: An object with the following properties:\n  - `replacer`: Same as the `replacer` parameter.\n  - `space`: Same as the `space` parameter.\n  - `quote`: A String representing the quote character to use when serializing\n    strings.\n\n#### Return value\nA JSON5 string representing the value.\n\n### Node.js `require()` JSON5 files\nWhen using Node.js, you can `require()` JSON5 files by adding the following\nstatement.\n\n```js\nrequire('json5/lib/register')\n```\n\nThen you can load a JSON5 file with a Node.js `require()` statement. For\nexample:\n\n```js\nconst config = require('./config.json5')\n```\n\n## CLI\nSince JSON is more widely used than JSON5, this package includes a CLI for\nconverting JSON5 to JSON and for validating the syntax of JSON5 documents.\n\n### Installation\n```sh\nnpm install --global json5\n```\n\n### Usage\n```sh\njson5 [options] <file>\n```\n\nIf `<file>` is not provided, then STDIN is used.\n\n#### Options:\n- `-s`, `--space`: The number of spaces to indent or `t` for tabs\n- `-o`, `--out-file [file]`: Output to the specified file, otherwise STDOUT\n- `-v`, `--validate`: Validate JSON5 but do not output JSON\n- `-V`, `--version`: Output the version number\n- `-h`, `--help`: Output usage information\n\n## Contributing\n### Development\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/json5/json5\ncd json5\nnpm install\n```\n\nWhen contributing code, please write relevant tests and run `npm test` and `npm\nrun lint` before submitting pull requests. Please use an editor that supports\n[EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/).\n\n### Issues\nTo report bugs or request features regarding the JSON5 **data format**,\nplease submit an issue to the official\n**[_specification_ repository](https://github.com/json5/json5-spec)**.\n\nNote that we will never add any features that make JSON5 incompatible with ES5;\nthat compatibility is a fundamental premise of JSON5.[*](#ecmascript-compatibility)\n\nTo report bugs or request features regarding this **JavaScript implementation**\nof JSON5, please submit an issue to **_this_ repository**.\n\n### Security Vulnerabilities and Disclosures\nTo report a security vulnerability, please follow the follow the guidelines\ndescribed in our [security policy](./SECURITY.md).\n\n## ECMAScript Compatibility\nWhile JSON5 aims to be fully compatible with ES5, there is one exception where\nboth JSON and JSON5 are not. Both JSON and JSON5 allow unescaped line and\nparagraph separator characters (U+2028 and U+2029) in strings, however ES5 does\nnot. A [proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-superset) to allow these\ncharacters in strings was adopted into ES2019, making JSON and JSON5 fully\ncompatible with ES2019.\n\n## License\nMIT. See [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md) for details.\n\n## Credits\n[Aseem Kishore](https://github.com/aseemk) founded this project.\nHe wrote a [blog post](https://aseemk.substack.com/p/ignore-the-f-ing-haters-json5)\nabout the journey and lessons learned 10 years in.\n\n[Michael Bolin](http://bolinfest.com/) independently arrived at and published\nsome of these same ideas with awesome explanations and detail. Recommended\nreading: [Suggested Improvements to JSON](http://bolinfest.com/essays/json.html)\n\n[Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/) of course designed and built\nJSON, but his state machine diagrams on the [JSON website](http://json.org/), as\ncheesy as it may sound, gave us motivation and confidence that building a new\nparser to implement these ideas was within reach! The original\nimplementation of JSON5 was also modeled directly off of Doug’s open-source\n[json_parse.js] parser. We’re grateful for that clean and well-documented\ncode.\n\n[json_parse.js]:\nhttps://github.com/douglascrockford/JSON-js/blob/03157639c7a7cddd2e9f032537f346f1a87c0f6d/json_parse.js\n\n[Max Nanasy](https://github.com/MaxNanasy) has been an early and prolific\nsupporter, contributing multiple patches and ideas.\n\n[Andrew Eisenberg](https://github.com/aeisenberg) contributed the original\n`stringify` method.\n\n[Jordan Tucker](https://github.com/jordanbtucker) has aligned JSON5 more closely\nwith ES5, wrote the official JSON5 specification, completely rewrote the\ncodebase from the ground up, and is actively maintaining this project.\n"
