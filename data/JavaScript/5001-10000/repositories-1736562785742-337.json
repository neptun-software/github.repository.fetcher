Here are a few quick repo maintenance guidelines intended to help keep Apollo projects happy and healthy.\n\n## Overall\n\n- Please remember to be polite and respectful to all community members, no matter what is being reported, contributed, etc. People who are taking time out of their lives to participate in the Apollo ecosystem should feel welcomed, included and appreciated.\n\n## Issues\n\n- Issues are for bugs and feature requests only. All other requests should be redirected accordingly, then closed. Requests for help should go to [Slack](https://www.apollographql.com/slack) or [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com).\n- If a bug report is valid, add the `confirmed` label, and optionally decide if community help should be requested using the `help-wanted` label. If you’re planning on working on it, assign the issue to yourself.\n- If an issue isn’t easily reproducible, ask for a reproduction and add a `reproduction-needed` label.\n- If a reproduction has been asked for but hasn’t been received in 1 week, close the issue.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n* Ensure PR’s have tests (when it makes sense, which is almost always).\n* Make sure `CHANGELOG`’s are updated/maintained. Either request that the PR author adds a `CHANGELOG` entry, or add one yourself. Make sure the PR is referenced along with their GitHub username, and link to their profile (to give them extra kudos).\n* Don’t forget to consider how a PR you’re merging will affect the docs; either ask contributors for docs changes, open a new issue to track outstanding changes, or consider implementing the docs changes yourself.\n* Always think about backwards compatibility; please don’t merge PR’s that require major version bumps, unless talking it over with the core team.\n* If the PR has a small number of commits, or a large number of semantically unimportant commits, squash and merge the PR. If the PR commits are well thought out, isolated and would add value to the git history if kept separate, do a merge commit.\n"

          "content": "# Apollo Contributor Guide\n\nExcited about Apollo and want to make it better? We’re excited too!\n\nApollo is a community of developers just like you, striving to create the best tools and libraries around GraphQL. We welcome anyone who wants to contribute or provide constructive feedback, no matter the age or level of experience. If you want to help but don't know where to start, let us know, and we'll find something for you.\n\nOh, and if you haven't already, sign up for the [Apollo Spectrum](https://spectrum.chat/apollo).\n\nHere are some ways to contribute to the project, from easiest to most difficult:\n\n* [Reporting bugs](#reporting-bugs)\n* [Improving the documentation](#improving-the-documentation)\n* [Responding to issues](#responding-to-issues)\n* [Small bug fixes](#small-bug-fixes)\n* [Suggesting features](#suggesting-features)\n* [Big pull requests](#big-prs)\n\n## Issues\n\n### Reporting bugs\n\nIf you encounter a bug, please file an issue on GitHub via the repository of the sub-project you think contains the bug. If an issue you have is already reported, please add additional information or add a 👍 reaction to indicate your agreement.\n\nWhile we will try to be as helpful as we can on any issue reported, please include the following to maximize the chances of a quick fix:\n\n1. **Intended outcome:** What you were trying to accomplish when the bug occurred, and as much code as possible related to the source of the problem.\n2. **Actual outcome:** A description of what actually happened, including a screenshot or copy-paste of any related error messages, logs, or other output that might be related. Places to look for information include your browser console, server console, and network logs. Please avoid non-specific phrases like “didn’t work” or “broke”.\n3. **How to reproduce the issue:** Instructions for how the issue can be reproduced by a maintainer or contributor. Be as specific as possible, and only mention what is necessary to reproduce the bug. If possible, try to isolate the exact circumstances in which the bug occurs and avoid speculation over what the cause might be.\n\nCreating a good reproduction really helps contributors investigate and resolve your issue quickly. In many cases, the act of creating a minimal reproduction illuminates that the source of the bug was somewhere outside the library in question, saving time and effort for everyone.\n\nInclude in the issue a link to your reproduction—a couple good options are a small Github repo or a [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/). Here's a starter CodeSandbox you can use: https://codesandbox.io/s/yrwE7pvJ7\n\nIf you have a more complicated issue where it is helpful to run it locally, you may consider using [react-apollo-error-template](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo-error-template) for reproducing the issue.\n\n### Improving the documentation\n\nImproving the documentation, examples, and other open source content can be the easiest way to contribute to the library. If you see a piece of content that can be better, open a PR with an improvement, no matter how small! If you would like to suggest a big change or major rewrite, we’d love to hear your ideas but please open an issue for discussion before writing the PR.\n\nImproving the documentation, examples, and other open source content can be the easiest way to contribute to the library. If you see a piece of content that can be better, open a PR with an improvement, no matter how small! If you would like to suggest a big change or major rewrite, we’d love to hear your ideas! Please open a feature request for discussion, over in the [Apollo Feature Request repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-feature-requests), before writing the PR.\n\n### Responding to issues\n\nIn addition to reporting issues, a great way to contribute to Apollo is to respond to other peoples' issues and try to identify the problem or help them work around it. If you’re interested in taking a more active role in this process, please go ahead and respond to issues. And don't forget to say \"Hi\" on Apollo Slack!\n\n### Small bug fixes\n\nFor a small bug fix change (less than 20 lines of code changed), feel free to open a pull request. We’ll try to merge it as fast as possible and ideally publish a new release on the same day. The only requirement is, make sure you also add a test that verifies the bug you are trying to fix.\n\n### Suggesting feature\n\nMost of the features in React Apollo came from suggestions by you, the community! We welcome any ideas about how to make Apollo better for your use case. Head on over to the [Apollo Feature Request repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-feature-requests), and open up a new feature request / discussion issue with your details.\n\n**Note:** Feature requests and non-bug related discussions are no longer managed in this repo's issue tracker. Feature request and/or discussions opened here will be closed.\n\n## Big PRs\n\nThis includes:\n\n* Big bug fixes\n* New features\n\nFor significant changes to a repository, it’s important to settle on a design before starting on the implementation. This way, we can make sure that major improvements get the care and attention they deserve. Since big changes can be risky and might not always get merged, it’s good to reduce the amount of possible wasted effort by agreeing on an implementation design/plan first.\n\n1. **Open an issue.** Open an issue about your bug in this repo, or about your feature request in the [Apollo Feature Request repo](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-feature-requests).\n2. **Reach consensus.** Some contributors and community members should reach an agreement that this feature or bug is important, and that someone should work on implementing or fixing it.\n3. **Agree on intended behavior.** On the issue, reach an agreement about the desired behavior. In the case of a bug fix, it should be clear what it means for the bug to be fixed, and in the case of a feature, it should be clear what it will be like for developers to use the new feature.\n4. **Agree on implementation plan.** Write a plan for how this feature or bug fix should be implemented. What modules need to be added or rewritten? Should this be one pull request or multiple incremental improvements? Who is going to do each part?\n5. **Submit PR.** In the case where multiple dependent patches need to be made to implement the change, only submit one at a time. Otherwise, the others might get stale while the first is reviewed and merged. Make sure to avoid “while we’re here” type changes - if something isn’t relevant to the improvement at hand, it should be in a separate PR; this especially includes code style changes of unrelated code.\n6. **Review.** At least one core contributor should sign off on the change before it’s merged. Look at the “code review” section below to learn about factors are important in the code review. If you want to expedite the code being merged, try to review your own code first!\n7. **Merge and release!**\n\n### Code review guidelines\n\nIt’s important that every piece of code in Apollo packages is reviewed by at least one core contributor familiar with that codebase. Here are some things we look for:\n\n1. **Required CI checks pass.** This is a prerequisite for the review, and it is the PR author's responsibility. As long as the tests don’t pass, the PR won't get reviewed.\n2. **Simplicity.** Is this the simplest way to achieve the intended goal? If there are too many files, redundant functions, or complex lines of code, suggest a simpler way to do the same thing. In particular, avoid implementing an overly general solution when a simple, small, and pragmatic fix will do.\n3. **Testing.** Do the tests ensure this code won’t break when other stuff changes around it? When it does break, will the tests added help us identify which part of the library has the problem? Did we cover an appropriate set of edge cases? Look at the test coverage report if there is one. Are all significant code paths in the new code exercised at least once?\n4. **No unnecessary or unrelated changes.** PRs shouldn’t come with random formatting changes, especially in unrelated parts of the code. If there is some refactoring that needs to be done, it should be in a separate PR from a bug fix or feature, if possible.\n5. **Code has appropriate comments.** Code should be commented, or written in a clear “self-documenting” way.\n6. **Idiomatic use of the language.** In TypeScript, make sure the typings are specific and correct. In ES2015, make sure to use imports rather than require and const instead of var, etc. Ideally a linter enforces a lot of this, but use your common sense and follow the style of the surrounding code.\n"

React Apollo functionality is now directly available from `@apollo/client` >= 3. While using the `@apollo/react-X` packages will still work, we recommend using the following imports from `@apollo/client` directly instead:\n>\n> - old: `@apollo/react-components` --> new: `@apollo/client/react/components`\n> - old: `@apollo/react-hoc` --> new: `@apollo/client/react/hoc`\n> - old: `@apollo/react-ssr` --> new: `@apollo/client/react/ssr`\n> - old: `@apollo/react-testing` --> new: `@apollo/client/testing`\n> - old: `@apollo/react-hooks` --> new: `@apollo/client`\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- **React Apollo 4.0.0 is dependent on `@apollo/client` >= 3.** If you are using `apollo-client` 2.x and are not ready to update to `@apollo/client`, please use React Apollo 3.x.\n\n- The `react-apollo` package has been fully removed. Please use `@apollo/client` or `@apollo/react-X` packages directly. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#4037](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/4037)\n\n- Due to changes made in Apollo Client, the previous SSR testing pattern of:\n\n  ```js\n  return getDataFromTree(app).then(() => {\n    const markup = ReactDOM.renderToString(app);\n    expect(markup).toMatch(/Waldo/);\n  });\n  ```\n\n  will no longer work (`ReactDOM.renderToString(app)` will just return the initial loading state of the component under test). Instead, we can leverage the markup returned when `getDataFromTree`'s Promise resolves:\n\n  ```js\n  return getDataFromTree(app).then((markup) => {\n    expect(markup).toMatch(/Waldo/);\n  });\n  ```\n\n- We are no longer building UMD versions of React Apollo.\n\n## 3.1.3 (2019-10-15)\n\n- Revert the changes made in [#3497](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3497), which have lead to problems with `onCompleted` being called more often than necessary. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [0901f4a](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/commit/0901f4ac2b1800dab423b63bd9e041c863a2425f)\n\n## 3.1.2 (2019-10-01)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Make sure SSR is fully disabled when using `ssr: false` and `ssrMode: true`. <br/>\n  [@maapteh](https://github.com/maapteh) in [#3515](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3515)\n- Fixed `MockLink`'s broken `newData` function handling. <br/>\n  [@pawelkleczek](https://github.com/pawelkleczek) in [#3539](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3539)\n- Fixed an issue that prevented `networkStatus` from changing `ready` at the end of pagination. <br/>\n  [@mu29](https://github.com/mu29) in [#3514](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3514)\n\n## 3.1.1 (2019-09-15)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Calling `startPolling` or `stopPolling` after a component has unmounted is now a no-op (instead of throwing an exception). Polling is automatically stopped when a component is unmounted, so it doesn't need to be called manually. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3485](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3485)\n- Allow `ignoreResults` to be controlled through `graphql` and `withMutation` options. <br/>\n  [@tim-stasse](https://github.com/tim-stasse) in [#3431](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3431)\n- Be a bit more defensive when it comes to accessing the internal\n  `ObservableQuery` instance, to avoid attempting to use it after a component\n  has unmounted. <br/>\n  [@jfrolich](https://github.com/jfrolich) in [#3490](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3490)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- A fix has been applied to prevent an unchanging `loading` state when an error occurs after a refetch, that is the same as the previous error. <br/>\n  [@jet2jet](https://github.com/jet2jet) in [#3477](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3477)\n- Add back in the removed `ChildDataProps` and `ChildMutateProps` types. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3495](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3495)\n- Make sure `onCompleted` is called each time a `useLazyQuery` based query completes, after the execution function is called. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3497](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3497)\n\n## 3.1.0 (2019-09-06)\n\n### Potentially Breaking Change\n\n- Change the default query `data` state from `{}` to `undefined`. This change aligns all parts of the React Apollo query cycle so that `data` is always `undefined` if there is no data, instead of `data` being converted into an empty object. This change impacts the initial query response, initial SSR response, `data` value when errors occur, `data` value when skipping, etc. All of these areas are now aligned to only ever return a value for `data` if there really is a value to return (instead of making it seem like there is one by converting to `{}`). <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3388](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3388)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Adds support for the `skip` option when using `useSubscription`. <br/>\n  [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l) in [#3356](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3356)\n- Makes sure `refetch`, `fetchMore`, `updateQuery`, `startPolling`, `stopPolling`, and `subscribeToMore` maintain a stable identity when they're passed back alongside query results. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3422](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3422)\n- Fixed problematic re-renders that were caused by using `fetchMore.updateQuery` with `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` set to true. When `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` is true, re-renders will now wait until `updateQuery` has completed, to make sure the updated data is used during the render. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3433](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3433)\n- Add `client` to the `useMutation` result. <br/>\n  [@joshalling](https://github.com/joshalling) in [#3417](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3417)\n- Prevent inline `onError` and `onCompleted` callbacks from being part of the internal memoization that's used to decide when certain after render units of functionality are run, when using `useQuery`. This fixes issues related to un-necessary component cleanup, like `error` disappearing from results when it should be present. <br/>\n  [@dylanwulf](https://github.com/dylanwulf) in [#3419](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3419)\n- `useLazyQuery`'s execution function can now be called multiple times in a row, and will properly submit network requests each time called, when using a fetch policy of `network-only`. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3453](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3453)\n- SSR enhancements to support `network-only` and `cache-and-network` fetch policies, along with changes to ensure disabled SSR queries are not fired. <br/>\n  [@mikebm](https://github.com/mikebm) in [#3435](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3435)\n- Remove `void` from the `MutationFunction`'s returned Promise types. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3458](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3458)\n- Prevent duplicate `onCompleted` calls during the same query execution cycle. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3461](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3461)\n- Make sure polling is stopped when a component is unmounted. <br/>\n  [@dqunbp](https://github.com/dqunbp) in [#3273](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3273)\n- Documentation fixes. <br/>\n  [@SeanRoberts](https://github.com/SeanRoberts) in [#3380](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3380)\n\n## 3.0.1 (2019-08-15)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Documentation updates. <br/>\n  [@joshalling](https://github.com/joshalling) in [#3324](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3324)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Dedupe `onError` callback calls and ensure `refetch` sets `loading` state properly. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3339](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3339)\n- Add missing `useLazyQuery` export to the `react-apollo` (all) package. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3320](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3320)\n- Remove `void` from being one of the `MutationTuple` mutate function possible generics. This will make it easier to properly destructure results returned by the mutate function Promise. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3334](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3334)\n- Export `MockedProviderProps` and `MockedProviderState` from `@apollo/react-testing`. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3337](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3337)\n- Add `@types/react` as a peer dep, to address potential TS compilation errors when using `ApolloProvider`. <br/>\n  [@zkochan](https://github.com/zkochan) in [#3278](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3278)\n- Make sure `error`'s are maintained after re-renders, when they should be. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#3362](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3362)\n\n## 3.0.0 (2019-08-06)\n\n### Overview\n\nThis major release includes a large refactoring of the existing React Apollo codebase, to introduce new improvements, changes, features and bug fixes. The biggest new features are:\n\n- Provides new `useQuery`, `useLazyQuery`, `useMutation`, `useSubscription`, and `useApolloClient` hooks, following [React's Hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).\n- Maintains support for React Apollo's `graphql` HOC and render proper components.\n- Introduces a new monorepo structure, with separately published packages, making it easier to use just the parts of React Apollo you're interested in:\n  - `@apollo/react-common`\n  - `@apollo/react-hooks`\n  - `@apollo/react-components`\n  - `@apollo/react-hoc`\n  - `@apollo/react-ssr`\n  - `@apollo/react-testing`\n- Thorough codebase pruning and cleaning to reduce the overall React Apollo bundle size.\n- And more!\n\nConsult the [Hooks migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/hooks-migration/) for more details around upgrading. For more information regarding how to use the new hooks, please consult the updated [React Apollo docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) (all docs have been updated to be hooks first).\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- The minimum supported React version is now 16.8.\n- The `react-apollo@3` package preserves most of the functionality of `react-apollo@2` by re-exporting existing components and functions from `@apollo/react-components` and `@apollo/react-hoc`. If you want to use Hooks, Components, or HOC directly, import the new `@apollo/react-hooks`, `@apollo/react-components`, and/or `@apollo/react-hoc` packages instead.\n- React Apollo testing utilities are no longer available as part of the `react-apollo` package. They should now be imported from the new `@apollo/react-testing` package.\n- The deprecated `walkTree` function has been removed ([9b24d756](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2892/commits/9b24d7567be194c454395365bb5db4fbd7a5caca)).\n- The deprecated `GraphqlQueryControls` and `MutationFunc` types have been removed ([ade881f0](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2892/commits/ade881f07b1175d28b0aae79915bfc5ed8dd9e5a)).\n- Preact is no longer supported ([b742ae63](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2892/commits/b742ae6382039eac79e050a9b0f54183dafaf4a3)).\n- Various Typescript type changes. Since we've introduced a third way of managing data with React (Hooks), we had to rework many of the existing exported types to better align with the Hooks way of doing things. Base types are used to hold common properties across Hooks, Components and the `graphql` HOC, and these types are then extended when needed to provide properties that are specific to a certain React paradigm\n  ([30edb1b0](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2892/commits/30edb1b080b64253b9074a5e7347c544618ea2ea) and\n  [3d138db3](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2892/commits/3d138db386fe44e35203b991eb6caca0eec19d3d)).\n- `catchAsyncError`, `wrap`, and `compose` utilities have been removed\n  ([2c3a262](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2892/commits/2c3a262f9eb1cfb9e58b40ceaeda16a628e3964c), [7de864e](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2892/commits/7de864ecb90521fc2e1f211023fe436486af2324), and [e6089a7](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2892/commits/e6089a716b2b19b57f36200db378b8613a91612d)).\n\n  Previously, `compose` was imported then exported directly from lodash using [`flowRight`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#flowRight). To keep using `compose`, install the [`lodash.flowright`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.flowright) package, then update your `compose` imports as:\n\n  ```js\n  import compose from 'lodash.flowright';\n  ```\n\n- Render prop components (`Query`, `Mutation` and `Subscription`) can no longer be extended. In other words, this is no longer possible:\n\n  ```js\n  class SomeQuery extends Query<SomeData, SomeVariables> {}\n  ```\n\n  All class based render prop components have been converted to functional components, so they could then just wrap their hook based equivalents (`useQuery`, `useMutation`, `useSubscription`).\n\n  While we recommend switching over to use the new hooks as soon as possible, if you're looking for a stop gap you can consider typing a `Query` component in a similar fashion, like:\n\n  ```js\n  export const SomeQuery = () => (\n    <Query<SomeData, SomeVariables> query={SOME_QUERY} ...>\n      {({ data }) => {\n        return <div> ... things happen... </div>;\n      }}\n    </Query>\n  );\n  ```\n\n## 2.5.7 (2019-06-21)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Make sure `MockedProvider` is using the proper CJS/ESM bundle, when\n  referencing `ApolloProvider`. <br/>\n  [@jure](https://github.com/jure) in [#3029](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3029).\n- Adjust the `ApolloContext` definition to play a bit more nicely with\n  `React.createContext` types. <br/>\n  [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) in [#3018](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3018)\n- The result of a mutation is now made available to the wrapped component,\n  when using the `graphql` HOC. <br/>\n  [@andycarrell](https://github.com/andycarrell) in [#3008](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3008)\n- Check equality of stringified variables in the `MockLink` to improve\n  debugging experience used by `MockedProvider`. <br/>\n  [@evans](https://github.com/evans) in [#3078](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3078)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Removed leftover `apollo-client@beta` peer dep. <br/>\n  [@brentertz](https://github.com/brentertz) in [#3064](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3064)\n- Stop setting optional input to `null`, when using the `graphql` HOC. <br/>\n  [@ZhengYuTay](https://github.com/ZhengYuTay) in [#3056](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3056)\n- Fix typescript error caused by `query` being mandatory in the `fetchMore` signature. <br/>\n  [@HsuTing](https://github.com/HsuTing) in [#3065](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/3065)\n- Fixes an issue that caused the `Query` component to get stuck in an always\n  loading state, caused by receiving an error (meaning subsequent valid\n  responses couldn't be handled).

This is an important new feature, that should\n  help address a lot of open Apollo Client / React Apollo issues, so we'll\n  explain it here with an example. Before this release, if you run a query\n  that looks like:\n\n  ```js\n  const GET_MEMBER = gql`\n    query GetMember($id: ID!) {\n      member(id: $id) {\n        id\n        name\n      }\n    }\n  `;\n  ```\n\n  in one component, the results are cached, then you run a superset query like\n  the following in another component:\n\n  ```js\n  const GET_MEMBER_WITH_PLANS = gql`\n    query GetMemberWithPlans($id: ID!) {\n      member(id: $id) {\n        id\n        name\n        plans {\n          id\n          title\n          duration\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  `;\n  ```\n\n  Apollo Client will not re-use the partial data that was cached from the first\n  query, when it preps and displays the second component. It can't find a\n  cache hit for the full second query, so it fires the full query over the\n  network.\n\n  With this release, if you set a `returnPartialData` prop to `true` on the\n  second component, the `data` available to that component will be\n  automatically pre-loaded with the parts of the query that can be found in the\n  cache, before the full query is fired over the network. This means you can\n  do things like showing partial data in your components, while the rest of the\n  data is being loaded over the network.\n\n## 2.5.5 (2019-04-22)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Export the Apollo Context provider (`ApolloContext`). <br/>\n  [@MrLoh](https://github.com/MrLoh) in [#2961](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2961)\n\n## 2.5.4 (2019-04-05)\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixes `Could not find \"client\" in the context of ApolloConsumer` errors when\n  using `MockedProvider`. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2907](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2907)\n- Ensure `Query` components using a `fetchPolicy` of `no-cache` have their\n  data preserved when the components tree is re-rendered. <br/>\n  [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) in [#2914](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2914)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Documentation updates. <br/>\n  [@afenton90](https://github.com/afenton90) in [#2932](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2932)\n\n## 2.5.3\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed an infinite loop caused by using `setState` in the\n  `onError` / `onCompleted` callbacks of the `Query` component. <br/>\n  [@chenesan](https://github.com/chenesan) in [#2751](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2751)\n- Fixed an issue that prevented good results from showing up in a `Query`\n  component, after an error was received, variables were adjusted, and then\n  the good data was fetched. <br/>\n  [@MerzDaniel](https://github.com/MerzDaniel) in [#2718](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2718)\n- Fixed an issue that prevented `Query` component updates from firing (under\n  certain circumstances) due to the internal `lastResult` value (that's used\n  to help prevent unnecessary re-renders) not being updated. <br/>\n  [@Glennrs](https://github.com/Glennrs) in [#2840](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2840)\n\n### Improvements\n\n- `MockedProvider` now accepts a `childProps` prop that can be used to pass\n  props down to a child component. <br/>\n  [@miachenmtl](https://github.com/miachenmtl) in [#2482](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2482)\n- `onCompleted` callbacks now use a destructuring-friendly type definition. <br/>\n  [@jozanza](https://github.com/jozanza) in [#2496](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2496)\n- `@connection` directives are now properly stripped from `MockedResponse`'s,\n  when using `MockedProvider`. <br/>\n  [@ajmath](https://github.com/ajmath) in [#2523](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2523)\n- `MockedProvider` has been updated to stop setting a default `resolvers`\n  value of `{}`, which means by default Apollo Client 2.5 local resolver\n  functionality is not enabled when mocking with `MockedProvider`. This allows\n  `@client` fields to be passed through the mocked link chain, like people\n  were used to before AC 2.5. When using this default mode you will see a\n  dev only warning message about this like:\n\n  > Found @client directives in query but no client resolvers were specified.\n  > You can now pass apollo-link-state resolvers to the ApolloClient\n  > constructor.\n\n  This message can be safely ignored.

This now prevents an issue where components created\n  with `graphql` were not having their query variables updated properly, when\n  props changed. <br/>\n  [@ksmth](https://github.com/ksmth) in [#1968](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/1968)\n- When a query failed on the first result, the query result `data` was being\n  returned as `undefined`. This behavior has been changed so that `data` is\n  returned as an empty object. This makes checking for data (e.g.\n  instead of `data && data.user` you can just check `data.user`) and\n  destructring (e.g. `{ data: { user } }`) easier. **Note:** this could\n  potentially hurt applications that are relying on a falsey check of `data`\n  to see if any query errors have occurred.

The recommended way to\n  handle this is to use the mutations `update` prop to reconcile the mutation\n  result with the data in the cache, getting everything into the expected\n  state. This can definitely be a cumbersome process however, so to help\n  address this the `partialRefetch` prop can be used to automatically\n  `refetch` the original query and update the cache. <br/>\n  [@steelbrain](https://github.com/steelbrain) in [#2003](https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo/pull/2003)\n\n## 2.1.11 (August 9, 2018)\n\n- Fixed an issue in `getDataFromTree` where queries that threw more than one\n  error had error messages swallowed, and returned an invalid error object\n  with circular references.

React Apollo functionality is now directly available from `@apollo/client` >= 3. While using the `@apollo/react-X` packages will still work, we recommend using the following imports from `@apollo/client` directly instead:\n>\n> - old: `@apollo/react-components` --> new: `@apollo/client/react/components`\n> - old: `@apollo/react-hoc` --> new: `@apollo/client/react/hoc`\n> - old: `@apollo/react-ssr` --> new: `@apollo/client/react/ssr`\n> - old: `@apollo/react-testing` --> new: `@apollo/client/testing`\n> - old: `@apollo/react-hooks` --> new: `@apollo/client`\n\nMoving forward, all Apollo + React issues / pull requests should be opened in the [apollo-client](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client.git) repo. Please refer to the [Apollo Client migration guide](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/migrating/apollo-client-3-migration/) for more details.\n\n---\n\nReact Apollo allows you to fetch data from your GraphQL server and use it in building complex and reactive UIs using the React framework. React Apollo may be used in any context that React may be used. In the browser, in React Native, or in Node.js when you want to do server-side rendering.\n\n## Documentation\n\nAll Apollo Client documentation, including React Apollo usage articles and helpful recipes, lives on [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/)\n\nFor the React Apollo API reference, visit [https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-apollo.html](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-apollo.html)\n\n## Maintainers\n\n- [@benjamn](https://github.com/benjamn) (Apollo)\n- [@hwillson](https://github.com/hwillson) (Apollo)\n"
