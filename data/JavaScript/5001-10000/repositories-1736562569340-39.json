By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.

Compatible with PJAX.\n\n<img src=\"demo/screenshots/screenshot-2.png\" width=\"280\"><img src=\"demo/screenshots/screenshot-3.png\" width=\"280\"><img src=\"demo/screenshots/screenshot-1.png\" width=\"270\">\n\n(Note: The character models above are for demonstration purposes only and are not included in this repository.)\n\nYou can also check out example web pages:\n\n- Check the effect in the lower left corner of [Mimi's Blog](https://zhangshuqiao.org)\n- [demo/demo.html](https://live2d-widget.pages.dev/demo/demo) to demonstrate basic functionality\n- [demo/login.html](https://live2d-widget.pages.dev/demo/login) to imitate the login interface of NPM\n\n## Usage\n\nIf you are a beginner or only need the basic functionality, you can simply add the following line of code to the `head` or `body` of your HTML page to load the widget:\n```xml\n<script src=\"https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/live2d-widgets@0/autoload.js\"></script>\n```\nThe placement of the code depends on how your website is built. For example, if you are using [Hexo](https://hexo.io), you need to add the above code to the template file of your theme. The modification process is similar for pages generated using various template engines.  \nIf your website uses PJAX, since the widget does not need to be refreshed on every page, make sure to place the script outside the PJAX refresh area.\n\n**However, we strongly recommend configuring the widget yourself to make it more suitable for your website!**  \nIf you are interested in customizing the widget, please refer to the detailed instructions below.\n\n## Configuration\n\nYou can refer to the source code of `dist/autoload.js` to see the available configuration options. `autoload.js` will automatically load three files: `waifu.css`, `live2d.min.js`, and `waifu-tips.js`. `waifu-tips.js` creates the `initWidget` function, which is the main function for loading the widget. The `initWidget` function accepts an object-type parameter as the configuration for the widget. The following are the available options:\n\n| Option | Type | Default Value | Description |\n| ------ | ---- | ------------- | ----------- |\n| `waifuPath` | `string` | `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/live2d-widgets@0/waifu-tips.json` | Path to the widget resources, can be modified |\n| `apiPath` | `string` | `https://live2d.fghrsh.net/api/` | API path, optional |\n| `cdnPath` | `string` | `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/fghrsh/live2d_api/` | CDN path, optional |\n| `tools` | `string[]` | see `autoload.js` | Buttons of the loaded tools, optional |\n\nAmong them, the parameters `apiPath` and `cdnPath` only need to set one of them. `apiPath` is the URL of the backend API, which can be set up and modified by yourself (there are many things to modify, not discussed here). You can refer to [live2d_api](https://github.com/fghrsh/live2d_api) for more information. On the other hand, `cdnPath` is used to load resources through CDN services like jsDelivr, which provides better stability.\n\n## Customization\n\nIf the options provided in the \"Configuration\" section above are not enough to meet your needs, you can make modifications yourself. The directory structure of this repository is as follows:\n\n- `src/` directory contains the code for each component, e.g. the button and dialog box.\n- `build/` directory contains the files built by TypeScript.\n- `dist/` directory contains the files that can be directly used on web pages after packaging, including:\n  - `autoload.js` is used to automatically load other resources such as style sheets.\n  - `waifu-tips.js` is automatically generated by `build/waifu-tips.js` and it is not recommended to modify it directly.\n  - `waifu-tips.json` defines the triggering conditions (`selector`, CSS selector) and the displayed text when triggered (`text`).\n  - `waifu.css` is the style sheet for the virtual assistant.\n\nBy default, the CSS selector rules in `waifu-tips.json` are effective for the Hexo [NexT theme](http://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next), but you may need to modify or add new content to make it suitable for your own website.  \n**Warning: The content in `waifu-tips.json` may not be suitable for all age groups or appropriate to access during work. Please ensure their suitability when using them.**\n\nTo deploy the development testing environment of this project locally, you need to install Node.js and npm, then execute the following commands:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/stevenjoezhang/live2d-widget.git\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to raise an issue. If you have any modification suggestions, welcome to submit a pull request.\n\n## Deploy\n\nAfter making modifications locally, you can deploy the modified project on a server or load it via a CDN for use on a webpage.\n\n### Using CDN\n\nTo customize the content, you can fork this repository and push the modified content to your own repository using `git push`. In this case, the usage method becomes:\n\n```xml\n<script src=\"https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/live2d-widget@latest/autoload.js\"></script>\n```\n\nReplace `username` with your GitHub username. To ensure the content of the CDN is refreshed correctly, you need to create a new git tag and push it to the GitHub repository. Otherwise, `@latest` in the URL will still point to the previous version. Additionally, CDN itself has caching, so the changes may take some time to take effect. Relevant documentation:\n- [Git Basics - Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)\n- [Managing releases in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)\n\n### Self-host\n\nAlternatively, you can directly host these files on your server instead of loading them via CDN.\n\n- If you can connect to your host via `ssh`, clone the forked and modified code repository onto your server.\n- If your host cannot be accessed via `ssh` (e.g., a regular virtual host), modify the code locally and upload the files to the website directory on the host using `ftp` or similar methods.\n- If you are deploying a static blog using Hexo or similar tools, place the code of this project in the blog's source file directory (e.g., the `source` directory). When redeploying the blog, the relevant files will be automatically uploaded to the corresponding paths. To prevent these files from being incorrectly modified by Hexo plugins, you may need to set `skip_render`.\n\nAfterwards, the entire project can be accessed through your domain name. You can try opening the `autoload.js` and `live2d.min.js` files in your browser and confirm that their content is complete and correct.\nIf everything is normal, you can proceed to modify the constant `live2d_path` in `autoload.js` to the URL of the `live2d-widget` directory. For example, if you can access `live2d.min.js` through the following URL:\n```\nhttps://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/live2d.min.js\n```\nthen modify the value of `live2d_path` to:\n```\nhttps://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/\n```\nMake sure to include the trailing `/` in the path.\nOnce done, add the following code to the interface where you want to add the live2d-widget:\n```xml\n<script src=\"https://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/autoload.js\"></script>\n```\nThis will load the widget.\n\n## Thanks\n\n<a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://d98b8t1nnulk5.cloudfront.net/production/images/layout/logo-header.png?1469004780\">\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://live.browserstack.com/images/opensource/browserstack-logo.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"BrowserStack Logo\" height=\"80\" src=\"https://live.browserstack.com/images/opensource/browserstack-logo.svg\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n> Thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to test in real browsers!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr-media/master/white/svg/jsdelivr-logo-horizontal.svg\">\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr-media/master/default/svg/jsdelivr-logo-horizontal.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"jsDelivr Logo\" height=\"80\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr-media/master/default/svg/jsdelivr-logo-horizontal.svg\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n> Thanks to jsDelivr for providing public CDN service.\n\nThe code is modified based on this blog post:  \nhttps://www.fghrsh.net/post/123.html\n\nThanks to [Hitokoto](https://hitokoto.cn) for providing the sentence API.\n\nWhen you click on the paper airplane button of the virtual assistant, a hidden surprise will appear.

| - | - | - |\n| `waifuPath` | `string` | `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/npm/live2d-widgets@0/waifu-tips.json` | 看板娘资源路径，可自行修改 |\n| `apiPath` | `string` | `https://live2d.fghrsh.net/api/` | API 路径，可选参数 |\n| `cdnPath` | `string` | `https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/fghrsh/live2d_api/` | CDN 路径，可选参数 |\n| `tools` | `string[]` | 见 `autoload.js` | 加载的小工具按钮，可选参数 |\n\n其中，`apiPath` 和 `cdnPath` 两个参数设置其中一项即可。`apiPath` 是后端 API 的 URL，可以自行搭建，并增加模型（需要修改的内容比较多，此处不再赘述），可以参考 [live2d_api](https://github.com/fghrsh/live2d_api)。而 `cdnPath` 则是通过 jsDelivr 这样的 CDN 服务加载资源，更加稳定。\n\n## 自定义\n\n如果以上「配置」部分提供的选项还不足以满足你的需求，那么你可以自己进行修改。本仓库的目录结构如下：\n\n- `src/` 目录下包含了各个组件的代码，例如按钮和对话框等；\n- `build/` 目录下包含了 TypeScript 构建后的文件；\n- `dist/` 目录下包含了进一步打包后网页直接可用的文件，其中：\n  - `autoload.js` 是用于自动加载其它资源，例如样式表等；\n  - `waifu-tips.js` 是由 `build/waifu-tips.js` 自动打包生成的，不建议直接修改；\n  - `waifu-tips.json` 中定义了触发条件（`selector`，CSS 选择器）和触发时显示的文字（`text`）；\n  - `waifu.css` 是看板娘的样式表。\n\n`waifu-tips.json` 中默认的 CSS 选择器规则是对 Hexo 的 [NexT 主题](http://github.com/next-theme/hexo-theme-next) 有效的，为了适用于你自己的网页，可能需要自行修改，或增加新内容。  \n**警告：`waifu-tips.json` 中的内容可能不适合所有年龄段，或不宜在工作期间访问。在使用时，请自行确保它们是合适的。**\n\n要在本地部署本项目的开发测试环境，你需要安装 Node.js 和 npm，然后执行以下命令：\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/stevenjoezhang/live2d-widget.git\nnpm install\nnpm run build\n```\n\n如果有任何疑问，欢迎提 Issue。如果有任何修改建议，欢迎提 Pull Request。\n\n## 部署\n\n在本地完成了修改后，你可以将修改后的项目部署在服务器上，或者通过 CDN 加载，以便在网页中使用。\n\n### 使用 CDN\n\n要自定义有关内容，可以把这个仓库 Fork 一份，然后把修改后的内容通过 git push 到你的仓库中。这时，使用方法对应地变为\n```xml\n<script src=\"https://fastly.jsdelivr.net/gh/username/live2d-widget@latest/autoload.js\"></script>\n```\n将此处的 `username` 替换为你的 GitHub 用户名。为了使 CDN 的内容正常刷新，需要创建新的 git tag 并推送至 GitHub 仓库中，否则此处的 `@latest` 仍然指向更新前的文件。此外 CDN 本身存在缓存，因此改动可能需要一定的时间生效。相关文档：\n- [Git Basics - Tagging](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging)\n- [Managing releases in a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository)\n\n### Self-host\n\n你也可以直接把这些文件放到服务器上，而不是通过 CDN 加载。\n\n- 如果你能够通过 `ssh` 连接你的主机，请把 Fork 并修改后的代码仓库克隆到服务器上。\n- 如果你的主机无法用 `ssh` 连接（例如一般的虚拟主机），请在本地修改好代码后，通过 `ftp` 等方式将文件上传到主机的网站的目录下。\n- 如果你是通过 Hexo 等工具部署的静态博客，请把本项目的代码放在博客源文件目录下（例如 `source` 目录）。重新部署博客时，相关文件就会自动上传到对应的路径下。为了避免这些文件被 Hexo 插件错误地修改，可能需要设置 `skip_render`。\n\n这样，整个项目就可以通过你的域名访问了。不妨试试能否正常地通过浏览器打开 `autoload.js` 和 `live2d.min.js` 等文件，并确认这些文件的内容是完整和正确的。  \n一切正常的话，接下来修改 `autoload.js` 中的常量 `live2d_path` 为 `live2d-widget` 这一目录的 URL 即可。比如说，如果你能够通过\n```\nhttps://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/live2d.min.js\n```\n访问到 `live2d.min.js`，那么就把 `live2d_path` 的值修改为\n```\nhttps://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/\n```\n路径末尾的 `/` 一定要加上。  \n完成后，在你要添加看板娘的界面加入\n```xml\n<script src=\"https://example.com/path/to/live2d-widget/autoload.js\"></script>\n```\n就可以加载了。\n\n## 鸣谢\n\n<a href=\"https://www.browserstack.com/\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://d98b8t1nnulk5.cloudfront.net/production/images/layout/logo-header.png?1469004780\">\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://live.browserstack.com/images/opensource/browserstack-logo.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"BrowserStack Logo\" height=\"80\" src=\"https://live.browserstack.com/images/opensource/browserstack-logo.svg\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n> 感谢 BrowserStack 容许我们在真实的浏览器中测试此项目。  \n> Thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to test in real browsers!\n\n<a href=\"https://www.jsdelivr.com\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr-media/master/white/svg/jsdelivr-logo-horizontal.svg\">\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr-media/master/default/svg/jsdelivr-logo-horizontal.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"jsDelivr Logo\" height=\"80\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsdelivr/jsdelivr-media/master/default/svg/jsdelivr-logo-horizontal.svg\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n> 感谢 jsDelivr 提供的 CDN 服务。  \n> Thanks jsDelivr for providing public CDN service.\n\n代码自这篇博文魔改而来：  \nhttps://www.fghrsh.net/post/123.html\n\n感谢 [一言](https://hitokoto.cn) 提供的语句接口。\n\n点击看板娘的纸飞机按钮时，会出现一个彩蛋，这来自于 [WebsiteAsteroids](http://www.websiteasteroids.com)。\n\n## 更多\n\n更多内容可以参考：  \nhttps://nocilol.me/archives/lab/add-dynamic-poster-girl-with-live2d-to-your-blog-02  \nhttps://github.com/xiazeyu/live2d-widget.js  \nhttps://github.com/summerscar/live2dDemo\n\n关于后端 API 模型：  \nhttps://github.com/xiazeyu/live2d-widget-models  \nhttps://github.com/xiaoski/live2d_models_collection\n\n除此之外，还有桌面版本：  \nhttps://github.com/amorist/platelet  \nhttps://github.com/akiroz/Live2D-Widget  \nhttps://github.com/zenghongtu/PPet  \nhttps://github.com/LikeNeko/L2dPetForMac\n\n以及 Wallpaper Engine：  \nhttps://github.com/guansss/nep-live2d\n\n## 许可证\n\nReleased under the GNU General Public License v3  \nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html\n\n本仓库并不包含任何模型，用作展示的所有 Live2D 模型、图片、动作数据等版权均属于其原作者，仅供研究学习，不得用于商业用途。\n\nLive2D 官方网站：  \nhttps://www.live2d.com/en/  \nhttps://live2d.github.io\n\nLive2D Cubism Core は Live2D Proprietary Software License で提供しています。  \nhttps://www.live2d.com/eula/live2d-proprietary-software-license-agreement_en.html  \nLive2D Cubism Components は Live2D Open Software License で提供しています。  \nhttp://www.live2d.com/eula/live2d-open-software-license-agreement_en.html\n\n> The terms and conditions do prohibit modification, but obfuscating in `live2d.min.js` would not be considered illegal modification.\n\nhttps://community.live2d.com/discussion/140/webgl-developer-licence-and-javascript-question\n\n## 更新日志\n\n2018年10月31日，由 fghrsh 提供的原 API 停用，请更新至新地址。参考文章：  \nhttps://www.fghrsh.net/post/170.html\n\n2020年1月1日起，本项目不再依赖于 jQuery。\n\n2022年11月1日起，本项目不再需要用户单独加载 Font Awesome。\n"
