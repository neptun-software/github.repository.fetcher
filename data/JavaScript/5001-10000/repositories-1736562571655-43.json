          "content": "# Contributing Code\n\nChakraCore accepts bug fix pull requests. For a bug fix PR to be accepted, it must first have a tracking issue that has been marked approved. Your PR should link to the bug you are fixing. If you've submitted a PR for a bug, please post a comment in the bug to avoid duplication of effort.\n\nChakraCore also accepts new feature pull requests. For a feature-level PR to be accepted, it first needs to have design discussion. Design discussion can take one of two forms a) a feature request in the issue tracker that has been marked as approved or b) the PR must be accompanied by a full design spec and this spec is later approved in the open design discussion. Features are evaluated against their complexity, impact on other features, roadmap alignment, and maintainability.\n\nThese two blogs posts on contributing code to open source projects are a good reference: [Open Source Contribution Etiquette](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2010/Dec-31.html) by Miguel de Icaza and [Don't \"Push\" Your Pull Requests](https://www.igvita.com/2011/12/19/dont-push-your-pull-requests/) by Ilya Grigorik.\n\n## Security\n\nIf you believe you have found a security issue in ChakraCore 1.11, please share it with Microsoft privately following the guidance at the Microsoft [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094). Reporting it via this channel helps minimize risk to projects built with ChakraCore.\n\nIf you find a security issue in the Master branch of ChakraCore but not in 1.11 please join our discord server and private message one of the Core team members.\n\n## Legal\n\nYou will need to complete a Contribution Agreement before your pull request can be accepted. This agreement testifies that you are granting us permission to use the source code you are submitting, and that this work is being submitted under appropriate license that we can use it.\n\nYou can read the agreement here: [Contribution Agreement](ContributionAgreement.md)\n\n## Housekeeping\n\nYour pull request should:\n\n* Include a description of what your change intends to do\n* Be a child commit of a reasonably recent commit in the master branch\n* Pass all unit tests\n* Have a clear commit message\n* Include adequate tests\n  * At least one test should fail in the absence of your non-test code changes. If your PR does not match this criteria, please specify why\n  * Tests should include reasonable permutations of the target fix/change\n  * Include baseline changes with your change\n\nSubmissions that have met these requirements will be will reviewed by a core contributor. Submissions must meet functional and performance expectations, including meeting requirements in scenarios for which the team doesn’t yet have open source tests. This means you may be asked to fix and resubmit your pull request against a new open test case if it fails one of these tests.\n\nChakraCore is an organically grown codebase. The consistency of style reflects this. For the most part, the team follows these [coding conventions](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/wiki/Coding-Convention). Contributors should also follow them when making submissions. Otherwise, follow the general coding conventions adhered to in the code surrounding your changes. Pull requests that reformat the code will not be accepted.\n\n## Running the tests\n\nThe unit tests can be run offline with following these steps:\n\n### a) Windows\n\n* Build `Chakra.Core.sln` for the version of ChakraCore you wish to test e.g. x64 Debug.\n  * Specifically, running tests requires that `rl.exe`, `ch.exe`, and `ChakraCore.dll` be built.\n* Call `test\\runtests.cmd` and specify the build config\n\ne.g.  `test\\runtests.cmd -x64debug`\n\nFor full coverage, please run unit tests against debug and test for both x86 and x64:\n* `test\\runtests.cmd -x64debug`\n* `test\\runtests.cmd -x64test`\n* `test\\runtests.cmd -x86debug`\n* `test\\runtests.cmd -x86test`\n\n`runtests.cmd` can take more switches that are useful for running a subset of tests.  Read the script file for more information.\n`runtests.cmd` looks for the build output in the default build output folder `Build\\VcBuild\\bin`. If the build output path is changed from this default then use the `-bindir` switch to specify that path.\n\n### b) Linux or macOS\n\nBuild the version of ChakraCore you wish to test - either a Debug or Test (RelWithDebugInfo) build. You will need the ChakraCore library and the `ch` application built.\n\nIf building with `cmake` you can then use the `make check` or `ninja check` command to run the test suite.\nAlternatively you can directly run `test/runtests.py` you'll need to specify `-t` (Test build) or `-d` (Debug build).\n\n`runtests.py` can take more switches that are useful for running a subset of tests.  Read the script file for more information.\n`runtests.py` looks for the build output in the default build output folder `out/test/ch` or `out/debug/ch`. If you've used a different path then use `--binary=path` to specify it\n\n## Issue Labels\n\n - [`help wanted`](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/labels/help%20wanted): these issues are specifically well suited for outside contributors.\n - [`good first issue`](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/labels/good%20first%20issue): these issues are small and appropriate for people who wish to familiarize themselves with GitHub pull requests and/or ChakraCore's contributor guidelines, build process, and running tests.  We're here to help you get started in open source.\n\nYou are welcome to work on issues that are not tagged with these labels. However, issues without these labels may be fairly complex, therefore please discuss with a core team member via comments on the issue before attempting to solve it.\n\nFor all issues you choose to work on please communicate on the issue that you are claiming it to avoid duplicated work.\n\nTo learn more about our GitHub labels see the [Label Glossary](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/Label-Glossary) on our wiki page.\n"

It can be compiled for x64 processors on Linux macOS and Windows. And x86 and ARM for Windows only. It is a future goal to support x86 and ARM processors on Linux and ARM on macOS. \n\n## Future of ChakraCore\n\nAs you may have heard Microsoft Edge no longer uses Chakra. Microsoft will continue to provide security updates for ChakraCore 1.11 until 9th March 2021 but do not intend to support it after that.\n\nChakraCore is planned to continue as a community project targeted primarily at embedded use cases. We hope to produce future releases with new features and enhancements to support such use cases. We also would like to invite any interested parties to be involved in this project. For further details please see the following draft planning documents:\n[Overall plan](https://github.com/chakra-core/org/blob/master/ChakraCore%20Future%20Plan.md)\n[Version 1.12 plan](https://github.com/chakra-core/org/blob/master/Release%201.12%20plan.md)\n\nAlso see discussion in issue [#6384](https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore/issues/6384)\n\nIf you'd like to contact the community team please either open an issue or join the Discord chat linked above.\n\n## Security\n\nIf you believe you have found a security issue in ChakraCore 1.11, please share it with Microsoft privately following the guidance at the Microsoft [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094). Reporting it via this channel helps minimize risk to projects built with ChakraCore.\n\nIf you find a security issue in the Master branch of Chakracore but not in 1.11 please join our Discord server and private message one of the Core team members.\n\n## Documentation\n\n* [ChakraCore Architecture](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/wiki/Architecture-Overview)\n* [Quickstart Embedding ChakraCore](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/wiki/Embedding-ChakraCore)\n* [API Reference](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/wiki/JavaScript-Runtime-%28JSRT%29-Reference)\n* [Contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [Blogs, talks and other resources](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/wiki/Resources)\n\n## Building ChakraCore\n\nYou can build ChakraCore on Windows 7 SP1 or above, and Windows Server 2008 R2 or above, with either Visual Studio 2015 or 2017 with C++ support installed.  Once you have Visual Studio installed:\n\n* Clone ChakraCore through ```git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore.git```\n* Open `Build\\Chakra.Core.sln` in Visual Studio\n* Build Solution\n\nOn macOS you can build ChakraCore with the xcode command line tools and `cmake`.\nOn Linux you can build ChakraCore with `cmake` and `ninja`.\n\nMore details in [Building ChakraCore](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/wiki/Building-ChakraCore).\n\nAlternatively, see [Getting ChakraCore binaries](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/wiki/Getting-ChakraCore-binaries) for pre-built ChakraCore binaries.\n\n## Using ChakraCore\n\nOnce built, you have a few options for how you can use ChakraCore:\n\n* The most basic is to test the engine is running correctly with the application *ch.exe* (ch on linux or macOS).  This app is a lightweight host of ChakraCore that you can use to run small applications.  After building, you can find this binary in:\n  * Windows: `Build\\VcBuild\\bin\\${platform}_${configuration}` (e.g. `Build\\VcBuild\\bin\\x64_debug`)\n  * macOS/Linux: `buildFolder/config/ch` (e.g. `out/Release/ch`)\n* You can [embed ChakraCore](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/wiki/Embedding-ChakraCore) in your applications - see [documentation](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/wiki/Embedding-ChakraCore) and [samples](https://aka.ms/chakracoresamples).\n\n_A note about using ChakraCore_: ChakraCore is a JavaScript engine, it does not include the external APIs that are provided by a Web Browser or Node.js.  For example, DOM APIs like ```document.write()``` are additional APIs that are not provided by ChakraCore, when embedding ChakraCore in an application you will need to implement your own input and output APIs. For debugging, in `ch` you can use ```print()``` to put text to the terminal.\n\nAlternatively, if you are using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager you can download and install ChakraCore with CMake integration in a single command:\n* vcpkg install chakracore\n\n## Contribute\n\nContributions to ChakraCore are welcome.  Here is how you can contribute to ChakraCore:\n\n* [Submit bugs](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/issues) and help us verify fixes.\n* [Submit pull requests](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/pulls) for bug fixes and features and discuss existing proposals\n\nPlease refer to [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.\n\n## License\n\nCode licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\n\n## Contact Us\n\nIf you have questions about ChakraCore, or you would like to reach out to us about an issue you're having or for development advice as you work on a ChakraCore issue, you can reach us as follows:\n\n* Open an [issue](https://github.com/chakra-core/ChakraCore/issues/new) and prefix the issue title with [Question].

This version of the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n0. Additional Definitions.\nAs used herein, 'this License' refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License, and the 'GNU GPL' refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n'The Library' refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an\nApplication or a Combined Work as defined below.\nAn 'Application' is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library,\nbut which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class\ndefined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\nA 'Combined Work' is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with\nthe Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work\nwas made is also called the 'Linked Version'.\nThe 'Minimal Corresponding Source' for a Combined Work means the Corresponding\nSource for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the\nCombined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application,\nand not on the Linked Version.\nThe 'Corresponding Application Code' for a Combined Work means the object code\nand/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs\nneeded for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the\nSystem Libraries of the Combined Work.\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being\nbound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers\nto a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility\n(other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may\nconvey a copy of the modified version:\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that,\nin the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility\nstill operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License\napplicable to that copy.\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your\nchoice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical\nparameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions\nand templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used\nin it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n4. Combined Works.\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,\neffectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained\nin the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if\nyou also do each of the following:\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include\nthe copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nd) Do one of the following:\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and\nthe Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that\npermit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version\nof the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified\nby section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable\nmechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present\non the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified\nversion of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required\nto provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent\nthat such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of\nthe Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a\nmodified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation\nInformation must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding\nApplication Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\nInformation in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\nCorresponding Source.)\n5. Combined Libraries.\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by\nside in a single library together with other library facilities that are not\nApplications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined\nlibrary under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the\nLibrary, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms\nof this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work\nbased on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined\nform of the same work.\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU\nLesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar\nin spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\nas you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License 'or any later version' applies to it, you have the option\nof following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any\nlater version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License\never published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether\nfuture versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that\nproxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization\nfor you to choose that version for the Library.\n=========================================\nEND OF BeatDetektor.js NOTICES, INFORMATION, AND LICENSE\n\n%% Catch  NOTICES, INFORMATION, AND LICENSE BEGIN HERE\n=========================================\nFor Catch:\n\nCatch\n\nCopyright (c) 2012 Two Blue Cubes Ltd.

Some jurisdictions do not allow\nlimitations of liability, so the foregoing limitation may not apply to you.\n\nIndemnity\nYou agree to indemnify and hold Apple, its officers, directors, shareholders,\npredecessors, successors in interest, employees, agents, subsidiaries and affiliates,\nharmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys'\nfees), made against Apple by any third party due to or arising out of or in\nconnection with your use of the Site.\n\nViolation of These Terms of Use\nApple may disclose any information we have about you (including your identity)\nif we determine that such disclosure is necessary in connection with any\ninvestigation or complaint regarding your use of the Site, or to identify, contact\nor bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference\nwith (either intentionally or unintentionally) Appleís rights or property, or the\nrights or property of visitors to or users of the Site, including Apple's\ncustomers. Apple reserves the right at all times to disclose any information that\nApple deems necessary to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process\nor governmental request. Apple also may disclose your information when Apple\ndetermines that applicable law requires or permits such disclosure, including\nexchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection\npurposes.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that Apple may preserve any transmittal or communication\nby you with Apple through the Site or any service offered on or through the Site,\nand may also disclose such data if required to do so by law or Apple determines\nthat such preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with\nlegal process, (2) enforce these Terms of Use, (3) respond to claims that any\nsuch data violates the rights of others, or (4) protect the rights, property or\npersonal safety of Apple, its employees, users of or visitors to the Site, and\nthe public.\n\nYou agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice,\nterminate your access to the Site and/or block your future access to the Site\nif we determine that you have violated these Terms of Use or other agreements\nor guidelines which may be associated with your use of the Site. You also agree\nthat any violation by you of these Terms of Use will constitute an unlawful and\nunfair business practice, and will cause irreparable harm to Apple, for which\nmonetary damages would be inadequate, and you consent to Apple obtaining any\ninjunctive or equitable relief that Apple deems necessary or appropriate in\nsuch circumstances. These remedies are in addition to any other remedies Apple\nmay have at law or in equity.\n\nYou agree that Apple may, in its sole discretion and without prior notice,\nterminate your access to the Site, for cause, which includes (but is not limited\nto) (1) requests by law enforcement or other government agencies, (2) a request\nby you (self-initiated account deletions), (3) discontinuance or material\nmodification of the Site or any service offered on or through the Site, or (4)\nunexpected technical issues or problems.\n\nIf Apple does take any legal action against you as a result of your violation of\nthese Terms of Use, Apple will be entitled to recover from you, and you agree to\npay, all reasonable attorneysí fees and costs of such action, in addition to any\nother relief granted to Apple. You agree that Apple will not be liable to you or\nto any third party for termination of your access to the Site as a result of any\nviolation of these Terms of Use.\n\nGoverning Law; Dispute Resolution\nYou agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site,\nincluding all disputes, will be governed by the laws of the United States and by\nthe laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of laws\nprovisions. You agree to the personal jurisdiction by and venue in the state and\nfederal courts in Santa Clara County, California, and waive any objection to such\njurisdiction or venue. The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if\nyou are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in\nthe European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you\nreside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year\nafter the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred.\nClaims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and\nservices are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or\nreceived for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the\nprevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneysí fees. In the event of\nany controversy or dispute between Apple and you arising out of or in connection\nwith your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith,\nto resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within\na reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit\nsuch controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved\nthrough mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy\navailable to them under applicable law.\n\nVoid Where Prohibited\nApple administers and operates the www.apple.com Site from its location in Cupertino,\nCalifornia USA; other Apple sites may be administered and operated from various\nlocations outside the United States. Although the Site is accessible worldwide,\nnot all features, products or services discussed, referenced, provided or offered\nthrough or on the Site are available to all persons or in all geographic locations,\nor appropriate or available for use outside the United States. Apple reserves the\nright to limit, in its sole discretion, the provision and quantity of any feature,\nproduct or service to any person or geographic area. Any offer for any feature,\nproduct or service made on the Site is void where prohibited. If you choose to\naccess the Site from outside the United States, you do so on your own initiative\nand you are solely responsible for complying with applicable local laws.\n\nMiscellaneous\nYou may not use or export or re-export any Content or any copy or adaptation of\nsuch Content, or any product or service offered on the Site, in violation of any\napplicable laws or regulations, including without limitation United States export\nlaws and regulations.\n\nIf any of the provisions of these Terms of Use are held by a court or other\ntribunal of competent jurisdiction to be void or unenforceable, such provisions\nshall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary and replaced with\na valid provision that best embodies the intent of these Terms of Use, so that\nthese Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect. These Terms of Use\nconstitute the entire agreement between you and Apple with regard to your use of\nthe Site, and any and all other written or oral agreements or understandings\npreviously existing between you and Apple with respect to such use are hereby\nsuperseded and cancelled. Other than as provided in a purchase agreement you\nenter into with Apple, Apple will not accept any counter-offers to these Terms\nof Use, and all such offers are hereby categorically rejected. Appleís failure\nto insist on or enforce strict performance of these Terms of Use shall not be\nconstrued as a waiver by Apple of any provision or any right it has to enforce\nthese Terms of Use, nor shall any course of conduct between Apple and you or\nany other party be deemed to modify any provision of these Terms of Use. These\nTerms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or\nremedies on any third parties.\n\nApple provides access to Apple international data and, therefore, may contain\nreferences or cross references to Apple products, programs and services that\nare not announced in your country. Such reference does not imply that Apple in\nyour country intends to announce such products, programs or services.\n\nFeedback and Information\nAny feedback you provide at this site shall be deemed to be non-confidential.\nApple shall be free to use such information on an unrestricted basis.\n\nThe information contained in this web site is subject to change without notice.\nCopyright © 1997-2009 Apple Inc.

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee\nyour freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free\nfor all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free\nSoftware Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit\nto using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU\nLesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General\nPublic Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute\ncopies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive\nsource code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or\nuse pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of such a\nprogram, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights\nthat you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or\nmodify the software.\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's\nfree use or not licensed at all.\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms\nof this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\ninto another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running\nthe Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\nyou changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in\npart contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed\nas a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you\nmust cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary\nway, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice\nand a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\nwarranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions,\nand telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the\nProgram itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement,\nyour work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections\nof that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered\nindependent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms,\ndo not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But\nwhen you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and\nthus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights\nto work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to\ncontrol the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\nabove provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code,\nwhich must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give\nany third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing\nsource distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding\nsource code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute\ncorresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial\ndistribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable\nform with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating\nsystem on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable. If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\nto copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any\nwork based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program\nor works based on it.\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the\nrecipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy,\ndistribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may\nnot impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights\ngranted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties\nto this License.\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed\non you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations\nunder this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not\npermit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies\ndirectly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it\nand this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular\ncircumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as\na whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is\nup to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software\nthrough any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries\neither by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who\nplaces the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution\nlimitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or\namong countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\nor of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program\ndoes not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs whose\ndistribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for permission.\nFor software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the\nFree Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision\nwill be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives\nof our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\nNO WARRANTY\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\"\nWITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\nYOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY\nSERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE\nOF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\nOTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n=========================================\nEND OF deltablue.js NOTICES, INFORMATION, AND LICENSE\n\n%% Dojo Toolkit NOTICES, INFORMATION, AND LICENSE BEGIN HERE\n=========================================\nCopyright (c) 2005-2015, The Dojo Foundation All rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification,\nare permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\nRedistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this list\nof conditions and the following disclaimer.

If Contributor\nobtains such knowledge after the Modification is made available as described in\nSection 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor\nmakes available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate\nmailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who received the\nCovered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n(b) Contributor APIs\nIf Contributor's Modifications include an application programming interface and\nContributor has knowledge of patent licenses which are reasonably necessary to\nimplement that API, Contributor must also include this information in the legal\nfile.\n(c) Representations.\nContributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4 (a) above,\nContributor believes that Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original\ncreation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\nby this License.\n3.5. Required Notices.\nYou must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it\nis not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its\nstructure, then You must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant\ndirectory) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. If You created\none or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice\ndescribed in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\nfor the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights\nrelating to Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code.\nHowever, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\nDeveloper or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby\nagree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability\nincurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\nsupport, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\nYou may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5 have been met for that Covered Code, and if\nYou include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is\navailable under the terms of this License, including a description of how and where\nYou have fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously\nincluded in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral\nin which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may\ndistribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership rights under a\nlicense of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided\nthat You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for\nthe Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's rights\nin the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this License. If You\ndistribute the Executable version under a different license You must make it\nabsolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by\nYou alone, not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to\nindemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\nby the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n3.7. Larger Works.\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code not governed\nby the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product.\nIn such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled\nfor the Covered Code.\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with\nrespect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial order, or\nregulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the maximum\nextent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such\ndescription must be included in the legal file described in Section 3.4 and must\nbe included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent\nprohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed\nfor a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n5. Application of this License.\nThis License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached the notice\nin Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n6. Versions of the License.\n6.1. New Versions\nNetscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the License from time to time. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n6.2. Effect of New Versions\nOnce Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License,\nYou may always continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also\nchoose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the\nLicense published by Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify\nthe terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n6.3. Derivative Works\nIf You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may only do in\norder to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code governed by this\nLicense), You must (a) rename Your license so that the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\",\n\"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\", \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in\nyour license (except to note that your license differs from this License) and (b)\notherwise make it clear that Your version of the license contains terms which differ\nfrom the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name\nof the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\nExhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n7. Disclaimer of warranty\nCovered code is provided under this license on an \"as is\" basis, without warranty\nof any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties\nthat the covered code is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose\nor non-infringing. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the covered\ncode is with you. Should any covered code prove defective in any respect, you (not\nthe initial developer or any other contributor) assume the cost of any necessary\nservicing, repair or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an\nessential part of this license. No use of any covered code is authorized hereunder\nexcept under this disclaimer.\n8. Termination\n8.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if\nYou fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of\nbecoming aware of the breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly\ngranted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\nnature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n8.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding\ndeclatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial\nDeveloper or Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as\n\"Participant\") alleging that:\nsuch Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent,\nthen any and all rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or\n2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\nprospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either:\n(i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable royalty\nfor Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or\n(ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against\nsuch Participant. If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment\narrangement are not mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation\nclaim is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1\nand/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice period\nspecified above. any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\nContributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any rights\ngranted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked\neffective as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had made,\nModifications made by that Participant.\n8.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant alleging that\nsuch Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent\nwhere such claim is resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\ninitiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the\nlicenses granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\ninto account in determining the amount or value of any payment or license.\n8.4. In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above, all end user\nlicense agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly\ngranted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\ntermination.\n9. Limitation of liability\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including\nnegligence), contract, or otherwise, shall you, the initial developer, any\nother contributor, or any distributor of covered code, or any supplier of any\nof such parties, be liable to any person for any indirect, special, incidental,\nor consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages\nfor loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and\nall other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\ninformed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall\nnot apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such party's\nnegligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions\ndo not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages,\nso this exclusion and limitation may not apply to you.\n10. U.S. government end users\nThe Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.\n2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial\ncomputer software documentation,\" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through\n227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with\nonly those rights set forth herein.\n11. Miscellaneous\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof.\nIf any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision\nshall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This\nLicense shall be governed by California law provisions (except to the extent\napplicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law\nprovisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen\nof, or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United States of\nAmerica, any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the\njurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with\nvenue lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible\nfor costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys'\nfees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts\nfor the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation\nwhich provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the\ndrafter shall not apply to this License.\n12. Responsibility for claims\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for\nclaims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of\nrights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and\nContributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\nherein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n13. Multiple-licensed code\nInitial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as \"Multiple-Licensed\".\n\"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial Developer permits you to utilize portions\nof the Covered Code under Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if\nany, specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n=========================================\nEND OF Pixastic Lib NOTICES, INFORMATION, AND LICENSE\n\n%% Prototype NOTICES, INFORMATION, AND LICENSE BEGIN HERE\n=========================================\nCopyright (c) 2005-2010 Sam Stephenson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
