          "content": "# Developer notes\n\nBelow are helpful notes for developers hacking on or releasing new versions of IPFS Desktop.\n\n## Release checklist\n\nBefore cutting a new release of IPFS Desktop, please go through the following process:\n\n### Manual testing\n\nManually test a few things that don't transfer well to automated testing:\n\n\n1. **Mac & Windows (both must to be checked):** Confirm that drag-and-drop file import works:\n   - Open _Files_ screen\n   - Drag file(s) into it (PDF, images, or videos)\n   - Confirm file(s) import was successful by clicking on newly imported file to preview\n2. **Mac & Windows (one check is sufficient):** Confirm that import via _Import_ button works:\n   - Open _Files_ screen\n   - Click on _Import_ button and select files(s) (directory, or standalone PDF, images, or videos)\n   - Confirm file(s) import was successful by clicking on newly imported file to preview\n3. **Mac only:** Drag/drop onto menubar icon behaves as expected when dragging one file, several files, and a combination of files/folders:\n   - File(s) import correctly\n   - Correct link is copied to clipboard\n4. **Windows only:** Right-click on a file and \"Add to IPFS\" from context menu works as expected:\n   - File(s) import correctly\n   - Correct link is copied to clipboard\n5. **Mac & Windows (both must to be checked):** Confirm that OS-wide protocol handler was registered by opening <a href=\"ipfs://bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi\">`ipfs://bafybeigdyrzt5sfp7udm7hu76uh7y26nf3efuylqabf3oclgtqy55fbzdi`</a> in a stock web browser (Edge, Safari, Google Chrome) _without_ IPFS Companion\n\n### Main release process\n\nRelease PRs are created automatically by release-please whenever new changes are merged into the `main` branch. A release is created automatically by CI when that release PR is merged. See the changes made in https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/pull/2664 for more information on that process.\n\nSo the first step is to merge the release PR. Once that is merged, the release will be created automatically by CI. Once the release is created, the following steps need to be done manually:\n\n#### Mark the latest release as `latest` and publish it.\n\n1. Check out the [releases page](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/releases) and find the latest release.\n1. Click the `Edit` button for the version we want to release\n1. Ensure the release notes are correct and the binaries and other artifacts are attached. (there should be 15 attached assets total)\n    * The `latest.yml, latest-mac.yml, latest-linux.yml` files on the release are used by the app to determine when an app update is available.\n    * `Source code (tar.gz)` & `Source code (zip)` are attached by github automatically when the release is published.\n1. Check the `Set as the latest release` box.\n1. Then click `Publish release`.\n\n#### When the above PR is merged and github release is created, bump the brew cask version\n\nAll it takes for this is [a simple command which will open a PR for you](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-a-cask):\n\n```bash\nbrew bump --open-pr homebrew/cask/ipfs\n```\n\n### Manual release process\n\nBe sure you have an environment variable `GITHUB_TOKEN` set to a valid GitHub token with `repo` scope.\n\n```bash\n### Create release PR\nnpm run release-pr\n\n### create github release\nnpm run release-gh\n\n### When the above PR is merged and github release is created, bump the brew cask version:\nbrew bump --open-pr homebrew/cask/ipfs\n# see https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-a-cask if you run into issues.\n```\n\n<!-- OLD RELEASE PROCESS (keep for now, until we're sure the new one works)\n1. Update the version using `npm version [major|minor|patch]` (it will create a new tag `vA.B.C`, note it down)\n1. Update all links and badges in `README.md` to point to the new version (`A.B.C`).\n   - You may use `ts-node scripts/release/updateReadme.ts <oldVersion> <newVersion>` to update the readme. e.g. `ts-node scripts/release/updateReadme.ts 0.26.0 0.26.1`\n      - If you do, confirm everything is updated properly.\n1. Update the latest version commit `git tag -d vA.B.C && git add README.md && git commit --amend --no-edit && git tag vA.B.C`\n1. Publish local changes and the tag to the GitHub repo: `git push && git push origin vA.B.C`.\n1. Wait for the CI to upload the binaries to the draft release (a new one will be created if you haven't drafted one).\n1. Publish a release draft.\n   - Once a release is published, users should receive the app update (see https://www.electron.build/auto-update for details).\n   - The `latest.yml, latest-mac.yml, latest-linux.yml` files on the release are used by the app to determine when an app update is available.\n1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with details from release/release draft.\n1. Update selected package managers:\n   - Wait for CI to finish and confirm that it updated [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/ipfs-desktop), and is at least pending review on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ipfs-desktop#versionhistory).\n   - Update the [Homebrew cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#updating-a-cask).\n-->\n\n### Manually notarize `.dmg` with Apple\n\nThese steps are only needed as a fallback if CI is not correctly notarizing the `.dmg` file. For context, see [#1365](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/issues/1211).\n\n1. Download the `.dmg` from `https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/releases/vA.B.C`.\n2. Ensure `APPLEID` and `APPLEIDPASS` are set either as environment variables or entries in `.env` file. These need to belong to the same org as the certificate used for signing.\n3. Run `node pkgs/macos/notarize-cli.js ./IPFS-Desktop-A.B.C.dmg`.\n4. Debug errors by calling the tool directly: `xcrun altool --notarize-app -f /path/to/IPFS-Desktop-0.X.0.dmg --primary-bundle-id io.ipfs.desktop -u XXX-from-vault-XXX -p XXX-app-specific-password-from-vault-XXX`; also, see the [long list of hoops Apple may ask you to jump through](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/pull/1365#issuecomment-598127684).\n\n### Notarization failures\n\nYou may get an error when notarizing the .dmg for macOS, something like\n\n> Error: You do not have required contracts to perform an operation. With error code FORBIDDEN_ERROR.CONTRACT_NOT_VALID for id ca5a6ab7-758b-44a7-973e-b59147a573b8 You do not have required contracts to perform an operation (-19208)\n\nApple requires this every few months: new paperwork, but only Admin can click the Approve button on https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/agreements/#/\n\nContact the PL Apple Developer account Admin (account holder viewed at https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/access/users) in order to approve new contracts/agreements.\n"

If you don't have a node, it'll install one for you. And either way, IPFS Desktop will automatically check for updates.\n\n### Start your node at system startup and control it from your OS\n\nIPFS Desktop enables you to stop or restart your node straight from the IPFS logo menu in your OS menubar/system tray. For Mac and Windows users, IPFS Desktop can also be set to launch at system startup, ensuring that your node is running whenever your computer is on.\n\n### Quickly import files, folders, and screenshots to IPFS\n\nImport files and folders to your IPFS node in a variety of convenient ways:\n- Drag and drop items onto IPFS Desktop's `Files` screen\n- Click the `Import` button on the `Files` screen to add items from your computer or an IPFS [content ID (CID)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/#identifier-formats)\n- (Windows) Right-click a file/folder's icon to add it to IPFS from the pop-up menu\n- (Mac) Drag and drop a file/folder onto the IPFS logo in your menubar\n\nPlus, you can use the `Take Screenshot` command under the IPFS logo menu to take a screenshot, import it to your node, and copy a shareable link to your clipboard with one click.\n\n### Easily manage the contents of your node\n\nIPFS Desktop's `Files` screen gives you an easy, familiar interface for working with the contents of your node:\n- Easily rename, move, or remove files and folders\n- Preview many common file formats directly in IPFS Desktop\n- Copy a file/folder's IPFS [content ID (CID)](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/content-addressing/#identifier-formats) or a shareable link to your clipboard\n- [\"Pin\"](https://docs.ipfs.tech/concepts/persistence/) files to your IPFS node or (coming soon!) to a third-party pinning service\n\n### Visualize your IPFS peers worldwide\n\nVisit the `Peers` screen to see what nodes you're connected to, where they are, the connections they're using, and more.\n\n### Explore the \"Merkle Forest\" of IPFS files\n\nUse the `Explore` screen to explore some example datasets — or your own files — and see firsthand how items stored on IPFS are broken down into content-addressed pieces.\n\n### Enjoy OS-wide support for IPFS files and links\n\nIPFS Desktop enables most operating systems (Mac, Windows and some Linux flavors) to support protocols including `ipfs://` and `ipns://`. This means that if an app on your computer tries to open a link starting with one of those protocol identifiers (for example, if your web browser encounters a link to `ipns://en.wikipedia-on-ipfs.org`), it'll automatically open in IPFS Desktop.\n\nFor an even better experience with `ipfs://`, and `ipns://` addresses, we also recommend installing [IPFS Companion](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion) to add support in your favorite browser!\n\n### Learn IPFS commands as you go\n\nIf you're interested in learning how to use IPFS from the command line, IPFS Desktop's CLI Tutor Mode can show you common IPFS commands as you go. Just check the `CLI Tutor Mode` box on the `Settings` screen to switch on this feature.\n\n## Install\n\nRelease notes and older versions of IPFS Desktop can be found on the [releases page](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/releases).\n\nDon't see your favorite package manager?

For details, see the [build process](`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and the [webui code](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui).\n\nIPFS Desktop in itself is a simple container that makes sure Kubo and IPFS Webui can work together in a standalone fashion and has access to other os-specific features like tray and contextual integrations.\nThere are multiple ways to access IPFS Webui:\n\n- https://webui.ipfs.io/#/welcome\n- http://127.0.0.1:5001/webui (shipped with kubo)\n- IPFS Desktop itself\n\nAll of these instances of IPFS Webui are the same but shipped slightly differently. The file you're seeing being downloaded is a specific release of IPFS Webui, i.e. v4.1.1 has content identifiers (CID) `bafybeiamycmd52xvg6k3nzr6z3n33de6a2teyhquhj4kspdtnvetnkrfim` which can be verified on the [IPFS Webui release page](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/releases).\n\n## Contribute\n\nWe welcome all contributions to IPFS Desktop! The best way to get started is to check the current [open issues](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/issues) (or drill down specifically for [issues labeled \"help wanted\"](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)) and find something interesting. All issues are categorized by the [standard label taxonomy](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/ISSUE_LABELS.md) used across the IPFS project, so you can also drill by topic (for example, [UX-related issues](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atopic%2Fdesign-ux)).\n\nNo matter how you contribute, please be sure you read and follow the [IPFS Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [IPFS Community Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).\n\n### Translations\n\nContributing translations in your language is particularly valuable! We use Transifex to manage internationalization, which means you don't need to change a single line of code to add your translations — just sign up for a Transifex account.\n\nBecause IPFS Desktop app includes text from [IPFS Web UI](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-webui) and [IPLD Explorer](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipld-explorer), you'll want to join all three Transifex projects in order to see all the text:\n- https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/\n- https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui/\n- https://www.transifex.com/ipfs/ipld-explorer/\n\n*Note for developers: We use English as our source of truth. This means that if you add any new text, make those additions in [`./assets/locales/en.json`](./assets/locales/en.json) and they will automatically propagate in Transifex for other languages.*\n\n### Developer notes\n\nFor more detailed information about hacking on IPFS Desktop, including a release checklist, please see the full [developer notes](DEVELOPER-NOTES.md).\n\n## FAQ & Troubleshooting\n\n### Why am I missing the system tray menu on Linux?\n\nIPFS Desktop is built using Electron, and unfortunately, poor system tray support has been a [longstanding problem with Electron apps](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21445).\n\nYou may wish to try troubleshooting according to the [Electron v9.3.0 docs](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/v9.3.0/docs/api/tray.md#class-tray):\n\n- On Linux, the app indicator will be used if it is supported; otherwise `GtkStatusIcon` will be used\n- On Linux distributions that only have app indicator support, you must install `libappindicator1` to make the tray icon work\n\nIf you've noticed that the old system tray is back in IPFS Desktop v0.13, this is because the Electron team [removed support for `StatusNotifier` and restored the old tray interface on Linux called `XEmbed`](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/21445#issuecomment-634163402).\n\n### Why can't I install IPFS Desktop under Debian 11?\n\nDebian package depends on `libappindicator3-1` which does not exist in Debian 11 anymore.\n\nYou need to install this missing dependency [on your own](https://gist.github.com/keyle/b4536dc922bb13d7b5dce16a7db7e328), or use `.AppImage` instead.\n\n### Why can't I start IPFS Desktop under Debian 10?\n\nSome Linux users may see one of the following errors when trying to launch IPFS Desktop:\n\nWhen launching by double-clicking the app icon:\n> The SUID sandbox helper binary was found, but is not configured correctly.\nRather than run without sandboxing I'm aborting now. You need to make sure that\nchrome-sandbox is owned by root and has mode 4755.\n\nWhen launching from the terminal:\n```console\n$ ipfs-desktop\n$Trace/breakpoint trap\n```\n\nThis is a known issue with Electron/Chrome and some hardened kernels. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/issues/1362#issuecomment-596857282), but a fix is to start IPFS Desktop from the terminal with the following additional parameter:\n```console\n$ ipfs-desktop --no-sandbox\n```\n\n### Where are my IPFS configuration and log files?\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> IPFS Desktop app configuration is separate from the configuration and repository of Kubo IPFS node.\n\nYou can open Desktop app and log files from the IPFS logo menu by selecting `Open Logs Directory` or `Open Configuration File` from the `Advanced` submenu. Or, find them in your OS as follows:\n- **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/IPFS Desktop/`\n- **Windows:** `%appdata%/IPFS Desktop/`\n- **Linux:** `~/.config/IPFS Desktop/`\n\n### How does IPFS Desktop select the IPFS repo location?\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> IPFS Desktop uses [Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) implementation of IPFS node, which has its own configuration and repository, separate from the Desktop app.\n\nIPFS Desktop uses [ipfsd-ctl](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl) to locate Kubo repository.\n\n1. First, it checks the `IPFS_PATH` environment variable.\n2. If that isn't set, it falls back to `$HOME/.ipfs`. As soon as the first run has succeeded, repository location info is saved in the configuration file, which becomes the source of truth.\n\nTo open your Kubo repo directory from the IPFS logo menu, select `Open Repository Directory` from the `Advanced` submenu.\n\n### Which version of IPFS does IPFS Desktop use?\n\nIPFS Desktop includes its own embedded binary of Kubo (`kubo` version defined in `package.json`); this is the latest version of [Kubo](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo) that has passed QA for IPFS Desktop use.\n\nYou can check which version of IPFS you're running from the IPFS logo menu by looking in the `About` submenu.\n\n### Which flags does IPFS Desktop boot with?\n\nBy default, IPFS Desktop starts the IPFS daemon with the flags `--migrate=true --enable-gc=true`.\n\nYou can change this in the IPFS Desktop config file by selecting `Open Configuration File` from the `Advanced` submenu.\n\n### I got a `repo.lock` error. How do I resolve this?\n\nIn general, this means that a previous process was unable to remove the repository lock (indicator that file is in use) from the repository directory. This is supposed to be handled automatically, but sometimes it isn't. If you get this error, you can generally safely delete this file after shutting down any running IPFS daemon's or applications. Simple process is as follows:\n\n1. Stop ipfs processes;\n2. Manually delete lock file, located within the [repository](#how-does-ipfs-desktop-select-the-ipfs-repo-location);\n3. Attempt to start ipfs desktop (or other process that received the `repo.lock` error) again.\n\n### I got a network error (e.g. `Error fetching`). What should I do?\n\nWhen upgrading, IPFS may need to perform migrations and for that we need a stable connection to download the required information for the migrations. Sometimes, the Internet connection may fail or be blocked by firewalls or antiviruses, and then you will run into a network error. Before submitting an issue, please try the following:\n\n1. Check if you are connected to the Internet;\n2. Make sure your firewall or antivirus is not blocking requests, such as P2P traffic;\n3. Try again, by restarting IPFS Desktop.\n\n### Error: Initializing daemon...\n\nThese errors pop up from [ipfsd-ctl](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfsd-ctl) when the Kubo daemon fails to start up. Below are some scenarios where you may run into this error.\n\n#### Error: Your programs version (N) is lower than your repos (N+x).\n\nThis means you are attempting to run an older version of ipfs-desktop or Kubo than you have previously ran on your machine. Each Kubo version (which is included with ipfs-desktop) is tied to a specific IPFS repo version, which you can see at https://github.com/ipfs/fs-repo-migrations#when-should-i-migrate.\n\nThe ideal solution is to ensure you're running [the latest version of ipfs-desktop](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/releases/latest), as upward migrations happen automatically.\n\nIt is possible that your `PATH` has different kubo version than the one bundled with IPFS Desktop, in such case you should update it to [the latest kubo binary](https://github.com/ipfs/kubo/releases/latest) as well.\n\nHowever, if you are an advanced user and you really need to run the older version that is emitting this error, you will need to run a migration in reverse, manually. You can follow the official instructions [here](https://github.com/ipfs/fs-repo-migrations/blob/master/run.md) but with additional parameters: `fs-repo-migrations -revert-ok -to N`. See `fs-repo-migrations --help` for more information.\n\n#### Found outdated fs-repo, migrations need to be run. - Error fetching: context deadline exceeded\n\nThis happens when there is a problem with downloading migrations needed by [fs-repo-migrations](https://github.com/ipfs/fs-repo-migrations/blob/master/run.md). The errors usually look something like this:\n\n```bash\nError: Initializing daemon...\nKubo version: 0.22.0\nRepo version: 14\nSystem version: amd64/darwin\nGolang version: go1.19.12\nFound outdated fs-repo, migrations need to be run.\nLooking for suitable migration binaries.\nNeed 1 migrations, downloading.\nDownloading migration: fs-repo-13-to-14...\nFetching with HTTP: \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYerugGRCZWA8yQMKDsd9daEVXUR3C5nuw3VXuX1mggHa/fs-repo-13-to-14/versions\"\nFetching with HTTP: \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYerugGRCZWA8yQMKDsd9daEVXUR3C5nuw3VXuX1mggHa/fs-repo-13-to-14/versions\"\nFetching with HTTP: \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYerugGRCZWA8yQMKDsd9daEVXUR3C5nuw3VXuX1mggHa/fs-repo-13-to-14/versions\"\nError fetching: exceeded number of retries. last error was http.DefaultClient.Do error: Get \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYerugGRCZWA8yQMKDsd9daEVXUR3C5nuw3VXuX1mggHa/fs-repo-13-to-14/versions\": dial tcp 199.16.156.40:443: i/o timeout\nFetching with IPFS: \"fs-repo-13-to-14/versions\"\nError fetching: context deadline exceeded\ncould not get latest version of migration fs-repo-13-to-14: 2 errors occurred:\n\t* exceeded number of retries. last error was http.DefaultClient.Do error: Get \"https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYerugGRCZWA8yQMKDsd9daEVXUR3C5nuw3VXuX1mggHa/fs-repo-13-to-14/versions\": dial tcp 199.16.156.40:443: i/o timeout\n\t*\n```\n\nYou can update your Kubo config to try different sources of the migration files.\n\n##### With IPFS-Desktop\n\n1. Go to the Settings tab\n2. Find \"Migrations\" in the config, and update the `DownloadSources` array to be `[\"IPFS\", \"https://dweb.link\", \"https://cloudflare-ipfs.com\", \"HTTP\"]`\n\n##### From the terminal\n\nFor this method, you have to have the `ipfs` binary available on your command line:\n\n```bash\nipfs config --json Migration.DownloadSources '[\"IPFS\", \"https://dweb.link\", \"https://cloudflare-ipfs.com\", \"HTTP\"]'\n```\n\n##### Manually in an editor (not recommended)\n\nYou can also edit the config file (`~/.ipfs/config` or `C:\\Users\\Username\\.ipfs\\config`) manually. Just make sure the json file is valid when you finish.\n\n### I need more help!\n\nIf you need help with using IPFS Desktop, the quickest way to get answers is to post them in the [official IPFS forums](https://discuss.ipfs.tech).\n\nIf you think you've found a bug or other issue with IPFS Desktop itself, please [open an issue](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-desktop/issues/new/choose).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT — Protocol Labs, Inc.](./LICENSE)\n"
