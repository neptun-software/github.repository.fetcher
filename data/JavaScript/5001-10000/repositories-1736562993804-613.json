They are both maintained. They are exclusive.\n\nPlease import the one you need for your project, not both:\n\n- **AR.js with Image Tracking + Location Based AR (AFRAME):**\n\n  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js\n\n- **AR.js with Marker Tracking + Location Based AR (AFRAME):**\n\n  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js\n\n\n- **AR.js with Image Tracking + Marker Tracking (Threejs):**\n\n  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/build/ar-threex.js\n\n  if you need the ARjs namespace import ar.js:\n\n  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/build/ar.js\n\n- **AR.js with Location Based AR (Threejs):**\n\n  - https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/three.js/build/ar-threex-location-only.js\n\n\nYou can also import a specific version replacing `master` keyword with version tag:\n\n```html\n  <script src=\"https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/3.4.6/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js\">\n```\n\n## Get started\n\n### 🖼 **Image Tracking**\n\nPlease follow these simple steps:\n\n- Create a new project with the code below (or [open this live example](https://ar-js-org.github.io/.github/profile/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/) and go directly to the last step)\n- Run it on a server\n- Open the website on your phone\n- Scan [this picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/trex-image-big.jpeg) to see content through the camera.\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/aframevr/aframe@1.6.0/dist/aframe-master.min.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js\"></script>\n\n<style>\n  .arjs-loader {\n    height: 100%;\n    width: 100%;\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 0;\n    left: 0;\n    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);\n    z-index: 9999;\n    display: flex;\n    justify-content: center;\n    align-items: center;\n  }\n\n  .arjs-loader div {\n    text-align: center;\n    font-size: 1.25em;\n    color: white;\n  }\n</style>\n\n<body style=\"margin : 0px; overflow: hidden;\">\n  <!-- minimal loader shown until image descriptors are loaded -->\n  <div class=\"arjs-loader\">\n    <div>Loading, please wait...</div>\n  </div>\n  <a-scene\n    vr-mode-ui=\"enabled: false;\"\n    renderer=\"logarithmicDepthBuffer: true; precision: medium;\"\n    embedded\n    arjs=\"trackingMethod: best; sourceType: webcam;debugUIEnabled: false;\"\n  >\n    <!-- we use cors proxy to avoid cross-origin problems ATTENTION! you need to set up your server -->\n    <a-nft\n      type=\"nft\"\n      url=\"your-server/https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/trex/trex-image/trex\"\n      smooth=\"true\"\n      smoothCount=\"10\"\n      smoothTolerance=\".01\"\n      smoothThreshold=\"5\"\n    >\n      <a-entity\n        gltf-model=\"your-server/https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/trex/scene.gltf\"\n        scale=\"5 5 5\"\n        position=\"150 300 -100\"\n      >\n      </a-entity>\n    </a-nft>\n    <a-entity camera></a-entity>\n  </a-scene>\n</body>\n```\n\n### 🌍Location Based Example\n\nPlease follow these simple steps:\n\n- Create a new project with the following snippet, and change `add-your-latitude` and `add-your-longitude` with your latitude and longitude, without the `<>`.\n- Run it on a server\n- Activate GPS on your phone and navigate to the example URL\n- Look around. You should see the text looking at you, appearing in the requested position, even if you look around and move.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n    <meta http-equiv=\"X-UA-Compatible\" content=\"IE=edge\" />\n    <title>GeoAR.js demo</title>\n    <script src=\"https://aframe.io/releases/1.6.0/aframe.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://unpkg.com/aframe-look-at-component@1.0.0/dist/aframe-look-at-component.min.js\"></script>\n    <script src=\"https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar-nft.js\"></script>\n  </head>\n\n  <body>\n    <a-scene\n      vr-mode-ui=\"enabled: false\"\n      arjs=\"sourceType: webcam; videoTexture: true; debugUIEnabled: false;\"\n    >\n      <a-text\n        value=\"This content will always face you.\"\n        look-at=\"[gps-camera]\"\n        scale=\"120 120 120\"\n        gps-entity-place=\"latitude: <add-your-latitude>; longitude: <add-your-longitude>;\"\n      ></a-text>\n      <a-camera gps-camera rotation-reader> </a-camera>\n    </a-scene>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### 🔲 Marker Based Example\n\nPlease follow this simple steps:\n\n- Create a new project with the code below (or [open this live example](https://ar-js-org.github.io/.github/profile/aframe/examples/marker-based/basic.html) and go directly to the last step)\n- Run it on a server\n- Open the website on your phone\n- Scan [this picture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/data/images/hiro.png) to see content through the camera.\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n    <script src=\"https://aframe.io/releases/1.6.0/aframe.min.js\"></script>\n    <!-- we import arjs version without NFT but with marker + location based support -->\n    <script src=\"https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/build/aframe-ar.js\"></script>\n    <body style=\"margin : 0px; overflow: hidden;\">\n        <a-scene embedded arjs>\n        <a-marker preset=\"hiro\">\n            <!-- we use cors proxy to avoid cross-origin problems ATTENTION! you need to set up your server -->\n            <a-entity\n            position=\"0 0 0\"\n            scale=\"0.05 0.05 0.05\"\n            gltf-model=\"your-server/https://raw.githack.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/master/aframe/examples/image-tracking/nft/trex/scene.gltf\"\n            ></a-entity>\n        </a-marker>\n        <a-entity camera></a-entity>\n        </a-scene>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\nImportant! Be aware that if you are referring to external resources, in any app, especially those using NFT, you will encounter CORS problems if those resources are not in the same server of the code. If you can’t see the tracking, please open your Browser Dev Tools and check if you have CORS errors in the console. If so, you have to fix those errors in order to see your content. The correct fix is to place your resources on the same server of your code.\n\nIf you cannot do that, you can host a proxy anywhere server to solve that (https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere).\nPlease note that several hosting services have policies that does not permit to use such server. Always check hosting services policies before using them to avoid account suspensions\n\nLearn more on the [AR.js Official Documentation](https://ar-js-org.github.io/AR.js-Docs/).\n\n## ES6 npm package\n\nYou can install **AR.js** with **npm** and use in any compatible project that support npm modules (React.js, Vue.js, Next.js or whatelse), to install it run:\n\n```\n// Install with npm\nnpm install @ar-js-org/ar.js\n```\n```\n// Install with yarn\nyarn add @ar-js-org/ar.js\n```\nFor some examples read this [issue](https://github.com/AR-js-org/AR.js/issues/234).\n### New Import Syntax for `ar-threex.mjs` and `ar.mjs`\n\nWith the latest updates (3.4.6), `three.js` can now be imported using the ES module syntax. \nTo align with this standard, `ar-threex.mjs`,`ar.mjs` and `ar-threex-location-only.mjs` should also be imported in the same way using an import map. Here is an example of how to import these modules in your project:\n\n```html\n// Example importing ar-threex.mjs\n<script type=\"importmap\">\n{\n  \"imports\": {\n    \"three\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/three@0.164.0/build/three.module.js\",\n    \"threex\": \"./path/to/ar-threex.mjs\",\n  }\n}\n</script>\n\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport * as THREE from 'three';\nimport { ArToolkitSource, ArToolkitContext, ArMarkerControls }  from 'threex'\n\n// Your AR.js code here\n</script>\n```\nRead the examples included in this repository for more information, but basically the only change is the import syntax.\n\n## Troubleshooting, feature requests, community\n\n**You can find a lot of help on the old [AR.js repositories issues](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/issues). Please search on open/closed issues, you may find interesting stuff.**\n\n### Contributing\n\nFrom opening a bug report to creating a pull request: every contribution is\nappreciated and welcome. If you're planning to implement a new feature or change\nthe api please create an issue first. This way we can ensure that your precious\nwork is not in vain.\n\n### Issues\n\nIf you are having configuration or setup problems, please post\na question to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=ar.js).\nYou can also address the question to us in our [Gitter chatroom](https://gitter.im/AR-js/Lobby)\n\n**If you have discovered a bug or have a feature suggestion, feel free to create an issue on Github.**\n\n### Submitting Changes\n\nAfter getting some feedback, push to your fork and submit a pull request.
