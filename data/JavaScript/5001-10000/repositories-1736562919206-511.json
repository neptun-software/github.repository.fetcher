By participating in this project, you\nagree to abide by the thoughtbot [code of conduct].\n\nWe expect everyone to follow the code of conduct anywhere in thoughtbot's\nproject codebases, issue trackers, chat-rooms, and mailing lists.\n\n[code of conduct]: https://thoughtbot.com/open-source-code-of-conduct\n\n## Getting Started\n\nAdministrate is a [Rails Engine][], but ships with everything needed to\ncontribute and test new changes.\n\nTo maintain compatibility with multiple dependency versions, we use\n[Appraisal][].\n\n[Rails Engine]: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html\n[Appraisal]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal\n\n### Opening a PR\n\n1. Fork the repo,\n2. Run `./bin/setup` to install the base dependencies and setup a local\n   database,\n3. Run the test suite: `bundle exec rspec && bundle exec appraisal rspec`,\n4. Make your changes,\n5. Push your fork and open a pull request.\n\nA good PR will solve the smallest problem it possibly can, have good test\ncoverage and (where necessary) have internationalisation support.\n\n### Running the application locally\n\nAdministrate's demo application can be run like any Rails application:\n\n```sh\nbin/dev\n```\n\nThis will start the application defined in `spec/example_app`.\nYou can view the `example_app` in the browser by navigating to `/admin`.\n\n## Repository Structure\n\n* The gem's source code lives in the `app` and `lib` subdirectories.\n* The demo app is nested within `spec/example_app`.\n* The guides as seen at [https://administrate-demo.herokuapp.com][docs] live\n  as Markdown files in the `docs` subdirectory.\n\nRails configuration files have been changed\nto recognize the app in the new location,\nso running the server or deploying to Heroku works normally.\n\nWith this structure, developing a typical feature looks like:\n\n* Add tests in `spec/`\n* Implement a feature in `administrate/`\n* Exercise the feature using the demo rails app (`spec/example_app/app/`)\n\n[docs]: https://administrate-demo.herokuapp.com\n\n## Front-end Architecture\n\nThis project uses:\n\n* Sass\n* [BEM]-style CSS selectors, with [namespaces]\n* Autoprefixer\n* SCSS-Lint, with [stylelint] ([configuration](stylelint-config))\n* A variety of CSS units:\n  - `em` for typographical-related elements\n  - `rem` for lengths related to components\n  - `px` for borders, text shadows, etc.\n  - `vw`/`vh` for lengths that should be relational to the viewport\n\n[BEM]: http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/\n[namespaces]: http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/\n[stylelint]: https://stylelint.io\n[stylelint-config]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/stylelint-config\n\n## Labels\n\nIssues and PRs are split into two levels of labels, at the higher level:\n\n* `feature`: new functionality that’s not yet implemented,\n* `bug`: breakages in functionality that is implemented,\n* `maintenance`: to keep up with changes around us\n\n…and then to more specific themes:\n\n* `namespacing`: models with a namespace,\n* `installing`: initial setup, first-run experience, generators,\n* `i18n`: translations and language support,\n* `views-and-styles`: how administrate looks and is interacted with,\n* `dashboards`: how administrate presents fields and displays data,\n* `search`: finding things through our models,\n* `sorting`: ordering things on dashboards,\n* `pagination`: how we handle lots of data in small chunks,\n* `security`: controlling data access through authorisation,\n* `fields`: new fields, displaying and editing data,\n* `models`: models, associations and fetching the underlying data,\n* `documentation`: how to use Administrate, examples and common usage,\n* `dependencies`: changes or issues relating to a dependency\n\n## Security\n\nSee the [security policy](./SECURITY.md).\n\n## Releasing\n\nNew releases (and the time period between them) is arbitrary, but usually\nmotivated by a new Rails release or enough bug fixes or features that\nthere's significant enough changes.\n\nA new release involves cutting and pushing a new version to [Ruby Gems][] and\nthen deploying that version of the example application and documentation. This\nmeans that [the demo application][demo] always matches the current release,\nwhilst [the pre-release application][pre-release] will track current `master`.\n\n[Ruby Gems]: https://rubygems.org/gems/administrate\n[demo]: https://administrate-demo.herokuapp.com/\n[pre-release]: https://administrate-demo-prerelease.herokuapp.com/\n"

Many improvements and bugfixes were contributed by the [open\nsource\ncommunity](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/graphs/contributors).\n\n## License\n\nadministrate is Copyright © 2015 thoughtbot.\nIt is free software, and may be redistributed under the terms specified in the\n[LICENSE](/LICENSE.md) file.\n\n<!-- START /templates/footer.md -->\n## About thoughtbot\n\n![thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/thoughtbot-logo-for-readmes.svg)\n\nThis repo is maintained and funded by thoughtbot, inc.\nThe names and logos for thoughtbot are trademarks of thoughtbot, inc.\n\nWe love open source software!\nSee [our other projects][community].\nWe are [available for hire][hire].\n\n[community]: https://thoughtbot.com/community?utm_source=github\n[hire]: https://thoughtbot.com/hire-us?utm_source=github\n\n\n<!-- END /templates/footer.md -->\n"
