This has two advantages:\n\n  1. Clearer difference between args and commands.\n  2. Allows flags and args after the command to be in any order.\n\n- **Breaking:** As a result of the CLI change, `bud new controller` is now `bud new:controller`\n- **Breaking:** The `tool` subcommand has been dropped. For example, `bud tool fs cat` is now `bud fs:cat`.\n- **Deprecated:** `bud create <dir>` is now deprecated. Use `bud new <dir>` when you want to scaffold a new Bud project.\n\n## v0.2.8\n\n- Added beta support for `generator/` and `transpiler/` generators. Docs coming in a later release, but you can look at the tests for example usage if you're feeling adventurous.\n- Added better support for type aliases to dependency injection.\n- Fixed an issue where transition state between changes in the controller would\n  lead to the generated controller getting removed.\n\n## v0.2.7\n\n- Fixed a small regression in `bud create` (#360)\n\n## v0.2.6\n\nThis is a very big release. From the outside, not much has changed, but the internals have been [almost entirely re-written](https://github.com/livebud/bud/pull/347).\n\nThis feels like the right architecture for the next couple of years. You can expect smaller release cycles with more rigorous change logs going forward.\n\nUnfortunately I can't account for all the user-facing changes from this large release. I'm not aware of any breaking changes, but a lot of code shifted.\n\nPlease give the upgrade a go and open an issue if you run into anything!\n\n## v0.2.5\n\n- Implement filesystem caching (#281)\n\n## v0.2.4\n\n- Partial support for auto-incrementing the port if already in use (#250)\n- Fix `staticcheck` problems and integrate into CI (#263)\n- Add support for Go 1.19 (#262)\n- `bud tool ...` now support `-C` chdir support (#255)\n- Auto infer module when `bud create` outside $GOPATH (#242) (thanks @012e!)\n- Add console.error, console.warn, setTimeout, setInterval, clearTimeout and clearInterval to V8 (#233)\n\n## v0.2.3\n\n- Fix regression in v0.2.2 where embedded files aren't available in the runtime package (#226)\n\n- Add simple E2E test in the Makefile to avoid issues regressions like this in the future.\n\n## v0.2.2\n\n- **BREAKING:** fix numerous protocol bugs between controllers and views (#203)\n\n  This was mostly around nested views. A lot of this was undocumented and so we finally started testing behaviors. You may need to adjust what your views export if you were heavily relying on nested controllers / views\n\n- Add scaffolding support for remaining controller actions: create, update, delete, edit & new (#203)\n\n  You can now call `bud new controller posts create update delete edit new show index` and scaffold all 7 controller actions.\n\n- Trigger full reloads on non-update events (#212)\n\n  Now if you rename, delete or add Svelte views, the watcher will pickup on these changes and trigger a reload.\n\n- Add support for method overriding in `<form>` tags (#203)\n\n  This allows you to submit PATCH, PUT and DELETE requests from forms using the `_method` parameter.\n\n  ```html\n  <form method=\"post\" action={`/${post.id || 0}`}>\n    <input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_method\" value=\"patch\">\n    <!-- Add input fields here -->\n    <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Update Post\" />\n  </form>\n  ```\n\n- Test that you can import Svelte files from node_modules (#221) thanks to @jfmario!\n\n  This release tested that you can indeed install and use Svelte components from the community like `svelte-time` and Bud will pick them up.\n\n- Support controllers that are named Index and Show (#214) thanks to @jfmario!\n\n  Prior to this release, you couldn't create a controller in `controller/index/controller.go` because it would conflict with the `Index` action. Now you can.\n\n- Escape props before hydrating (#200)\n\n  This allows you to pass raw HTML that could include a `<script>` tag as props into a Svelte view and have the rendering escaped.\n\n## v0.2.1\n\n- Fix typo in scaffolding .gitignore (#189)\n- Fix minor spelling in transform error output (#190) thanks to @jfmario\n- Add `Hoist` option to dependency injection framework so dependents of external parameters can still be eligible for hoisting (#192)\n\n## v0.2.0\n\n- Improve support for injecting request-specific dependencies (#181)\n\n  In v0.2.0, you can now create controller dependencies that have access to the request and response and are scoped to the request-response lifecycle.\n\n  ```go\n  package controller\n\n  // Flash is a session flash that could be in a separate package\n  type Flash struct {\n    Writer http.ResponseWriter\n  }\n\n  func (f *Flash) Set(msg string) {\n    http.Cookie(f.Writer, &http.Cookie{\n      Name: \"flash\",\n      Value: msg,\n    })\n  }\n\n  // Based on: https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/simple-flash-messages-in-golang\n  func (f *Flash) Get() string {\n    c, err := r.Cookie(name)\n    if err != nil {\n      return \"\"\n    }\n    http.SetCookie(f.Writer, &http.Cookie{\n      Name: name,\n      MaxAge: -1,\n      Expires: time.Unix(1, 0),\n    })\n    return c.Value\n  }\n\n  type Controller struct {\n    Flash *Flash\n  }\n\n  func (c *Controller) Create() (*User, error) {\n    // ... create the user\n    c.Flash.Set(\"Successfully created a user!\")\n    return user, nil\n  }\n\n  func (c *Controller) Show(id int) (*Page, error) {\n    // ... load the user\n    page := &Page{\n      User: user,\n      Flash: c.Flash.Get()\n    }\n    return page, nil\n  }\n\n  // Note: in the future, there will be a way to access the flash from views\n  // without needing to pull it out and add it to your props.\n  // See: https://github.com/livebud/bud/pull/185 for more details.\n  type Page struct {\n    User *User\n    Flash string\n  }\n  ```\n\n  It may seem like if you had a database client within the `Session` it will be re-initialize the database for every request. This is not the case.\n\n  Dependency injection uses a technique called hoisting to avoid re-initiazation of dependencies that don't depend on the scoped parameters (in this case `*http.Request` and `http.ResponseWriter`).\n\n- Add rudimentary redirects on form submissions that have errors\n\n  Prior to this release, form errors would return a JSON response even if you submitted from an HTML page.\n\n  In this release, we now redirect back to the page that submitted the form. You don't yet have access to what failed. This will come in a future release.\n\n- Add `bud tool bs` for starting the local bud server\n\n  This is helpful for hacking on your generated bud files without the generators clobbering your changes. See [this section](https://github.com/livebud/bud/tree/main/contributing#disabling-code-generation) in the contributing guide for more details.\n\n- Use a more .gitignore compliant matcher.\n\n  The previous matcher just used globbing, but .gitignore has a more sophisticated way of ignoring files. For example `bud/` will ignore all inner files. This is something the previous matcher didn't understand.\n\n  This fixes some watch looping due to an unexpected failure to match a `.gitignore` line item.\n\n## v0.1.11\n\n- Fixed regression when using `bud new controller` (#173)\n\n## v0.1.10\n\n- Fix regression when running `bud create` outside of a `$GOPATH` (#167)\n- Fix cache clear before code generation to ensure there's no stale generated code. Prior to v0.1.10, we were clearing part of the cache not all of it (#168)\n- Allow explicit versions to be installed with `curl` by setting the `VERSION` environment variable (#168)\n\n## v0.1.9\n\n- Better hot reload DX with `bud run` (#131) thanks to @012e\n\n  Prior to v0.1.9, whenever a file change occurs it would rebuild and print a ready message if successful or an error message if unsuccessful. The ready messages would often clutter the terminal over time.\n\n  <a href=\"https://share.cleanshot.com/XCdkEnOr8BlCNgV035pu\"><video src='https://share.cleanshot.com/XCdkEnOr8BlCNgV035pu/download' width='100%'/></a>\n\n- Large internal refactor (#133). The goals of this refactor:\n\n  1. Make it easier to understand. The double generated binary building was something that often confused me.\n  2. Make it easier to contribute. I'm so impressed with the contributions so far, with this refactor it should be even easier.\n  3. Make it faster during development. The slowest step in the build process is running `go build`. We now only run `go build` once on boot, not twice.\n\n  Learn more details [in this comment](https://github.com/livebud/bud/pull/133#issuecomment-1166371510). This PR concludes the work necessary to release [v0.2](https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/18).\n\n- Support glob embeds (#150) thanks to @vito\n\n  Build caching now understands embedded globs like `// go:embed *.sql`. You'll no longer get stale builds when changing a file within an embedded glob.\n\n- Improved Dockerfile in contributing (#140) thanks to @wheinze\n\n  The Dockerfile now supports passing Node and Go versions to build a custom container. It also uses a smaller base image.\n\n## v0.1.8\n\n- Support `func(w, r)` controller actions (#147) (thanks @vito!)\n\n  This release adds a highly-requested feature (atleast by me!) where you can now drop down to using the vanilla `http.HandlerFunc` signature.\n\n  This is a useful escape hatch for webhooks, streaming and other complex use cases.\n\n  ```go\n  package webhooks\n\n  type Controller struct {\n    GH *github.Client\n  }\n\n  func (c *Controller) Index() string {\n    return \"GitHub webhook service!\"\n  }\n\n  // Create handles incoming webhooks\n  func (c *Controller) Create(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {\n    // Respond to the webhook using a vanilla HTTP handler function!\n  }\n  ```\n\n- Replace redirect with case-insensitive routing (#142) (thanks @vito!)\n\n  Prior to v0.1.8, if you defined the route `/bud`, but a user visited `/BUD`,\n  they would be redirected to `/bud`. This was originally done for SEO purposes to prevent different casing from appearing as separate pages.\n\n  However, this had an unfortunate side-effect in that you couldn't use parameters with mixed casing (e.g. base64 encoding).\n\n  In v0.1.8, we changed this so that URL routing is now case insensitive, so `/BUD` will run the `/bud` action. This doesn't address the SEO issue, but that will be a [follow-up task](https://github.com/livebud/bud/pull/142#issuecomment-1159824008) for a later time.\n\n## v0.1.7\n\n- Ensure alignment between CLI and runtime round 2 (#128)\n\n  In #126, we missed the case where the module wasn't downloaded yet. This version fixes that.\n\n## v0.1.6\n\n- Ensure alignment between CLI and runtime (#126)\n\n  In v0.1.5, we had a breaking change in the runtime. If you had an existing project and upgraded the CLI to v0.1.5, but you were still using the v0.1.4 runtime in go.mod, you'd encounter an error. This change automatically updates your go.mod to align with the CLI that's building it. Fixes: #125.\n\n## v0.1.5\n\nThis release focuses on paying down some technical debt that was accumulated prior to the release. It's part of the [v0.2](https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/18) plan.\n\n- Rename `bud run [--port=<address>]` to `bud run [--listen=<address>]`\n\n  This **breaking change** addresses the confusion discussed in https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/42.\n\n- Rename `bud tool v8 client` to `bud tool v8 serve`\n\n  This **breaking change** gives a better name for what the command does, listen for eval requests, evaluate the javascript and return the response.\n\n- 204 No Content improvements (thanks @theEyeD!)\n\n  Now when controller don't have a return value or return a nil error, they return `204 No Content`. For example:\n\n  ```go\n  package users\n  type Controller struct {}\n  func (c *Controller) Create() error {\n    return nil\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ```sh\n  $ curl -X POST /users\n  HTTP/1.1 204 No Content\n  Content-Length: 0\n  ```\n\n- Dedupe and group watch events (#123)\n\n  This reduces the number of events the watcher triggers on Linux causing less builds to trigger at once. It also hopefully fixed an issue where \"remove\" events sometimes weren't triggering rebuilds on all platforms.\n\n- Improve CI (thanks @wheinze!) (#118)\n\n  Waldemar took a much needed pass over the CI. He cleaned up the file, fixed caching and extended the test matrix, so we can more confidently say what's required to use Bud.\n\n- Refactor, test and simplify the compiler (#93)\n\n  The compiler wasn't really tested prior to v0.1.4. Issue that would crop up would be discovered due to E2E tests. In v0.1.5, the compiler was refactored to be testable, then tested. It was also simplified to reduce the number of ways you could use it programmatically. This makes it less likely a test will pass but the end-to-end usage will fail.\n\n- Extend the error chain (#100)\n\n  Errors were being lost while merging the filesystems for plugins. Now errors that occur in generators will be extended through the merged filesystem, so it's easier to see when there are issues in the generators\n\n## v0.1.4\n\n- Add support for custom actions (thanks @theEyeD!)\n\n  This release adds support for defining custom actions on controllers that get mapped to GET requests. This feature closes: https://github.com/livebud/bud/pull/67.\n\n  For example, given the following users controller in `controller/users/users.go`:\n\n  ```go\n  package users\n  type Controller struct {}\n  func (c *Controller) Deactivate() error { return nil }\n  ```\n\n  The `Deactivate` method would get mapped to `GET /users/deactivate`. Learn more in [the documentation](https://www.notion.so/Hey-Bud-4d81622cc49942f9917c5033e5205c69#cc536e505a7349e08c68a65aef266726).\n\n- Speed up tests by using existing `GOMODCACHE`\n\n  Some of the test suite used an empty `GOMODCACHE` to test plugin support. This turned added about a 1-minute overhead to those tests while dependencies were downloaded and the cache was populated.\n\n  We now rely on real module fixtures: https://github.com/livebud/bud-test-plugin and https://github.com/livebud/bud-test-plugin.\n\n- Add a version number to released assets\n\n  This will make it easier to add Bud to other package managers like the Arch User Repository (AUR) for Arch Linux users. This feature fixes: https://github.com/livebud/bud/issues/52.\n\n- Added a background section to the Readme (thanks @thepudds!)\n\n  @thepudds re-wrote the Reddit post, simplifying and condensing it for the Readme. I always like when projects include a \"why\", so I really appreciate @thepudds adding this for Bud!\n\n## v0.1.3\n\n- Move build caching from $TMPDIR/bud/cache to $YOUR_APP/bud/cache\n\n  This should fix https://github.com/livebud/bud/issues/27 issue on M1 Macs.\n\n- Fallback to copying if renaming a directory fails\n\n  This change fixes a `invalid cross-device link` error WSL users were encountering.\n\n## v0.1.2\n\n- Fix live reload for Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) users (thanks @theEyeD!)\n\n## v0.1.1\n\n- Improve the installation script (thanks @barelyhuman!)\n\n  For cases where `/usr/local/bin` is not writable, the install script will now prompt you to escalate your privileges.\n\n- Run Go's formatter on generated template files (thanks @codenoid!)\n\n  Now the Go files generated into `bud/` will be formatted with the same formatter as `go fmt`.\n\n- Fix `bud create` when working outside of `$GOPATH` (thanks @barelyhuman!)\n\n  If you tried created a Bud project outside of `$GOPATH`, Bud would be unable to infer the Go module path and will prompt you to provide a module path. This prompt was being clobbered by NPM's progress bar. Now the prompt happens before running `npm install`.\n\n- Add a [Contributor's Guide](./Contributing.md)\n\n  Wrote an initial guide on how to contribute to Bud. Please have a look and let me know if you'd like to see anything else in that guide.\n\n- Switch the default from 0.0.0.0 to 127.0.0.1 (#35)\n\n  On the latest OSX you'll get a security prompt when you try binding to 0.0.0.0. On WSL, bud will just stall. This release switches the default to localhost (aka 127.0.0.1). Many thanks to @alecthomas, @theEyeD and @kevwan for helping me understand this issue better.\n\n## v0.1.0\n\nThis release wraps up the [v0.1](https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/17) milestone 🎉\n\n- Add initial darwin/arm64 (aka Apple M1) Support (please test!)\n- Update the welcome page to include all the links.\n\nI'm completely overwhelmed by all the love. As I write this, we're still on the front page of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31371340) (13 hours in!):\n\n![HN](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/170299/168419120-83faf09c-f5c8-406c-a98c-4c694fab5c2e.png)\n\nAnd we're at the top of the [Go subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang).\n\n![Reddit](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/170299/168419117-a2b1a033-0f87-498d-8a8b-71d608c6dd57.png)\n\n## v0.0.9\n\n- Add support for `bud create .`\n- Fix `bud create` for the development binary when outside the source tree.\n- Reverse `bud new controller` from route:resource (e.g. `/:stories`) to resource:route (e.g. `stories:/`) to avoid confusion with URL params.\n- Correct the \"Ready\" message\n\n## v0.0.8\n\n- Give the welcome page a fresh coat of paint.\n- Support `bud version [key]` to make it easier to script getting the version of bud.\n\n## v0.0.7\n\n- Download go modules after scaffolding\n\n  Hopefully fully fixing `bud create <dir>` this time. Bud now downloads the runtime modules upon create.\n\n- Add some getting started instructions\n\n  I've written up a bit of documentation on how to get started. There's a lot more to come here!\n\n## v0.0.6\n\n- Fixed `bud create`\n\n  Now that bud is public and has versions, I did another pass over `bud create <dir>` to get it working as expected\n\n- Add live reload to the welcome page\n\n  In an effort to vanguish all page refreshes, needing to refresh the welcome page stuck out like a thorn. This release clips that thorn.\n\n## v0.0.5\n\n- Next attempt at fixing `bud run` after installing from Github\n\n  It turns out .go files are also required by the runtime. I've unignored them, but will think of better ways to handle this in the future.\n\n## v0.0.4\n\n- Fix `bud run` after installing from Github\n\n  When you build the binaries with --trimpath, it removes the import paths stored within the binary. This is preferable because you don't want to see my filepaths within the binary, but it also means that the downloaded binary was no longer able to find where the standard library packages were located. I fixed this by calling `go env` on boot. This adds about 7ms overhead on boot, so I'd like to find a way to do this without spawning, but we'll leave that as an exercise for the reader :)\n\n  Another problem we encountered was that the runtime was missing some of the necessary embedded assets. I've removed them from .gitignore to fix the problem. Longer-term I think it makes sense to use bindata for this case to turn them into Go files that can be ignored in development but are built into the binary for production.\n\n- Add back missing node_modules\n\n  I overpruned the dependencies and that was causing failures in CI. I added them back in.\n\n## v0.0.3\n\n- Bud is finally open source on Github!\n\n  I'm thrilled to finally share my side project with everyone! I first started working on this while in lockdown in Berlin on April 20th, 2020. A co-worker suggested I have a look at the Laracast videos about Laravel. I was just blown away by how productive you can be in Laravel.\n\n  As a former solo developer, I place a lot of weight on having all the tools you need to build, launch and iterate on ideas as quickly as possible. Laravel provides a comprehensive and cohesive toolset for getting your ideas out there quickly.\n\n  With Go being my preferred language of choice these days and a natural fit for building web backends, I started prototyping what a Laravel-like MVC framework would look like in Go.\n\n  At this point, I just had the following goal for Bud:\n\n  - Be just as productive as Laravel in a typed language like Go.\n\n  I got the first version working about 6 months in and I tried building a blog from it. It fell flat. You needed to scaffold all these files just to get started. If you're coming from Rails or Laravel you may shrug, this is pretty normal. Unfortunately, I've been spoiled by the renaissance in frontend frameworks with Next.js. What I love Next is that it starts out barebones and every file you add incrementally enhances your web application. This keeps the complexity under control.\n\n  With these newly discovered constraints, I started working on the next iteration of Bud.\n\n  - Generate files only as you need them. Keep these generated files away from your application code.\n  - Should feel like using a modern Javascript framework. This means it should work with modern frontend frameworks like Svelte and React, support live reload and have server-side rendering.\n\n  With these new goals, the Bud you see today started to take shape. But along the way, I discovered a few more project goals:\n\n  - The framework should be extensible from Day 1. Bud is too ambitious for one person. We're going to need an ambitious community behind this framework.\n  - Bud should have great performance for the developer using Bud and for the person using websites built with Bud. We have an exciting journey ahead for both of these goals.\n  - Bud should compile to a single binary. These days with platforms services like Heroku and Vercel, it's easy to not care about this, but I still cherish the idea that I can build a single binary that contains my entire web app and scp it up to tiny server.\n\n  And this is the Bud you see before you. I have big plans for the framework and I sincerely hope you'll join me on this journey.\n\n## v0.0.2\n\n- Improve test caching\n\n  The tests are slower than they should be. What was curious was that they didn't seem to be doing much during a lot of the test run.\n\n  I dug into why and it turns out the test caching itself can be extremely slow. See this issue for more details: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26562. It's slated to be fixed in Go 1.19, so I'm going to hold off on a fix for that.\n\n  Additionally, the tests weren't ever being cached. If you'd like to read about the whole debugging saga that took a day to figure out, head over to this issue: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/26562. I've remedied this issue, but it's something to keep an eye on.\n\n- Prep the build script\n\n  I'm in the process of setting up `curl -sf https://github.com/livebud/bud/install.sh | sh`. In doing that, I'm ironing out the publishing pipeline and install script.\n\n## v0.0.1\n\n- Initial publish release\n"

Bud writes the boring code for you, helping you launch your website faster.\n\n## Video Demo\n\nWatch a video demonstrating how to build a minimal HN clone in 15 minutes with Bud.\n\n[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/170299/168361927-9165c2f9-55d4-4fa0-a53e-966028a79b39.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoypcRqn-xA)\n\n## Documentation\n\nRead [the documentation](https://denim-cub-301.notion.site/Hey-Bud-4d81622cc49942f9917c5033e5205c69) to learn how to get started with Bud.\n\n# Installing Bud\n\nBud ships as a single binary that runs on Linux and Mac. You can follow along for Windows support in [this issue](https://github.com/livebud/bud/issues/7).\n\nThe easiest way to get started is by copying and pasting the command below in your terminal:\n\n```diff\ncurl -sf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/livebud/bud/main/install.sh | sh\n```\n\nThis script will download the right binary for your operating system and move the binary to the right location in your `$PATH`.\n\nConfirm that you've installed Bud by typing `bud` in your terminal.\n\n```bash\nbud -h\n```\n\nYou should see the following:\n\n```bash\nUsage:\n    bud [flags] [command]\n\nFlags:\n  -C, --chdir  Change the working directory\n\nCommands:\n  build    build the production server\n  create   create a new project\n  run      run the development server\n  tool     extra tools\n  version  Show package versions\n```\n\n# Requirements\n\nThe following software is required to use Bud.\n\n- Node v14+\n\n  This is a temporary requirement that we plan to remove in [v0.3](https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/21)\n\n- Go v1.17+\n\n  Bud relies heavily on `io/fs` and will take advantage of generics in the future, so while Go v1.16 will work, we suggest running Go v1.18+ if you can.\n\n# Your First Project\n\nWith bud installed, you can now scaffold a new project:\n\n```bash\n$ bud create hello\n$ cd hello\n```\n\nThe create command will scaffold everything you need to get started with bud.\n\n```bash\n$ ls\ngo.mod  node_modules/  package-lock.json  package.json\n```\n\n... which is not very much by the way! Unlike most other fullstack frameworks, Bud starts out very minimal. As you add dependencies, Bud will generate all the boring code to glue your app together. Let's see this in action.\n\nStart the development server with `bud run`:\n\n```bash\n$ bud run\n| Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000\n```\n\nClick on the link to open the browser. You'll be greeted with bud's welcome page.\n\nCongrats! You're running your first web server with Bud. The welcome server is your jumping off point to learn more about the framework.\n\n![CleanShot 2022-05-12 at 22.00.19@2x.png](https://denim-cub-301.notion.site/image/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fsecure.notion-static.com%2Fdb7f750b-a699-4117-ac07-303124e5d2f4%2FCleanShot_2022-05-12_at_22.00.192x.png?table=block&id=9488d91f-b72d-4c6d-9ce0-358c31f7f964&spaceId=faf0f409-6e25-40a4-871e-3b311037350f&width=2000&userId=&cache=v2)\n\n## Next Steps\n\nCheck out the Hacker News [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoypcRqn-xA), read the [documentation](https://denim-cub-301.notion.site/Hey-Bud-4d81622cc49942f9917c5033e5205c69#156ea69b8d044bacb65fc2897f3e52b8), [schedule a quick call](https://cal.com/mattmueller/30min) or go on your own adventure. The only limit is your imagination.\n\nRecent discussions: [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/uoxocj/bud_the_fullstack_web_framework_for_go_developers/), [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31371340), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/golivebud)\n\n# Real-World Projects\n\n- [Bass Loop](https://github.com/vito/bass-loop): a CI/CD stack for https://bass-lang.org/.\n- [Welcome Page](https://github.com/livebud/welcome): Bud's welcome page is written in Bud.\n\n# History of Bud\n\nI started working on Bud in April 2019 after seeing how productive developers could be in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). I wanted the same for Go, so I decided to try creating Laravel for the Go ecosystem. However, my first version after 6 months needed to scaffold many files just to get started. If you are coming from [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails) or Laravel, you may shrug and consider this as pretty normal.\n\nUnfortunately, I have been spoiled by the renaissance in frontend frameworks like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) that start barebones but every file you add incrementally enhances your web application. This keeps the initial complexity under control.\n\nWith this additional inspiration, I worked on the next iteration for the ensuing 18 months.\n\nThe goals are now:\n\n- Generate files only as you need them. Keep these generated files away from your application code and give developers the choice to keep them out of source control. You shouldn't need to care about the generated code. You may be surprised to learn that Go also generates code to turn your Go code into an executable, but it works so well you don't need to think about it. Bud should feel like this.\n\n- Feel like using a modern JS framework. This means it should work with [multiple](https://github.com/livebud/bud/discussions/8) modern frontend frameworks like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/), support [live reload](https://denim-cub-301.notion.site/Hey-Bud-4d81622cc49942f9917c5033e5205c69#4c7dff15ef3e458587b81fb9b1819afb), and have [server-side rendering](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/uoxocj/bud_the_fullstack_web_framework_for_go_developers/i8ke92h/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) for better performance and SEO.\n\n- The framework should be extensible from Day 1. Bud is too ambitious for one person. We're going to need an ambitious community behind this framework. Extensibility should be primarily driven by adding code, rather than by adding configuration.\n\n- Bud should provide high-level, type-safe APIs for developers while generating performant, low-level Go code under the covers.\n\n- Bud should compile to a single binary that contains your entire web app and can be copied to a server that doesn't even have Go installed.\n\n# Contributing\n\nPlease refer to the [Contributing Guide](./contributing/Readme.md) to learn how to develop Bud locally.\n"
