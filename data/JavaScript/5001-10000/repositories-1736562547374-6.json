          "content": "# Nuclei Contribution Guide\nTemplates are the core of the [nuclei scanner](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei) which powers the actual scanning engine. The Nuclei Templates repository stores and houses various templates for a variety of protocols, including TCP, DNS, HTTP, SSL, File, Whois, Websocket, Headless etc. for the scanner provided by our team, as well as contributed by the community.\n\nWe have over **9000+** templates contributed by **more than 800** security researchers and engineers. We hope that you contribute by sending templates via **pull requests** or [Github issues](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=submit-template.md&title=%5Bnuclei-template%5D+) to grow the list. By contributing, you won't only help the community **❤️** but can also gain experience, increase community and peer recognition, improving your job prospects\n\nThis documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process. We are happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to **improve/add** new **templates** to this project. Thank you for helping out and remember, **no contribution is too small.**\n\n## **How Can I Contribute?**\n\n- [Submitting Nuclei Templates](#Submitting-Nuclei-Templates)\n- [Reporting False Negative Template](#Reporting-False-Positive-Template)\n- [Reporting False Positive Template](#Reporting-False-Positive-Template)\n- [Enhancing existing templates](#Enhancing-existing-templates)\n- [Reporting Invalid templates](#Reporting-Invalid-templates)\n- [Request Template](#Request-Template)\n- [Sharing idea / feature for nuclei-templates](#Sharing-idea-/-feature-for-nuclei-templates)\n\n### **Submitting Nuclei Templates**\n\n**Before Submitting an Issue or Pull Request**\n\n- Take a look at the [Existing Templates](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates) or search for endpoints before creating new one.\n- Take a look at Existing Templates in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues) and [Pull Request](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/pulls) section to avoid duplicate work.\n- Take a look at [Templates](https://nuclei.projectdiscovery.io/templating-guide/) and [Matchers](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/wiki/Unique-Template-Matchers) Guideline for creating new template.\n\nAlong with the P.O.C following are the required fields in the info section for submitting new template.\n\n1. `id`: It should be short ideally max of 3-4 words. For example `grafana-unauth-rce`\n2. `name` : The name should be short in this format `<Vendor> <Product> <Version> - <Vulnerability>` \n3. `author`: It can be your github/twitter username or alias. You can also create a PR to add more details associated with the author name here (https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/blob/main/contributors.json)\n4. `severity` : Based on the CVSS score but can vary based on the exploit and real-world impact\n5. `description` : Short description of the vulnerability\n6. `reference` : Please provide the reference to the POC, setup guide or the product details to help the team verify the template.\n\n**Do’s**\n\n- If you have verified the template, mark it as `verified: true` under metadata field and share the debug data using `-debug` flag after redacting the vulnerable server information in the PR\n- Make sure to add more than one matcher to prevent false positive results. Avoid short word that could be encountered anywhere\n- If possible submit the vulnerable environment based on docker-compose. For example: https://github.com/vulhub/vulhub.\n- We only accept templates with complete P.O.Cs instead of just detection based on version\n\n**Don’t**\n\n- Don’t not share any real world target on the PR. If you have setup an vulnerable environment please share it privately on Discord with the team to easily validate the template.\n- Avoid submitting templates with weak matchers. For example: Adding GET/POST data as the matchers in the template, as it can result in false positive results on few hosts\n- Don’t make unnecessary changes to the existing templates like adding more requests to the templates when the existing requests or paths are good enough to verify that the bug exists\n- Try to keep the requests per template as low as possible\n\n**Best Practices**\n\n- Make sure to add the template in the appropriate directory.\n- Add part with the matchers. For example if the matcher is in response body add `part:` body\n- Use `cmd` variable for RCE templates so that they are unified throughout the repo\n- Use `{{username}}` and `{{password}}` variables in all authenticated templates\n- Use `{{token}}` variable in all the template that deals with keys or tokens\n- If there are more than 1 template for a tech create a separate folder for it\n- Don't share any vulnerable URL publicly on Github or Discord channel.\n- We should only upload a web shell as a last resort to validate the vulnerability, and if we do upload a file, make sure the file name is random(`{{randstr}}`)\n- Do not include code templates for exploits that can be written using HTTP or JavaScript. We avoid adding additional exploit code to the project unless there is an exception.\n\n### **Submitting a PR**\n\n**Fork the Project**\n\n- This will create a Local Copy of this Repository on your Github Profile. Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote.\n<img width=\"928\" alt=\"template-fork\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8293321/124467966-2afde200-ddb6-11eb-835f-8f8fc2fabedb.png\">\n\n```jsx\ngit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/nuclei-templates\ncd nuclei-templates\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates\n```\n\n- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.\n\n```jsx\ngit remote update\ngit checkout main\ngit rebase upstream/main\n```\n\n**Create your Template Branch**\n\n- Create a new branch. Use its name to identify the issue your addressing.\n\n```jsx\n# It will create a new branch with name template_branch_name and switch to that branch\ngit checkout -b template_branch_name\n```\n\n**Create Template and Commit**\n\n- Create your template.\n- Add all the files/folders needed.\n- After you've made changes or completed template creation, add changes to the branch you've just created by:\n\n```jsx\n# To add all new files to branch template_branch_name\ngit add .\n```\n\n- To commit, give a descriptive message for the convenience of the reviewer by:\n\n```jsx\n# This message get associated with all files you have changed\ngit commit -m \"Added/Fixed/Updated XXX Template\"\n```\n\n**NOTE**:\n\n- Try to add only one templates per Pull Request as it will make it simple for us to review and the PR will not be blocked because of one of the templates\n- Multiple templates for same technology can be grouped into single Pull Request.\n\n**Push Your Changes**\n\n- Now you are ready to push your template to the remote (forked) repository.\n- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:\n\n```jsx\n# To push your work to your remote repository\ngit push -u origin template_branch_name\n```\n\n**Pull Request**\n\n- Fire up your favorite browser, navigate to your GitHub repository, then click on the New pull request button within the Pull requests tab.

          "content": "# Nuclei Templates Community Rewards Program - FAQ\n\n## What is the purpose of this rewards program?\nThe program is designed to reward the community for their efforts in contributing high-quality templates for critical and trending vulnerabilities.\n\n## What are the bounty ranges for template submissions?\nBounties range from **$50 to $250**, depending on the complexity of the template and the effort required.\n\n## Where can I find bounty issues?\nOnly issues listed by us on our GitHub repository with the 💎 **Bounty** label are eligible for rewards. You can find these bounty issues [here](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/nuclei-templates/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3A%22%F0%9F%92%8E%20Bounty%22)\n\n## What is the acceptance criteria for templates?\nTemplates must meet the following criteria:\n1. **Complete POC**: A full Proof of Concept (POC) must be provided and not rely solely on version detection.\n2. **Debug Data**: Include debug data to assist with template validation.\n3. **Validation Required**: The template will be reviewed and validated before rewards are given.\n4. **Accurate Matchers**: Use strong matchers to avoid false positives.\n> **Note**: Triagers will make the final decision on whether a template qualifies for a reward based on validation and the acceptance criteria outlined.\n\n## How do I start working on a bounty issue?\n1. **Find an Issue**: Look for issues tagged with 💎 **Bounty**.\n2. **Declare Work**: Comment with `/attempt #<issue_number>` to claim the issue.\n3. **Submit Work**: Submit your pull request with `/claim #<issue_number>` in the PR description when ready.\n\n## How often are new bounty issues added?\nWe add new bounty issues on a **weekly basis**, so make sure to check back regularly for fresh opportunities. In the future, you can expect many more bounty issues as the program expands, allowing more opportunities for contributors to participate and earn rewards.\n\n## Can I collaborate with others?\nYes, you can collaborate with other contributors and split rewards by commenting:\n```\n/claim #<issue_number>\n/split @contributor1\n/split @contributor2\n```\n\n## Is there a limit to how many issues I can work on?\nYou can work on up to **3 issues** simultaneously.\n\n## What happens if I don’t complete an issue on time?\nIssues must be completed within **2 months**, or they will be closed.\n\n## How are rewards distributed?\nRewards are distributed once the template is fully validated. If the issue remains unresolved for **few weeks**, the bounty may increase.\n\n## What should I include in my template submission?\nInclude the following:\n> Avoid adding code templates for CVEs that can be achieved using HTTP, TCP, or JavaScript. Such templates are blocked by default and won’t produce results, so we prioritize creating templates with other protocols unless exceptions are made.\n- **Complete POC**: A working Proof of Concept.\n- **Matchers**: Multiple matchers to prevent false positives.\n- **Debug Data**: Data to assist the triage team in validation.\n- **Metadata**: Include required fields like `id`, `name`, `author`, `severity`, `description`, and `reference`.\n\n## What types of templates will be rejected?\nTemplates may be rejected if they:\n- Rely solely on version detection.\n- Lack a complete POC.\n- Contain weak matchers or redundant changes to existing templates.\n\n## What should I avoid when submitting a template?\n- Avoid sharing real-world targets publicly.\n- Don’t submit templates with weak matchers.\n- Avoid unnecessary changes to existing templates.\n\n## Is there a leaderboard for contributors?\nYes! We now have a **leaderboard** that showcases top contributors. You can check it out here: [Leaderboard](https://cloud.projectdiscovery.io/templates/leaderboard).\n\n## Is this program permanent?\nThe rewards program is currently a test run, but we may make changes based on community feedback.\n\n## What additional rewards are available besides bounties?\nBeyond bounties, we also reward contributors with:\n- **Swag** such as t-shirts and stickers.\n- **Invites to security conferences** for standout contributors.\n- **Stickers** as a token of appreciation for all first-time contributors, regardless of the bounty.\n\n> Contributors who feel their pull request or issue was overlooked for first-time contributor stickers can ping us on our Discord for assistance: [ProjectDiscovery Discord](https://discord.com/invite/projectdiscovery).\n"

Zyxel NAS devices achieve authentication by using the weblogin.cgi CGI executable. This program fails to properly sanitize the username parameter that is passed to it. If the username parameter contains certain characters, it can allow command injection with the privileges of the web server that runs on the Zyxel device. Although the web server does not run as the root user, Zyyxel devices include a setuid utility that can be leveraged to run any command with root privileges. As such, it should be assumed that exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution with root privileges. By sending a specially-crafted HTTP POST or GET request to a vulnerable Zyyxel device, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on the device. This may happen by directly connecting to a device if it is directly exposed to an attacker.   However, there are ways to trigger such crafted requests even if an attacker does not have direct connectivity to a vulnerable devices.
