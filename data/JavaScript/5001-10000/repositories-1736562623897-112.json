Modify the value of `userResourcesLocation` from `unset` to the full url of the solution you wish to use (if a url is already in use, add a space after the existing url). e.g. `userResourcesLocation https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pixeltris/TwitchAdSolutions/master/video-swap-new/video-swap-new-ublock-origin.js` \n- To ensure uBlock Origin loads the script I recommend that you disable/enable the uBlock Origin extension (or restart your browser).\n\nTo stop using a script remove the filter and make the url `unset`.\n\n*For the sake of security it's recommended to use a permalink when using uBlock Origin (permalinks do not auto update).*\n\n*The scripts __may randomly stop being applied by uBlock Origin__ for unknown reasons ([#200](https://github.com/pixeltris/TwitchAdSolutions/issues/200)). It's recommended to use the userscript versions instead.*\n\n## Applying a script (userscript)\n\n- Viewing one of the userscript files should prompt the given script to be added (assuming you have a userscript manager).\n"

This currently only uses the TTV LOL API for proxying. However, TTV LOL itself no longer works, so entering a custom proxy URL in settings is required for ad-blocking capabilities. For example: `https://eu.luminous.dev/live/$channel?allow_source=true&allow_audio_only=true&fast_bread=true`\n- `ReVanced` - [code](https://github.com/revanced)\n  - A collection of tools that allows you to patch Twitch and other Android apps such as YouTube to remove ads. ReVanced's Twitch patches use the TTV LOL and PurpleAdBlocker proxies (can be toggled between in settings). The setup is complicated, so anyone who doesn't want the hassle should just use Xtra instead.\n- https://twitchls.com/\n  - Uses the `embed` player. Purple screen may display every 10-15 mins.\n- https://reddit.com/r/Twitch/comments/kisdsy/i_did_a_little_test_regarding_ads_on_twitch_and/\n  - Some countries don't get ads. A simple VPN/VPS could be used to block ads by proxying the m3u8 without having to proxy all your traffic (just the initial m3u8).\n\n## Proxy issues\n\nProxy solutions can have downtime and you'll either see ads or error 2000. This isn't Twitch retaliating.\n\nBuffering may occur at higher resolutions. This happens because traffic comes from a Twitch server closest to the initial m3u8 proxy request. The only solution to this is asking the proxy maintainer to add a proxy in a country closer to you. If they wont then you'll need to use a lower resolution, or use a different ad blocking solution. A VPN might also be better solution for you.\n\n## Extensions to avoid\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> These extensions most likely have bad intentions. Use at your own risk.
