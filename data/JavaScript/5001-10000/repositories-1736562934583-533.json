You will still see the new URL in your browser. You just need to copy and paste that link. It should contain things like `code=M.C....` in that link.\n\n## I got `KeyError: 'access_token'` after I copied the link\n\nWhile testing Voyager, we use Redirect URI Type: `Public client/native (mobile & desktop)` in the app registration for Azure Login. However, according to the report in issue [#34](https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager/issues/34#issuecomment-1567007133), the URI Type was changed to \"Web\" and it resolved the problem. Feel free to attempt both URI Types to determine which one works for you. If all the approaches fail, please refer to the original tutorial in [minecraft-launcher-lib](https://minecraft-launcher-lib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/microsoft_login.html).\n\nUpdate: This is probably a Microsoft's bug. See [issue #80 in minecraft-launcher-lib](https://codeberg.org/JakobDev/minecraft-launcher-lib/issues/80). If you cannot solve this problem, you can try to use the [Minecraft Official Launcher](./installation/minecraft_instance_install.md#option-2-minecraft-official-launcher) and use mc_port to run.\n## I got `Subprocess Mineflayer failed to start` error.\n\nThere are many reasons that may cause this problem. You can try with following solutions:\n1. Make sure you install nodejs and the dependency packages correctly. You can use the following command to check your installation:\n    ```bash\n    cd voyager/env/mineflayer\n    node index.js\n    ```\n   If you see `Server started on port {PORT}`, then your installation is correct. You can kill the process by `Ctrl+C`.\n2. Make sure you install Fabric correctly. You should be able to select the Fabric version in the Minecraft launcher. \n3. Each Mineflayer process can only listen to one port. If you want to start multiple instances of `Voyager`, you need to manually change the port when initialization:\n    ```python\n    from voyager import Voyager\n    voyager = Voyager(\n        server_port=3001, # default is 3000\n        ...\n    )\n    ```\n   \n## I saw the bot left and rejoin the game after each task.\n\nAfter completing each task, we'll reset the environment, which means the bot will exit and rejoin the game. This reset is necessary to synchronize Mineflayer with the Minecraft game. We do this because certain commands we utilize might result in lag on the Mineflayer side, causing the inventory stored in Mineflayer to differ from the actual inventory in the game. However, if you wish to avoid the reset, you can use `voyager.learn(reset_env=False)` and consider increasing the `env_wait_ticks` value. This will provide Mineflayer with additional time to sync with the Minecraft game.\n\n\n## How to show the bot's first-person view?\n\nDue to the Mineflayer's limitation, we currently can not directly get the bot's view in the game. Although there's a plugin called [prismarine-viewer](https://github.com/PrismarineJS/prismarine-viewer), the video quality is not good enough, so we opt not to use it. Our demo video is generated by [replay-mod](https://www.replaymod.com/). We start the recording and let the bot play for hours, then come back to the recording and render the view from the bot.\n\n\n## Can I use GPT-3.5 instead of GPT-4?\n\nIt's highly recommended to use GPT-4. GPT-3.5 falls behind in terms of code quality and reasoning ability compared to GPT-4. Moreover, GPT-3.5 has a limited context length, which means it may provide incomplete responses. If you insist on using GPT-3.5, it is essential to configure it with `skill_manager_retrieval_top_k` ≤ 2 to reduce the context length of the prompt.\n\n## What's the estimated cost of running Voyager?\n\nUsing Voyager for approximately 160 iterations using GPT-4 will cost you around 50 USD. It's important to keep a close eye on your OpenAI API expenses and avoid unnecessary spending. Once Voyager begins running, it's recommended to monitor the bot's behavior for a period and ensure that it successfully completes some tasks."

Voyager consists of three\nkey components: 1) an automatic curriculum that maximizes exploration, 2) an\never-growing skill library of executable code for storing and retrieving complex\nbehaviors, and 3) a new iterative prompting mechanism that incorporates environment\nfeedback, execution errors, and self-verification for program improvement.\nVoyager interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, which bypasses the need for\nmodel parameter fine-tuning. The skills developed by Voyager are temporally\nextended, interpretable, and compositional, which compounds the agent’s abilities\nrapidly and alleviates catastrophic forgetting. Empirically, Voyager shows\nstrong in-context lifelong learning capability and exhibits exceptional proficiency\nin playing Minecraft. It obtains 3.3× more unique items, travels 2.3× longer\ndistances, and unlocks key tech tree milestones up to 15.3× faster than prior SOTA.\nVoyager is able to utilize the learned skill library in a new Minecraft world to\nsolve novel tasks from scratch, while other techniques struggle to generalize.\n\nIn this repo, we provide Voyager code. This codebase is under [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n# Installation\nVoyager requires Python ≥ 3.9 and Node.js ≥ 16.13.0. We have tested on Ubuntu 20.04, Windows 11, and macOS. You need to follow the instructions below to install Voyager.\n\n## Python Install\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager\ncd Voyager\npip install -e .\n```\n\n## Node.js Install\nIn addition to the Python dependencies, you need to install the following Node.js packages:\n```\ncd voyager/env/mineflayer\nnpm install -g npx\nnpm install\ncd mineflayer-collectblock\nnpx tsc\ncd ..\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Minecraft Instance Install\n\nVoyager depends on Minecraft game. You need to install Minecraft game and set up a Minecraft instance.\n\nFollow the instructions in [Minecraft Login Tutorial](installation/minecraft_instance_install.md) to set up your Minecraft Instance.\n\n## Fabric Mods Install\n\nYou need to install fabric mods to support all the features in Voyager. Remember to use the correct Fabric version of all the mods. \n\nFollow the instructions in [Fabric Mods Install](installation/fabric_mods_install.md) to install the mods.\n\n# Getting Started\nVoyager uses OpenAI's GPT-4 as the language model. You need to have an OpenAI API key to use Voyager. You can get one from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n\nAfter the installation process, you can run Voyager by:\n```python\nfrom voyager import Voyager\n\n# You can also use mc_port instead of azure_login, but azure_login is highly recommended\nazure_login = {\n    \"client_id\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_ID\",\n    \"redirect_url\": \"https://127.0.0.1/auth-response\",\n    \"secret_value\": \"[OPTIONAL] YOUR_SECRET_VALUE\",\n    \"version\": \"fabric-loader-0.14.18-1.19\", # the version Voyager is tested on\n}\nopenai_api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n\nvoyager = Voyager(\n    azure_login=azure_login,\n    openai_api_key=openai_api_key,\n)\n\n# start lifelong learning\nvoyager.learn()\n```\n\n* If you are running with `Azure Login` for the first time, it will ask you to follow the command line instruction to generate a config file.\n* For `Azure Login`, you also need to select the world and open the world to LAN by yourself. After you run `voyager.learn()` the game will pop up soon, you need to:\n  1. Select `Singleplayer` and press `Create New World`.\n  2. Set Game Mode to `Creative` and Difficulty to `Peaceful`.\n  3. After the world is created, press `Esc` key and press `Open to LAN`.\n  4. Select `Allow cheats: ON` and press `Start LAN World`. You will see the bot join the world soon. \n\n# Resume from a checkpoint during learning\n\nIf you stop the learning process and want to resume from a checkpoint later, you can instantiate Voyager by:\n```python\nfrom voyager import Voyager\n\nvoyager = Voyager(\n    azure_login=azure_login,\n    openai_api_key=openai_api_key,\n    ckpt_dir=\"YOUR_CKPT_DIR\",\n    resume=True,\n)\n```\n\n# Run Voyager for a specific task with a learned skill library\n\nIf you want to run Voyager for a specific task with a learned skill library, you should first pass the skill library directory to Voyager:\n```python\nfrom voyager import Voyager\n\n# First instantiate Voyager with skill_library_dir.\nvoyager = Voyager(\n    azure_login=azure_login,\n    openai_api_key=openai_api_key,\n    skill_library_dir=\"./skill_library/trial1\", # Load a learned skill library.\n    ckpt_dir=\"YOUR_CKPT_DIR\", # Feel free to use a new dir. Do not use the same dir as skill library because new events will still be recorded to ckpt_dir. \n    resume=False, # Do not resume from a skill library because this is not learning.\n)\n```\nThen, you can run task decomposition. Notice: Occasionally, the task decomposition may not be logical. If you notice the printed sub-goals are flawed, you can rerun the decomposition.\n```python\n# Run task decomposition\ntask = \"YOUR TASK\" # e.g. \"Craft a diamond pickaxe\"\nsub_goals = voyager.decompose_task(task=task)\n```\nFinally, you can run the sub-goals with the learned skill library:\n```python\nvoyager.inference(sub_goals=sub_goals)\n```\n\nFor all valid skill libraries, see [Learned Skill Libraries](skill_library/README.md).\n\n# FAQ\nIf you have any questions, please check our [FAQ](FAQ.md) first before opening an issue.\n\n# Paper and Citation\n\nIf you find our work useful, please consider citing us! \n\n```bibtex\n@article{wang2023voyager,\n  title   = {Voyager: An Open-Ended Embodied Agent with Large Language Models},\n  author  = {Guanzhi Wang and Yuqi Xie and Yunfan Jiang and Ajay Mandlekar and Chaowei Xiao and Yuke Zhu and Linxi Fan and Anima Anandkumar},\n  year    = {2023},\n  journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv: Arxiv-2305.16291}\n}\n```\n\nDisclaimer: This project is strictly for research purposes, and not an official product from NVIDIA.\n"
