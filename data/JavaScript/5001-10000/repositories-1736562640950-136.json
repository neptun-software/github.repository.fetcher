          "content": "# Welcome to Dat!\n\nPlease take a second to read over this before opening an issue. Providing complete information upfront will help us address any issue (and ship new features!) faster. Our time is limited, please respect it and create complete issues.\n\nWe are available to chat in IRC at #dat. You can join [via Gitter](https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions). You can also [view and search](https://botbot.me/freenode/dat/) chat logs.\n\nWe have a [faq](https://docs.datproject.org/faq) section on our docs that may address non-bug questions.\n\n## Opening an Issue\n\nPlease read this section before opening a new issue. \n\n`dat` is composed of many modules and this repository is just one of them. If you know your issue is with another module, we prefer you open it in that repository. There may be an exiting issue in another repository. If you aren't sure, then this is the perfect place.\n\nAny new issues should be *actionable*. If your issue cannot be solved (and thus closed) please reconsider opening it in our discussion repository or rewording it.\n\n### Bug Reports\n\nA perfect bug report would have the following:\n\n1. Summary of the issue you are experiencing.\n2. Details on what versions of node and dat you have (`node -v` and `dat -v`).\n3. A simple repeatable test case for us to run. Please try to run through it 2-3 times to ensure it is completely repeatable.\n\nWe would like to avoid issues that require a follow up questions to identify the bug. These follow ups are difficult to do unless we have a repeatable test case.\n\nWe can't all be perfect =). Do as much as you can and we'll try to help you with the rest. If we are slow to respond, a more complete bug report will help.\n\n### Feature Requests\n\nFeature requests are more than welcome. Please search exiting issues (open and closed) to make sure it is not a duplicate. A good feature request would have examples of how to use it, some detailed use cases, and any concerns or possible edge cases.\n\nKeep in mind we have specific use cases we are building for (namely scientific data sharing). If, your feature request does not fit within that use case it may not be prioritized or implemented.\n\n### General Discussion Issues\n\nWe prefer to be able to close issues in this repository, which does not lend itself to discussion type questions. Open discussion type issue in the [datproject/discussions](https://github.com/datproject/discussions/issues) repository.\n\n## For Developers\n\nPlease read these guidelines if you are interested in contributing to Dat.\n\n### Submitting pull requests\n\nBefore taking the time to code something, feel free to open an issue first proposing your idea to other contributors, that way you can get feedback on the idea before taking time to write precious code.\n\nFor any new functionality we like to see:\n\n* unit tests so that we can improve long term maintenance and catch regressions in the future\n* updates to the [change log](http://keepachangelog.com/) and relevant documentation\n\n### For Collaborators\n\nMake sure to get a `:thumbsup:`, `+1` or `LGTM` from another collaborator before merging a PR. If you aren't sure if a release should happen, open an issue.\n\nRelease process:\n\n- make sure the tests pass\n- Update changelog\n- `npm version <major|minor|patch>`\n- `git push && git push --tags`\n- `npm publish`\n\n### Development workflow\n\nWe use and write a lot of node modules and it introduces a bit of a learning curve when working on multiple modules simultaneously. There are lots of different and valid solutions to working on lots of modules at once, this is just one way.\n\n#### Developing inside a node_modules folder\n\nFirst make sure you are comfortable with [how require works](https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#how-require-works) in node.\n\nWe recommend creating a folder somewhere manually called `node_modules`. For example in `~/code/node_modules`. Clone all of your git copies of modules that you want to work on into here, so for example:\n\n- `~/code/node_modules/dat`\n- `~/code/node_modules/hyperdrive`\n\nWhen you run `npm install` inside of `~/code/node_modules/dat`, dat will get its own copy of `hyperdrive` (one if its dependencies) inside `~/code/node_modules/dat/node_modules`. However, if you encounter a bug in hyperdrive that you need to fix, but you want to test your fix in dat, you want dat to use your git copy of hyperdrive at `~/code/node_modules/hyperdrive` and not the npm copy of hyperdrive at `~/code/node_modules/dat/node_modules/hyperdrive`.\n\nHow do you get dat to use the git copy of hyperdrive? Just delete the npm copy!\n\n```\nrm -rf ~/code/node_modules/dat/node_modules/hyperdrive\n```\n\nNow when you run dat, and it tries to `require('hyperdrive')` it first looks in its own `node_modules` folder at `~/code/node_modules/dat/node_modules` but doesnt find hyperdrive. So it goes up to `~/code/node_modules` and finds `hyperdrive` there and uses that one, your git copy.\n\nIf you want to switch back to an npm copy, just run `npm install` inside `~/code/node_modules/dat/` and npm will download any missing modules into `~/code/node_modules/dat/node_modules` but wont touch anything in `~/code/node_modules`.\n\nThis might seem a bit complicated at first, but is simple once you get the hang of it. Here are some rules to help you get started:\n\n- Never make any meaningful edits to code inside an \"npm-managed\" node_modules folder (such as `~/code/node_modules/dat/node_modules`), because when you run `npm install` inside those folders it could inadvertently delete all of your edits when installing an updated copy of a module. This has happened to me many times, so I just always use my git copy and delete the npm copy (as described above) to make edits to a module.\n- You should never need to run any npm commands in terminal when at your \"manually managed\"\" node_modules folder at `~/code/node_modules`. Never running npm commands at that folder also prevents npm from accidentally erasing your git copies of modules\n- The location of your \"manually managed\" node_modules folder should be somewhere isolated from your normal require path. E.g. if you put it at `~/node_modules`, then when you run `npm install dat` at `~/Desktop` npm might decide to erase your git copy of dat at `~/node_modules/dat` and replace it with a copy from npm, which could make you lose work. Putting your manually managed `node_modules` folder in a sub-folder like `~/code` gets it \"out of the way\" and prevents accidents like that from happening.\n"

There exists a large community around it. \n\n\n[<img src=\"https://datproject.github.io/design/downloads/dat-logo.png\" align=\"right\" width=\"140\">][Dat Project]\n\nHave questions? Join our chat via IRC or Gitter:\n\n[![#dat IRC channel on freenode][irc-badge]][irc-channel]\n[![datproject/discussions][gitter-badge]][gitter-chat]\n\n### Thanks to our financial supporters!\n![OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/dat/tiers/maintainer.svg?avatarHeight=36&width=600\")\n\n### Table of Contents\n\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Getting Started](#getting-started)\n- [Using Dat](#usage)\n- [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)\n- [Javascript API](#js-api)\n- [For Developers](#for-developers)\n\n## Installation\n\nDat can be used as a command line tool or a javascript library:\n\n* Install the `$ dat` CLI to use in the command line.\n* [require('dat')][dat-node] - dat-node, a library for downloading and sharing dat archives in javascript apps.\n\n### Installing the `$ dat` command line tool\n\nThe recommended way to install dat is through a single file binary distribution version of `dat` with the one line install command below. The binary includes a copy of node and dat packaged inside a single file, so you just have to download one file in order to start sharing data, with no other dependencies needed on your system:\n\n```\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datproject/dat/master/download.sh | bash\n```\n\n## Next version\n\nTry the next version of dat! This version (14.0.0) is not compatible with older\nversions (13.x) and below, and works on node v12.\n\n```\nnpm install -g dat@next\n```\n\nMaintainers wanted!\n\n#### NPM Prerequisites\n\n* **Node**: You'll need to [install Node JS][install-node] before installing Dat. Dat needs `node` version 4 or above and `npm` installed. You can run `node -v` to check your version.\n* **npm**: `npm` is installed with node. You can run `npm -v` to make sure it is installed.\n\nOnce you have `npm` ready, install `dat` from npm with the `--global, -g` option, `npm install -g dat`.\n\n## Getting started\n\n#### What is Dat?\n\nShare, backup, and publish your filesystem. You can turn any folder on your computer into a dat. Dat scans your folder, allowing you to:\n\n* Track your files with automatic version history.\n* Share files with others over a secure peer to peer network.\n* Automate live backups to external HDs or remote servers.\n* Publish and share files with built in HTTP server.\n\nDat allows you to focus on the fun work without worrying about moving files around. **Secure**, **distributed**, **fast**.\n\n* Documentation: [docs.datproject.org](https://docs.datproject.org)\n* [Dat white paper](https://github.com/datprotocol/whitepaper/blob/master/dat-paper.pdf)\n\n##### Desktop Applications\n\nRather not use the command line? Check out these options:\n\n* [Beaker Browser] - An experimental p2p browser with built-in support for the Hypercore Protocol.\n* [Dat Desktop](https://github.com/datproject/dat-desktop) - A desktop app to manage multiple dats on your desktop machine. \n\n### JS Library\n\nAdd Dat to your `package.json`, `npm install dat --save`. Dat exports the [dat-node] API via `require('dat')`. Use it in your javascript applications! Dat Desktop and Dat command line both use dat-node to share and download dats.\n\nFull API documentation is available in the [dat-node] repository on Github.\n\nWe have Dat installed, let's use it!\n\nDat's unique design works wherever you store your data. You can create a new dat from any folder on your computer.\n\nA dat is some files from your computer and a `.dat` folder. Each dat has a unique `dat://` link. With your dat link, other users can download your files and live sync any updates.\n\n### Sharing Data\n\nYou can start sharing your files with a single command. Unlike `git`, you do not have to initialize a repository first, `dat share` or simply `dat` will do that for you:\n\n```\ndat <dir>\n```\n\nUse `dat` to create a dat and sync your files from your computer to other users. Dat scans your files inside `<dir>`, creating metadata in `<dir>/.dat`. Dat stores the public link, version history, and file information inside the dat folder.\n\n`dat sync` and `dat share` are aliases for the same command.\n![share-gif]\n\n### Downloading Data\n\n```\ndat dat://<link> <download-dir>\n```\n\nUse `dat` to download files from a remote computer sharing files with Dat. This will download the files from `dat://<link>` to your `<download-dir>`. The download exits after it completes but you can continue to update the files later after the clone is done. Use `dat pull` to update new files or `dat sync` to live sync changes.\n\n`dat clone` is an alias for the same command.\n\n![clone-gif]\n\n\n### Misc Commands\n\nA few other highlights. Run `dat help` to see the full usage guide.\n\n* `dat create` or `dat init` - Create an empty dat and `dat.json` file.\n* `dat log ~/data/dat-folder/` or `dat log dat://<key>` - view the history and metadata information for a dat.\n\n### Quick Demos\n\nTo get started using Dat, you can try downloading a dat and then sharing a dat of your own.\n\n#### Download Demo\n\nWe made a demo folder just for this exercise. Inside the demo folder is a `dat.json` file and a gif. We shared these files via Dat and now you can download them with our dat key!\n\nSimilar to git, you can download somebody's dat by running `dat clone <link>`. You can also specify the directory:\n\n```\n❯ dat clone dat://778f8d955175c92e4ced5e4f5563f69bfec0c86cc6f670352c457943666fe639 ~/Downloads/dat-demo\ndat v13.5.0\nCreated new dat in /Users/joe/Downloads/dat-demo/.dat\nCloning: 2 files (1.4 MB)\n\n2 connections | Download 614 KB/s Upload 0 B/s\n\ndat sync complete.\nVersion 4\n```\n\nThis will download our demo files to the `~/Downloads/dat-demo` folder. These files are being shared by a server over Dat (to ensure high availability) but you may connect to any number of users also hosting the content.\n\nYou can also also view the files online: [datbase.org/778f8d955175c92e4ced5e4f5563f69bfec0c86cc6f670352c457943666fe639](https://datbase.org/778f8d955175c92e4ced5e4f5563f69bfec0c86cc6f670352c457943666fe639/). datbase.org can download files over Dat and display them on HTTP as long as someone is hosting it. The website temporarily caches data for any visited links (do not view your dat on datbase.org if you do not want us to cache your data).\n\n#### Sharing Demo\n\nDat can share files from your computer to anywhere. If you have a friend going through this demo with you, try sharing to them! If not we'll see what we can do.\n\nFind a folder on your computer to share. Inside the folder can be anything, Dat can handle all sorts of files (Dat works with really big folders too!).\n\nFirst, you can create a new dat inside that folder. Using the `dat create` command also walks us through making a `dat.json` file:\n\n```\n❯ dat create\nWelcome to dat program!\nYou can turn any folder on your computer into a Dat.\nA dat is a folder with some magic.\n```\n\nThis will create a new (empty) dat. Dat will print a link, share this link to give others access to view your files.\n\nOnce we have our dat, run `dat <dir>` to scan your files and sync them to the network. Share the link with your friend to instantly start downloading files.\n\n#### Bonus HTTP Demo\n\nDat makes it really easy to share live files on a HTTP server. This is a cool demo because we can also see how version history works! Serve dat files on HTTP with the `--http` option. For example, `dat --http`, serves your files to a HTTP website with live reloading and version history! This even works for dats you're downloading (add the `--sparse` option to only download files you select via HTTP). The default HTTP port is 8080.\n\n*Hint: Use `localhost:8080/?version=10` to view a specific version.*\n\nGet started using Dat today with the `share` and `clone` commands or read below for more details.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe first time you run a command, a `.dat` folder is created to store the dat metadata.\nOnce a dat is created, you can run all the commands inside that folder, similar to git.\n\nDat keeps secret keys in the `~/.dat/secret_keys` folder. These are required to write to any dats you create.\n\n#### Creating a dat & dat.json\n\n```\ndat create [<dir>]\n```\n\nThe create command prompts you to make a `dat.json` file and creates a new dat. Import the files with sync or share.\n\nOptionally bypass Title and Description prompt:\n\n```sh\ndat create --title \"MY BITS\" --description \"are ready to synchronize! 😎\"\n```\n\nOptionally bypass `dat.json` creation:\n\n```sh\ndat create --yes\ndat create -y\n```\n\n### Sharing\n\nThe quickest way to get started sharing files is to `share`:\n\n```\n❯ dat \ndat://3e830227b4b2be197679ff1b573cc85e689f202c0884eb8bdb0e1fcecbd93119\nSharing dat: 24 files (383 MB)\n\n0 connections | Download 0 B/s Upload 0 B/s\n\nImporting 528 files to Archive (165 MB/s)\n[=-----------------------------------------] 3%\nADD: data/expn_cd.csv (403 MB / 920 MB)\n```\n\n```\ndat [<dir>] [--no-import] [--no-watch]\n```\n\nStart sharing your dat archive over the network. It will import new or updated files since you last ran `create` or `sync`. Dat watches files for changes and imports updated files.\n\n* Use `--no-import` to not import any new or updated files.\n* Use `--no-watch` to not watch directory for changes. `--import` must be true for `--watch` to work.\n\n#### Ignoring Files\n\nBy default, Dat will ignore any files in a `.datignore` file, similar to git. Each file should be separated by a newline. Dat also ignores all hidden folders and files. Supports pattern wildcards (`/*.png`) and directory-wildcards (`/**/cache`).\n\n#### Selecting Files\n\nBy default, Dat will download all files. If you want to only download a subset, you can create a `.datdownload` file which downloads only the files and folders specified. Each should be separated by a newline.\n\n\n### Downloading\n\nStart downloading by running the `clone` command. This creates a folder, downloads the content and metadata, and a `.dat` folder inside. Once you started the download, you can resume at any time.\n\n```\ndat <link> [<dir>] [--temp]\n```\n\nClone a remote dat archive to a local folder.\nThis will create a folder with the key name if no folder is specified.\n\n\n#### Downloading via `dat.json` key\n\nYou can use a `dat.json` file to clone also. This is useful when combining Dat and git, for example. To clone a dat you can specify the path to a folder containing a `dat.json`:\n\n```\ngit git@github.com:joehand/dat-clone-sparse-test.git\ndat ./dat-clone-sparse-test\n```\n\nThis will download the dat specified in the `dat.json` file.\n\n#### Updating Downloaded Archives\n\nOnce a dat is clone, you can run either `dat pull` or `dat sync` in the folder to update the archive.\n\n```\ndat pull [<dir>]\n```\n\nDownload latest files and keep connection open to continue updating as remote source is updated.\n\n### Shortcut commands\n\n* `dat <link> <dir>` will run `dat clone` for new dats or resume the existing dat in `<dir>`\n* `dat <dir>` is the same as running `dat sync <dir>`\n\n### Key Management & Moving dats\n\n`dat keys` provides a few commands to help you move or backup your dats.\n\nWriting to a dat requires the secret key, stored in the `~/.dat` folder. You can export and import these keys between dats. First, clone your dat to the new location:\n\n* (original) `dat share` \n* (duplicate) `dat clone <link>`\n\nThen transfer the secret key:\n\n* (original) `dat keys export` - copy the secret key printed out.\n* (duplicate) `dat keys import` - this will prompt you for the secret key, paste it in here.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nWe've provided some troubleshooting tips based on issues users have seen.\nPlease [open an issue][new-issue] or ask us in our [chat room][gitter-chat] if you need help troubleshooting and it is not covered here.\n\nIf you have trouble sharing/downloading in a directory with a `.dat` folder, try deleting it and running the command again.\n\n#### Check Your Dat Version\n\nKnowing the version is really helpful if you run into any bugs, and will help us troubleshoot your issue.\n\nCheck your Dat version:\n\n```\ndat -v\n```\n\nYou should see the Dat semantic version printed, e.g. `14.0.0`.\n\n### Installation Issues\n\n#### Node & npm\n\nTo use the Dat command line tool you will need to have [node and npm installed][install-node-npm].\nMake sure those are installed correctly before installing Dat.\nYou can check the version of each:\n\n```\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n```\n\n#### Global Install\n\nThe `-g` option installs Dat globally, allowing you to run it as a command.\nMake sure you installed with that option.\n\n* If you receive an `EACCES` error, read [this guide][fixing-npm-permissions] on fixing npm permissions.\n* If you receive an `EACCES` error, you may also install Dat with sudo: `sudo npm install -g dat`.\n* Have other installation issues? Let us know, you can [open an issue][new-issue] or ask us in our [chat room][gitter-chat].\n\n### Debugging Output\n\nIf you are having trouble with a specific command, run with the debug environment variable set to `dat` (and optionally also `dat-node`).\nThis will help us debug any issues:\n\n```\nDEBUG=dat,dat-node dat dat://<link> dir\n```\n\n### Networking Issues\n\nNetworking capabilities vary widely with each computer, network, and configuration.\nWhenever you run Dat there are several steps to share or download files with peers:\n\n1. Discovering Peers\n2. Connecting to Peers\n3. Sending & Receiving Data\n\nWith successful use, Dat will show `Connected to 1 peer` after connection.\nIf you never see a peer connected, your network may be restricting discovery or connection.\n\n## JS API\n\nYou can use Dat in your javascript application:\n\n```js\nvar Dat = require('dat')\n\nDat('/data', function (err, dat) {\n  // use dat\n})\n```\n\n**[Read more][dat-node] about the JS usage provided via `dat-node`.**\n\n## For Developers\n\nPlease see [guidelines on contributing] before submitting an issue or PR.\n\nThis command line library uses [dat-node] to create and manage the archives and networking.\nIf you'd like to build your own Dat application that is compatible with this command line tool, we suggest using dat-node.\n\n### Installing from source\n\nClone this repository and in a terminal inside of the folder you cloned run this command:\n\n```\nnpm link\n```\n\nThis should add a `dat` command line command to your PATH.\nNow you can run the `dat` command to try it out.\n\nThe contribution guide also has more tips on our [development workflow].\n\n* `npm run test` to run tests\n* `npm run auth-server` to run a local auth server for testing\n\n## License\n\nBSD-3-Clause\n\n[Dat Project]: https://datproject.org\n[Code for Science & Society]: https://codeforscience.org\n[Dat white paper]: https://github.com/datproject/docs/blob/master/papers/dat-paper.pdf\n[Dat Desktop]: https://docs.datproject.org/install#desktop-application\n[Beaker Browser]: https://beakerbrowser.com\n[registry server]: https://github.com/datproject/datbase\n[share-gif]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datproject/docs/master/docs/assets/cli-share.gif\n[clone-gif]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datproject/docs/master/docs/assets/cli-clone.gif\n[Knight Foundation grant]: https://blog.datproject.org/2016/02/01/announcing-publicbits-org/\n[dat-node]: https://github.com/datproject/dat-node\n[dat-ignore]: https://github.com/joehand/dat-ignore\n[new-issue]: https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/new\n[dat#503]: https://github.com/datproject/dat/issues/503\n[install-node]: https://nodejs.org/en/download/\n[install-node-npm]: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node\n[fixing-npm-permissions]: https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions\n[guidelines on contributing]: https://github.com/datproject/dat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[development workflow]: https://github.com/datproject/dat/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#development-workflow\n[travis-badge]: https://travis-ci.org/datproject/dat.svg?branch=master\n[travis-build]: https://travis-ci.org/datproject/dat\n[appveyor-badge]: https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/datproject/dat?branch=master&svg=true\n[appveyor-build]: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/joehand/dat/branch/master\n[npm-badge]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/dat.svg\n[npm-package]: https://npmjs.org/package/dat\n[irc-badge]: https://img.shields.io/badge/irc%20channel-%23dat%20on%20freenode-blue.svg\n[irc-channel]: https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=dat\n[gitter-badge]: https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg\n[gitter-chat]: https://gitter.im/datproject/discussions\n"

Using the CLI you can now specify which files you want to download either with an option or using the `.datdownload` file. `dat sync` will download and keep updated on the selected files. This means you can put large datasets into Dat but have control over what files you download where.\n\n[Full release notes](https://github.com/datproject/dat/releases/tag/v13.8.0)\n\n## Added\n* Selective Sync (https://github.com/datproject/dat/pull/834)\n* Key management (https://github.com/datproject/dat/pull/828)\n\n## Changed\n* Commands run faster via lazy required modules (https://github.com/datproject/dat/pull/821)\n\n## 13.7.0 - 2017-06-28\n## Added\n* Throttling - sometimes Dat goes too fast, so you can limit the upload + download speeds.
