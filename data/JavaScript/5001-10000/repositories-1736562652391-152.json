Alternatively, skip to the section below for instructions on how to build Min directly from source.\n\n### Installation on Linux\n\n- To install the .deb file, use `sudo dpkg -i /path/to/download`\n- To install the RPM build, use `sudo rpm -i /path/to/download --ignoreos`\n- On Arch Linux install from [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/min-browser-bin).\n- On Raspberry Pi, you can install Min from [Pi-Apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n* The [wiki](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/wiki) provides an overview of the the features available in Min, a list of available keyboard shortcuts, and answers to some [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/wiki/FAQ).\n* Min supports installing userscripts to extend its functionality. See the [userscript documentation](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/wiki/userscripts) for instructions on writing userscripts, as well as a collection of scripts written by the community.\n* If you have questions about using Min, need help getting started with development, or want to talk about what we're working on, join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/bRpqjJ4).\n\n## Developing\n\nIf you want to develop Min:\n\n- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org).\n- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.\n- Start Min in development mode by running `npm run start`.\n- After you make changes, press `alt+ctrl+r` (or `opt+cmd+r` on Mac) to reload the browser UI.\n\n### Building binaries\n\nIn order to build Min from source, follow the installation instructions above, then use one of the following commands to create binaries:\n\n- `npm run buildWindows`\n- `npm run buildMacIntel`\n- `npm run buildMacArm`\n- `npm run buildDebian`\n- `npm run buildRaspi` (for 32-bit Raspberry Pi)\n- `npm run buildLinuxArm64` (for 64-bit Raspberry Pi or other ARM Linux)\n- `npm run buildRedhat`\n\nDepending on the platform you are building for, you may need to install additional dependencies:\n\n- If you are building a macOS package, you'll need to install Xcode and the associated command-line tools. You may also need to set your default SDK to macOS 11.0 or higher, which you can do by running `export SDKROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX11.1.sdk`. The exact command will depend on where Xcode is installed and which SDK version you're using.\n- To build on Windows, you'll need to install Visual Studio. Once it's installed, you may also need to run `npm config set msvs_version 2019` (or the appropriate version).\n\n## Contributing to Min\n\nThanks for taking the time to contribute to Min!\n\n### Getting Help\n\nIf you're experiencing a bug or have a suggestion for how to improve Min, please open a [new issue](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/issues/new/choose).\n\n### Contributing Code\n\n- Start by following the development instructions listed above.\n- The wiki has an [overview of Min's architecture](https://github.com/minbrowser/min/wiki/Architecture).\n- Min uses the [Standard](https://github.com/feross/standard) code style; [most editors](https://standardjs.com/#are-there-text-editor-plugins) have plugins available to auto-format your code.\n- If you see something that's missing, or run into any problems, please open an issue!\n\n### Contributing Translations\n\n#### Adding a new language\n\n- Find the language code that goes with your language from [this list](https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:ui/base/l10n/l10n_util.cc;l=55) (line 55 - 230).\n- In the `localization/languages` directory, create a new file, and name it \"[your language code].json\".\n- Open your new file, and copy the contents of the <a href=\"https://github.com/minbrowser/min/blob/master/localization/languages/en-US.json\">localization/languages/en-US.json</a> file into your new file.\n- Change the \"identifier\" field in the new file to the language code from step 1.\n- Inside the file, replace each English string in the right-hand column with the equivalent translation.\n- (Optional) See your translations live by following the [development instructions](#installing) above. Min will display in the same language as your operating system, so make sure your computer is set to the same language that you're translating.\n- That's it! Make a pull request with your changes.\n\n#### Updating an existing language\n\n- Find the language file for your language in the `localization/languages` directory.\n- Look through the file for any items that have a value of \"null\", or that have a comment saying \"missing translation\".\n- For each of these items, look for the item with the same name in the `en-US.json` file.\n- Translate the value from the English file, replace \"null\" with your translation, and remove the \"missing translation\" comment.\n- Make a pull request with the updated file.\n\n[DiscordBadge]: https://img.shields.io/discord/764269005195968512.svg?label=Discord&logo=discord&logoColor=white\n[DiscordUrl]: https://discord.gg/bRpqjJ4\n[DownloadsBadge]: https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/minbrowser/min/total.svg\n[DownloadsUrl]: https://github.com/minbrowser/min/releases\n"
