          "content": "# Changelog\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## [Unreleased]\n\n### Changed\n- `systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle` promise can resolve with `true` to indicate success, in which case **File > Save** will not prompt to save the file again. `false` indicates failure or cancellation, whereas `undefined` can be used if it is unknown whether the file will be saved successfully, as is the case when using the `download` attribute on an anchor element. If saving as a monochrome bitmap, `undefined` will cause the canvas to become monochrome, but it will still prompt to save the file again. This tradeoff is reasonable because the download attribute doesn't support saving over an already saved file anyways\n\n\n## [1.0.0] - 2022-08-02\n### Added\n- `systemHooks` API for overriding file dialogs, file saving/loading, and Set as Wallpaper commands\n\t- `systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog = async ({ formats, defaultFileName, defaultPath, defaultFileFormatID, getBlob, savedCallbackUnreliable, dialogTitle }) => { ... };`\n\t- `systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog = async ({ formats }) => { ... };`\n\t- `systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle = async (save_file_handle, blob) => { ... };`\n\t- `systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle = async (file_handle) => { ... };`\n\t- `systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled = (canvas) => { ... };`\n\t- `systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered = (canvas) => { ... };`\n- function `undoable({ name, icon }, actionFunction)` to make an action undoable, as far is it modifies the canvas\n- function `show_error_message(message, [error])` to show an error message dialog box, optionally with expandable error details\n- function `open_from_file(blob, source_file_handle)` to load a file from a blob and file handle pair (kinda quirky API)\n- function `set_theme(theme_file_name)` to switch themes\n- function `set_language(language_code)` to switch languages, prompting the user to reload the application\n- You can use `.main-canvas` selector to access the canvas element.\n- URL parameter `#load:<URL>` to load a file from a URL\n\n[Unreleased]: https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/compare/v1.0.0...HEAD\n[1.1.0]: https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/compare/v1.0.0...v1.1.0\n[1.0.0]: https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/releases/tag/v1.0.0\n"

I don't recommend this pattern for new code.\n- Menu code and windowing code lives in the [os-gui](https://github.com/1j01/os-gui) project.\n\t- It can be synced (one-way) by running `npm i os-gui@latest --save-exact && npm run sync-os-gui`\n\t- To develop os-gui in the context of jspaint, you can run `npm link` in a clone of os-gui, then run `npm link os-gui && npm run sync-os-gui` in jspaint after making any changes in os-gui.\n\t- (Maybe I should version this using git-subrepo?)\n\t- Some window behavior specific to jspaint is in `$ToolWindow.js` and `$Component.js`\n- `image-manipulation.js` should contain just rendering related code, and ideally no dialogs except maybe some error messages.\n\t- Some image manipulation code is also in `tools.js` and `functions.js`\n- CSS is in `styles/`\n\t- Layout-important CSS is kept separate from theme CSS\n- Localization data is in `localization/`\n\t- As of writing there's no good way to contribute translations, but [get in touch!](https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/issues/80)\n\nAny good IDE or code editor has a project-wide search (often with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F</kbd>). I use this all the time.  \nI also use the \"Intellisense\" feature of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to jump to function definitions (an extra convenience over searching for function names)."

[Try it out!](https://jspaint.app)\nThen join the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/jxQBK3k8tx) to share your art!\n\nJS Paint recreates every tool and menu of MS Paint, and even [little-known features](#did-you-know), to a high degree of fidelity.\n\nIt supports themes, additional file types, and accessibility features like a Dwell Clicker and Speech Recognition.\n\n![Screenshot](images/meta/main-screenshot.png)\n\nAh yes, good old Paint. Not the one with the [ribbons][]\nor the [new skeuomorphic one][Fresh Paint] with the interface that can take up nearly half the screen.\n(And not the even newer [Paint 3D][].)\n\n[ribbons]: https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=MS+Paint+Windows+7+ribbons \"Google Search: MS Paint Windows 7 ribbons\"\n[Fresh Paint]: https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=MS+Fresh+Paint \"Google Search: MS Fresh Paint\"\n[Paint 3D]: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/paint-3d-preview/9nblggh5fv99\n\nWindows 95, 98, and XP were the golden years of Paint.\nYou had a tool box and a color box, a foreground color and a background color,\nand that was all you needed.\n\nThings were simple.\n\nBut we want to undo more than three actions.\nWe want to edit transparent images.\nWe can't just keep using the old Paint.\n\nSo that's why I'm making JS Paint.\nI want to bring good old Paint into the modern era.\n\n\n#### Current improvements include:\n\n* Open source ([MIT licensed](LICENSE.txt))\n* Cross-platform\n* Mobile friendly\n  * Touch support: use two fingers to pan the view, and pinch to zoom\n  * Click/tap the selected colors area to swap the foreground and background colors\n  * **View > Fullscreen** to toggle fullscreen mode, nice for small screens\n  * **Extras > Quick Undo Button** to add a floating undo button for easier access\n    * (this may be enabled by default in the future for touch devices)\n* Web features\n  * **File > Load From URL...** to open an image from the Web.\n  * **File > Upload to Imgur** to upload the current image to Imgur.\n  * **Paste** supports loading from URLs.\n  * You can create links that will open an image from the Web in JS Paint. For example, this link will start with an isometric grid as a template: <https://jspaint.app/#load:https://i.imgur.com/zJMrWwb.png>\n  * Rudimentary **multi-user** collaboration support.\n    Start up a session at\n    [jspaint.app/#session:multi-user-test](https://jspaint.app/#session:multi-user-test)\n    and send the link to your friends!\n    It isn't seamless; actions by other users interrupt what you're doing, and visa versa.\n    Sessions are not private, and you may lose your work at any time.\n    If you want better collaboration support, follow the development of [Mopaint](https://github.com/1j01/mopaint).\n* **Extras > Themes** to change the look of the app.\n  * Dark and light variants\n  * Vector tool icons handcrafted to match the pixel art versions, for both Modern and Classic themes\n  * Occult theme, in the spirit of Halloween\n  * Winter theme, with a special color palette including candy cane stripes, and advent calendar style flaps revealing pixel art for each tool\n  * Bubblegum theme, featuring *Business Pink* color scheme and AI-generated icons\n* **Extras > Enlarge UI** to make buttons and menus bigger, for usage with an eye tracker, head tracker, or other course input devices. May also work well for a tablet, but not so much for a phone at the moment.\n* **Extras > Dwell Clicker** to click automatically by hovering in one spot, for usage with an eye tracker or head tracker.\n  * Hovered buttons are highlighted, and the click is performed after a delay.\n  * Supports dragging windows and drawing on the canvas.\n  * With just a webcam, you can try it out with [Enable Viacam](https://eviacam.crea-si.com/) (head tracker), [GazePointer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gazepointer/) (eye tracker), or the built in [<img src=\"images/tracky-mouse-16x16.png\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"> Tracky Mouse](https://trackymouse.js.org/) head tracker using **Extras > Head Tracker**.\n  * This feature can be easily added to other web applications, using the [<img src=\"images/tracky-mouse-16x16.png\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\"> Tracky Mouse API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tracky-mouse).\n* **Extras > Speech Recognition** to control the app with your voice.\n  * Select tools and colors (\"fill tool\", \"orange\", etc.)\n  * Pan the view (\"scroll down and to the left\", or \"go southwest\", etc.)\n  * Explore the menus, or activate any menu item without opening the menus first\n  * Interact with windows\n  * Dictate text with the Text tool\n  <!-- (Broken due to no-longer-free service) * Even tell the application to sketch things (for instance, \"draw a house\") -->\n* Create an animated GIF from the current document history.\n  Accessible from the Extras menu or with <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+G</kbd>.\n  It's pretty nifty, you should try it out!\n  You might want to limit the size of the image though.\n* Load and save [many different palette formats](#color-palette-formats) with **Colors > Get Colors** and **Colors > Save Colors**.\n  (I made a library for this: <img src=\"images/anypalette-logo-128x128.png\" height=\"16\"> [AnyPalette.js](https://github.com/1j01/anypalette.js).)\n  * You can also drag and drop palette files into the app to load.\n\nEditing Features:\n\n* Use Alt+Mousewheel to zoom in and out\n* Edit transparent images! To create a transparent image,\n  go to **Image > Attributes...** and select Transparent,\n  then OK, and then **Image > Clear Image** or use the Eraser tool.\n  Images with *any* translucent pixels will open in Transparent mode.\n* You can crop the image by making a selection while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>\n* Keyboard shortcuts for rotation: <kbd>Ctrl+.</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> (<kbd><</kbd> and <kbd>></kbd>)\n* Rotate by any arbitrary angle in **Image > Flip/Rotate**\n* In **Image > Stretch/Skew**, you can stretch more than 500% at once\n* Zoom to an arbitrary scale in **View > Zoom > Custom...**\n* Zoom to fit the canvas within the window with **View > Zoom > Zoom To Window**\n* Non-contiguous fill: Replace a color in the entire image by holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> when using the fill tool\n\nMiscellaneous Improvements:\n\n* [Vertical Color Box mode](https://jspaint.app/#vertical-color-box-mode), accessible from **Extras > Vertical Color Box**\n* You can use the Text tool at any zoom level (and it previews the exact pixels that will end up on the canvas).\n* Spellcheck is available in the textbox if your browser supports it.\n* Resize handles are easier to grab than in Windows 10's Paint.\n* Omits some Thumbnail view bugs, like the selection showing in the wrong place.\n* Unlimited undos/redos (as opposed to a measly 3 in Windows XP,\n  or a measly 50 in Windows 7)\n* Undo history is *nonlinear*, which means if you undo and do something other than redo, the redos aren't discarded. Instead, a new branch is created in the *history tree*. Jump to any point in history with **Edit > History** or <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Y</kbd>\n* Automatically keeps a backup of your image. Only one backup per image tho, which doesn't give you a lot of safety. Remember to save with **File > Save** or <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd>! Manage backups with **File > Manage Storage**.\n\n<!--\nHalf-features:\n\n* When you do **Edit > Paste From...** you can select transparent images.\n  ~~You can even paste a transparent animated GIF and then\n  hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> while dragging the selection to\n  smear it across the canvas *while it animates*!~~\n  Update: This was [due to not-to-spec behavior in Chrome.](https://christianheilmann.com/2014/04/16/browser-inconsistencies-animated-gif-and-drawimage/)\n  I may reimplement this in the future as I really liked this feature.\n* You can open SVG files, though only as a bitmap.\n  (Note: it may open super large, or tiny. There's no option to choose a size when opening.)\n-->\n\n![JS Paint drawing of JS Paint on a phone](images/meta/mobipaint.png)\n\n\n#### Limitations:\n\nA few things with the tools aren't done yet.\nSee [TODO.md](TODO.md#Tools)\n\nFull clipboard support in the web app requires a browser supporting the [Async Clipboard API w/ Images](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2019/07/image-support-for-async-clipboard), namely Chrome 76+ at the time of writing.\n\nIn other browsers you can still copy with <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd>, cut with <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd>, and paste with <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd>,\nbut data copied from JS Paint can only be pasted into other instances of JS Paint.\nExternal images can be pasted in.\n\n\n## Supported File Formats\n\n### Image Formats\n\n⚠️ Saving as JPEG will introduce artifacts that cause problems when using the Fill tool or transparent selections.\n\n⚠️ Saving in some formats will reduce the number of colors in the image.\n\n💡 Unlike in MS Paint, you can use **Edit > Undo** to revert color or quality reduction from saving.\nThis doesn't undo saving the file, but allows you to then save in a different format with higher quality, using **File > Save As**.\n\n💡 Saving as PNG is recommended as it gives small file sizes while retaining full quality.\n\n| File Extension                | Name

palette,\n  which you can get to from **Image > Attributes...**\n\n* You can drag the color box and tool box around if you grab them by the right place.\n  You can even drag them out into little windows.\n  You can dock the windows back to the side by double-clicking on their title bars.\n\n* In addition to the left-click foreground color and the right-click background color,\n  there's a third color you can access by holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while you draw.\n  It starts out with no color so you'll need to hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> and select a color first.\n  The fancy thing about this color slot is you can\n  press and release <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to switch colors *while drawing*.\n\n* You can apply image transformations like Flip/Rotate, Stretch/Skew or Invert (in the Image menu) either to the whole image or to a selection.\n  Try scribbling with the Free-Form Select tool and then doing **Image > Invert**\n\n* These Tips and Tricks from [a tutorial for MS Paint](https://www.albinoblacksheep.com/tutorial/mspaint)\n  also work in JS Paint:\n\n\t* [x] Brush Scaling (<kbd>+</kbd> & <kbd>-</kbd> on the number pad to adjust brush size)\n\t* [x] \"Custom Brushes\" (hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and drag the selection to smear it)\n\t* [x] The 'Stamp' \"Tool\" (hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and click the selection to stamp it)\n\t* [x] Image Scaling (<kbd>+</kbd> & <kbd>-</kbd> on the number pad to scale the selection by factors of 2)\n\t* [x] Color Replacement (right mouse button with Eraser to selectively replace the foreground color with the background color)\n\t* [x] The Grid (<kbd>Ctrl+G</kbd> & Zoom to 4x+)\n\t* [x] Quick Undo (Pressing a second mouse button cancels the action you were performing.\n\t      I also made it redoable, in case you do it by accident!)\n\t* [ ] Scroll Wheel Bug (Hmm, let's maybe not recreate this?)\n\n\n## Desktop App\n\n### PWA\n\nJS Paint can be installed as a Progressive Web App (PWA), although it doesn't work offline yet.\nLook for the install prompt in the address bar.\n\nPWA features:\n- No address bar; middle-ground between web and native\n- Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux, Android, iOS)\n- Basic file integration:\n\t- File > Open\n\t- File > Save downloads the file after asking for a filename and format\n\t- Drag and drop files onto the window to open them\n\nMissing features:\n\n- <details><summary>Directly saving to files is implemented but not enabled currently.</summary>I was concerned about data loss for two reasons: 1. the change in behavior of File > Save / Ctrl+S from effectively acting as Save As to overwriting files directly, although I made a warning dialog for this, with a don't show again option; 2. there was a bad bug with saved files ending up completely empty (zero bytes), which I don't know if was a bug in my code or in Chrome.</details>\n- <details><summary>Offline support is not implemented.</summary>I've taken a few stabs at this, and <a href=\"https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/pull/144\">I'm not the only one</a>, but there are some huge caveats, such as the development server not being able to live-reload without disabling the service worker.</details>\n\n### Electron\n\nI've also built it into a desktop app with [Electron][] and [Electron Forge][].\nYou can download it from the [releases page][].\n\n![JS Paint running as a desktop app on macOS](images/meta/electron-app-screenshot-mac.png)\n\nElectron app features:\n- Native-like experience (runs in a window with no address bar)\n- Cross-platform (macOS, Windows, Linux)\n- Clipboard support\n- Files can be opened in various ways:\n  - **File > Open**\n  - Drag and drop onto window\n  - Drag and drop onto dock icon on macOS\n  - Drag and drop onto desktop shortcut\n  - **Right Click > Open With** in file manager (macOS and Linux)\n    - On Windows, you can manually paste the path to the executable into the Open With dialog, which you can find by right clicking the app in the taskbar, then right clicking the app's name, and selecting Properties. In the Shortcut tab, the Target field is the path to the executable. Once you open the app in this way, the app will show up in the Open With list, and if you select \"Always\", it will become the default app for that file type.\n  - Command line: type `jspaint path/to/file.png` in the terminal\n- **File > Save** will save directly to the file\n- **File > Set As Wallpaper (Tiled)** and **File > Set As Wallpaper (Centered)**\n- On macOS, an icon representing the currently open file is shown in the titlebar. You can drag this icon into other applications, for example to include the image you're editing in an email. The icon is dimmed while there are unsaved changes.\n\n<details><summary>Electron app limitations</summary>\n\n- Basics:\n  - Execution is blocked by default on Mac and Windows\n    - On macOS you need to Ctrl+click the file and then say Open\n    - On Windows, you need to say \"More info\" and then \"Run\" (or \"Run anyway\"?)\n    - I would need to pay a fee for code signing to avoid this. It's basically *security by extortion*.\n  - There are no automatic updates. Apparently I would need to pay a fee for code signing to get this free service.\n    - That said, **Help > About Paint** can tell you if JS Paint is out of date, at least in terms of news updates.\n  - Electron is out of date. It may, for instance, contain image decoding vulnerabilities that have since been fixed. However, I've taken precautions to sandbox the app and restrict write access to a list of files explicitly opened in the app, the list being controlled by the main process, separate from the renderer process which would handle image decoding.\n  - Only a single editor window can be opened at once.\n  - The File menu's recent files list is not implemented, nor are [OS-specific jump menus](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/recent-documents).\n- Minor details:\n  - A very confusing message is shown if you edit a document before clicking an Open link in the Manage Storage dialog.\n  - WebGL error messages tell you to refresh without offering a way to reload; also, calling the app a web page feels unpolished\n  - The File > Open dialog does not have an All Files (\\*.\\*) option, and the list of file types supported is not exhaustive; for example, AVIF images can be loaded but only by drag and drop\n  - Drag and drop shows two \"Save changes to X?\" dialogs on top of each other?\n- I'm not sure if all of these are still issues, need to retest them:\n  - Quit doesn't exit app completely, only closes the window if it's open... intended behavior? shouldn't right click > Quit really quit? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44316306/how-to-quit-electron-app-on-mac\n  - Quit doesn't show/focus window when save changes prompt is shown on maybe mac/linux\n  - Ctrl+C doesn't exit on mac/linux https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/5273\n    - this is because of `editor_window.on(\"close\")` calling `preventDefault` and may be a feature but needs to show/focus the window\n    - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75362687/electron-js-processes-do-not-exit-on-app-quit\n  - Opening an SVG file also isn't working via command line argument (dragging onto the shortcut in File Explorer) even though dragging and dropping into the window works.  \n    - Seems to load load SVG as a palette... Is this what I was running into?\n\n</details>\n\n[Electron]: https://electronjs.org/\n[Electron Forge]: https://electronforge.io/\n[releases page]: https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/releases/\n\n\n## Development Setup\n\n[Clone the repo.](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)\n\nInstall [Node.js][] if you don't have it, then open up a command prompt / terminal in the project directory.\n\n### Quality Assurance\n\nRun `npm run lint` to check for spelling errors, type errors, code style issues, and other problems.\n\nRun `npm run format` to automatically fix formatting issues, or `npx eslint --fix` to fix all auto-fixable issues.\n\nThe formatting rules are configured for compatibility with VS Code's built-in formatter.\n\nRun `npm test` to run browser-based tests with Cypress. (It's slow to start up and run tests, unfortunately.)\n\nRun `npm run accept` to accept any visual changes.\nThis unfortunately re-runs all the tests, rather than accepting results of the previous test, so you could end up with different results than the previous test.\nIf you use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), you can view diffs of images, in four different modes.\n\nTo open the Cypress UI, first run `npm run test:start-server`, then concurrently `npm run cy:open`\n\n~~Tests are also run in continuous integration [with Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/1j01/jspaint).~~\n\n### Web App (https://jspaint.app)\n\nAfter you've installed dependencies with `npm i`,\nuse `npm run dev` to start a live-reloading server.\n\nMake sure any layout-important styles go in `layout.css`.\nWhen updating `layout.css`, a right-to-left version of the stylesheet is generated, using [RTLCSS](https://rtlcss.com/).  \nYou should test the RTL layout by changing the language to Arabic or Hebrew.\nGo to **Extras > Language > العربية** or **עברית**.  \nSee [Control Directives](https://rtlcss.com/learn/usage-guide/control-directives/) for how to control the RTL layout.\n\nThere is a VS Code launch task for attaching to Chrome for debugging.\nSee `.vscode/launch.json` for usage instructions.\n\n### Desktop App (Electron)\n\n- Install dependencies with `npm i`\n- Start the electron app with `npm run electron:start`\n\n[electron-debug][] is included, so you can use <kbd>F5</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd> to reload and <kbd>F12</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> to open the devtools.\n\nYou can build for production with `npm run electron:make`\n\nThere is a VS Code launch task for debugging the Electron main process.\nFor the renderer process, you can use the embedded Chrome DevTools.\n\n[Live Server]: https://github.com/1j01/live-server\n[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/\n[electron-debug]: https://github.com/sindresorhus/electron-debug\n\n## Deployment\n\nJS Paint can be deployed using a regular web server.\n\nNothing needs to be compiled.\n\n### CORS proxy\n\nOptionally, you can set up a [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) server, for loading images from the web, if you paste a URL into JS Paint, or use the `#load:<URL>` feature with images that are not on the same domain.\n\nBy default it will use a [CORS Anywhere instance](https://jspaint-cors-proxy.herokuapp.com) set up to work with [jspaint.app](https://jspaint.app).\n\nIt is hosted for free on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/),\nand you can set up your own instance and configure it to work with your own domain.\n\nYou'll have to find and replace `https://jspaint-cors-proxy.herokuapp.com` with your own instance URL.\n\n\n### Multiplayer Support\n\nMultiplayer support currently relies on Firebase,\nwhich is not open source software.\n\nYou could create a [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database/web/start) instance and edit JS Paint's `sessions.js` to point to it,\nreplacing the `config` passed to `initializeApp` with the config from the Firebase Console when you set up a Web App.\n\nBut the multiplayer mode is very shoddy so far.\nIt should be replaced with something open source, more secure, more efficient, and more robust.\n\n## Embed in your website\n\n### Simple\n\nAdd this to your HTML:\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://jspaint.app\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></iframe>\n```\n\n#### Start with an image\n\nYou can have it load an image from a URL by adding `#load:<URL>` to the URL.\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://jspaint.app#load:https://jspaint.app/favicon.ico\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></iframe>\n```\n\n### Advanced\n\nIf you want to control JS Paint, how it saves/loads files, or access the canvas directly,\nthere is an unstable API.\n\nFirst you need to [clone the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/),\nso you can point an `iframe` to your local copy.\n\nThe local copy of JS Paint has to be hosted on the same web server as the containing page, or more specifically, it has to share the [same origin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy).\n\nHaving a local copy also means things won't break any time the API changes.\n\nIf JS Paint is cloned to a folder called `jspaint`, which lives in the same folder as the page you want to embed it in, you can use this:\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"jspaint/index.html\" id=\"jspaint-iframe\" width=\"100%\" height=\"100%\"></iframe>\n```\n\nIf it lives somewhere else, you may need to add `../` to the start of the path, to go up a level. For example, `src=\"../../apps/jspaint/index.html\"`.\nYou can also use an absolute URL, like `src=\"https://example.com/cool-apps/jspaint/index.html\"`.\n\n#### Changing how files are saved/loaded\n\nYou can override the file saving and opening dialogs\nwith JS Paint's `systemHooks` API.\n\n```html\n<script>\nvar iframe = document.getElementById(\"jspaint-iframe\");\nvar jspaint = iframe.contentWindow;\n// Wait for systemHooks object to exist (the iframe needs to load)\nwaitUntil(()=> jspaint.systemHooks, 500, ()=> {\n\t// Hook in\n\tjspaint.systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog = async ({ formats, defaultFileName, defaultPath, defaultFileFormatID, getBlob, savedCallbackUnreliable, dialogTitle }) => { ... };\n\tjspaint.systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog = async ({ formats }) => { ... };\n\tjspaint.systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle = async (save_file_handle, blob) => { ... };\n\tjspaint.systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle = async (file_handle) => { ... };\n});\n// General function to wait for a condition to be met, checking at regular intervals\nfunction waitUntil(test, interval, callback) {\n\tif (test()) {\n\t\tcallback();\n\t} else {\n\t\tsetTimeout(waitUntil, interval, test, interval, callback);\n\t}\n}\n</script>\n```\n\nA [Blob](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob) represents the contents of a file in memory.\n\nA file handle is anything that can identify a file.\nYou get to own this concept, and define how to identify files.\nIt could be anything from an index into an array, to a Dropbox file ID, to an IPFS URL, to a file path.\nIt can be any type, or maybe it needs to be a string, I forget.\n\nOnce you have a concept of a file handle, you can implement file pickers using the system hooks, and functions to read and write files.\n\n| Command | Hooks Used |\n| ------- | ---------- |\n| **File > Save As** | [`systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog`][], then when a file is picked, [`systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle`][] |\n| **File > Open** | [`systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog`][], then when a file is picked, [`systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle`][] |\n| **File > Save** | [`systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle`][] (or same as **File > Save As** if there's no file open yet) |\n| **Edit > Copy To** | [`systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog`][], then when a file is picked, [`systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle`][] |\n| **Edit > Paste From** | [`systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog`][], then when a file is picked, [`systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle`][] |\n| **File > Set As Wallpaper (Tiled)** | [`systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled`][] if defined, else [`systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered`][] if defined, else same as **File > Save As** |\n| **File > Set As Wallpaper (Centered)** | [`systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered`][] if defined, else same as **File > Save As** |\n| **Extras > Render History As GIF** | Same as **File > Save As** |\n| **Colors > Save Colors** | Same as **File > Save As** |\n| **Colors > Get Colors** | Same as **File > Open** |\n\n#### Loading a file initially\n\nTo start the app with a file loaded for editing,\nwait for the app to load, then call [`systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle`][] with a file handle, and tell the app to load that file blob.\n\n```js\nconst file_handle = \"initial-file-to-load\";\nsystemHooks.readBlobFromHandle(file_handle).then(file => {\n\tif (file) {\n\t\tcontentWindow.open_from_file(file, file_handle);\n\t}\n}, (error) => {\n\t// Note: in some cases, this handler may not be called, and instead an error message is shown by readBlobFromHandle directly.\n\tcontentWindow.show_error_message(`Failed to open file ${file_handle}`, error);\n});\n```\n\nThis is clumsy, and in the future there may be a query string parameter to load an initial file by its handle.\n(Note to self: it will need to wait for your system hooks to be registered, somehow.)\n\nThere's already a query string parameter to load from a URL:\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://jspaint.app?load:SOME_URL_HERE\"></iframe>\n```\n\nBut this won't set up the file handle for saving.\n\n\n#### Integrating Set as Wallpaper\n\nYou can define two functions to set the wallpaper, which will be used by **File > Set As Wallpaper (Tiled)** and **File > Set As Wallpaper (Centered)**.\n\n- [`systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled`][]` = (canvas) => { ... };`\n- [`systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered`][]` = (canvas) => { ... };`\n\nIf you define only [`systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered`][], JS Paint will attempt to guess your screen's dimensions and tile the image, applying it by calling your [`systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered`][] function.\n\nIf you don't specify [`systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered`][], JS Paint will default to saving a file (`<original file name> wallpaper.png`) using [`systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog`][] and [`systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle`][].\n\nHere's a full example supporting a persistent custom wallpaper as a background on the containing page:\n\n```js\nconst wallpaper = document.querySelector(\"body\"); // or some other element\n\njspaint.systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered = (canvas) => {\n\tcanvas.toBlob((blob) => {\n\t\tsetDesktopWallpaper(blob, \"no-repeat\", true);\n\t});\n};\njspaint.systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled = (canvas) => {\n\tcanvas.toBlob((blob) => {\n\t\tsetDesktopWallpaper(blob, \"repeat\", true);\n\t});\n};\n\nfunction setDesktopWallpaper(file, repeat, saveToLocalStorage) {\n\tconst blob_url = URL.createObjectURL(file);\n\twallpaper.style.backgroundImage = `url(${blob_url})`;\n\twallpaper.style.backgroundRepeat = repeat;\n\twallpaper.style.backgroundPosition = \"center\";\n\twallpaper.style.backgroundSize = \"auto\";\n\tif (saveToLocalStorage) {\n\t\tconst fileReader = new FileReader();\n\t\tfileReader.onload = () => {\n\t\t\tlocalStorage.setItem(\"wallpaper-data-url\", fileReader.result);\n\t\t\tlocalStorage.setItem(\"wallpaper-repeat\", repeat);\n\t\t};\n\t\tfileReader.onerror = () => {\n\t\t\tconsole.error(\"Error reading file (for setting wallpaper)\", file);\n\t\t};\n\t\tfileReader.readAsDataURL(file);\n\t}\n}\n\n// Initialize the wallpaper from localStorage, if it exists\ntry {\n\tconst wallpaper_data_url = localStorage.getItem(\"wallpaper-data-url\");\n\tconst wallpaper_repeat = localStorage.getItem(\"wallpaper-repeat\");\n\tif (wallpaper_data_url) {\n\t\tfetch(wallpaper_data_url).then(response => response.blob()).then(file => {\n\t\t\tsetDesktopWallpaper(file, wallpaper_repeat, false);\n\t\t});\n\t}\n} catch (error) {\n\tconsole.error(error);\n}\n```\n\nIt's a little bit recursive, sorry; it could probably be done simpler.\nLike by just using data URLs. (Actually, I think I wanted to use blob URLs just so that it doesn't bloat the DOM inspector with a super long URL. Which is really a devtools UX bug. Maybe they've improved this?)\n\n#### Specifying the canvas size\n\nYou can load a file that has the desired dimensions.\nThere's no special API for this at the moment.\n\nSee [Loading a file initially](#loading-a-file-initially).\n\n#### Specifying the theme\n\nYou could change the theme programmatically:\n\n```js\nvar iframe = document.getElementById(\"jspaint-iframe\");\nvar jspaint = iframe.contentWindow;\njspaint.set_theme(\"modern.css\");\n```\nbut this will break the user preference.\n\nThe **Extras > Themes** menu will still work, but the preference won't persist when reloading the page.\n\nIn the future there may be a query string parameter to specify the default theme. You could also fork jspaint to change the default theme.\n\n#### Specifying the language\n\nSimilar to the theme, you can try to change the language programmatically:\n\n```js\nvar iframe = document.getElementById(\"jspaint-iframe\");\nvar jspaint = iframe.contentWindow;\njspaint.set_language(\"ar\");\n```\nbut this will actually **ask the user to reload the application** to change languages.\n\nThe **Extras > Language** menu will still work, but the user will be bothered to change the language every time they reload the page.\n\nIn the future there may be a query string parameter to specify the default language. You could also fork jspaint to change the default language.\n\n#### Adding custom menus\n\nNot supported yet.\nYou could fork jspaint and add your own menus.\n\n#### Accessing the canvas directly\n\nWith access to the canvas, you can implement a live preview of your drawing, for example updating a texture in a game engine in realtime.\n\n```js\nvar iframe = document.getElementById(\"jspaint-iframe\");\n// contentDocument here refers to the webpage loaded in the iframe, not the image document loaded in jspaint.\n// We're just reaching inside the iframe to get the canvas.\nvar canvas = iframe.contentDocument.querySelector(\".main-canvas\");\n```\n\nIt's recommended **not** to use this for loading a document, as it won't change the document title, or reset undo/redo history, among other things.\nInstead use [`open_from_file`][].\n\n#### Performing custom actions\n\nIf you want to make buttons or other UI to do things to the document, you should (probably) make it undoable.\nIt's very easy, just wrap your action in a call to [`undoable`][].\n\n```js\nvar iframe = document.getElementById(\"jspaint-iframe\");\nvar jspaint = iframe.contentWindow;\nvar icon = new Image();\nicon.src = \"some-folder/some-image-15x11-pixels.png\";\njspaint.undoable({\n\tname: \"Seam Carve\",\n\ticon: icon, // optional\n}, function() {\n\t// do something to the canvas\n});\n```\n\n#### <a href=\"#systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog\" id=\"systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog\">async function `systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog({ formats, defaultFileName, defaultPath, defaultFileFormatID, getBlob, savedCallbackUnreliable, dialogTitle })`</a>\n[`systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog`]: #systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog\n\nDefine this function to override the default save dialog.\nThis is used both for saving images, as well as palette files, and animations.\n\nArguments:\n- `formats`: an array of objects representing types of files, with the following properties:\n\t- `formatID`: a string that uniquely identifies the format (may be the same as `mimeType`)\n\t- `mimeType` (optional): the file format's designated [media type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type), e.g. `\"image/png\"` (palette formats do not have this property)\n\t- `name`: the file format's name, e.g. `\"WebP\"`\n\t- `nameWithExtensions`: the file format's name followed by a list of extensions, e.g. `\"TIFF (*.tif;*.tiff)\"`\n\t- `extensions`: an array of file extensions, excluding the dot, with the preferred extension first, e.g. `[\"bmp\", \"dib\"]`\n- `defaultFileName` (optional): a suggested file name, e.g. `\"Untitled.png\"` or the name of an open document.\n- `defaultPath` (optional): a file handle for a document that was opened, so you can save to the same folder easily. Misnomer: this may not be a path, it depends on how you define file handles.\n- `defaultFileFormatID` (optional): the `formatID` of a file format to select by default.\n- `async function getBlob(formatID)`: a function you call to get a file in one of the supported formats. It takes a `formatID` and returns a `Promise` that resolves with a `Blob` representing the file contents to save.\n- `function savedCallbackUnreliable({ newFileName, newFileFormatID, newFileHandle, newBlob })` (optional): a function you call when the user has saved the file. The `newBlob` should come from `getBlob(newFileFormatID)`.\n- `dialogTitle` (optional): a title for the save dialog.\n\nNote the inversion of control here:\nJS Paint calls your `systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog` function, and then you call JS Paint's `getBlob` function.\nOnce `getBlob` resolves, you can call the `savedCallbackUnreliable` function which is defined by JS Paint.\n(Hopefully I can clarify this in the future.)\n\nAlso note that this function is responsible for saving the file, not just picking a save location.\nYou may reuse your `systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle` function if it's helpful.\n\n#### <a href=\"#systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog\" id=\"systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog\">async function `systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog({ formats })`</a>\n[`systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog`]: #systemHooks.showOpenFileDialog\n\nDefine this function to override the default open dialog.\nThis is used for opening images and palettes.\n\nArguments:\n- `formats`: same as `systemHooks.showSaveFileDialog`\n\nNote that this function is responsible for loading the contents of the file, not just picking a file.\nYou may reuse your `systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle` function if it's helpful.\n\n#### <a href=\"#systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle\" id=\"systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle\">async function `systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle(fileHandle, blob)`</a>\n[`systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle`]: #systemHooks.writeBlobToHandle\n\nDefine this function to tell JS Paint how to save a file.\n\nArguments:\n- `fileHandle`: a file handle, as defined by your system, representing the file to write to.\n- `blob`: a `Blob` representing the file contents to save.\n\nReturns:\n- `Promise` that resolves with `true` if the file was definitely saved successfully, `false` if an error occurred or the user canceled, or `undefined` if it is not known whether the file was saved successfully, as is the case with file downloading with `<a href=\"...\" download=\"...\">`. The promise should not reject; errors should be handled by showing an error message and returning `false`.\n\n#### <a href=\"#systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle\" id=\"systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle\">async function `systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle(fileHandle)`</a>\n[`systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle`]: #systemHooks.readBlobFromHandle\n\nDefine this function to tell JS Paint how to load a file.\n\nArguments:\n- `fileHandle`: a file handle, as defined by your system, representing the file to read from.\n\n#### <a href=\"#systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled\" id=\"systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled\">function `systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled(canvas)`</a>\n[`systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled`]: #systemHooks.setWallpaperTiled\n\nDefine this function to tell JS Paint how to set the wallpaper. See [Integrating Set as Wallpaper](#integrating-set-as-wallpaper) for an example.\n\nArguments:\n- `canvas`: a `HTMLCanvasElement` with the image to set as the wallpaper.\n\n#### <a href=\"#systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered\" id=\"systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered\">function `systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered(canvas)`</a>\n[`systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered`]: #systemHooks.setWallpaperCentered\n\nDefine this function to tell JS Paint how to set the wallpaper. See [Integrating Set as Wallpaper](#integrating-set-as-wallpaper) for an example.\n\nArguments:\n- `canvas`: a `HTMLCanvasElement` with the image to set as the wallpaper.\n\n#### <a href=\"#undoable\" id=\"undoable\">function `undoable({ name, icon }, actionFunction)`</a>\n[`undoable`]: #undoable\n\nUse this to make an action undoable.\n\nThis function takes a snapshot of the canvas, and some other state, and then calls the `actionFunction` function.\nIt creates an entry in the history so it can be undone.\n\nArguments:\n- `name`: a name for the action, e.g. `\"Brush\"` or `\"Rotate Image 270°\"`\n- `icon` (optional): an `Image` to display in the History window. It is recommended to be 15x11 pixels.\n- `actionFunction`: a function that takes no arguments, and modifies the canvas.\n\n#### <a href=\"#show_error_message\" id=\"show_error_message\">function `show_error_message(message, [error])`</a>\n[`show_error_message`]: #show_error_message\n\nUse this to show an error message dialog box, optionally with expandable error details.\n\nArguments:\n- `message`: plain text to show in the dialog box.\n- `error` (optional): an `Error` object to show in the dialog box, collapsed by default in a \"Details\" expandable section.\n\n#### <a href=\"#open_from_file\" id=\"open_from_file\">function `open_from_file(blob, source_file_handle)`</a>\n[`open_from_file`]: #open_from_file\n\nUse this to load a file into the app.\n\nArguments:\n- `blob`: a `Blob` object representing the file to load.\n- `source_file_handle`: a *corresponding* file handle for the file, as defined by your system.\n\nSorry for the quirky API.\nThe API is new, and parts of it have not been designed at all. This was just a hack that I came to depend on, reaching into the internals of JS Paint to load a file.\nI decided to document it as the first version of the API, since I'll want a changelog when upgrading my usage of it anyways.\n\n#### <a href=\"#set_theme\" id=\"set_theme\">function `set_theme(theme_file_name)`</a>\n[`set_theme`]: #set_theme\n\nUse this to change the look of the application.\n\nArguments:\n- `theme_file_name`: the name of the theme file to load, one of:\n\t- `\"classic.css\"`: the Windows98 theme.\n\t- `\"dark.css\"`: the Dark theme.\n\t- `\"modern.css\"`: the Modern theme.\n\t- `\"winter.css\"`: the festive Winter theme.\n\t- `\"occult.css\"`: a Satanic theme.\n\n#### <a href=\"#set_language\" id=\"set_language\">function `set_language(language_code)`</a>\n[`set_language`]: #set_language\n\nYou can kind of use this to change the language of the application. But actually it will show a prompt to the user to change the language, because the application needs to reload to apply the change.\nAnd if that dialog isn't in the right language, well, they'll probably be confused.\n\nArguments:\n- `language_code`: the language code to use, e.g. `\"en\"` for English, `\"zh\"` for Traditional Chinese, `\"zh-simplified\"` for Simplified Chinese, etc.\n\n#### Changelog\n\nThe API will change a lot, but changes will be documented in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\n\nNot just a history of changes, but a migration/upgrading guide. <!-- These are some Ctrl+F keywords. -->\n\nFor general project news, click **Extras > Project News** in the app.\n\n## License\n\nJS Paint is free and open source software, licensed under the permissive [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\n\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n[![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/1j01/jspaint?label=GitHub%20Stars&style=social)](https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/stargazers)\n[![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/1j01/jspaint?style=social)](https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/network/members)\n\n"

This is not possible with `.png` files. Microsoft Edge also apparently requires `.cur` files for custom cursors. I already have `.cur` files in the repo for the modern theme (unused), and extracted (outside the repo) for the classic theme. I just need to copy them, rename them semantically, use them, and do some testing to see if format fallbacks work as expected.\n\n### Extended editing\n\n* Optional fill tolerance (slider that you enable from a settings menu?)\n\n* Transparency\n\t* Color opacity slider\n\t* Toggle between blend and copy (overwrite) modes\n\t* Maybe equivalize any rgba(X, X, X, 0) in fill algorithm?\n\tThere'd still be the possibility of 1/255th opacity pixels,\n\tbut if you're creating colors from the combination of a color picker and an opacity slider,\n\tyou might naturally introduce differing zero-opacity color values a lot.\n\n* Documents with multiple sub-images\n\t* Component to switch between sub-images\n\t* Handle undo/redo for sub-images\n\t* Animated GIFs\n\t\t* Transparency ([jnordberg/gif.js issue #5](https://github.com/jnordberg/gif.js/issues/5))\n\t* Animated Transparent APNGs\n\t\t* APNG Library: [UPNG.js](https://github.com/photopea/UPNG.js/) (already used for loading/saving PNGs)\n\t* Multi-size Icons\n\t\t* Windows ICO ([jBinary can read](https://jdataview.github.io/jBinary.Repo/demo/#ico) and presumably write ICO files)\n\t\t* Mac ICNS\n\t* Layered images\n\t\t* Photoshop PSD ([via psd.js](https://github.com/samccone/psd.js)\n\t\t* OpenRaster ORA ([via ora.js](https://github.com/zsgalusz/ora.js))\n\t* Paged Images\n\t\t* PDF (via [pdf.js](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js)) (single page already supported)\n\t\t* DjVu (via [djvu.js](https://djvu.js.org/))\n\t\t* TIFF (via [utif.js](https://github.com/photopea/UTIF.js/)) (single page/frame already supported)\n\n* Online (multi-user) and local (single-user) sessions\n\t* See [sessions.js](src/sessions.js)\n\t* Issues\n\t\t* There's no conflict resolution; user edits revert other user edits\n\t\t* It's not eventually consistent\n\t\t* Cursors from other users that go outside the parent can cause the page to be scrollable\n\n* Symmetry, tesselation, painting texture on 3D models, and even an infinite canvas, all could be done with a shared system \n\t* For symmetry and tesselation, [geometry can be generated](), and then it can work the same as painting on a 3D model\n\t* An infinite canvas engine would generate simple square geometry, but would require support for multiple editable textures (also useful for 3D models)\n\t\t* And of course layers and animations and multi-size icons need a similar system (multiple sub-images)\n\t* For 3D model painting, it's important to note there's a few different possible approaches.\n\t\t1. UV-dynamic, like [Chameleon](https://www-ui.is.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~takeo/chameleon/chameleon.htm) & [Chameleon.js](https://tomtung.github.io/chameleon.js/) (can adapt texture resolution as you paint)\n\t\t2. UV-static\n\t\t\t1. Ray tracing the pointer to find texture coordinates (gives texture coordinate space scaled result by default)\n\t\t\t2. Screen-space drawing (gives screen space scaled result by default); I saw a good medium post or two about this\n\t* Also, some approaches might not extend to tesselation and symmetry. [\"Very important, this means that we assume our uv has no overlapping triangles. So no \\[tileable\\] textures.\"](https://shahriyarshahrabi.medium.com/mesh-texture-painting-in-unity-using-shaders-8eb7fc31221c)\n\t* Existing 3D texturing systems:\n\t\t* Closed source project: https://discourse.threejs.org/t/a-fully-fledged-texture-painter-for-the-web/15678/16\n\t\t* Open source project with adaptive UVs: https://tomtung.github.io/chameleon.js/\n\t\t* Open source project with adaptive and static UV modes, for both painting and sculpting: https://github.com/stephomi/sculptgl (check Dynamic Topology > Activated)\n\n* Save text and record transformations so the image can be saved as\nSVG (or HTML?) with invisible selectable transformed text elements?\n\t* Every time you move a selection, duplicate the text and create a clip-path for both parts?\n\t\t* Make only one of them audible for screen-readers\n\n\n### Device support\n\n* Prevent text selection in buttons and history entries\n* Enlarge menus on touch devices\n* Enlarge window titlebar close buttons on touch devices\n* Magnifier: on touchscreens, wait until pointerup to zoom\n\t* To detect touchscreen usage, could keep track of whether the last pointermove had any buttons pressed... or use `pointerType`, right?\n* Alternative way to access \"Color Eraser\" feature without a secondary mouse button?\n* Alternative access to functionality that would normally require a keyboard (with a numpad!)\n\t* Numpad +/-: Increase/Decrease brush size, Double/Halve selection size, ...\n\t* Shift toggles a handful of things (could have one toggle button renamed contextually?):\n\t\t* Proportional Resize\n\t\t* Smear / Trail Selection\n\t\t* Snap to 8 directions\n\t\t\t* An isometric mode would also be good\n\t* Ctrl+Select: \"Crop To Selection\" menu option\n* Don't drag toolbars out into windows with touch, it's too easy to do accidentally\n\n### Tools\n\n* Select and Free-Form Select\n\t* Passive: create no undoables until you do something like move or invert the selection\n\t\t* You should be able to make a selection, then change the secondary color, then drag the selection cutting it out with the color you selected\n\t\t* Select and deselect with no actions in between should create no undoables\n\t* Proportionally resize selection while holding Shift\n\t\t* (or maybe by default? I feel like it should be the default, tbh.)\n\n\n* Text\n\t* If it would go over the edge of the canvas, reject the input (at least, that's what mspaint does)\n\t* Add padding left to text area when font has glyphs that extend left, like italic 'f' in Times New Roman\n\t\t* mspaint has access to font metrics\n\t\t* jspaint could render text to see when it would overflow\n\t\t\t* To do it efficiently,\n\t\t\t\t* Take all glyphs in the text\n\t\t\t\t\t* (And maybe a set of common letters like the alphabet)\n\t\t\t\t\t* Split with a library to handle Unicode (emojis etc.)\n\t\t\t\t* Uniquify\n\t\t\t\t* Place them *all on top of each other*, positioned absolutely, leaving room to the left of them to detect pixels\n\t\t\t\t* Scan the pixels at the left to find the maximum extent left\n\t\t\t\t* Could store, per font, what glyphs have been tested and what's the maximum extent detected, in order to not have to rerender these\n\t\t\t\t\t* \"What glyphs have been tested\" should be specific to font size and attributes, since an italic 'f' may extend more than a normal 'f' for instance\n\t* Store position of FontBox\n\n\n* Shape Styles\n\t* Shapes: respond to Ctrl (It's complicated)\n\t* Patterns (black and white mode, winter theme)\n\t\t* Check to make sure patterns are aligned properly for all the tools\n\t\t* There's supposed to be a mapping between color values and pattern fills, used by the text tool and for the palette when switching between modes (colors should be kept between going to black and white mode and back)\n\n\n### Desktop App (Electron)\n\nElectron boilerplate stuff:\n\n* Remember window position/state\n* Set up autoupdating\n* Keep window hidden until loaded (`show: false`, [`ready-to-show`](https://electronjs.org/docs/api/browser-window#event-ready-to-show))\n\nSecurity:\n\n* Context isolation\n* Disable multiplayer?? should be fine\n\nFunctionality:\n\n* Subwindows as separate windows\n* Document recovery without having to know about File > Manage Storage - pop up contextually with a dialog when you need it\n* Show link URLs when you hover over them, in the status bar (because we have a status bar! haha) (there's this API: [event: update-target-url](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/web-contents.md#event-update-target-url), which gave me the idea, or it could be implemented with mouse events)\n* Recent files (could also be implemented for 98.js.org in the future)\n* macOS:\n\t* `win.setSheetOffset` with the menu bar height\n* Windows: maybe handle `session-end` event and ask to save?\n* Detect if file changes on disk, ask if you want to reload it?\n\n### Also\n\n* Anything marked `@TODO` or `@FIXME` in the source code\n\n\n* See [Issues on GitHub](https://github.com/1j01/jspaint/issues)\n\n\n* CSS\n\t* DRY, especially button styles, with [os-gui](https://github.com/1j01/os-gui)\n\t* Clearer `z-index` handling, maybe with CSS variables?\n\n\n* JS\n\t* Organize things into files better; \"functions.js\" is like ONE step above saying \"code.js\"\n\t* `$ToolWindow` has a `$Button` facility; `$DialogWindow` overrides it with essentially a better one; now there's `showMessageBox` too! and `$ToolWindow` is a wrapper for OS-GUI's `$Window`, and should be removed at some point; btw, should `show_error_message` functionality be folded into `showMessageBox`?\n\t* Make code clearer / improve code quality\n\t\t* https://codeclimate.com/github/1j01/jspaint\n\n\n* Images\n\t* Use a shared sprite sheet per theme (and optimize it I guess)\n"

theme!\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tOffice software has never looked so refined, as with the Bubblegum theme's elegant\n\t\t\t\t<em><span style=\"\n\t\t\t\t\tfont-family: cursive;\n\t\t\t\t\tfont-style: italic;\n\t\t\t\t\ttransform: skewX(-10deg);\n\t\t\t\t\tdisplay: inline-block;\n\t\t\t\t\t/*background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #a090c6, #efa9d3); background-clip:

scheme.</em>\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tAll the icons in this theme were <strong>AI-generated</strong>, as an experiment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tCurrent mainstream AI technology really struggles at creating a full set of icons in one go,\n\t\t\t\tand the style is always a little bit different from image to image,\n\t\t\t\tso the process involved generating many, many images,\n\t\t\t\tusually prompting it to create an \"icon set\" in order to <em>hopefully</em> get a few icons that match,\n\t\t\t\tto add to the overall icon set.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThere's very little control, and things often come out wonky or overly generic,\n\t\t\t\tbut overall it takes very little effort,\n\t\t\t\tso it's a strange thing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tLuckily, I could get away with some stylistic differences between\n\t\t\t\tthe abstract shape icons and the more detailed tool icons.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tI hand-edited a few of the icons, but they're mostly as they came out of the AI.\n\t\t\t\tMy favorite is the Eye Gaze Mode pause button icon (<img alt=\"an eye\"\n\t\t\t\t\tsrc=\"images/bubblegum/eye-gaze-unpause-128x128.png\"\n\t\t\t\t\tstyle=\"vertical-align: middle; width: 1em; height: 1em;\" />),\n\t\t\t\twhich I got for free randomly due to the AI misinterpreting \"eye dropper\".\n\t\t\t\tI love the way it blends seamlessly into the button.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThe 3D bevels are also AI-generated, applied with copious usage of 9-slice borders.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<h3>Try The New Theme</h3>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t<!-- <img src=\"help/onestep.gif\"> -->\n\t\t\t\tOn the <b>Extras</b> menu, click <b>Themes</b>, then <b>Bubblegum</b>.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThe icons aren't optimized for legibility at small sizes,\n\t\t\t\tso be sure to try it out together with <b>Extras > Eye Gaze Mode</b>,\n\t\t\t\tor else increase your browser's zoom level,\n\t\t\t\tby scrolling the mouse wheel while holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>⌘</kbd>,\n\t\t\t\tfor the full effect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<h2>Maintenance</h2>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tIn other news, I've been investing a lot into making JS Paint more maintainable.\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tYou won't see these changes in the app directly,\n\t\t\t\tbut they help make the code more <em>malleable</em>,\n\t\t\t\tlike adding water to clay to shape it without breaking it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<ul>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tConverted the codebase almost entirely to <strong>ES Modules</strong>.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tMade remaining usage of <strong>global variables explicit</strong> in each file.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tSplit up some huge files into <strong>smaller files</strong>.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>\n\t\t\t\t\tAdded <strong>type annotations</strong> to the codebase, using JSDoc comments.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis way errors can be spotted earlier, and editors can provide better autocompletion,\n\t\t\t\t\tall while keeping the code in plain JavaScript, with no compile step.\n\t\t\t\t</li>\n\t\t\t</ul>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tThese changes will make it easier to add cool new features to JS Paint in the future.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<!-- \n\t\t\t(It's \"JS Paint\", not \"TS Paint\", after all!)\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\tP.S. <strong>Fun fact</strong>: ECMAScript (ES) is a synonym for JavaScript (JS),\n\t\t\t\twhich is a completely different language from Java.\n\t\t\t\tThe more you know!\n\t\t\t\tAlso, TypeScript (TS) is a superset of JavaScript, and the TypeScript compiler (tsc)\n\t\t\t\tcan be used to check JavaScript code for type errors, not just compile TypeScript code.\n\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t\t\t(It's not \"ES Paint\", but it <em>could have been</em>,\n\t\t\t\tand then I could have designed a logo with a rotated 'M' to make it an 'E'.\n\t\t\t\tMissed opportunity?? 🤔)\n\t\t\t</p> -->\n\t\t</article>\n\t\t<article class=\"news-entry\"
