Below you will find useful information for contributing including how to setup the library, how to work with it in development, and how to commit.\n\nIs this your first Pull Request on GitHub? Learn more by reading [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\nWant to know where you can help? Check out our [active issues](https://github.com/styled-components/polished/issues) for places to start.\n\n**Important** - Have an idea for a new module? Please file an issue first as we use these issues to gauge interest in any particular feature. The nature of `✨ polished` means we could almost include anything, so this helps us narrow our focus. If you submit a PR directly for a new feature, without a corresponding issue, that PR will be closed.\n\nPlease note that this project is released with a Contributor [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.\n\n## Setup\n`✨ polished` supports both `npm` and `yarn`. If using `yarn` just substitute the below commands with the `yarn` equivalent.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\n## Development\n\nHere are some useful commands for development:\n\n- Run tests via `npm test`.\n- Update Jest snapshots via `npm test -- -u`.\n- Rebuild library and docs with every change via `npm run build:watch`\n- Serve the docs locally via `npm run docs`.\n\n## Committing\n\n`✨ polished` uses [`semantic-release`](https://npmjs.com/package/semantic-release) to do automatic releases and generate a changelog based on the commit history. In order for this to work, we follow [this convention][convention] for commit messages.\n\n`commitizen` is installed to help you follow [this convention][convention].\n\nOnce you are ready to commit your changes, just use the following commands:\n\n1. `git add <files to be committed>`\n2. `git cz`\n\nThen you just simply follow the prompts to craft your commit message.\n\n[convention]: https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog-angular/blob/ed32559941719a130bb0327f886d6a32a8cbc2ba/convention.md\n"

Need a consistent color palette throughout your app? `✨ polished` is for you!\n\n- **Make your app look great without stress**\n- **Cross framework compatible**: No matter if you're using [`styled-components`](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components), emotion, jss, aphrodite, radium, or plain inline styles, as long as you're writing your styles in JavaScript you can use polished!\n- **Switching from a pre-processor to styles in JS made easy**\n\n## Docs\n\n**See the full documentation at [polished.js.org](http://polished.js.org/docs)!**\n\n## Usage\n\n`✨ polished` modules are meant to be used as stand-alone imports. You should avoid importing the entire library directly:\n\n`import { clearFix, animation } from 'polished'`\n~`import * as polished from 'polished`~\n~`import polished from 'polished'`~\n\nWhen `✨ polished` modules are imported properly, tree shaking in [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/) and [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup#tree-shaking) can be leveraged to reduce your bundle size.\n\n## Browser Support\nAll Evergreen Browsers + IE11\n\nAs of v3.6.X we support `>0.5%, not dead, ie >= 11, not op_mini all` for all our builds.\n\n## Flow Type Definitions\n\n`✨ polished` has first-class [Flow](https://flow.org/) support with zero configuration to assist you in finding type errors while using our modules.\n\n### Ignore ✨ polished source\n\nFlow frequently updates and it is possible that the version you are running may cause you to run into errors coming from the `polished` package in your `node_modules` directory. You can add the following lines to your `.flowconfig` to ignore `polished` in those cases:\n\n```bash\n[ignore]\n.*/node_modules/polished/.*\n```\n\n## TypeScript Definitions\n\n`✨ polished` has [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) definitions to allow the library to be used in any TypeScript project. You will need to set `moduleResolution` to `node` in your `tsconfig.json` in order to use `✨ polished` with TypeScript.\n\n### Babel plugin\n\nYou can optionally also use [`babel-plugin-polished`](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-polished) to compile the static function calls out and remove the (already tiny) runtime performance impact of using `✨ polished`.\n\n### Object Spread Properties\n\nIn the documentation you will see examples using [object spread properties](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) (`{ ...other }`). To enable this syntax in your project add the [`transform-object-rest-spread` plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-transform-object-rest-spread) (or the [`stage-3` preset](https://babeljs.io/docs/plugins/preset-stage-3/) to enable all stage three features) to your Babel configuration.\n\n## Why?\n\nWhen writing styles in JavaScript, many people need Sass-style helper functions to be productive. `✨ polished` brings them to you in a nice, lightweight package tailor-made for styles in JavaScript.\n\nThe main difference with Sass is that it's written in a functional style and all color functions are curried. This means you can compose them together into your own reusable helpers with a `compose` function of your choice:\n\n```JS\nimport { compose } from 'ramda' // Replace with any compose() function of your choice\nimport { lighten, desaturate } from 'polished'\n\n// Create tone() helper\nconst tone = compose(lighten(0.1), desaturate(0.1))\n```\n\n### Why not `package-xyz`?\n\nFirst of all, we didn't find another library that had everything we needed, and we don't care about installing a dozen packages separately.\n\nSpecifically most other packages that provide color functions do so in an object-oriented style, often with a fluent API that's very different from the Sass-style helpers. This means people that aren't very familiar with JavaScript might shy away from using them.\n\n`✨ polished` was made as a standard library for everybody, no matter if they know JS inside out or not.\n\n## Compatibility\n\n✨ polished is **compatible with any library that accepts styles as JS objects**. This includes, but is by far not limited to, `styled-components`, radium, aphrodite, glamor, glamorous, jss and many more!\n\nNo matter if you're using [inline styles or CSS-in-JS](http://mxstbr.blog/2016/11/inline-styles-vs-css-in-js/), polished is for you.\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
