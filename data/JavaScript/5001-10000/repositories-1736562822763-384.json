For example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"memory\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAdditional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"filesystem\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem\", \"/path/to/allowed/files\"]\n    },\n    \"git\": {\n      \"command\": \"uvx\",\n      \"args\": [\"mcp-server-git\", \"--repository\", \"path/to/git/repo\"]\n    },\n    \"github\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-github\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN\": \"<YOUR_TOKEN>\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"postgres\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres\", \"postgresql://localhost/mydb\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## 🛠️ Creating Your Own Server\n\nInterested in creating your own MCP server?
