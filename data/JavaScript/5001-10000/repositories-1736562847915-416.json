[good first issue](https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) has extra information to help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) are issues suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after your first pull request.\n\nSometimes, these labels will be fine. That's ok! There is likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you don't know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can reach out to us via  [Discord](https://discord.gg/4QWgSz4hTC) or [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster/discussions), and we will help you find something.\n\nOnce you see an issue you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying you want to work on it. Something like \"I want to work on this\" is fine.\n\n## Ask for Help\n\nThe best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:\n\n* The original GitHub issue\n* The [Discord](https://discord.gg/4QWgSz4hTC) community\n* Our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster/discussions)\n\n## Pull Request Lifecycle\n\nBefore you start, please ensure no one else is working on the same issue. If a related pull request exists, we would appreciate your help. If you don't get a response within a reasonable timeframe, you can proceed with your pull request.\n\nAfter you've submitted your pull request, it enters the review stage. During this time, the project maintainers or contributors will examine your changes. They might request modifications, such as:\n\n- Enhancements in your code\n- Additional tests or updates to the documentation\n- Changes in your implementation approach\n- Dividing your pull request into smaller, more manageable parts\n\nDepending on the project's roadmap and priorities, you might also be asked to:\n\n- Delay the integration of your pull request to align with future releases\n- Close your current pull request and, if needed, open a new one with revised changes\n\n## Development Environment Setup\n\nSee our [Development environment setup](https://github.com/fonoster/fonoster/tree/main/docs/self-hosting) guide to get started locally.\n\n## Sign your Commits\n\n### DCO\n\nLicensing is important to open-source projects. It assures that the software will continue to be available based on the terms that the author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to our project's repositories. The [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) is a way to certify that you wrote and have the right to contribute the code you are submitting to the project.\n\nYou sign off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must match the git user and email associated with the commit.\n\n```text\nThis is my commit message\n\nSigned-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>\n```\n\nGit has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:\n\n```text\ngit commit -s -m 'chore: this is my commit message'\n```\n\nYou can amend your commit with the sign-off by running if you forgot to do this and have yet to push your changes to the remote repository. \n\n```text\ngit commit --amend -s\n```\n\nPlease note that our commit messages use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).\n\n## Pull Request Checklist\n\nWhen you submit your pull request or push new commits, our automated systems will run some checks on your new code. We require that your pull request passes these checks, but we also have more criteria than just that before we can accept and merge it. We recommend that you check the following things locally before you submit your code:\n\n- [ ] Your code builds and passes tests locally\n- [ ] Your code passes our automated checks\n- [ ] You have signed your commits\n- [ ] You have added tests for your code (if applicable)\n- [ ] You have updated the documentation (if applicable)\n"

This platform is free to start and offers a comprehensive experience of what Fonoster can do.\n> \n> **Installation Advisory**: Please note that the current installation process for Fonoster is complex. We are actively working to simplify this process. We recommend waiting for our upcoming v0.9.x release before attempting a direct installation. We are working to offer a more user-friendly installation experience.\n>\n>Thank you for your interest in Fonoster. We are committed to enhancing your experience with every release.\n\n## Features \n\nThe most notable features of Fonoster 0.4 are:\n\n- [x] Multitenancy\n- [x] Easy deployment of PBX functionalities\n- [x] Programmable Voice Applications\n- [x] NodeJS SDK\n- [x] Support for Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)\n- [x] Secure API endpoints with Let's Encrypt\n- [x] Authentication with OAuth2\n- [X] Authentication with JWT \n- [x] Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)\n- [x] Plugins-based Command-line Tool\n- [x] Support for Google Speech APIs\n\n## Code Examples\n\nA Voice Application is a server that takes control of the flow in a call. A Voice Application can use any combination of the following verbs:\n\n- `Answer` - Accepts an incoming call\n- `Hangup` - Closes the call\n- `Play` - Takes a URL or file and streams the sound back to the calling party\n- `Say` - Takes a text, synthesizes the text into audio, and streams back the result\n- `Gather` - Waits for DTMF or speech events and returns back the result\n- `SGather` - Returns a stream for future DTMF and speech results\n- `Dial` - Passes the call to an Agent or a Number at the PSTN\n- `Record` - It records the voice of the calling party and saves the audio on the Storage sub-system\n- `Mute` - It tells the channel to stop sending media, effectively muting the channel\n- `Unmute` - It tells the channel to allow media flow\n\nVoice Application Example:\n\n```typescript\nconst VoiceServer = require(\"@fonoster/voice\").default;\nconst { \n  GatherSource, \n  VoiceRequest, \n  VoiceResponse \n} = require(\"@fonoster/voice\");\n\nnew VoiceServer().listen(async (req: VoiceRequest, voice: VoiceResponse) => {\n  const { ingressNumber, sessionRef, appRef } = req;\n\n  await voice.answer();\n\n  await voice.say(\"Hi there! What's your name?\");\n\n  const { speech: name } = await res.gather({\n    source: GatherSource.SPEECH\n  });\n\n  await voice.say(\"Nice to meet you \" + name + \"!\");\n\n  await voice.say(\"Please enter your 4 digit pin.\");\n\n  const { digits } = await voice.gather({\n    maxDigits: 4,\n    finishOnKey: \"#\"\n  });\n\n  await voice.say(\"Your pin is \" + digits);\n\n  await voice.hangup();\n});\n\n// Your app will live at tcp://127.0.0.1:50061 \n// and you can easily publish it to the Internet with:\n// ngrok tcp 50061\n```\n\nEverything in Fonoster is an API first, and initiating a call is no exception. You can use the SDK to start a call with a few lines of code.\n\nExample of originating a call with the SDK:\n\n```typescript\nconst SDK = require(\"@fonoster/sdk\");\n\nasync function main(request) {\n  const apiKey = \"your-api-key\";\n  const apiSecret = \"your-api-secret\"\n  const accessKeyId = \"WO00000000000000000000000000000000\";\n\n  const client = SDK.Client({ accessKeyId });\n  await client.loginWithApiKey(apiKey, apiSecret);\n\n  const calls = new SDK.Calls(client);\n  const response = await calls.createCall(request);\n\n  console.log(response); // successful response\n}\n\nconst request = {\n  from: \"+18287854037\",\n  to: \"+17853178070\",\n  appRef: \"3e61ecb7-a1b6-4a93-84c3-4f1979165bca\"\n};\n\nmain(request).catch(console.error);\n```\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo get started with Fonoster, use the following resources:\n\n- [Deploying Fonoster with Docker](./docs/self-hosting/deploy-with-docker.md)\n- [Guide for Early Access User](./docs/early-access/overview.md)\n- [Getting started with Fonoster](https://fonoster.com/docs/overview/)\n- [How we created an open-source alternative to Twilio and why it matters](https://dev.to/fonoster/how-we-created-an-open-source-alternative-to-twilio-and-why-it-matters-434g)\n\n## Give a Star! ⭐\n\nPlease give it a star if you like this project or plan to use it.
