Here's how you can help.\n\n\n## Bugs reports\n\nA bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the\nrepository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful – thank you!\n\nGuidelines for bug reports:\n\n1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been\n   reported.\n\n2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the\n   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.\n\n3. **Isolate the problem** &mdash; ideally create a reduced test\n   case and a live example.\n\n4. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific\n   information about the environment – operating system and version, browser\n   and version, version of Flight – and steps required to reproduce the issue.\n\n\n## Feature requests & contribution enquiries\n\nFeature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea\nfits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong\ncase for the inclusion of your feature. Please provide as much detail and\ncontext as possible.\n\nContribution enquiries should take place before any significant pull request,\notherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that we might\nhave good reasons for rejecting.\n\n\n## Pull requests\n\nGood pull requests&mdash;patches, improvements, new features&mdash;are a fantastic\nhelp. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated\ncommits.\n\nMake sure to adhere to the coding conventions used throughout the codebase\n(indentation, accurate comments, etc.). Please run `npm test` before you push:\nthis will run the jasmine test suite (using karma runner) and check your syntax\nstyle is consistent with master (using JSCS)\n\nPlease follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the\nproject:\n\n1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,\n   and configure the remotes:\n\n   ```bash\n   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory\n   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/flight\n   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory\n   cd <repo-name>\n   # Assign the original repo to a remote called \"upstream\"\n   git remote add upstream git://github.com/twitter/flight\n   ```\n\n2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:\n\n   ```bash\n   git checkout master\n   git pull upstream master\n   ```\n\n3. Install the dependencies (you must have Node.js and [Bower](http://bower.io)\n   installed), and create a new topic branch (off the main project development\n   branch) to contain your feature, change, or fix:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install\n   bower install\n   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>\n   ```\n\n4. Make sure to update, or add to the tests when appropriate. Patches and\n   features will not be accepted without tests. Run `make test` to check that\n   all tests pass after you've made changes.\n\n5. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Provide clear and explanatory commit\n   messages. Use Git's [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase) feature to tidy up\n   your commits before making them public.\n\n6. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:\n\n   ```bash\n   git pull [--rebase] upstream master\n   ```\n\n7. Push your topic branch up to your fork:\n\n   ```bash\n   git push origin <topic-branch-name>\n   ```\n\n8. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/)\n    with a clear title and description.\n\n9. If you are asked to amend your changes before they can be merged in, please\n   use `git commit --amend` (or rebasing for multi-commit Pull Requests) and\n   force push to your remote feature branch. You may also be asked to squash\n   commits.\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing your code,\n\nYou agree to license your contribution under the terms of the MIT License\nhttps://github.com/twitter/flight/blob/master/LICENSE\n"

It was\ncreated at Twitter, and is used by the [twitter.com](https://twitter.com/) and\n[TweetDeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) web applications.\n\n* [Website](http://flightjs.github.io/)\n* [API documentation](doc/README.md)\n* [Flight example app](http://flightjs.github.io/example-app/) ([Source](https://github.com/flightjs/example-app))\n* [Flight's Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/twitter-flight)\n* [Flight on Twitter](https://twitter.com/flightjs)\n* [Flight on Freenode IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=flightjs) (#flightjs)\n\n## Example\n\nA simple example of a Flight component.\n\n```js\n/* Component definition */\n\nvar Inbox = flight.component(inbox);\n\nfunction inbox() {\n  this.doSomething = function() { /* ... */ }\n  this.doSomethingElse = function() { /* ... */ }\n\n  // after initializing the component\n  this.after('initialize', function() {\n    this.on('click', this.doSomething);\n    this.on('mouseover', this.doSomethingElse);\n  });\n}\n\n/* Attach the component to a DOM node */\n\nInbox.attachTo('#inbox');\n```\n\n## Installation\n\nQuick start using the [pre-built\nlibrary](http://flightjs.github.io/release/latest/flight.min.js) (a\n[UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) bundle). It exposes all of its modules as\nproperties of a global variable, `flight`.\n\n```html\n<!-- jQuery -->\n<script src=\"//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js\"></script>\n<!-- Flight release -->\n<script src=\"http://flightjs.github.io/release/latest/flight.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/):\n\n```\nnpm install --save flightjs\n```\n\nUsing [Bower](http://bower.io/):\n\n```\nbower install --save flight\n```\n\nYou will have to load [jQuery](http://jquery.com) in your application.\n\n## Why Flight?\n\nFlight is only ~5K minified and gzipped. It's built upon jQuery.\n\nFlight components are highly portable and easily testable. This is because a\nFlight component (and its API) is entirely decoupled from other components.\nFlight components communicate only by triggering and subscribing to events.\n\nFlight also includes a simple and safe\n[mixin](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2011/05/31/a-fresh-look-at-javascript-mixins/)\ninfrastructure, allowing components to be easily extended with minimal\nboilerplate.\n\n## Development tools\n\nFlight has supporting projects that provide everything you need to setup,\nwrite, and test your application.\n\n* [Flight generator](https://github.com/flightjs/generator-flight/)\n  Recommended. One-step to setup a Flight-based web app.\n\n* [Flight package generator](https://github.com/flightjs/generator-flight-package/)\n  Recommended. One-step to setup everything you need to write and test a\n  standalone Flight component.\n\n* [Jasmine Flight](https://github.com/flightjs/jasmine-flight/)\n  Extensions for the Jasmine test framework.\n\n* [Mocha Flight](https://github.com/flightjs/mocha-flight/)\n  Extensions for the Mocha test framework.\n\n## Finding and writing components\n\nYou can browse all the [Flight components](http://flight-components.jit.su)\navailable at this time. They can also be found by searching the Bower registry:\n\n```\nbower search flight\n```\n\nThe easiest way to write a new Flight component is to use the [Flight\npackage generator](https://github.com/flightjs/generator-flight-package/):\n\n```\nyo flight-package foo\n```\n\n## Browser Support\n\nChrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, IE 7+ (requires [ES5-shim](https://github.com/kriskowal/es5-shim)).\n\n## Quick Overview\n\nHere's a brief introduction to Flight's key concepts and syntax. Read the [API\ndocumentation](doc) for a comprehensive overview.\n\n### Components ([API](doc/component_api.md))\n\n- A Component is nothing more than a constructor with properties mixed into its prototype.\n- Every Component comes with a set of basic functionality such as event handling and component registration.\n(see [Base API](doc/base_api.md))\n- Additionally, each Component definition mixes in a set of custom properties which describe its behavior.\n- When a component is attached to a DOM node, a new instance of that component is created. Each component\ninstance references the DOM node via its `node` property.\n- Component instances cannot be referenced directly; they communicate with other components via events.\n\n### Interacting with the DOM\n\nOnce attached, component instances have direct access to their node object via the `node` property. (There's\nalso a jQuery version of the node available via the `$node` property.)\n\n### Events in Flight\n\nEvents are how Flight components interact. The Component prototype supplies methods for triggering events as\nwell as for subscribing to and unsubscribing from events. These Component event methods are actually just convenient\nwrappers around regular event methods on DOM nodes.\n\n### Mixins ([API](doc/mixin_api.md))\n\n- In Flight, a mixin is a function which assigns properties to a target object (represented by the `this`\nkeyword).\n- A typical mixin defines a set of functionality that will be useful to more than one component.\n- One mixin can be applied to any number of [Component](#components) definitions.\n- One Component definition can have any number of mixins applied to it.\n- Each Component defines a [*core*](#core_mixin) mixin within its own module.\n- A mixin can itself have mixins applied to it.\n\n### Advice ([API](doc/advice_api.md))\n\nIn Flight, advice is a mixin (`'lib/advice.js'`) that defines `before`, `after` and `around` methods.\n\nThese can be used to modify existing functions by adding custom code. All Components have advice mixed in to\ntheir prototype so that mixins can augment existing functions without requiring knowledge\nof the original implementation. Moreover, since Components are seeded with an empty `initialize` method,\nComponent definitions will typically use `after` to define custom `initialize` behavior.\n\n### Debugging ([API](doc/debug_api.md))\n\nFlight ships with a debug module which can help you trace the sequence of event triggering and binding. By default\nconsole logging is turned off, but you can log `trigger`, `on` and `off` events by means of the following console\ncommands.\n\n## Authors\n\n+ [@angus-c](http://github.com/angus-c)\n+ [@danwrong](http://github.com/danwrong)\n+ [@kpk](http://github.com/kennethkufluk)\n\nThanks for assistance and contributions:\n[@sayrer](https://github.com/sayrer),\n[@shinypb](https://github.com/shinypb),\n[@kloots](https://github.com/kloots),\n[@marcelduran](https://github.com/marcelduran),\n[@tbrd](https://github.com/tbrd),\n[@necolas](https://github.com/necolas),\n[@fat](https://github.com/fat),\n[@mkuklis](https://github.com/mkuklis),\n[@jrburke](https://github.com/jrburke),\n[@garann](https://github.com/garann),\n[@WebReflection](https://github.com/WebReflection),\n[@coldhead](https://github.com/coldhead),\n[@paulirish](https://github.com/paulirish),\n[@nimbupani](https://github.com/nimbupani),\n[@mootcycle](https://github.com/mootcycle).\n\nSpecial thanks to the rest of the Twitter web team for their abundant\ncontributions and feedback.\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2013 Twitter, Inc and other contributors.\n\nLicensed under the MIT License\n"
