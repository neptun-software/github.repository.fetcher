And in the theme's `_config.yml` file, the \"**menu**\" of the `19` to `21` line is configured, and the comment about the message board could be canceled.\n\n### new friends link page (Optional)\n\nThe `friends` page is a page for displaying **Friendly Links** information. If you don't have a `friends/index.md` file in your blog's `source` directory, then you need to create a new one. The command is as follows:\n\n```bash\nhexo new page \"friends\"\n```\n\nEdit the file `/source/friends/index.md` you just created, at least you need the following:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: friends\ndate: 2018-12-12 21:25:30\ntype: \"friends\"\nlayout: \"friends\"\n---\n```\n\nAlso, create a new `_data` directory in your blog's `source` directory and a new `friends.json` file in the `_data` directory. The contents of the file is as follows:\n\n```json\n[{\n    \"avatar\": \"http://image.luokangyuan.com/1_qq_27922023.jpg\",\n    \"name\": \"MaJang\",\n    \"introduction\": \"I am not a master, just looking for the master's footsteps.\",\n    \"url\": \"http://luokangyuan.com/\",\n    \"title\": \"Read More\"\n}, {\n    \"avatar\": \"http://image.luokangyuan.com/4027734.jpeg\",\n    \"name\": \"Blinkfox\",\n    \"introduction\": \"Hello, I'm blinkfox, I like programming.\",\n    \"url\": \"https://blinkfox.github.io/\",\n    \"title\": \"Visit Blog\"\n}, {\n    \"avatar\": \"http://image.luokangyuan.com/avatar.jpg\",\n    \"name\": \"ja_rome\",\n    \"introduction\": \"Ordinary steps can also go out of the great journey.\",\n    \"url\": \"https://me.csdn.net/jlh912008548\",\n    \"title\": \"Read More\"\n}]\n```\n### new 404 page\n\nIf the `source` directory of your blog doesn't have `404.md` file, you need create a new one.

The menu navigation name can be Chinese or English (e.g.: `Index` or `主页`)\n2. Icon icon can be found in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons)\n\n```yaml\nmenu:\n  Index:\n    url: /\n    icon: fas fa-home\n  Tags:\n    url: /tags\n    icon: fas fa-tags\n  Categories:\n    url: /categories\n    icon: fas fa-bookmark\n  Archives:\n    url: /archives\n    icon: fas fa-archive\n  About:\n    url: /about\n    icon: fas fa-user-circle\n  Friends:\n    url: /friends\n    icon: fas fa-address-book\n```\n\n#### Secondary menu configuration method\n\nIf you need a secondary menu, you can do the following on the basis of the original basic menu navigation.\n\n1. Add the `children` keyword to the first level menu that needs to add a secondary menu (e.g.: add `children` under the `About` menu)\n2. Create a secondary menu name, path url and icon icon under `children`.\n3. Note that each secondary menu module must be preceded by `-`.\n4. Note the indentation format.\n\n```yaml\nmenu:\n  Index:\n    url: /\n    icon: fas fa-home\n  Tags:\n    url: /tags\n    icon: fas fa-tags\n  Categories:\n    url: /categories\n    icon: fas fa-bookmark\n  Archives:\n    url: /archives\n    icon: fas fa-archive\n  About:\n    url: /about\n    icon: fas fa-user-circle\n  Friends:\n    url: /friends\n    icon: fas fa-address-book\n  Medias:\n    icon: fas fa-list\n    children:\n      - name: Music\n        url: /music\n        icon: fas fa-music\n      - name: Movies\n        url: /movies\n        icon: fas fa-film\n      - name: Books\n        url: /books\n        icon: fas fa-book\n      - name: Galleries\n        url: /galleries\n        icon: fas fa-image\n```\n\n### Code Highlight\n\nStarting from Hexo 5.0.0 version, it comes with support for `prismjs` code syntax highlighting, and hexo-theme-matery has been modified to support it.\n\nIf the plugin of `hexo-prism-plugin` has been installed in your blog, then you need to execute `npm uninstall hexo-prism-plugin` to uninstall it, otherwise there will be `&#123;`, `&#125;` escape characters in the code block of the post.\n\nThen, modify the value of `highlight.enable` to `false` in `_config.yml` at the root your hexo project, and set the value of `prismjs.enable` to `true`, the main configuration is as follows:\n\n```yaml\nhighlight:\n  enable: false\n  line_number: true\n  auto_detect: false\n  tab_replace: ''\n  wrap: true\n  hljs: false\nprismjs:\n  enable: true\n  preprocess: true\n  line_number: true\n  tab_replace: ''\n```\n\nThe default `prismjs` theme in the hexo-theme-matery is `Tomorrow Night`, if you want to customize your own theme, you can go to [prismjs download page](https://prismjs.com/download.html) to download yourself favorite theme `css` file, then name this css theme file `prism.css`, replace the `source/libs/prism/prism.css` file in the theme folder of `hexo-theme-matery`.\n\n### Search\n\nThe theme uses the Hexo plugin [hexo-generator-search](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-generator-search) to search the content, and the Installation command is as follows:\n\n```bash\nnpm install hexo-generator-search --save\n```\n\nAdd the following content in `_config.yml` at the root of your hexo project:\n\n```yaml\nsearch:\n  path: search.xml\n  field: post\n```\n\n### Translate Chinese Link to Pinyin (Recommended)\n\nDefault permalinks of Hexo will include Chinese if your article's title is Chinese. But it's adverse to `SEO`, and `gitment` comments don't support Chinese Link as well. We can use the [hexo-permalink-pinyin](https://github.com/viko16/hexo-permalink-pinyin) Hexo plugin to generate permalinks in Chinese Pinyin when generating posts.\n\nInstallation command is as follows：\n\n```bash\nnpm i hexo-permalink-pinyin --save\n```\n\nAdd such configurations in `_config.yml` file of Hexo:\n\n```yaml\npermalink_pinyin:\n  enable: true\n  separator: '-' # default: '-'\n```\n\n> **Note**: [hexo-abbrlink](https://github.com/rozbo/hexo-abbrlink) can generate non-Chinese link in addition to this plugin.\n\n### Post word count statistics plugin (Recommended)\n\nIf you want to display the post word count and reading time information in the post detail page, you can install the [hexo-wordcount](https://github.com/willin/hexo-wordcount) plugin.\n\nInstallation command is as follows：\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save hexo-wordcount\n```\n\nThen just activate the following configuration items in the theme `_config.yml` file:\n\n```yaml\npostInfo:\n  date: true\n  update: false\n  wordCount: false # set true.\n  totalCount: false # set true.\n  min2read: false # set true.\n  readCount: false # set true.\n```\n\n### Add emoji support (Optional)\n\nThis theme adds support for the `emoji` emoticon, using the Hexo plugin [hexo-filter-github-emojis](https://npm.taobao.org/package/hexo-filter-github-emojis) to support the generation of the `emoji` expression. The corresponding `markdown emoji` syntax (`::`, for example: `:smile:`) is converted into a `emoji` expression that jumps. The installation command is as follows:\n\n```bash\nnpm install hexo-filter-github-emojis --save\n```\n\nAdd the following configuration into the `_config.yml` file in your hexo project root folder：\n\n```yaml\ngithubEmojis:\n  enable: true\n  className: github-emoji\n  inject: true\n  styles:\n  customEmojis:\n```\n\nExecute `hexo clean && hexo g` to regenerate the blog file, and then you can see the expression you wrote in the `emoji` grammar in the corresponding position in the article.\n\n### Add RSS feed support (Optional)\n\nThe theme uses the Hexo plugin [hexo-generator-feed](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed) to support `RSS` feed , and the Installation command is as follows:\n\n```bash\nnpm install hexo-generator-feed --save\n```\n\nAdd the following configuration into the `_config.yml` file in your hexo project root folder：\n\n```yaml\nfeed:\n  type: atom\n  path: atom.xml\n  limit: 20\n  hub:\n  content:\n  content_limit: 140\n  content_limit_delim: ' '\n  order_by: -date\n```\n\nExecute `hexo clean && hexo g` to regenerate the blog file, and then you can see the `atom.xml` file in the `public` folder, indicating that you have successfully installed.\n\n### [DaoVoice](http://www.daovoice.io/) online chat (Optional)\n\nGo to the official website of [DaoVoice](http://www.daovoice.io/), register and get the `app_id`. Fill the `app_id` into the the theme `_config.yml` file.\n\n### [Tidio](https://www.tidio.com/) online chat (Optional)\n\nGo to the official website of [Tidio](https://www.tidio.com/), register and get the `Public Key`. Fill the `Public Key` into the the theme `_config.yml` file.\n\n### Modify website footer\n\nWebsite footer may need to be customized, and it is not convenient to make it part of the configuration, So you need to modify and process it by yourself. Changes could be made in the theme's `/layout/_partial/footer.ejs` file, including the site information, the theme used, the amount of traffic and so on.\n\n### Modify social links\n\nIn the theme `_config.yml` file, the configurations of `QQ`, `GitHub` and mailbox and more are supported by default. In the `/layout/_partial/social-link.ejs` file of the theme, you can add or modify social link addresses as you need. To add a link, please refer to the following code:\n\n```html\n<% if (theme.socialLink.github) { %>\n    <a href=\"<%= theme.socialLink.github %>\" class=\"tooltipped\" target=\"_blank\" data-tooltip=\"访问我的GitHub\" data-position=\"top\" data-delay=\"50\">\n        <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>\n    </a>\n<% } %>\n```\n\nYou can search social icons such as `fab fa-github` in [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons). There are common social icons you can reference:\n\n- Facebook: `fab fa-facebook`\n- Twitter: `fab fa-twitter`\n- Google-plus: `fab fa-google-plus`\n- Linkedin: `fab fa-linkedin`\n- Tumblr: `fab fa-tumblr`\n- Medium: `fab fa-medium`\n- Slack: `fab fa-slack`\n- Sina Weibo: `fab fa-weibo`\n- Wechat: `fab fa-weixin`\n- QQ: `fab fa-qq`\n- Zhihu: `fab fa-zhihu`\n\n> **Note**: The version of `Font Awesome` used by matery is `5.11.0`.\n\n### Configure music player (optional)\n\nTo support music playing, you just need to activate music playing configuration in the theme's `_config.yml` file.\n\n```yaml\n# Whether to display the music\nmusic:\n  enable: true\n  title: \t\t   # non-fixed mode works\n    enable: true\n    show: Listen to music\n  server: netease   # require music platform: netease, tencent, kugou, xiami, baidu\n  type: playlist    # require song, playlist, album, search, artist\n  id: 503838841     # require song id / playlist id / album id / search keyword\n  fixed: false      # enable fixed mode\n  autoplay: false   # audio atuoplay\n  theme: '#42b983'\n  loop: 'all'       # player loop play, values: 'all', 'one', 'none'\n  order: 'random'   # player play order, values: 'list', 'random'\n  preload: 'auto'   # values: 'none', 'metadata', 'auto'\n  volume: 0.7       # default volume, notice that player will remember user setting, default volume will not work after user set volume themselves\n  listFolded: true  # indicate whether list should folded at first\n```\n\n>`server` values :  `netease` (NetEase  cloud music) , `tencent` (QQMusic) , `kugou` (KuGouMusic) , `xiami`  \n>(XiamMusic) , `baidu` (BaiduMusic)  \n>`type` values : `song`  ,   `playlist` , `album` , `search` , `artist`  \n>For example to get the `id`:open NetEase cloud music in the browser , click the playlist of my love , there will a string of  \n>numbers  in the browser\\`s address bar  ,  the `playlist`\\`s `id` just is the string of numbers.\n\n### add note\n\n> [demonstration](https://blog.17lai.site/posts/cf0f47fd/#tag-note)\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\n{% note [class] [no-icon] [summary] %}\nAny content (support inline tags too).\n{% endnote %}\n```\n\n- `[class]` : *Optional parameter.* Supported values: default | primary | success | info | warning | danger.\n- `[no-icon]` : *Optional parameter.* Disable icon in note.\n- `[summary]` : *Optional parameter.* Optional summary of the note.\n\nAll parameters are optional.\n\n#### example\n\n```\n{% note %}\n#### Header\n(without define class style)\n{% endnote %}\n```\n\n### add button\n\n> [demonstration](https://blog.17lai.site/posts/cf0f47fd/#tag-button)\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\n{% button url, text, icon [class], [title] %}\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n{% btn url, text, icon [class], [title] %}\n```\n\n- `url` : Absolute or relative path to URL.\n- `text` : Button text.

But I still recommend at least filling in the values of `title` and `date`.\n\n| Options   | Defaults              | Description                                             |\n| ---------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| title      | Markdown's file title | Post title, it is highly recommended to fill in this option |\n| date       | Date and time when the file created | Publish time, it is highly recommended to fill in this option, and it is best to ensure that it is globally unique |\n| author     | `author` in root `_config.yml` | Post author                                    |\n| img        | a value in `featureImages`  | Post feature image，For example: `http://xxx.com/xxx.jpg` |\n| top        | `true`                      | Recommended post (whether the post is topped), if the `top` value is `true`, it will be recommended as a homepage post. |\n| hide        | `false`                      | Whether show this post in homepage, if the `hide` value is `true`, it will not be showed in homepage. |\n| cover      | `false`                     | The `v1.0.2` version is added to indicate whether the post needs to be added to the homepage carousel cover. |\n| coverImg   | null                        | The new version of `v1.0.2` indicates that the post needs to display the image path on the cover of the homepage. If not, the default image of the post is used by default. |\n| password   | null                        | The post read the password. If you want to set the reading verification password for the article, you can set the value of `password`, which must be encrypted with `SHA256` to prevent others from seeing it. The premise is that the `verifyPassword` option is activated in the theme's `config.yml` |\n| toc        | `true`                      | Whether TOC is turned on or not, you can turn off the TOC function for an article.

The value of `date` should try to ensure that each article is unique, because `Gitalk` and `Gitment` recognize `id` in this topic are uniquely identified by the value of `date`.\n> 3. If you want to set the ability to read the verification password for the article, you should not only set the value of the password with SHA256 encryption in Front-matter, but also activate the configuration in the theme `_config.yml`.\n> 4. you can define reprint policy for a single article in the front-matter of the specific md file using this key: reprintPolicy\n\nThe following are examples of the post's `Front-matter`.\n\n### The simplest example\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: typora-vue-theme Theme introduction\ndate: 2018-09-07 09:25:00\n---\n```\n\n### The most comprehensive example\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: typora-vue-theme Theme introduction\ndate: 2018-09-07 09:25:00\nauthor: Qi Zhao\nimg: /source/images/xxx.jpg\ntop: true\nhide: false\ncover: true\ncoverImg: /images/1.jpg\npassword: 8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92\ntoc: false\nmathjax: false\nsummary: This is the content of your custom post summary.

The theme will take remainder according to `hashcode` of the post title if the post does not set featured pictures.\n\n**I think everyone should have their own style and feature for their blogs**. If you are not satisfied with the theme's functions and color, you can modify them by yourself,\nand more free functions and details could be changed by modifying source code when it is hard to achieve by modifying the theme's `_config.yml`.\n\n### Customizing theme color\n\nSearch `.bg-color` to modify background color in `/source/css/matery.css` in theme file：\n\n```css\n/* The overall background color, including navigation, mobile navigation, footer, tab, etc.. */\n.bg-color {\n    background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #4cbf30 0%, #0f9d58 100%);\n}\n\n@-webkit-keyframes rainbow {\n   /* Dynamically switch background colors. */\n}\n\n@keyframes rainbow {\n    /* Dynamically switch background colors. */\n}\n```\n\n### Modify banner picture and post's featured pictures\n\nYou can change `banner` pictures in `/source/medias/banner` as you like .Theme code can switch dynamically every day and just need 7 pictures.If you master `JavaScript`, you can change it to your favorite switching logic, such as Random switching. The code for switching `banner`is in `<script></script>` of `/layout/_partial/bg-cover-content.ejs`file.\n\n```javascript\n$('.bg-cover').css('background-image', 'url(/medias/banner/' + new Date().getDay() + '.jpg)');\n```\n\nThere are 24 featured pictures in `/source/medias/featureimages`, you can add or delete some, and modify corresponding settings in the theme's `_config.yml`.\n\n## Changelog\n\nSee [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/blinkfox/hexo-theme-matery/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n"

[@shw2018](https://github.com/shw2018)\n- [@L1cardo](https://github.com/L1cardo)\n- [@Five-great](https://github.com/Five-great)\n\n## 下载\n\n本主题**推荐你使用 Hexo 5.0.0 及以上的版本**。如果，你已经有一个自己的 [Hexo](https://hexo.io/zh-cn/) 博客了，建议你将 Hexo 升级到最新稳定的版本。\n\n点击 [这里](https://codeload.github.com/blinkfox/hexo-theme-matery/zip/master) 下载 `master` 分支的最新稳定版的代码，解压缩后，将 `hexo-theme-matery` 的文件夹复制到你 Hexo 的 `themes` 文件夹中即可。\n\n当然你也可以在你的 `themes` 文件夹下使用 `git clone` 命令来下载:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/blinkfox/hexo-theme-matery.git\n```\n\n## 配置\n\n### 切换主题\n\n修改 Hexo 根目录下的 `_config.yml` 的  `theme` 的值：`theme: hexo-theme-matery`\n\n#### `_config.yml` 文件的其它修改建议:\n\n- 请修改 `_config.yml` 的 `url` 的值为你的网站主 `URL`（如：`http://xxx.github.io`）。\n- 建议修改两个 `per_page` 的分页条数值为 `6` 的倍数，如：`12`、`18` 等，这样文章列表在各个屏幕下都能较好的显示。\n- 如果你是中文用户，则建议修改 `language` 的值为 `zh-CN`。\n\n### 新建分类 categories 页\n\n`categories` 页是用来展示所有分类的页面，如果在你的博客 `source` 目录下还没有 `categories/index.md` 文件，那么你就需要新建一个，命令如下：\n\n```bash\nhexo new page \"categories\"\n```\n\n编辑你刚刚新建的页面文件 `/source/categories/index.md`，至少需要以下内容：\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: categories\ndate: 2018-09-30 17:25:30\ntype: \"categories\"\nlayout: \"categories\"\n---\n```\n\n### 新建标签 tags 页\n\n`tags` 页是用来展示所有标签的页面，如果在你的博客 `source` 目录下还没有 `tags/index.md` 文件，那么你就需要新建一个，命令如下：\n\n```bash\nhexo new page \"tags\"\n```\n\n编辑你刚刚新建的页面文件 `/source/tags/index.md`，至少需要以下内容：\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: tags\ndate: 2018-09-30 18:23:38\ntype: \"tags\"\nlayout: \"tags\"\n---\n```\n\n### 新建关于我 about 页\n\n`about` 页是用来展示**关于我和我的博客**信息的页面，如果在你的博客 `source` 目录下还没有 `about/index.md` 文件，那么你就需要新建一个，命令如下：\n\n```bash\nhexo new page \"about\"\n```\n\n编辑你刚刚新建的页面文件 `/source/about/index.md`，至少需要以下内容：\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: about\ndate: 2018-09-30 17:25:30\ntype: \"about\"\nlayout: \"about\"\n---\n```\n\n### 新建留言板 contact 页（可选的）\n\n`contact` 页是用来展示**留言板**信息的页面，如果在你的博客 `source` 目录下还没有 `contact/index.md` 文件，那么你就需要新建一个，命令如下：\n\n```bash\nhexo new page \"contact\"\n```\n\n编辑你刚刚新建的页面文件 `/source/contact/index.md`，至少需要以下内容：\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: contact\ndate: 2018-09-30 17:25:30\ntype: \"contact\"\nlayout: \"contact\"\n---\n```\n\n> **注**：本留言板功能依赖于第三方评论系统，请**激活**你的评论系统才有效果。并且在主题的 `_config.yml` 文件中，第 `19` 至 `21` 行的“**菜单**”配置，取消关于留言板的注释即可。\n\n### 新建友情链接 friends 页（可选的）\n\n`friends` 页是用来展示**友情链接**信息的页面，如果在你的博客 `source` 目录下还没有 `friends/index.md` 文件，那么你就需要新建一个，命令如下：\n\n```bash\nhexo new page \"friends\"\n```\n\n编辑你刚刚新建的页面文件

菜单导航配置\n\n#### 配置基本菜单导航的名称、路径url和图标icon.\n\n1.菜单导航名称可以是中文也可以是英文(如：`Index`或`主页`) \n2.图标icon 可以在[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) 中查找   \n\n```yaml\nmenu:\n  Index:\n    url: /\n    icon: fas fa-home\n  Tags:\n    url: /tags\n    icon: fas fa-tags\n  Categories:\n    url: /categories\n    icon: fas fa-bookmark\n  Archives:\n    url: /archives\n    icon: fas fa-archive\n  About:\n    url: /about\n    icon: fas fa-user-circle\n  Friends:\n    url: /friends\n    icon: fas fa-address-book\n```\n\n#### 二级菜单配置方法\n\n如果你需要二级菜单则可以在原基本菜单导航的基础上如下操作\n     \n1. 在需要添加二级菜单的一级菜单下添加`children`关键字(如:`About`菜单下添加`children`)     \n2. 在`children`下创建二级菜单的 名称name,路径url和图标icon.      \n3. 注意每个二级菜单模块前要加 `-`.     \n4. 注意缩进格式  \n\n```yaml\nmenu:\n  Index:\n    url: /\n    icon: fas fa-home\n  Tags:\n    url: /tags\n    icon: fas fa-tags\n  Categories:\n    url: /categories\n    icon: fas fa-bookmark\n  Archives:\n    url: /archives\n    icon: fas fa-archive\n  About:\n    url: /about\n    icon: fas fa-user-circle-o\n  Friends:\n    url: /friends\n    icon: fas fa-address-book\n  Medias:\n    icon: fas fa-list\n    children:\n      - name: Music\n        url: /music\n        icon: fas fa-music\n      - name: Movies\n        url: /movies\n        icon: fas fa-film\n      - name: Books\n        url: /books\n        icon: fas fa-book\n      - name: Galleries\n        url: /galleries\n        icon: fas fa-image\n```\n\n\n### 代码高亮\n\n从 Hexo5.0 版本开始自带了 `prismjs` 代码语法高亮的支持，本主题对此进行了改造支持。\n\n如果你的博客中曾经安装过 `hexo-prism-plugin` 的插件，那么你须要执行 `npm uninstall hexo-prism-plugin` 来卸载掉它，否则生成的代码中会有 `&#123;` 和 `&#125;` 的转义字符。\n\n然后，修改 Hexo 根目录下 `_config.yml` 文件中 `highlight.enable` 的值为 `false`，并将 `prismjs.enable` 的值设置为 `true`，主要配置如下：\n\n```yaml\nhighlight:\n  enable: false\n  line_number: true\n  auto_detect: false\n  tab_replace: ''\n  wrap: true\n  hljs: false\nprismjs:\n  enable: true\n  preprocess: true\n  line_number: true\n  tab_replace: ''\n```\n\n主题中默认的 `prismjs` 主题是 `Tomorrow Night`，如果你想定制自己的主题，可以前往 [prismjs 下载页面](https://prismjs.com/download.html) 定制下载自己喜欢的主题 `css` 文件，然后将此 css 主题文件取名为 `prism.css`，替换掉 `hexo-theme-matery` 主题文件夹中的 `source/libs/prism/prism.css` 文件即可。\n\n### 搜索\n\n本主题中还使用到了 [hexo-generator-search](https://github.com/wzpan/hexo-generator-search) 的 Hexo 插件来做内容搜索，安装命令如下：\n\n```bash\nnpm install hexo-generator-search --save\n```\n\n在 Hexo 根目录下的 `_config.yml` 文件中，新增以下的配置项：\n\n```yaml\nsearch:\n  path: search.xml\n  field: post\n```\n\n### 中文链接转拼音（建议安装）\n\n如果你的文章名称是中文的，那么 Hexo 默认生成的永久链接也会有中文，这样不利于 `SEO`，且 `gitment` 评论对中文链接也不支持。我们可以用 [hexo-permalink-pinyin](https://github.com/viko16/hexo-permalink-pinyin) Hexo 插件使在生成文章时生成中文拼音的永久链接。\n\n安装命令如下：\n\n```bash\nnpm i hexo-permalink-pinyin --save\n```\n\n在 Hexo 根目录下的 `_config.yml` 文件中，新增以下的配置项：\n\n```yaml\npermalink_pinyin:\n  enable: true\n  separator: '-' # default: '-'\n```\n\n> **注**：除了此插件外，[hexo-abbrlink](https://github.com/rozbo/hexo-abbrlink) 插件也可以生成非中文的链接。\n\n### 文章字数统计插件（建议安装）\n\n如果你想要在文章中显示文章字数、阅读时长信息，可以安装 [hexo-wordcount](https://github.com/willin/hexo-wordcount)插件。\n\n安装命令如下：\n\n```bash\nnpm i --save hexo-wordcount\n```\n\n然后只需在本主题下的 `_config.yml` 文件中，将各个文章字数相关的配置激活即可：\n\n```yaml\npostInfo:\n  date: true\n  update: false\n  wordCount: false # 设置文章字数统计为 true.\n  totalCount: false # 设置站点文章总字数统计为 true.\n  min2read: false # 阅读时长.\n  readCount: false # 阅读次数.\n```\n\n### 添加emoji表情支持（可选的）\n\n本主题新增了对`emoji`表情的支持，使用到了 [hexo-filter-github-emojis](https://npm.taobao.org/package/hexo-filter-github-emojis) 的 Hexo 插件来支持 `emoji`表情的生成，把对应的`markdown emoji`语法（`::`,例如：`:smile:`）转变成会跳跃的`emoji`表情，安装命令如下：\n\n```bash\nnpm install hexo-filter-github-emojis --save\n```\n\n在 Hexo 根目录下的 `_config.yml` 文件中，新增以下的配置项：\n\n```yaml\ngithubEmojis:\n  enable: true\n  className: github-emoji\n  inject: true\n  styles:\n  customEmojis:\n```\n执行 `hexo clean && hexo g` 重新生成博客文件，然后就可以在文章中对应位置看到你用`emoji`语法写的表情了。\n\n### 添加 RSS 订阅支持（可选的）\n\n本主题中还使用到了 [hexo-generator-feed](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed) 的 Hexo 插件来做 `RSS`，安装命令如下：\n\n```bash\nnpm install hexo-generator-feed --save\n```\n\n在 Hexo 根目录下的 `_config.yml` 文件中，新增以下的配置项：\n\n```yaml\nfeed:\n  type: atom\n  path: atom.xml\n  limit: 20\n  hub:\n  content:\n  content_limit: 140\n  content_limit_delim: ' '\n  order_by: -date\n```\n\n执行 `hexo clean && hexo g` 重新生成博客文件，然后在 `public` 文件夹中即可看到 `atom.xml` 文件，说明你已经安装成功了。\n\n### 添加 [DaoVoice](http://www.daovoice.io/) 在线聊天功能（可选的）\n\n前往 [DaoVoice](http://www.daovoice.io/) 官网注册并且获取 `app_id`，并将 `app_id` 填入主题的 `_config.yml` 文件中。\n\n### 添加 [Tidio](https://www.tidio.com/) 在线聊天功能（可选的）\n\n前往 [Tidio](https://www.tidio.com/) 官网注册并且获取 `Public Key`，并将 `Public Key` 填入主题的 `_config.yml` 文件中。\n\n### 修改页脚\n\n页脚信息可能需要做定制化修改，而且它不便于做成配置信息，所以可能需要你自己去再修改和加工。修改的地方在主题文件的 `/layout/_partial/footer.ejs` 文件中，包括站点、使用的主题、访问量等。\n\n### 添加中文繁简转换\n\n在主题的 `_config.yml` 文件中，开启 translate 为 enable。\n\n> 开启中文繁简转换如下修改。默认不开启。 \n> 实例演示： [繁简转换](https://blog.17lai.site) 底下 footer 栏\n\n```yaml\ntranslate:\n  enable: true\n```\n\n### 修改社交链接\n\n在主题的 `_config.yml` 文件中，默认支持 `QQ`、`GitHub` 和邮箱等的配置，你可以在主题文件的 `/layout/_partial/social-link.ejs` 文件中，新增、修改你需要的社交链接地址，增加链接可参考如下代码：\n\n```html\n<% if (theme.socialLink.github) { %>\n    <a href=\"<%= theme.socialLink.github %>\" class=\"tooltipped\" target=\"_blank\" data-tooltip=\"访问我的GitHub\" data-position=\"top\" data-delay=\"50\">\n        <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i>\n    </a>\n<% } %>\n```\n\n其中，社交图标（如：`fa-github`）你可以在 [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) 中搜索找到。以下是常用社交图标的标识，供你参考：\n\n- Facebook: `fab fa-facebook`\n- Twitter: `fab fa-twitter`\n- Google-plus: `fab fa-google-plus`\n- Linkedin: `fab fa-linkedin`\n- Tumblr: `fab fa-tumblr`\n- Medium: `fab fa-medium`\n- Slack: `fab fa-slack`\n- Sina Weibo: `fab fa-weibo`\n- Wechat: `fab fa-weixin`\n- QQ: `fab fa-qq`\n- Zhihu: `fab fa-zhihu`\n\n> **注意**: 本主题中使用的 `Font Awesome` 版本为 `5.11.0`。\n\n### 修改打赏的二维码图片\n\n在主题文件的 `source/medias/reward` 文件中，你可以替换成你的的微信和支付宝的打赏二维码图片。\n\n### 配置音乐播放器（可选的）\n\n要支持音乐播放，在主题的 `_config.yml` 配置文件中激活music配置即可：\n\n```yaml\n# 是否在首页显示音乐\nmusic:\n  enable: true\n  title:     \t    # 非吸底模式有效\n    enable: true\n    show: 听听音乐\n  server: netease   # require music platform: netease, tencent, kugou, xiami, baidu\n  type: playlist    # require song, playlist, album, search, artist\n  id: 503838841     # require song id / playlist id / album id / search keyword\n  fixed: false      # 开启吸底模式\n  autoplay: false   # 是否自动播放\n  theme: '#42b983'\n  loop: 'all'       # 音频循环播放, 可选值: 'all', 'one', 'none'\n  order: 'random'   # 音频循环顺序, 可选值: 'list', 'random'\n  preload: 'auto'   # 预加载，可选值: 'none', 'metadata', 'auto'\n  volume: 0.7       # 默认音量，请注意播放器会记忆用户设置，用户手动设置音量后默认音量即失效\n  listFolded: true  # 列表默认折叠\n```\n\n> `server`可选`netease`（网易云音乐），`tencent`（QQ音乐），`kugou`（酷狗音乐），`xiami`（虾米音乐），\n>\n> `baidu`（百度音乐）。\n>\n> `type`可选`song`（歌曲），`playlist`（歌单），`album`（专辑），`search`（搜索关键字），`artist`（歌手）\n>\n> `id`获取方法示例: 浏览器打开网易云音乐，点击我喜欢的音乐歌单，浏览器地址栏后面会有一串数字，`playlist`的`id`\n>\n> 即为这串数字。\n\n### 添加note\n\n> [演示](https://blog.17lai.site/posts/cf0f47fd/#tag-note)\n\n#### Usage\n\n```\n{% note [class] [no-icon] [summary]
