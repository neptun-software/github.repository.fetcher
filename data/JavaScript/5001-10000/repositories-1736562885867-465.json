As a contributor, here are the guidelines I would like you to follow:\n\n - [Question or Problem?](#question)\n - [Issues and Bugs](#issue)\n - [Feature Requests](#feature)\n - [Submission Guidelines](#submit)\n - [Coding Rules](#rules)\n - [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit)\n\n## <a name=\"question\"></a> Got a Question or Problem?\n\nDo not open issues for general support questions as I want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports and feature requests. You've got much better chances of getting your question answered on [gitter chat][gitter] or [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/casl).\n\n## <a name=\"issue\"></a> Found a Bug?\n\nIf you find a bug in the source code, you can help by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) or even better, you can [submit a Pull Request](#submit-pr) with a fix.\n\n## <a name=\"feature\"></a> Missing a Feature?\n\nYou can *request* a new feature by [submitting an issue](#submit-issue) to this GitHub Repository. If you would like to *implement* a new feature, please submit an issue with a proposal for your work first, to be sure that somebody else hasn't started to do the same.\n\n## <a name=\"submit\"></a> Submission Guidelines\n\n### <a name=\"submit-issue\"></a> Submitting an Issue\n\nBefore you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.\n\nPlease provide steps to reproduce for found bug (using http://plnkr.co, https://codesandbox.io/, https://repl.it/ or similar), this will help to understand and fix the issue faster.\n\n### <a name=\"submit-pr\"></a> Submitting a Pull Request (PR)\n\nBefore you submit your Pull Request (PR) consider the following guidelines:\n\n* Search [GitHub](https://github.com/stalniy/casl/pulls) for an open or closed PR\n  that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.\n\n* Fork the project and setup it (CASL uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) for monorepo management):\n\n  ```sh\n  # replace ${YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME} with your github username\n  git clone git@github.com:${YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME}/casl.git\n  # install pnpm, other ways at https://pnpm.js.org/en/installation\n  npx pnpm add -g pnpm\n  cd casl\n  pnpm i -r\n  pnpm run -r build # build all packages so local deps can be linked\n  ```\n\n* Make your changes in a new git branch (fork master branch):\n\n  ```sh\n  git checkout -b my-fix-branch master\n  ```\n\n* **include appropriate test cases**.\n* Follow defined [Coding Rules](#rules).\n* Run all test suites `pnpm run -r test`\n* Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows defined [commit message conventions](#commit). Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages using [semantic-release](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/).\n* Push your branch to GitHub:\n\n  ```sh\n  git push origin my-fix-branch\n  ```\n\n* In GitHub, send a pull request to `casl:master`.\n* If somebody from project contributors suggest changes then:\n  * Make the required updates.\n  * Re-run all test suites to ensure tests are still passing.\n  * Rebase your branch and force push to your GitHub repository (this will update your Pull Request). Basically you can use `git commit -a --amend` and `git push --force origin my-fix-branch` in order to keep single commit in the feature branch.\n\nThat's it! Thank you for your contribution!\n\n## <a name=\"rules\"></a> Coding Rules\n\nTo ensure consistency throughout the source code, keep these rules in mind as you are working:\n\n* All features or bug fixes **must be tested** by one or more specs (unit-tests).\n* All public API methods **must be documented** in docs-src/src/content/pages.\n* Project follows [Airbnb's TypeScript Style Guide][js-style-guide] with [some exceptions](.eslintrc). All these will be checked by CI when you submit your PR\n\n## <a name=\"commit\"></a> Commit Message Guidelines\n\nThe project have very precise rules over how git commit messages can be formatted.  This leads to **more readable messages** that are easy to follow when looking through the **project history**.  But also, git history is used to **generate the change log**.\n\nThe commit message format is borrowed from Angular projects and you can find [more details in this document][commit-message-format]\n\n[commit-message-format]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#\n[github]: https://github.com/stalniy/casl\n[gitter]: https://gitter.im/stalniy-casl/casl\n[js-style-guide]: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript\n"

Please don't ask questions in issues, the issue list of this repo is **exclusively** for bug reports and feature requests. Questions in the issue list may be closed immediately without answers.\n\n## CASL crash course\n\nCASL operates on the abilities level, that is what a user can actually do in the application. An ability itself depends on the 4 parameters (last 3 are optional):\n\n1. User Action\\\n   Describes what user can actually do in the app. User action is a word (usually a verb) which depends on the business logic (e.g., `prolong`, `read`). Very often it will be a list of words from CRUD - `create`, `read`, `update` and `delete`.\n2. Subject\\\n   The subject or subject type which you want to check user action on. Usually this is a business (or domain) entity name (e.g., `Subscription`, `BlogPost`, `User`).\n3. Conditions\\\n   An object or function which restricts user action only to matched subjects. This is useful when you need to give a permission on resources created by a user (e.g., to allow user to update and delete own `BlogPost`)\n4. Fields\\\n   Can be used to restrict user action only to matched subject's fields (e.g., to allow moderator to update `hidden` field of `BlogPost` but not update `description` or `title`)\n\nUsing CASL you can describe abilities using regular and inverted rules. Let's see how\n\n**Note:** all the examples below will be written in TypeScript but CASL can be used in similar way in ES6+ and Nodejs environments.\n\n### 1. Define Abilities\n\nLets define `Ability` for a blog website where visitors:\n* can read blog posts\n* can manage (i.e., do anything) own posts\n* cannot delete a post if it was created more than a day ago\n\n```ts\nimport { AbilityBuilder, createMongoAbility } from '@casl/ability'\nimport { User } from '../models'; // application specific interfaces\n\n/**\n * @param user contains details about logged in user: its id, name, email, etc\n */\nfunction defineAbilitiesFor(user: User) {\n  const { can, cannot, build } = new AbilityBuilder(createMongoAbility);\n\n  // can read blog posts\n  can('read', 'BlogPost');\n  // can manage (i.e., do anything) own posts\n  can('manage', 'BlogPost', { author: user.id });\n  // cannot delete a post if it was created more than a day ago\n  cannot('delete', 'BlogPost', {\n    createdAt: { $lt: Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000 }\n  });\n\n  return build();\n});\n```\n\nDo you see how easily business requirements were translated into CASL's rules?\n\n**Note**: you can use class instead of string as a subject type (e.g., `can('read', BlogPost)`)\n\nAnd yes, `Ability` class allow you to use some MongoDB operators to define conditions. Don't worry if you don't know MongoDB, it's not required and explained in details in [Defining Abilities][define-abilities]\n\n### 2. Check Abilities\n\nLater on you can check abilities by using `can` and `cannot` methods of `Ability` instance.\n\n```js\n// in the same file as above\nimport { ForbiddenError } from '@casl/ability';\n\nconst user = getLoggedInUser(); // app specific function\nconst ability = defineAbilitiesFor(user);\n\nclass BlogPost { // business entity\n  constructor(props) {\n    Object.assign(this, props);\n  }\n}\n\n// true if ability allows to read at least one Post\nability.can('read', 'BlogPost');\n// the same as\nability.can('read', BlogPost);\n\n// true, if user is the author of the blog post\nability.can('manage', new BlogPost({ author: user.id }));\n\n// true if there is no ability to read this particular blog post\nconst ONE_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;\nconst postCreatedNow = new BlogPost({ createdAt: new Date() });\nconst postCreatedAWeekAgo = new BlogPost({ createdAt: new Date(Date.now() - 7 * ONE_DAY) });\n\n// can delete if it's created less than a day ago\nability.can('delete', postCreatedNow); // true\nability.can('delete', postCreatedAWeekAgo); // false\n\n// you can even throw an error if there is a missed ability\nForbiddenError.from(ability).throwUnlessCan('delete', postCreatedAWeekAgo);\n```\n\nOf course, you are not restricted to use only class instances in order to check permissions on objects. See [Introduction][intro] for the detailed explanation.\n\n### 3. Database integration\n\nCASL has a complementary package [@casl/mongoose] which provides easy integration with MongoDB and [mongoose].\n\n```ts\nimport { accessibleRecordsPlugin } from '@casl/mongoose';\nimport mongoose from 'mongoose';\n\nmongoose.plugin(accessibleRecordsPlugin);\n\nconst user = getUserLoggedInUser(); // app specific function\n\nconst ability = defineAbilitiesFor(user);\nconst BlogPost = mongoose.model('BlogPost', mongoose.Schema({\n  title: String,\n  author: mongoose.Types.ObjectId,\n  content: String,\n  createdAt: Date,\n  hidden: { type: Boolean, default: false }\n}))\n\n// returns mongoose Query, so you can chain it with other conditions\nconst posts = await BlogPost.accessibleBy(ability).where({ hidden: false });\n\n// you can also call it on existing query to enforce permissions\nconst hiddenPosts = await BlogPost.find({ hidden: true }).accessibleBy(ability);\n\n// you can even pass the action as a 2nd parameter. By default action is \"read\"\nconst updatablePosts = await BlogPost.accessibleBy(ability, 'update');\n```\n\nSee [Database integration][database-integration] for details.\n\n### 4. Advanced usage\n\n**CASL is incrementally adoptable**, that means you can start your project with simple claim (or action) based authorization and evolve it later, when your app functionality evolves.\n\n**CASL is composable**, that means you can implement alternative conditions matching (e.g., based on [joi], [ajv] or pure functions) and field matching (e.g., to support alternative syntax in fields like `addresses.*.street` or `addresses[0].street`) logic.\n\nSee [Advanced usage][advanced-usage] for details.\n\n[joi]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hapi/joi\n[ajv]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ajv\n\n### 5.
