          "content": "# Contributing to the AWS SDK for JavaScript\n\nWe work hard to provide a high-quality and useful SDK, and we greatly value\nfeedback and contributions from our community. Whether it's a bug report,\nnew feature, correction, or additional documentation, we welcome your issues\nand pull requests. Please read through this document before submitting any\nissues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary information to\neffectively respond to your bug report or contribution.\n\n\n## Filing Bug Reports\n\nYou can file bug reports against the SDK on the [GitHub issues][issues] page.\n\nIf you are filing a report for a bug or regression in the SDK, it's extremely\nhelpful to provide as much information as possible when opening the original\nissue. This helps us reproduce and investigate the possible bug without having\nto wait for this extra information to be provided. Please read the following\nguidelines prior to filing a bug report.\n\n1. Search through existing [issues][] to ensure that your specific issue has\n   not yet been reported. If it is a common issue, it is likely there is\n   already a bug report for your problem.\n\n2. Ensure that you have tested the latest version of the SDK. Although you\n   may have an issue against an older version of the SDK, we cannot provide\n   bug fixes for old versions. It's also possible that the bug may have been\n   fixed in the latest release.\n\n3. Provide as much information about your environment, SDK version, and\n   relevant dependencies as possible. For example, let us know what version\n   of Node.js you are using, or if it's a browser issue, which browser you\n   are using. If the issue only occurs with a specific dependency loaded,\n   please provide that dependency name and version.\n\n4. Provide a minimal test case that reproduces your issue or any error\n   information you related to your problem. We can provide feedback much\n   more quickly if we know what operations you are calling in the SDK. If\n   you cannot provide a full test case, provide as much code as you can\n   to help us diagnose the problem. Any relevant information should be provided\n   as well, like whether this is a persistent issue, or if it only occurs\n   some of the time.\n\n\n## Submitting Pull Requests\n\nWe are always happy to receive code and documentation contributions to the SDK.\nPlease be aware of the following notes prior to opening a pull request:\n\n1. The SDK is released under the [Apache license][license]. Any code you submit\n   will be released under that license. For substantial contributions, we may\n   ask you to sign a [Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][cla].\n\n2. If you would like to implement support for a significant feature that is not\n   yet available in the SDK, please talk to us beforehand to avoid any\n   duplication of effort.\n\n3. Wherever possible, pull requests should contain tests as appropriate.\n   Bugfixes should contain tests that exercise the corrected behavior (i.e., the\n   test should fail without the bugfix and pass with it), and new features \n   should be accompanied by tests exercising the feature.\n\n4. Pull requests that contain failing tests will not be merged until the test\n   failures are addressed. Pull requests that cause a significant drop in the\n   SDK's test coverage percentage are unlikely to be merged until tests have\n   been added.\n\n### Testing the code\n\nTo run the tests locally, install `phantomjs`. You can do so using [Homebrew][homebrew]:\n\n```\nbrew install --cask phantomjs\n```\n\nThen, to run all tests:\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nTo run a particular test subset e.g. just the unit tests:\n\n```\nnpm run unit\n```\n\nSee the implementation of the `test` script in `package.json` for more options.\n\n*Optional*: run integration tests located in [features folder](./features):\n\nMake sure you have valid AWS credentials available and run then the the integration test for \nspecific service, for example:\n\n```\nAWS_REGION=[set region] node node_modules/cucumber/bin/cucumber.js --tag @s3\n```\n\nHardcoded region strings are not allowed in the SDK. To check the code for\nthe presence of hardcoded region strings, run\n\n```\nnode ./scripts/region-checker/index.js\n```\n\nfrom the project root directory. If this command shows any output, the PR will\nnot be merged. Any lines that appear here must have the region string removed\nor be added to `scripts/region-checker/allowlist.js`. Lines should only be\nallowlisted if absolutely necessary.\n\n### Testing the documentation changes:\n\nTo test the documentation changes, please ensure you have the following requirements installed (Please make sure you have the latest version of Ruby):\n\n* `gem install bundler`\n\nOnce the bundler is installed, you need to execute the following commands, to install rake:\n\n```\nbundle install\n```\n\nOnce done, please run this command to get the documentation in (doc/latest/_index.html)\n\n```\nbundle exec rake docs:api\n```\n\n### Changelog\n\nWe have moved to using a changelog to document changes between SDK versions instead of [release notes][releasenotes].\nThe release notes generally contained service client updates, and major SDK changes. \nOur goal with the changelog is to document all changes made with each version of the SDK. \nWhen submitting a pull request, please run the `add-change` script and commit the resulting JSON file so that your change gets added to the changelog.\nFrom SDK root:\n```\nnpm run add-change\n```\n\nSee the [add-change cli notes](./scripts/changelog/README.md) for more information.\n\n[issues]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues\n[pr]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/pulls\n[license]: http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/\n[cla]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement\n[homebrew]: http://brew.sh/\n[releasenotes]: https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/JavaScript\n"

During maintenance mode, AWS will limit SDK releases to address critical bug fixes and security issues only. The SDK will not receive API updates for new or existing services, or be updated to support new regions.\n\nWe recommend that you migrate to [AWS SDK for JavaScript v3][aws-sdk-js-v3].\nFor dates, additional details, and information on how to migrate, please refer to the linked announcement.\n\nThe **AWS SDK for JavaScript v3** is the latest and recommended version, \nwhich has been GA since December 2020. Here is [why and how you should use\n**AWS SDK for JavaScript v3**][v3-recommended-blog]. You can try our migration scripts in [aws-sdk-js-codemod][aws-sdk-js-codemod] to migrate\nyour application from v2 to v3.\n\nTo get help with your migration, please follow our general guidelines to \n[open an issue][v3-new-issue] and choose [guidance][open-issue-v3-guidance].\nTo give feedback on and report issues in the v3 repo, please refer to \n[Giving feedback and contributing][v3-contributing].\n\nWatch this README and the [AWS Developer Tools Blog][aws-devtools-blog]\nfor updates and announcements regarding the maintenance plans and timelines.\n\nA maintenance mode message may be emitted by this package on startup. \nTo suppress this message, use an environment variable:\n\n```sh\nAWS_SDK_JS_SUPPRESS_MAINTENANCE_MODE_MESSAGE=1 node my_program.js\n```\n\nor a JavaScript setting as follows:\n```js\nvar SDK = require('aws-sdk');\nrequire('aws-sdk/lib/maintenance_mode_message').suppress = true;\n```\n\n[v3-new-issue]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/issues/new?assignees=&labels=needs-triage%2Cv2-v3-inconsistency&projects=&template=v2-to-v3-migration.yml&title=MIGRATION+ISSUE%3A+%5BYour+Title+Here%5D\n[v2-maintenance-mode]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-javascript-v2\n[v3-recommended-blog]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/why-and-how-you-should-use-aws-sdk-for-javascript-v3-on-node-js-18/\n[v3-contributing]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3#giving-feedback-and-contributing\n[aws-sdk-js-v3]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/welcome.html\n[aws-devtools-blog]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/\n[open-issue-v3-guidance]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/issues/new?assignees=&labels=guidance%2C+needs-triage&template=---questions---help.md&title=\n[aws-sdk-js-codemod]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk-js-codemod\n\n## Table of Contents:\n* [Getting Started](#getting-Started)\n* [Getting Help](#getting-help)\n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Getting Started\n\n## How To Install\n\n### In the Browser\n\nTo use the SDK in the browser, simply add the following script tag to your\nHTML pages:\n\n    <script src=\"https://sdk.amazonaws.com/js/aws-sdk-2.1692.0.min.js\"></script>\n\nYou can also build a custom browser SDK with your specified set of AWS services.\nThis can allow you to reduce the SDK's size, specify different API versions of\nservices, or use AWS services that don't currently support CORS if you are\nworking in an environment that does not enforce CORS. To get started:\n\nhttp://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/building-sdk-for-browsers.html\n\nThe AWS SDK is also compatible with [browserify](http://browserify.org).\n\nFor browser-based web, mobile and hybrid apps, you can use [AWS Amplify Library](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/?utm_source=aws-js-sdk&utm_campaign=browser) which extends the AWS SDK and provides an easier and declarative interface.\n\n### In Node.js\n\nThe preferred way to install the AWS SDK for Node.js is to use the\n[npm](http://npmjs.org) package manager for Node.js. Simply type the following\ninto a terminal window:\n\n```sh\nnpm install aws-sdk\n```\n\n### In React Native\nTo use the SDK in a react native project, first install the SDK using npm:\n\n```sh\nnpm install aws-sdk\n```\n\nThen within your application, you can reference the react native compatible version of the SDK with the following:\n\n```javascript\nvar AWS = require('aws-sdk/dist/aws-sdk-react-native');\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use [AWS Amplify Library](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/react_native_guide?utm_source=aws-js-sdk&utm_campaign=react-native) which extends AWS SDK and provides React Native UI components and CLI support to work with AWS services.\n\n### Using Bower\n\nYou can also use [Bower](http://bower.io) to install the SDK by typing the\nfollowing into a terminal window:\n\n```sh\nbower install aws-sdk-js\n```\n\n## Usage with TypeScript\nThe AWS SDK for JavaScript bundles TypeScript definition files for use in TypeScript projects and to support tools that can read `.d.ts` files.\nOur goal is to keep these TypeScript definition files updated with each release for any public api.\n\n### Pre-requisites\nBefore you can begin using these TypeScript definitions with your project, you need to make sure your project meets a few of these requirements:\n\n * Use latest version of TypeScript. We recommend 4.x+\n * Includes the TypeScript definitions for node. You can use npm to install this by typing the following into a terminal window:\n\n    ```sh\n    npm install --save-dev @types/node\n    ```\n\n * If you are targeting at es5 or older ECMA standards, your `tsconfig.json` has to include `'es5'` and `'es2015.promise'` under `compilerOptions.lib`.\n See [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/ts/tsconfig.json) for an example.\n\n### In the Browser\nTo use the TypeScript definition files with the global `AWS` object in a front-end project, add the following line to the top of your JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\n/// <reference types=\"aws-sdk\" />\n```\n\nThis will provide support for the global `AWS` object.\n\n### In Node.js\nTo use the TypeScript definition files within a Node.js project, simply import `aws-sdk` as you normally would.\n\nIn a TypeScript file:\n\n```javascript\n// import entire SDK\nimport AWS from 'aws-sdk';\n// import AWS object without services\nimport AWS from 'aws-sdk/global';\n// import individual service\nimport S3 from 'aws-sdk/clients/s3';\n```\n\n**NOTE:** You need to add `\"esModuleInterop\": true` to compilerOptions of your `tsconfig.json`. If not possible, use like `import * as AWS from 'aws-sdk'`.\n\nIn a JavaScript file:\n\n```javascript\n// import entire SDK\nvar AWS = require('aws-sdk');\n// import AWS object without services\nvar AWS = require('aws-sdk/global');\n// import individual service\nvar S3 = require('aws-sdk/clients/s3');\n```\n\n### With React\n\nTo create React applications with AWS SDK, you can use [AWS Amplify Library](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/react_guide?utm_source=aws-js-sdk&utm_campaign=react) which provides React components and CLI support to work with AWS services.\n\n### With Angular\nDue to the SDK's reliance on node.js typings, you may encounter compilation \n[issues](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/1271) when using the\ntypings provided by the SDK in an Angular project created using the Angular CLI.\n\nTo resolve these issues, either add `\"types\": [\"node\"]` to the project's `tsconfig.app.json`\nfile, or remove the `\"types\"` field entirely.\n\n[AWS Amplify Library](https://aws.github.io/aws-amplify/media/angular_guide?utm_source=aws-js-sdk&utm_campaign=angular) provides Angular components and CLI support to work with AWS services.\n\n### Known Limitations\nThere are a few known limitations with the bundled TypeScript definitions at this time:\n\n * Service client typings reflect the latest `apiVersion`, regardless of which `apiVersion` is specified when creating a client.\n * Service-bound parameters use the `any` type.\n\n# Getting Help\n\nThe best way to interact with our team is through GitHub. \nYou can [open an issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/new/choose) and choose from one of our templates for \n[bug reports](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2C+needs-triage&template=---bug-report.md&title=), \n[feature requests](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feature-request&template=---feature-request.md&title=) \nor [guidance](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/issues/new?assignees=&labels=guidance%2C+needs-triage&template=---questions---help.md&title=). \nYou may also find help on community resources such as [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-sdk-js) with the tag #aws-sdk-js.\nIf you have a support plan with [AWS Support](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/), you can also create a new support case.\n\nPlease make sure to check out our resources too before opening an issue:\n* Our [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html) and [API reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/)\n* Our [Changelog](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for recent changes.\n* Our [code examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/sdk-code-samples.html).\n\nPlease see [SERVICES.md](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js/blob/master/SERVICES.md) for a list of supported services.\n\n# Maintenance and support for SDK major versions\nFor information about maintenance and support for SDK major versions and their underlying dependencies, see the following in the [AWS SDKs and Tools Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/overview.html):\n* [AWS SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/maint-policy.html)\n* [AWS SDKs and Tools Version Support Matrix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/version-support-matrix.html)\n\n\n\n# Contributing\nWe welcome community contributions and pull requests.

          "content": "# @!title Upgrading Notes (1.x to 2.0)\n\n# Upgrading Notes (1.x to 2.0)\n\nThis document captures breaking changes from 1.x versions to the first\nstable 2.x (non-RC) release of the AWS SDK for JavaScript.\n\n## 1. Automatic Conversion of Base64 and Timestamp Types on Input/Output\n\nThe SDK will now automatically encode and decode base64-encoded values, as well\nas timestamp values, on the user's behalf. This change affects any operation\nwhere Base64 or Timestamp values were sent by a request or returned in a\nresponse, i.e., `AWS.DynamoDB` and `AWS.SQS`, which allow for Base64\nencoded values.\n\nUser code that previously did base64 conversion no longer requires this.\nFurthermore, values encoded as base64 are now returned as Buffer objects\nfrom server responses (and can also be passed as Buffer input). For\nexample, the following 1.x `SQS.sendMessage()` parameters:\n\n```javascript\nvar params = {\n  MessageBody: 'Some Message',\n  MessageAttributes: {\n    attrName: {\n      DataType: 'Binary',\n      BinaryValue: new Buffer('example text').toString('base64')\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nCan be rewritten as:\n\n```javascript\nvar params = {\n  MessageBody: 'Some Message',\n  MessageAttributes: {\n    attrName: {\n      DataType: 'Binary',\n      BinaryValue: 'example text'\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAnd the message will be read as:\n\n```javascript\nsqs.receiveMessage(params, function(err, data) {\n  // buf is <Buffer 65 78 61 6d 70 6c 65 20 74 65 78 74>\n  var buf = data.Messages[0].MessageAttributes.attrName.BinaryValue;\n  console.log(buf.toString()); // \"example text\"\n});\n```\n\n## 2. Moved response.data.RequestId to response.requestId\n\nThe SDK now stores request IDs for all services in a consistent place on the\nresponse object, rather than inside the response.data property. This is to\nimprove consistency across services that expose request IDs in different ways.\nNote that this is also a breaking change that renames the\n`response.data.RequestId` property to `response.requestId`\n(or `this.requestId` inside of a callback).\n\nTo migrate your code, change:\n\n```javascript\nsvc.operation(params, function (err, data) {\n  console.log('Request ID:', data.RequestId);\n});\n```\n\nTo the following:\n\n```javascript\nsvc.operation(params, function () {\n  console.log('Request ID:', this.requestId);\n});\n```\n\n## 3. Exposed Wrapper Elements \n\nIf you use {AWS.ElastiCache}, {AWS.RDS}, or {AWS.Redshift}, you must now access\nthe response through the top-level output property in the response for certain\noperations. This change corrects the SDK to behave according to documentation\noutput, which was previously listing this wrapper element.\n\nExample:\n\n`RDS.describeEngineDefaultParameters()` used to return:\n\n```javascript\n{ Parameters: [ ... ] }\n```\n\nThis operation now returns:\n\n```javascript\n{ EngineDefaults: { Parameters: [ ... ] } }\n```\n\nThe full list of affected operations for each service are:\n\n**AWS.ElastiCache**: authorizeCacheSecurityGroupIngress, createCacheCluster,\ncreateCacheParameterGroup, createCacheSecurityGroup, createCacheSubnetGroup,\ncreateReplicationGroup, deleteCacheCluster, deleteReplicationGroup,\ndescribeEngineDefaultParameters, modifyCacheCluster, modifyCacheSubnetGroup,\nmodifyReplicationGroup, purchaseReservedCacheNodesOffering, rebootCacheCluster,\nrevokeCacheSecurityGroupIngress\n\n**AWS.RDS**: addSourceIdentifierToSubscription, authorizeDBSecurityGroupIngress,\ncopyDBSnapshot, createDBInstance, createDBInstanceReadReplica,\ncreateDBParameterGroup, createDBSecurityGroup, createDBSnapshot,\ncreateDBSubnetGroup, createEventSubscription, createOptionGroup,\ndeleteDBInstance, deleteDBSnapshot, deleteEventSubscription,\ndescribeEngineDefaultParameters, modifyDBInstance, modifyDBSubnetGroup,\nmodifyEventSubscription, modifyOptionGroup, promoteReadReplica,\npurchaseReservedDBInstancesOffering, rebootDBInstance,\nremoveSourceIdentifierFromSubscription, restoreDBInstanceFromDBSnapshot,\nrestoreDBInstanceToPointInTime, revokeDBSecurityGroupIngress\n\n**AWS.Redshift**: authorizeClusterSecurityGroupIngress, authorizeSnapshotAccess,\ncopyClusterSnapshot, createCluster, createClusterParameterGroup,\ncreateClusterSecurityGroup, createClusterSnapshot, createClusterSubnetGroup,\ncreateEventSubscription, createHsmClientCertificate, createHsmConfiguration,\ndeleteCluster, deleteClusterSnapshot, describeDefaultClusterParameters,\ndisableSnapshotCopy, enableSnapshotCopy, modifyCluster,\nmodifyClusterSubnetGroup, modifyEventSubscription,\nmodifySnapshotCopyRetentionPeriod, purchaseReservedNodeOffering, rebootCluster,\nrestoreFromClusterSnapshot, revokeClusterSecurityGroupIngress,\nrevokeSnapshotAccess, rotateEncryptionKey\n\n## 4. Dropped `.Client` and `.client` Properties\n\nThe `.Client` and `.client` properties have been removed from Service objects.\nIf you are using the `.Client` property on a Service class or a `.client`\nproperty on an instance of the service, remove these properties from your code.\n\nUpgrading example:\n\nThe following 1.x code:\n\n```\nvar sts = new AWS.STS.Client();\n// or\nvar sts = new AWS.STS();\n\nsts.client.operation(...);\n```\n\nShould be changed to the following:\n\n```\nvar sts = new AWS.STS();\nsts.operation(...)\n```\n"
