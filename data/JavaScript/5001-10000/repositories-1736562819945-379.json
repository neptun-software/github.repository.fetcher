There are\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,\nthis simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as\npart of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see\nyour current agreements on file or to sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n## Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult\n[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more\ninformation on using pull requests.\n\nWe require unit tests for most code, instructions for running our unit test\nsuites are in the documentation.\n\n## Content\n\nGenerally speaking, we are trying to keep this list to a small set of\nhigh-quality, curated examples. If you want to add a new example, please\nconsult with us (in Github Issues) before creating a new example. We don't\nwant to see you go through all of the work of creating a new example and us not\nbeing in a place to accept it.\n\nWe certainly invite you to create examples and post them on Github for others\nto learn from. You can share your progress with others in community in Github\nIssues.\n"

`getting_started`, all the examples require the following dependencies to be installed.\n\n - Node.js version 8.9 or higher\n - [NPM cli](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) OR [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)\n\n## How to build an example\n`cd` into the directory\n\nIf you are using `yarn`:\n\n```sh\ncd mnist-core\nyarn\nyarn watch\n```\n\nIf you are using `npm`:\n```sh\ncd mnist-core\nnpm install\nnpm run watch\n```\n\n### Details\n\nThe convention is that each example contains two scripts:\n\n- `yarn watch` or `npm run watch`: starts a local development HTTP server which watches the\nfilesystem for changes so you can edit the code (JS or HTML) and see changes when you refresh the page immediately.\n\n- `yarn build` or `npm run build`: generates a `dist/` folder which contains the build artifacts and\ncan be used for deployment.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to contribute an example, please reach out to us on\n[Github issues](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs/issues)\nbefore sending us a pull request as we are trying to keep this set of examples\nsmall and highly curated.\n\n### Running Presubmit Tests\n\nBefore you send a pull request, it is a good idea to run the presubmit tests\nand make sure they all pass. To do that, execute the following commands in the\nroot directory of tfjs-examples:\n\n```sh\nyarn\nyarn presubmit\n```\n\nThe `yarn presubmit` command executes the unit tests and lint checks of all\nthe exapmles that contain the `yarn test` and/or `yarn lint` scripts. You\nmay also run the tests for individual exampls by cd'ing into their respective\nsubdirectory and executing `yarn`, followed by `yarn test` and/or `yarn lint`.\n"
