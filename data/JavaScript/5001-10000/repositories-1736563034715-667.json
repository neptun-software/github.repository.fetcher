This makes understanding blockchains a necessarily harder task, than it must be. Especially source-code-wisely. This project is an attempt to provide as concise and simple implementation of a blockchain as possible.\n\n \n### What is blockchain\n[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain_(database)) : Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously-growing list of records called blocks secured from tampering and revision.\n\n### Key concepts of Naivechain\nCheck also [this blog post](https://medium.com/@lhartikk/a-blockchain-in-200-lines-of-code-963cc1cc0e54#.dttbm9afr5) for a more detailed overview of the key concepts\n* HTTP interface to control the node\n* Use Websockets to communicate with other nodes (P2P)\n* Super simple \"protocols\" in P2P communication\n* Data is not persisted in nodes\n* No proof-of-work or proof-of-stake: a block can be added to the blockchain without competition\n\n\n![alt tag](naivechain_blockchain.png)\n\n![alt tag](naivechain_components.png)\n\n\n### Naivecoin\nFor a more extensive tutorial about blockchains, you can check the project [Naivecoin](https://lhartikk.github.io/). It is based on Naivechain and implements for instance Proof-of-work, transactions and wallets.\n\n### Quick start\n(set up two connected nodes and mine 1 block)\n```\nnpm install\nHTTP_PORT=3001 P2P_PORT=6001 npm start\nHTTP_PORT=3002 P2P_PORT=6002 PEERS=ws://localhost:6001 npm start\ncurl -H \"Content-type:application/json\" --data '{\"data\" : \"Some data to the first block\"}' http://localhost:3001/mineBlock\n```\n\n### Quick start with Docker\n(set up three connected nodes and mine a block)\n###\n```sh\ndocker-compose up\ncurl -H \"Content-type:application/json\" --data '{\"data\" : \"Some data to the first block\"}' http://localhost:3001/mineBlock\n```\n\n### HTTP API\n##### Get blockchain\n```\ncurl http://localhost:3001/blocks\n```\n##### Create block\n```\ncurl -H \"Content-type:application/json\" --data '{\"data\" : \"Some data to the first block\"}' http://localhost:3001/mineBlock\n``` \n##### Add peer\n```\ncurl -H \"Content-type:application/json\" --data '{\"peer\" : \"ws://localhost:6001\"}' http://localhost:3001/addPeer\n```\n#### Query connected peers\n```\ncurl http://localhost:3001/peers\n```\n"
