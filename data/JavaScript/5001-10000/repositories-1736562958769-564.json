Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3.

If you're working with [older browsers versions which do not implement e.g. TransformStreams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream#browser_compatibility), you can manually\n    load the [Web Streams polyfill](https://github.com/MattiasBuelens/web-streams-polyfills).\n    Please note that when you load the polyfills, the global `ReadableStream` property (if it exists) gets overwritten with the polyfill version.\n    In some edge cases, you might need to use the native\n    `ReadableStream` (for example when using it to create a `Response`\n    object), in which case you should store a reference to it before loading\n    the polyfills. There is also the [web-streams-adapter](https://github.com/MattiasBuelens/web-streams-adapter)\n    library to convert back and forth between them.\n  * In Node.js: OpenPGP.js v6 no longer supports native Node `Readable` streams in inputs, and instead expects (and outputs) [Node's Web Streams](https://nodejs.org/api/webstreams.html#class-readablestream). [Node v17+ includes utilities to convert from and to Web Streams](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#streamreadabletowebstreamreadable-options).\n\n\n### Performance\n\n* Version 3.0.0 of the library introduced support for public-key cryptography using [elliptic curves](https://wiki.gnupg.org/ECC). We use native implementations on browsers and Node.js when available. Compared to RSA, elliptic curve cryptography provides stronger security per bits of key, which allows for much faster operations. Currently the following curves are supported:\n\n    | Curve           | Encryption | Signature | NodeCrypto | WebCrypto | Constant-Time     |\n    |:---------------:|:----------:|:---------:|:----------:|:---------:|:-----------------:|\n    | curve25519      | ECDH       | N/A       | No         | No        | Algorithmically  |\n    | ed25519         | N/A        | EdDSA     | No         | Yes*      | If native**      |\n    | nistP256        | ECDH       | ECDSA     | Yes*       | Yes*      | If native**      |\n    | nistP384        | ECDH       | ECDSA     | Yes*       | Yes*      | If native**      |\n    | nistP521        | ECDH       | ECDSA     | Yes*       | Yes*      | If native**      |\n    | brainpoolP256r1 | ECDH       | ECDSA     | Yes*       | No        | If native**      |\n    | brainpoolP384r1 | ECDH       | ECDSA     | Yes*       | No        | If native**      |\n    | brainpoolP512r1 | ECDH       | ECDSA     | Yes*       | No        | If native**      |\n    | secp256k1       | ECDH       | ECDSA     | Yes*       | No        | If native**      |\n\n   \\* when available  \n   \\** these curves are only constant-time if the underlying native implementation is available and constant-time\n\n* The platform's [native Web Crypto API](https://w3c.github.io/webcrypto/) is used for performance. On Node.js the native [crypto module](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html#crypto_crypto) is also used, in cases where it offers additional functionality.\n\n* The library implements authenticated encryption (AEAD) as per [RFC 9580](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9580/) using AES-GCM, OCB, or EAX. This makes symmetric encryption faster on platforms with native implementations. However, since the specification is very recent and other OpenPGP implementations are in the process of adopting it, the feature is currently behind a flag. **Note: activating this setting can break compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations which have yet to implement the feature.** You can enable it by setting `openpgp.config.aeadProtect = true`.\n  Note that this setting has a different effect from the one in OpenPGP.js v5, which implemented support for a provisional version of AEAD from [RFC 4880bis](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-rfc4880bis-10), which was modified in RFC 9580.\n\n  You can change the AEAD mode by setting one of the following options:\n\n  ```\n  openpgp.config.preferredAEADAlgorithm = openpgp.enums.aead.gcm; // Default, native in WebCrypto and Node.js\n  openpgp.config.preferredAEADAlgorithm = openpgp.enums.aead.ocb; // Non-native, but supported across RFC 9580 implementations\n  openpgp.config.preferredAEADAlgorithm = openpgp.enums.aead.eax; // Native in Node.js\n  ```\n\n### Getting started\n\n#### Node.js\n\nInstall OpenPGP.js using npm and save it in your dependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save openpgp\n```\n\nAnd import it as an ES module, from a .mjs file:\n```js\nimport * as openpgp from 'openpgp';\n```\n\nOr as a CommonJS module:\n\n```js\nconst openpgp = require('openpgp');\n```\n\n#### Deno (experimental)\n\nImport as an ES6 module, using /dist/openpgp.mjs.\n\n```js\nimport * as openpgp from './openpgpjs/dist/openpgp.mjs';\n```\n\n#### Browser (webpack)\n\nInstall OpenPGP.js using npm and save it in your devDependencies:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev openpgp\n```\n\nAnd import it as an ES6 module:\n\n```js\nimport * as openpgp from 'openpgp';\n```\n\nYou can also only import the functions you need, as follows:\n\n```js\nimport { readMessage, decrypt } from 'openpgp';\n```\n\nOr, if you want to use the lightweight build (which is smaller, and lazily loads non-default curves on demand):\n\n```js\nimport * as openpgp from 'openpgp/lightweight';\n```\n\nTo test whether the lazy loading works, try to generate a key with a non-standard curve:\n\n```js\nimport { generateKey } from 'openpgp/lightweight';\nawait generateKey({ curve: 'brainpoolP512r1',  userIDs: [{ name: 'Test', email: 'test@test.com' }] });\n```\n\nFor more examples of how to generate a key, see [Generate new key pair](#generate-new-key-pair). It is recommended to use `curve25519` instead of `brainpoolP512r1` by default.\n\n\n#### Browser (plain files)\n\nGrab `openpgp.min.js` from [unpkg.com/openpgp/dist](https://unpkg.com/openpgp/dist/), and load it in a script tag:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"openpgp.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nOr, to load OpenPGP.js as an ES6 module, grab `openpgp.min.mjs` from [unpkg.com/openpgp/dist](https://unpkg.com/openpgp/dist/), and import it as follows:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"module\">\nimport * as openpgp from './openpgp.min.mjs';\n</script>\n```\n\nTo offload cryptographic operations off the main thread, you can implement a Web Worker in your application and load OpenPGP.js from there. For an example Worker implementation, see `test/worker/worker_example.js`.\n\n#### TypeScript\n\nSince TS is not fully integrated in the library, TS-only dependencies are currently listed as `devDependencies`, so to compile the project you’ll need to add `@openpgp/web-stream-tools` manually:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save-dev @openpgp/web-stream-tools\n```\n\nIf you notice missing or incorrect type definitions, feel free to open a PR.\n\n### Examples\n\nHere are some examples of how to use OpenPGP.js v6. For more elaborate examples and working code, please check out the [public API unit tests](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/blob/main/test/general/openpgp.js). If you're upgrading from v4 it might help to check out the [changelog](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/wiki/v6-Changelog) and [documentation](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs#documentation).\n\n#### Encrypt and decrypt *Uint8Array* data with a password\n\nEncryption will use the algorithm specified in config.preferredSymmetricAlgorithm (defaults to aes256), and decryption will use the algorithm used for encryption.\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const message = await openpgp.createMessage({ binary: new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x01, 0x01]) });\n    const encrypted = await openpgp.encrypt({\n        message, // input as Message object\n        passwords: ['secret stuff'], // multiple passwords possible\n        format: 'binary' // don't ASCII armor (for Uint8Array output)\n    });\n    console.log(encrypted); // Uint8Array\n\n    const encryptedMessage = await openpgp.readMessage({\n        binaryMessage: encrypted // parse encrypted bytes\n    });\n    const { data: decrypted } = await openpgp.decrypt({\n        message: encryptedMessage,\n        passwords: ['secret stuff'], // decrypt with password\n        format: 'binary' // output as Uint8Array\n    });\n    console.log(decrypted); // Uint8Array([0x01, 0x01, 0x01])\n})();\n```\n\n#### Encrypt and decrypt *String* data with PGP keys\n\nEncryption will use the algorithm preferred by the public (encryption) key (defaults to aes256 for keys generated in OpenPGP.js), and decryption will use the algorithm used for encryption.\n\n```js\nconst openpgp = require('openpgp'); // use as CommonJS, AMD, ES6 module or via window.openpgp\n\n(async () => {\n    // put keys in backtick (``) to avoid errors caused by spaces or tabs\n    const publicKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`;\n    const privateKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----`; // encrypted private key\n    const passphrase = `yourPassphrase`; // what the private key is encrypted with\n\n    const publicKey = await openpgp.readKey({ armoredKey: publicKeyArmored });\n\n    const privateKey = await openpgp.decryptKey({\n        privateKey: await openpgp.readPrivateKey({ armoredKey: privateKeyArmored }),\n        passphrase\n    });\n\n    const encrypted = await openpgp.encrypt({\n        message: await openpgp.createMessage({ text: 'Hello, World!' }), // input as Message object\n        encryptionKeys: publicKey,\n        signingKeys: privateKey // optional\n    });\n    console.log(encrypted); // '-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE ... END PGP MESSAGE-----'\n\n    const message = await openpgp.readMessage({\n        armoredMessage: encrypted // parse armored message\n    });\n    const { data: decrypted, signatures } = await openpgp.decrypt({\n        message,\n        verificationKeys: publicKey, // optional\n        decryptionKeys: privateKey\n    });\n    console.log(decrypted); // 'Hello, World!'\n    // check signature validity (signed messages only)\n    try {\n        await signatures[0].verified; // throws on invalid signature\n        console.log('Signature is valid');\n    } catch (e) {\n        throw new Error('Signature could not be verified: ' + e.message);\n    }\n})();\n```\n\nEncrypt to multiple public keys:\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const publicKeysArmored = [\n        `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`,\n        `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`\n    ];\n    const privateKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----`;    // encrypted private key\n    const passphrase = `yourPassphrase`; // what the private key is encrypted with\n    const plaintext = 'Hello, World!';\n\n    const publicKeys = await Promise.all(publicKeysArmored.map(armoredKey => openpgp.readKey({ armoredKey })));\n\n    const privateKey = await openpgp.decryptKey({\n        privateKey: await openpgp.readKey({ armoredKey: privateKeyArmored }),\n        passphrase\n    });\n\n    const message = await openpgp.createMessage({ text: plaintext });\n    const encrypted = await openpgp.encrypt({\n        message, // input as Message object\n        encryptionKeys: publicKeys,\n        signingKeys: privateKey // optional\n    });\n    console.log(encrypted); // '-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE ... END PGP MESSAGE-----'\n})();\n```\n\nIf you expect an encrypted message to be signed with one of the public keys you have, and do not want to trust the decrypted data otherwise, you can pass the decryption option `expectSigned = true`, so that the decryption operation will fail if no valid signature is found:\n```js\n(async () => {\n    // put keys in backtick (``) to avoid errors caused by spaces or tabs\n    const publicKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`;\n    const privateKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----`; // encrypted private key\n    const passphrase = `yourPassphrase`; // what the private key is encrypted with\n\n    const publicKey = await openpgp.readKey({ armoredKey: publicKeyArmored });\n\n    const privateKey = await openpgp.decryptKey({\n        privateKey: await openpgp.readPrivateKey({ armoredKey: privateKeyArmored }),\n        passphrase\n    });\n\n    const encryptedAndSignedMessage = `-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\n...\n-----END PGP MESSAGE-----`;\n\n    const message = await openpgp.readMessage({\n        armoredMessage: encryptedAndSignedMessage // parse armored message\n    });\n    // decryption will fail if all signatures are invalid or missing\n    const { data: decrypted, signatures } = await openpgp.decrypt({\n        message,\n        decryptionKeys: privateKey,\n        expectSigned: true,\n        verificationKeys: publicKey, // mandatory with expectSigned=true\n    });\n    console.log(decrypted); // 'Hello, World!'\n})();\n```\n\n#### Encrypt symmetrically with compression\n\nBy default, `encrypt` will not use any compression when encrypting symmetrically only (i.e. when no `encryptionKeys` are given).\nIt's possible to change that behaviour by enabling compression through the config, either for the single encryption:\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const message = await openpgp.createMessage({ binary: new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]) }); // or createMessage({ text: 'string' })\n    const encrypted = await openpgp.encrypt({\n        message,\n        passwords: ['secret stuff'], // multiple passwords possible\n        config: { preferredCompressionAlgorithm: openpgp.enums.compression.zlib } // compress the data with zlib\n    });\n})();\n```\n\nor by changing the default global configuration:\n```js\nopenpgp.config.preferredCompressionAlgorithm = openpgp.enums.compression.zlib\n```\n\nWhere the value can be any of:\n * `openpgp.enums.compression.zip`\n * `openpgp.enums.compression.zlib`\n * `openpgp.enums.compression.uncompressed` (default)\n\n\n\n#### Streaming encrypt *Uint8Array* data with a password\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const readableStream = new ReadableStream({\n        start(controller) {\n            controller.enqueue(new Uint8Array([0x01, 0x02, 0x03]));\n            controller.close();\n        }\n    });\n\n    const message = await openpgp.createMessage({ binary: readableStream });\n    const encrypted = await openpgp.encrypt({\n        message, // input as Message object\n        passwords: ['secret stuff'], // multiple passwords possible\n        format: 'binary' // don't ASCII armor (for Uint8Array output)\n    });\n    console.log(encrypted); // raw encrypted packets as ReadableStream<Uint8Array>\n\n    // Either pipe the above stream somewhere, pass it to another function,\n    // or read it manually as follows:\n    for await (const chunk of encrypted) {\n        console.log('new chunk:', chunk); // Uint8Array\n    }\n})();\n```\n\nFor more information on using ReadableStreams (both in browsers and Node.js), see [the MDN Documentation on the\nStreams API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Streams_API) .\n\n#### Streaming encrypt and decrypt *String* data with PGP keys\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const publicKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`; // Public key\n    const privateKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----`; // Encrypted private key\n    const passphrase = `yourPassphrase`; // Password that private key is encrypted with\n\n    const publicKey = await openpgp.readKey({ armoredKey: publicKeyArmored });\n\n    const privateKey = await openpgp.decryptKey({\n        privateKey: await openpgp.readPrivateKey({ armoredKey: privateKeyArmored }),\n        passphrase\n    });\n\n    const readableStream = new ReadableStream({\n        start(controller) {\n            controller.enqueue('Hello, world!');\n            controller.close();\n        }\n    });\n\n    const encrypted = await openpgp.encrypt({\n        message: await openpgp.createMessage({ text: readableStream }), // input as Message object\n        encryptionKeys: publicKey,\n        signingKeys: privateKey // optional\n    });\n    console.log(encrypted); // ReadableStream containing '-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE ... END PGP MESSAGE-----'\n\n    const message = await openpgp.readMessage({\n        armoredMessage: encrypted // parse armored message\n    });\n    const decrypted = await openpgp.decrypt({\n        message,\n        verificationKeys: publicKey, // optional\n        decryptionKeys: privateKey\n    });\n    const chunks = [];\n    for await (const chunk of decrypted.data) {\n        chunks.push(chunk);\n    }\n    const plaintext = chunks.join('');\n    console.log(plaintext); // 'Hello, World!'\n})();\n```\n\n\n#### Generate new key pair\n\nECC keys (smaller and faster to generate):\n\nPossible values for `curve` are: `curve25519`, `ed25519`, `nistP256`, `nistP384`, `nistP521`,\n`brainpoolP256r1`, `brainpoolP384r1`, `brainpoolP512r1`, and `secp256k1`.\nNote that both the `curve25519` and `ed25519` options generate a primary key for signing using Ed25519\nand a subkey for encryption using Curve25519.\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const { privateKey, publicKey, revocationCertificate } = await openpgp.generateKey({\n        type: 'ecc', // Type of the key, defaults to ECC\n        curve: 'curve25519', // ECC curve name, defaults to curve25519\n        userIDs: [{ name: 'Jon Smith', email: 'jon@example.com' }], // you can pass multiple user IDs\n        passphrase: 'super long and hard to guess secret', // protects the private key\n        format: 'armored' // output key format, defaults to 'armored' (other options: 'binary' or 'object')\n    });\n\n    console.log(privateKey);     // '-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK ... '\n    console.log(publicKey);      // '-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK ... '\n    console.log(revocationCertificate); // '-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK ... '\n})();\n```\n\nRSA keys (increased compatibility):\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const { privateKey, publicKey } = await openpgp.generateKey({\n        type: 'rsa', // Type of the key\n        rsaBits: 4096, // RSA key size (defaults to 4096 bits)\n        userIDs: [{ name: 'Jon Smith', email: 'jon@example.com' }], // you can pass multiple user IDs\n        passphrase: 'super long and hard to guess secret' // protects the private key\n    });\n})();\n```\n\n#### Revoke a key\n\nUsing a revocation certificate:\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const { publicKey: revokedKeyArmored } = await openpgp.revokeKey({\n        key: await openpgp.readKey({ armoredKey: publicKeyArmored }),\n        revocationCertificate,\n        format: 'armored' // output armored keys\n    });\n    console.log(revokedKeyArmored); // '-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK ... '\n})();\n```\n\nUsing the private key:\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const { publicKey: revokedKeyArmored } = await openpgp.revokeKey({\n        key: await openpgp.readKey({ armoredKey: privateKeyArmored }),\n        format: 'armored' // output armored keys\n    });\n    console.log(revokedKeyArmored); // '-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK ... '\n})();\n```\n\n#### Sign and verify cleartext messages\n\n```js\n(async () => {\n    const publicKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`;\n    const privateKeyArmored = `-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----\n...\n-----END PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----`; // encrypted private key\n    const passphrase = `yourPassphrase`; // what the private key is encrypted with\n\n    const publicKey = await openpgp.readKey({ armoredKey: publicKeyArmored });\n\n    const privateKey = await openpgp.decryptKey({\n        privateKey: await openpgp.readPrivateKey({ armoredKey: privateKeyArmored }),\n        passphrase\n    });\n\n    const unsignedMessage = await openpgp.createCleartextMessage({ text: 'Hello, World!' });\n    const cleartextMessage = await openpgp.sign({\n        message: unsignedMessage, // CleartextMessage or Message object\n        signingKeys: privateKey\n    });\n    console.log(cleartextMessage); // '-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE ...

The first audit's report has been published [here](https://github.com/openpgpjs/openpgpjs/wiki/Cure53-security-audit).\n\n### Security recommendations\n\nIt should be noted that js crypto apps deployed via regular web hosting (a.k.a. [**host-based security**](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2012/08/cryptocat.html)) provide users with less security than installable apps with auditable static versions. Installable apps can be deployed as a [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Marketplace/Options/Packaged_apps) or [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/about_apps.html) packaged app. These apps are basically signed zip files and their runtimes typically enforce a strict [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/security/content-security-policy/) to protect users against [XSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting). This [blogpost](https://tankredhase.com/2014/04/13/heartbleed-and-javascript-crypto/) explains the trust model of the web quite well.\n\nIt is also recommended to set a strong passphrase that protects the user's private key on disk.\n\n### Development\n\nTo create your own build of the library, just run the following command after cloning the git repo. This will download all dependencies, run the tests and create a minified bundle under `dist/openpgp.min.js` to use in your project:\n\n    npm install && npm test\n\nFor debugging browser errors, run the following command:\n\n    npm run browsertest\n\n### How do I get involved?\n\nYou want to help, great! It's probably best to send us a message on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/openpgpjs/openpgpjs) before you start your undertaking, to make sure nobody else is working on it, and so we can discuss the best course of action. Other than that, just go ahead and fork our repo, make your changes and send us a pull request! :)\n\n### License\n\n[GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html) (3.0 or any later version).
