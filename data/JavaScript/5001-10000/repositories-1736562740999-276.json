This week I learnt about Groovy AST transformations. AST transformations allows you to hook into the Groovy compilation process so that you can customize it to meet your needs. In this blog, you will learn how to write an AST transformation that will add a `toHash` method to a class. `toHash` method will generate a hash for your object. You will be able to provide hash algorithm of your choice. We will use Java's `java.security.MessageDigest` to generate the hash code.\n\n35. **[Week 34: August 21, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/34-aws-lambda)** [Automating Your Static Website Social Notifications with AWS Lambda](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/34-aws-lambda/README.md). AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform that executes your code in response to events. It manages the underlying infrastructure scaling it up or down to meet the event rate. You are only charged for the time your code is executed. AWS Lambda currently supports Java, Python, and Node.js language runtimes.\n\n36. **[Week 36: September 04, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/36-webpack)** [Webpack: The Missing Tutorial](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/36-webpack/README.md). webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.\n\n37. **[Week 37: September 11, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/37-spring-boot-scala)** [Building \"Bootiful\" Scala Web Applications with Spring Boot](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/37-spring-boot-scala/README.md). In this post, I will quickly show you how to use Spring Boot with Scala by converting Spring Boot's official *Building a RESTful Web Service* guide to Scala.\n\n38. **[Week 38: September 18, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/38-akka)** [Actor System Termination on JVM Shutdown](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/38-akka/README.md). In this short post, I will discuss how to cleanly shutdown Akka ActorSystem on JVM exit.\n\n39. **[Week 39: October 07, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/39-docker)** [Docker for Java Developers Part 1](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/39-docker/README.md). This week I had to give a talk on Docker ecosystem so I spent a lot of my after office hours preparing for the talk. [Docker](http://docker.com/) is a container technology that allows us to package an application and its dependencies together in a filesystem so that they can be deployed together on any server. This helps us achieve package once deploy anywhere. So, in the next few posts of this series, we will learn how Java developers can get started with Docker.\n\n40. **[Week 40: October 19, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/40-docker-cron)** [Using Docker Containers As Cron Jobs](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/40-docker-cron/README.md): This week I was working on a problem that required cron jobs. The use case was that after user registers with the application, we will create a cron job that will track his/her social activities. We will have one container per user. I wanted to keep cron jobs to work in a different process from the main application so that different concerns of the application don't intermingle. In my view, containers provide the right abstraction to solve this use case.\n\n41. **[Week 41: December 04, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/41-akka-dispatcher)** [Understanding Akka Dispatcher](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/blob/master/41-akka-dispatcher/README.md):  [Akka](http://akka.io/) is a toolkit and runtime for building highly concurrent, distributed and resilient message driven systems. This post assumes you already know Akka. Actor needs a dispatcher to perform its task. A dispatcher relies on executor to provide thread. There are two types of executors a dispatcher can have: 1) `fork-join-executor` 2) `thread-pool-executor`. In this post, we will understand how you can configure `fork-join-executor` and `thread-pool-executor` to meet your needs.\n\n42. **[Week 42: December 08, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/42-docker-compose)** [Using Docker Compose with wait-for-it](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/blob/master/42-docker-compose/README.md):   Today, we will learn about Docker Compose, a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. This post will also cover how to use Docker Compose with [wait-for-it](https://github.com/vishnubob/wait-for-it). `wait-for-it` is a simple bash utility to test and wait for the availability of TCP host and port.\n\n43. **[Week 43: December 26, 2016](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/tree/master/43-graphql)** [GraphQL - building a pokedex in React with GraphQL](https://github.com/shekhargulati/52-technologies-in-2016/blob/master/43-graphql/README.md): [GraphQL](http://graphql.org), a query language that is starting to get more and more attention. Facebook, who internally used GraphQL since 2012 and released a first specification and reference implementation of GraphQL in 2015 announced GraphQL to be [production ready] in September 2016. What followed is a trend of more and more companies starting to use GraphQL, such as GitHub, Coursera and Shopify.\n\n-----------\nYou can follow me on twitter at [https://twitter.com/shekhargulati](https://twitter.com/shekhargulati) or email me at <shekhargulati84@gmail.com>.
