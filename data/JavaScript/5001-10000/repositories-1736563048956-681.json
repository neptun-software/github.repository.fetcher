Thanks!\n\n\nUnreleased (aka. GitHub master)\n-------------------------------\n\n- In *Collapsible Headings*, get the notebook version from `sys_info` if possible, resolving an incompatibility with *notebook* versions 6.5.x [#1617](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1617).\n- Add short execution threshold for ExecutionTime plugin. Excution time will not show on cells that executed faster than the given threshold [#1336](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1336).\n\n0.7.0\n-----\n\n - Remove dependency on latex_envs [#1603](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1603)\n - Remove scripts entry in setup.py [#1612](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1612)\n - Fix typos [#1604](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1604)  \n\n0.6.0\n-----\n - Fix CI\n - Add license.txt in setup.cfg\n - Fix Readme \n\n0.5.3\n-----\n\n- Replace `template_path` with `extra_template_paths` [#1532](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1532). Nbconvert 6.0 replaced `template_path` with `extra_template_paths` (see https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#significant-changes). This change in Nbconvert 6.0 causes errors in jupyter_latex_envs and in jupyter_contrib_nbextensions (see [#1529](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/1529).\n- Update `install_requires` list in `setup.py` with 'nbconvert >=6.0' \n- Drop support for python < 3.6\n- [toc2] fix for disappearing sidebar in static html_toc export [#1548](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1548)  \n- Fix Extensions Not Loading for Large Notebooks [#1499](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1499)\n- Support non-live notebook such as nbconvert output [#1535](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1535)\n\n0.5.1\n-----\n\n- Fix for navigation hotkeys [#1378](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1378)\n- `gist_it` Making github endpoint configurable to support publishing gists to Github Enterprise [#1364](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1364)\n- Fix treefilter [#1359](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1359)\n- Enable ruler extension in editor [#1296](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1296)\n- Several spelling fixes\n- Configure `code_prettify` extension to load custom yapf styles by default [#1376](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1376)\n\nTravis/AppVeyor testing is currently broken due to outdated configuration. Will hopefully be working in 0.5.2 again.\n\n0.5.0\n-----\n\nRepo-level stuff:\n\n- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md`\n  (fixes [#1224](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/1224))\n  [#1225](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1225)\n   [@consideratio](https://github.com/consideratio)\n- [ci] allow lint failure on travis\n  [#1228](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1228)\n  [@jcb91](https://github.com/jcb91)\n- Fix some travis warnings and errors\n  [#1251](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1251)\n  [@juhasch](https://github.com/juhasch)\n- Remove OSX travis run (OSX still supported, but travis run kept failing without being any significant difference to linux run)\n  [#1253](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1253)\n  [@juhasch/fix](https://github.com/juhasch/fix)\n- fix travis for py27\n  [#1265](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1265)\n  [@jcb91](https://github.com/jcb91)\n\nNew features and bugfixes:\n\n- `load_tex_macros` __new nbextension added!__\n  [#1257](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1257)\n  [@ketch](https://github.com/ketch)\n- `cell_filter` __new nbextension added!__\n  [#1240](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1240)\n  [@benelot](https://github.com/benelot)\n- `execution_dependencies` __new nbextension added!__\n  [#1213](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1213)\n  [@benelot](https://github.com/benelot)\n- `isort` __new nbextension added!__\n  First implementation based on code_prettify\n  [#1204](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1204)\n  [@benjaminabel](https://github.com/benjaminabel)\n- require newer `jupyter_highlight_selected_word`\n  [#1270](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1270)\n  [@jcb91](https://github.com/jcb91)\n- Fix for long button labels in `code_prettify` and variants\n  [#1268](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1268)\n  [@jfbercher](https://github.com/jfbercher)\n- Bugfix for `collapsible_headings` key bindings conflict\n  [#1264](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1264)\n  [@rhilenova](https://github.com/rhilenova)\n- `kernel_exec_on_cells`,\n  make shift-click on button autoformat all cells\n  [#1219](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1219)\n  [@jcb91](https://github.com/jcb91)\n- `scroll_down` ensure output will scroll down in new cells\n  [#1227](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1227)\n  [@cjld](https://github.com/cjld)\n- `init_cell` Warning dialog now always relevant, fixes [#1223](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/1223).

You can discuss improvements in issues and implement them in pull requests.\n\nBecause this is a volunteer effort, we cannot provide support for all of the extensions.\nSo if you contribute a new extension, please stick around and help others using it.\n\n## Create an issue\n\nDo not hesitate to open up an issue, you can discuss bugs, improvements or new extensions in them. Creating an issue is a good starting point for code contributions. The community can support you with experience of similar extensions, pros and cons, what to look for etc.\n\nHere is an example issue of how @benelot did it that worked pretty smoothly: [#1193](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/1193)\n\n## Setup development\n\nFor small things like fixing typos in documentation, you can [make edits through GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/), which will handle forking and making a pull request (PR) for you. For anything bigger or more complex, you'll probably want to set up a development environment, a quick procedure for which is as folows:\n\n1. __Fork and clone__\n   First fork this repo, then clone your fork. In this way you become prepared to make a pull request.\n\n   ```shell\n   # clone your fork\n   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions.git\n   cd jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n   ```\n\n2. __Setup__\n\n   If you're using python in combination with some form of virtual environment (e.g. conda, virtualenv), make sure you have the correct environment (the one from which you run `jupyter notebook`) active before running these commands!\n\n   ```shell\n   # run from the main directory, where setup.py is\n   pip install --editable .\n\n   # on windows, remove the --symlink flag and re-run the command each time you make changes\n   jupyter-contrib-nbextension install --sys-prefix --symlink\n   ```\n\n## Create an extension\n\nAdd a folder with the name of your new extension to [jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions). Check out the [Jupyter Notebook extension structure link](http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internals.html) to know what has to be in that folder and what the general conventions are.\n\n## Create a pull request\n\nAs you are ready with your code contribution, make a pull-request to the main repo and briefly explain what you have done.\n\nHere is an example pull request of how @benelot did it that worked super well: [#1213](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/pull/1213)\n\nPlease also update the [unreleased section](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#unreleased-aka-github-master) of the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) to note what you've added or fixed.\n"

You will find a list of alternative extensions for\nJupyterLab on [jupyterlab-contrib](https://jupyterlab-contrib.github.io/migrate_from_classical.html).\n\n\nDocumentation\n=============\n\nDocumentation for all maintained extensions can be found at\n[jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io](https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest)\n\nAll extensions that are maintained and active\nhave at least a  yaml file to allow them being configured using the\n[jupyter_nbextensions_configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator)\nserver extension, which is installed as a dependency of this package.\nMost also have a markdown readme file for documentation.\nThe `jupyter_nbextensions_configurator` server extension shows an nbextensions\ntab on the main notebook dashboard (file tree page) from which you can see each\nnbextension's markdown readme, and configure its options.\nTo view documentation without installing, you can check the list at\n[jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions.html](http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions.html),\nor browse the nbextensions\ndirectory to read markdown readmes on github at\n[github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions).\n\nSome extensions are not documented. We encourage you to add documentation for them.\n\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nTo install the `jupyter_contrib_nbextensions` notebook extensions, three steps\nare required. First, the Python pip package needs to be installed. Then, the\nnotebook extensions themselves need to be copied to the Jupyter data directory.\nFinally, the installed notebook extensions can be enabled, either by using\nbuilt-in Jupyter commands, or more conveniently by using the\n[jupyter_nbextensions_configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator)\nserver extension, which is installed as a dependency of this repo.\n\nThe Python package installation step is necessary to allow painless\ninstallation of the nbextensions together with additional items like nbconvert\ntemplates, pre-/postprocessors, and exporters.\n\n\n1\\. Install the python package\n------------------------------\n\n\n### PIP\n\nAll of the nbextensions in this repo are provided as parts of a python package,\nwhich is installable in the usual manner using `pip` or the `setup.py` script.\nTo install the current version from PyPi, simply type\n\n    pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n\nAlternatively, you can install directly from the current master branch of the\nrepository\n\n    pip install https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tarball/master\n\nAll the usual pip options apply, e.g. using pip's `--upgrade` flag to force an\nupgrade, or `-e` for an editable install.\n\n\n### Conda\n\nThere are conda packages for the notebook extensions and the\n[jupyter_nbextensions_configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator)\navailable from [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.github.io).\nYou can install both using\n\n    conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n\nThis also automatically installs the Javascript and CSS files\n(using `jupyter contrib nbextension install --sys-prefix`), therefore \nthe second installation step below can be skipped.\n\n\n### Installation from cloned Repo\n\nYou can also install from a cloned repo, which can be useful for development.\nYou can clone the repo using\n\n    git clone https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions.git\n\nThen perform an editable pip install using\n\n    pip install -e jupyter_contrib_nbextensions\n\n\n2\\. Install javascript and css files\n------------------------------------\n\nThis step copies the nbextensions' javascript and css files into the jupyter\nserver's search directory, and edits some jupyter config files.\nA `jupyter` subcommand is provided for the purpose:\n\n    jupyter contrib nbextension install --user\n\nThe command does two things: installs nbextension files, and edits nbconvert\nconfig files. The first part is essentially a wrapper around the\nnotebook-provided `jupyter nbextension install`, and copies relevant javascript\nand css files to the appropriate jupyter data directory.\nThe second part edits the config files `jupyter_nbconvert_config.json`and\n`jupyter_notebook_config.json` as noted below in the options.\nThe command can take most of the same options as the jupyter-provided versions,\nincluding\n\n * `--user` to install into the user's home jupyter directories\n * `--system` to perform installation into system-wide jupyter directories\n * `--sys-prefix` to install into python's `sys.prefix`, useful for instance in\n   virtual environments, such as with conda\n * `--symlink` to symlink the nbextensions rather than copying each file\n   (recommended on non-Windows platforms).\n * `--debug`, for more-verbose output\n\nIn addition, two further option flags are provided to perform either only the\nconfig-editing operations, or only the file-copy operations:\n\n * `--only-files` to install nbextension files without editing any config files\n * `--only-config` to edit the config files without copying/symlinking any\n   nbextension files. This edits the following files in the applicable jupyter\n   config directory:\n    - `jupyter_nbconvert_config.json` to use some of the classes provided\n      in the python module `jupyter_contrib_nbextensions.nbconvert_support`\n    - `jupyter_notebook_config.json` to enable the serverextension\n      `jupyter_nbextensions_configurator`.\n\nFinally, the `--perform-running-check` option flag is provided in order to\nprevent the installation from proceeding if a notebook server appears to be\ncurrently running\n(by default, the install will still be performed, even if a notebook server\nappears to be running).\n\nAn analogous `uninstall` command is also provided, to remove all of the\nnbextension files from the jupyter directories.\n\n\n3\\. Enabling/Disabling extensions\n---------------------------------\n\nTo use an nbextension, you'll also need to enable it, which tells the notebook\ninterface to load it. To do this, you can use a Jupyter subcommand:\n\n    jupyter nbextension enable <nbextension require path>\n\nfor example,\n\n    jupyter nbextension enable codefolding/main\n\nTo disable the extension again, use\n\n    jupyter nbextension disable <nbextension require path>\n\n**Alternatively**, and more conveniently, you can use the\n[jupyter_nbextensions_configurator](https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator)\nserver extension, which is installed as a dependency of this repo, and can be\nused to enable and disable the individual nbextensions, as well as configure\ntheir options. You can then open the `nbextensions` tab on the tree\n(dashboard/file browser) notebook page to configure nbextensions.\nYou will have access there to a dashboard where extensions can be\nenabled/disabled via checkboxes.\nAdditionally, a short documentation for each extension is displayed, and\nconfiguration options are presented.\n\n![jupyter_nbextensions_configurator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator/master/src/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator/static/nbextensions_configurator/icon.png)\n\n\n4\\. More complex setups\n-----------------------\n\nFor complex or customized installation scenarios, please look at the\ndocumentation for installing notebook extensions, server extensions, nbconvert\npre/postprocessors and templates on the [Jupyter homepage](https://jupyter.org).\nMost nbextensions here should work fine with JupyterHub (because JupyterHub spawns \nregular notebook servers for each individual user), but won't work with JupyterLab \n(because the Javascript framework of JupyterLab is different from the notebook's, and \nis still rapidly changing under active development).\n\nSee also [installing Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)\n\n\nNotebook extension structure\n============================\n\nMost of the nbextensions are stored in the repository each as a separate subdirectory of\n[`src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions`](https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/tree/master/src/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/nbextensions).\n\nEach notebook extension typically has its own directory named after the extension, containing:\n\n * `thisextension/thisextension.js` - javascript implementing the nbextension\n * `thisextension/thisextension.yml` - file describing the nbextension to the `jupyter_nbextensions_configurator` server extension\n * `thisextension/thisextension.css` - optional CSS file, which may be loaded by the javascript\n * `thisextension/README.md` - readme file describing the nbextension in markdown format\n\nA few (jupyter_highlight_selected_word, jupyter_latex_envs), exist as separate packages on pypi, which are included as dependencies of this package.\n\nFor further details, see [the documentation at jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io](http://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internals.html).\n\n\nContributing\n============\n\nTo learn how to setup a development environment and for contribution guidelines, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\nChanges\n=======\n\nFor changes, see the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)\n"
