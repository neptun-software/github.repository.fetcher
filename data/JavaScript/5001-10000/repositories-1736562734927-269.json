[Here is a guide for Windows 11 and 10.](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-desktop-background-and-colors-176702ca-8e24-393b-15f2-b15b38f69de6#ID0EBF=Windows_11)\n\nAfter switching the theme you might need to restart your browser.\n\n## List of commands\n\nYou can use a variety of commands with Omni to perform actions or filter your results.\n\n- **/tabs**: Search your tabs\n- **/bookmarks**: Search your bookmarks\n- **/history**: Search your browser history\n- **/actions**: Search all available actions\n- **/remove**: Remove a bookmark or close a tab\n\nFeel free to suggest new commands for Omni by [making an issue](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni/issues/new).\n\n## Self-hosting Omni\nYou can run Omni locally without having to install it from the Chrome Store or from Firefox Add-ons.\n\n### Installing on Chrome\n\n1. Download the code. In the web version of GitHub, you can do that by clicking the green \"Code\" button, and then \"Download ZIP\".\n2. Go to chrome://extensions/ in your browser, and [enable developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv2/faq/#:~:text=You%20can%20start%20by%20turning,a%20packaged%20extension%2C%20and%20more.).\n3. Drag the [src folder](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni/tree/master/src) (make sure it's a folder and not a ZIP file, so unzip first), or click on the \"Load unpacked\" button and locate the folder.\n4. That's it, you will now be able to use Omni locally.\n\n### Installing on Firefox\n\n1. Download the code. In the web version of GitHub, you can do that by clicking the green \"Code\" button, and then \"Download ZIP\".\n2. Open the about:debugging page in your browser, click the \"This Firefox\" option.\n3. Click the \"Load Temporary Add-on\" button, and select any file inside the [firefox folder](https://github.com/alyssaxuu/omni/tree/master/firefox)\n4. That's it, you will now be able to use Omni locally.\n\n## Libraries used\n\n- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - for better event handling and DOM manipulation\n- [dom-focus-lock](https://github.com/theKashey/dom-focus-lock) - to keep focus on the input field\n\n#\n\nFeel free to reach out to me through email at hi@alyssax.com or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/alyssaxuu) if you have any questions or feedback!
