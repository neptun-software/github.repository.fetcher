Let's find out!\nUse the controls to your left to <b>START</b> the sim in quick mode,\nor go through it <b>step-by-step</b>.\n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_2_2_correct\">\nYou were correct -- \n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_2_2_incorrect\">\nYour bet was close, but no cigar -- \n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_2_2\">\n<span class=\"pavlov\">Simpleton</span> wins!\nThis is because <span class=\"pavlov\">Simpleton</span> is actually capable of\nexploiting <span class=\"all_c\">Always Cooperate</span>. They both start cooperating,\nbut if <span class=\"pavlov\">Simpleton</span> makes a mistake and cheats,\nsince <span class=\"all_c\">Always Cooperate</span> never retaliates,\n<i>it'll keep cheating them</i>.\n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_2_2_btn\">\nNow let's try...\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"noise_evo_3\">\n...the same thing as before, except instead of half-<span class=\"all_c\">Always Cooperate</span>,\nit's half-<span class=\"all_d\">Always Cheat</span>. It's a much <i>less</i> forgiving,\n<i>more</i> hostile environment.\n<br><br>\nWho do you think will win now? <b>Think, then PLACE YOUR BETS:</b>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"noise_evo_4\">\nYou bet on [CHAR]. Again, go through the simulation...\n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_4_2_correct\">\nYou were right on the money -- \n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_4_2_incorrect\">\nGood guess, but someone else took the prize -- \n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_4_2\">\n<span class=\"tf2t\">Copykitten</span> wins this time!\nThat's surprising that with an even <i>meaner</i> starting population,\n<span class=\"tf2t\">Copykitten</span>,\na <i>more forgiving</i> version of <span class=\"tft\">Copycat</span>,\nwas the most successful! (note: <span class=\"tf2t\">Copykitten</span> is so forgiving\nit doesn't even <i>entirely</i> wipe out <span class=\"tft\">Copycat</span>. it shares room)\n<br><br>\nIn this case, a bit of \"miscommunication\" (5% chance of mistake each round) could lead\nto more <i>forgiveness</i>. But is this true for <i>all</i> levels...\n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_4_2_btn\">\n...of miscommunication?\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"noise_evo_5\">\n<b>Use the slider below to change the amount of \"miscommunication\", then hit START.</b>\nAt 5%, <span class=\"tf2t\">Copykitten</span> wins.\nWhat happens at 0%? Or 20%? Or 50%? (it only goes up to 50%,\nbecause at that point, <i>every</i> move is a coin flip) \n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_5_continue\">\nWhen you're done playing around, click:\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"noise_evo_6\">\nThe results turn out something like this:<br>\n<b>At 0%,</b> the fair <span class=\"tft\">Copycat</span> wins!\n<b>At 1% to 9%,</b> the forgiving <span class=\"tf2t\">Copykitten</span> wins!\n<b>At 10% to 49%:</b> the unfair, unforgiving <span class=\"all_d\">Always Cheat</span> wins.\n<b>At 50%,</b> <i>nobody wins ever.</i>\n<br><br>\nThis is why \"miscommunication\" is such an interesting barrier to trust:\na <i>little</i> bit of it leads to forgiveness,\nbut <i>too much</i> and it leads to widespread distrust!\nI think our modern media technology,\nas much as it's helped us increase communication...\nhas increased our <i>miscommunication</i> much more.\n<br><br>\nAt last, let's experiment with <i>all</i> the numbers, the knobs and sliders.\nLet's play...\n</p>\n<p id=\"noise_evo_6_btn\">\n...in the Sandbox Mode!\n</p>\n\n\n<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->\n<!-- - - - - - SANDBOX! - - - - - - - -->\n<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->\n\n<p id=\"sandbox_population\">\nStart off with this distribution of players:\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"sandbox_payoffs\">\nThe payoffs in a one-on-one game are:\n</p>\n<p id=\"sandbox_reset_payoffs\">\nset default\n</p>\n\n<!--\nWhen translating the following, keep the \"[N]\", with square brackets,\nas a placeholder for the number.

REPEAT INTERACTIONS\n</p>\n<p id=\"conclusion_1_a2\">\nTrust keeps a relationship going,\nbut you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions <i>before</i> trust can evolve.\n</p>\n<p id=\"conclusion_2_a\">\n2. POSSIBLE WIN-WINS\n</p>\n<p id=\"conclusion_2_a2\">\nYou must be playing a non-zero-sum game,\na game where it's at least possible that <i>both</i> players can be better off -- a win-win.\n</p>\n<p id=\"conclusion_3_a\">\n3. LOW MISCOMMUNICATION\n</p>\n<p id=\"conclusion_3_a2\">\nIf the level of miscommunication is <i>too</i> high, trust breaks down.\nBut when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be <i>more</i> forgiving.\n</p>\n<p id=\"conclusion_4\">\nOf course, real-world trust is affected by much more than this.\nThere's reputation, shared values, contracts, cultural markers, blah blah blah.\nAnd let's not forget...\n</p>\n<p id=\"conclusion_btn\">\n...the <i>biggest</i> lesson. &rarr;\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"outro_1\">\nIf there's one big takeaway<br>\nfrom <i>all</i> of game theory, it's this:\n<br><br>\n<b>What the game is, defines what the players do.</b><br>\nOur problem today isn't just that people are losing trust,<br>\nit's that our <i>environment</i> acts against the evolution of trust.\n<br><br>\nThat may seem cynical or naive -- that we're \"merely\" products of our environment --\nbut as game theory reminds us, we <i>are</i> each others' environment.\n<b>In the short run, the game defines the players. But in the long run,\nit's us players who define the game.</b>\n<br><br>\nSo, do what <i>you</i> can do, to create the conditions necessary to evolve trust.\nBuild relationships. Find win-wins. Communicate clearly.\nMaybe then, we can stop firing at each other, get out of our own trenches,\ncross No Man's Land to come together...\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"outro_1_btn\">\nand all learn...\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"outro_2\">\n...to live and let live.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"outro_2_credits\">\n\"A Christmas Truce between Opposing Trenches\"\nIllustrated by AC Michael.\nPublished in <i>The Illustrated London News</i>, January 9, 1915.\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"outro_2_btn\">\n&lt;3\n</p>\n\n<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->\n<!-- - - - - - CREDITS! - - - - - - -->\n<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->\n\n<p id=\"credits\">\n<span class=\"credits\">\n\ncreated by:<br>\n<span class=\"big\">NICKY CASE</span><br>\n<a href=\"http://ncase.me/\" target=\"_blank\">play my other shtuff</a>\n•\n<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ncasenmare\" target=\"_blank\">follow my tweeter</a>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/ncase/trust/#play-it-here-httpncasemetrust\" target=\"_blank\">download the music &amp; source code</a>\n\n<span class=\"divider\"></span>\n\nbased off robert axelrod's 1984 book,<br>\n<span class=\"big\">\"THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATION\"</span><br>\n<a href=\"notes\" target=\"_blank\">read my footnotes for this game</a>\n\n<span class=\"divider\"></span>\n\nlots of love and thanks to<br>\n<span class=\"big\">MY PATREON SUPPORTERS</span><br>\n<a href=\"peeps\" target=\"_blank\">see my drawings of 'em</a>\n•\n<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ncase\" target=\"_blank\">throw coins at me on patreon &lt;3</a>\n\n<span class=\"divider\"></span>\n\np.s: want more learning-by-playing?<br>\ncheck out \n<a href=\"http://explorabl.es/\" target=\"_blank\">explorable explanations</a>!\n\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->\n<!-- - - - - THE PLAYERS - - - - - - -->\n<!-- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -->\n\n<p id=\"label_tft\">Copycat</p>\n<p id=\"label_short_tft\">\ncopycat\n</p>\n<p id=\"icon_tft\">\n<span class=\"tft\">\n\t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t<span class=\"icon_label\">Copycat</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"label_all_d\">Always Cheat</p>\n<p id=\"label_short_all_d\">\ncheater\n</p>\n<p id=\"icon_all_d\">\n<span class=\"all_d\">\n\t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t<span class=\"icon_label\">All Cheat</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"label_all_c\">Always Cooperate</p>\n<p id=\"label_short_all_c\">\ncooperator\n</p>\n<p id=\"icon_all_c\">\n<span class=\"all_c\">\n\t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t<span class=\"icon_label\">All Cooperate</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"label_grudge\">Grudger</p>\n<p id=\"label_short_grudge\">\ngrudger\n</p>\n<p id=\"icon_grudge\">\n<span class=\"grudge\">\n\t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t<span class=\"icon_label\">Grudger</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"label_prober\">Detective</p>\n<p id=\"label_short_prober\">\ndetective\n</p>\n<p id=\"icon_prober\">\n<span class=\"prober\">\n\t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t<span class=\"icon_label\">Detective</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"label_tf2t\">Copykitten</p>\n<p id=\"label_short_tf2t\">\ncopykitten\n</p>\n<p id=\"icon_tf2t\">\n<span class=\"tf2t\">\n\t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t<span class=\"icon_label\">Copykitten</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"label_pavlov\">Simpleton</p>\n<p id=\"label_short_pavlov\">\nsimpleton\n</p>\n<p id=\"icon_pavlov\">\n<span class=\"pavlov\">\n\t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t<span class=\"icon_label\">Simpleton</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"label_random\">Random</p>\n<p id=\"label_short_random\">\nrandom\n</p>\n<p id=\"icon_random\">\n<span class=\"random\">\n\t<span class=\"icon\"></span>\n\t<span class=\"icon_label\">Random</span>\n</span>\n</p>\n\n<p id=\"forgot_whos_who\">\n(forgot who's who? hover buttons to see descriptions of each character!)\n</p>\n<p id=\"who_tft\">\nStarts with Cooperate.
