          "content": "# Contributing to Metro\n\nMetro is one of Facebook's open source projects that is both under very active development and is also being used to ship code to everybody on [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com). We're still working out the kinks to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, but we're not quite there yet. Hopefully this document makes the process for contributing clear and answers some questions that you may have.\n\n## [Code of Conduct](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct)\n\nFacebook has adopted a Code of Conduct that we expect project participants to adhere to. Please read [the full text](https://code.facebook.com/codeofconduct) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.\n\n## Our Development Process\n\nThe core team works directly on GitHub and all work is public.\n\n### `main` is unsafe\n\nWe will do our best to keep `main` in good shape, with tests passing at all times. But in order to move fast, we will make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. We will do our best to communicate these changes and always version appropriately so you can lock into a specific version if need be.\n\n### Workflow and Pull Requests\n\nThe core team will be monitoring for pull requests. When we get one, we'll run some Facebook-specific integration tests on it first. From here, we'll need to get another person to sign off on the changes and then merge the pull request. For API changes we may need to fix internal uses, which could cause some delay. We'll do our best to provide updates and feedback throughout the process.\n\n*Before* submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done…\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.\n\n   ```sh\n   git clone https://github.com/facebook/metro\n   cd metro\n   git checkout -b my_branch\n   ```\n\n2. Run `yarn`.\n\n    ```sh\n    yarn\n    ```\n\n3. Code in this repo is typechecked with [Flow](https://flow.org/). [Optional] If you are using VS Code, we recommend opening the `metro.code-workspace` file, which should configure the Flow Language Service and other workspace settings correctly.\n4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.\n5. If you've changed APIs:\n    1. Update the documentation if necessary.\n    2. Update any relevant `.d.ts` files under the package's `types/` directory.\n6. Ensure the test suite passes via `npm test`.\n7. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\n\n### Contributor License Agreement (CLA)\n\nIn order to accept your pull request, we need you to submit a CLA. You only need to do this once, so if you've done this for another Facebook open source project, you're good to go. If you are submitting a pull request for the first time, just let us know that you have completed the CLA and we can cross-check with your GitHub username.\n\n[Complete your CLA here.](https://code.facebook.com/cla)\n\n### Bugs\n\n### Where to Find Known Issues\n\nWe will be using GitHub Issues for our public bugs. We will keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new issue, try to make sure your problem doesn't already exist.\n\n### Reporting New Issues\n\nThe best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case. Please provide a public repository with a runnable example.\n\n### Security Bugs\n\nFacebook has a [bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat/) for the safe disclosure of security bugs. With that in mind, please do not file public issues; go through the process outlined on that page.\n\n## How to Get in Touch\n\n* Discord - [#help-react-native](https://discord.gg/JuTwWB8rsy) on [Reactiflux](http://www.reactiflux.com/)\n\n### Code Conventions\n\n* 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs).\n* 80 character line length strongly preferred.\n* Prefer `'` over `\"`.\n* ES2015 syntax when possible.\n* `'use strict';`.\n* Use [Flow types](http://flowtype.org/).\n* Use semicolons;\n* Trailing commas,\n* Avd abbr wrds.\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing to Metro, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT license.\n"
