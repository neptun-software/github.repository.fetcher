about this list\n\n> Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. (Abraham Lincoln)\n\nA collection of full-stack resources for programmers.\n\nThe goal of this page is to make you a more proficient developer. You'll find only resources that I've found truly inspiring, or that have become timeless classics.\n\n## Principles\n\n- This page is not meant to be comprehensive. I am trying to keep it light and not too overwhelming.\n- The selection of articles is opinionated.\n- I don't necessarily agree with or endorse every single line that is written in every single one of those resources. The same applies to their authors: I don't endorse everything each of those authors has said and will ever say.\n\nItems:\n\n- 🧰 : list of resources\n- 📖 : book\n- 🎞 : video/movie extract/movie/talk\n- 🏙 : slides/presentation\n- ⭐️ : must-read\n- 📃 : paper\n\n## Contributing to this list\n\nFeel free to open a PR to contribute!\n\nI will not be adding everything: as stated above, I am trying to keep the list concise.\n\n## Must-read books\n\nI've found these books incredibly inspiring:\n\n- 📖 [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/): hands-on the most inspiring and useful book I've read about programming.\n- 📖 [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670): a nice addition to The Pragmatic Programmer, gives you the necessary framework to talk about code.\n- 📖 [Release It!](https://smile.amazon.com/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395): this books goes beyond code and gives you best practices for building production-ready software. It will give you about 3 years worth of real-world experience.\n- 📖 [Scalability Rules: 50 Principles for Scaling Web Sites](https://smile.amazon.com/Scalability-Rules-Principles-Scaling-Sites/dp/013443160X)\n- 📖 [The Linux Programming Interface: A Linux and UNIX System Programming Handbook](http://www.amazon.com/The-Linux-Programming-Interface-Handbook/dp/1593272200): outside of teaching you almost everything you need to know about Linux, this book will give you insights into how software evolves, and the value of having simple & elegant interfaces.\n- 📖 [Structure and interpretation of Computer Programs](https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf) (free): One of the most influential textbooks in Computer Science (written and used at MIT), SICP has been influential in CS education. [Byte](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_(magazine)>) recommended SICP \"for professional programmers who are really interested in their profession\".\n\nThere are some free books available, including:\n\n- 📖 [Professional software development](http://mixmastamyk.bitbucket.io/pro_soft_dev/): pretty complete and a good companion to this page. The free chapters are mostly focused on software development processes: design, testing, code writing, etc. - and not so much about tech itself.\n- 🧰 [vhf/free-programming-books](https://github.com/vhf/free-programming-books)\n- 🧰 [EbookFoundation/free-programming-books](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/books/free-programming-books.md)\n\n## Must-read articles\n\n- [Practical Advice for New Software Engineers](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/practical-advice-for-new-software-engineers)\n- [On Being A Senior Engineer](http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/)\n- [Lessons Learned in Software Development](http://henrikwarne.com/2015/04/16/lessons-learned-in-software-development/): one of those articles that give you years of hard-earned lessons, all in one short article. Must read.\n- [Things I Learnt The Hard Way](https://blog.juliobiason.me/thoughts/things-i-learnt-the-hard-way/)\n  - Spec first, then code\n  - Tests make better APIs\n  - Future thinking is future trashing\n  - Documentation is a love letter to your future self\n  - Sometimes, it's better to let the application crash than do nothing\n  - Understand and stay away of cargo cult\n  - \"Right tool for the job\" is just to push an agenda\n  - Learn the basics functional programming\n  - ALWAYS use timezones with your dates\n  - ALWAYS use UTF-8\n  - Create libraries\n  - Learn to monitor\n  - Explicit is better than implicit\n  - Companies look for specialists but keep generalists longer\n  - The best secure way to deal with user data is not to capture it\n  - When it's time to stop, it's time to stop\n  - You're responsible for the use of your code\n  - Don't tell \"It's done\" when it's not\n  - Pay attention on how people react to you\n  - Beware of micro-aggressions\n  - Keep a list of \"Things I Don't Know\"\n- [Signs that you're a good programmer](https://skatgame.net/mburo//courses/350/signs-that-you-re-a-good-programmer.html) (not everything in here is great - some of the points are counterproductive)\n  - The instinct to experiment first\n  - Emotional detachment from code and design\n  - Eager to fix what isn't broken\n  - Fascinated by the incomprehensible\n  - Compelled to teach\n  - Incorruptible patience\n  - A destructive pursuit of perfection\n  - Encyclopedic grasp of the platform\n  - Thinks In Code\n  - When In Rome, Does As Romans Do\n  - Creates their own tools\n  - Indifferent to Hierarchy\n  - Excited by failure\n  - Indifferent to circumstances\n  - Substitutes impulse for commitment\n  - Driven by experiences\n- [7 absolute truths I unlearned as junior developer](https://monicalent.com/blog/2019/06/03/absolute-truths-unlearned-as-junior-developer/)\n  - Early in your career, you can learn 10x more in a supportive team in 1 year, than coding on your own\n  - Every company has problems, every company has technical debt.\n  - Being overly opinionated on topics you lack real-world experience with is pretty arrogant.\n  - Many conference talks cover proof of concepts rather than real-world scenarios.\n  - Dealing with legacy is completely normal.\n  - Architecture is more important than nitpicking.\n  - Focus on automation over documentation where appropriate.\n  - Having some technical debt is healthy.\n  - Senior engineers must develop many skills besides programming.\n  - We’re all still junior in some areas.\n- [How to Build Good Software](https://knowledge.csc.gov.sg/ethos-issue-21/how-to-build-good-software/)\n  - A good high-level summary of fundamental engineering practices.\n  - The root cause of bad software has less to do with specific engineering choices, and more to do with how development projects are managed.\n  - There is no such thing as platonically good engineering: it depends on your needs and the practical problems you encounter.\n  - Software should be treated not as a static product, but as a living manifestation of the development team’s collective understanding.\n  - Software projects rarely fail because they are too small; they fail because they get too big.\n  - Beware of bureaucratic goals masquerading as problem statements. If our end goal is to make citizens’ lives better, we need to explicitly acknowledge the things that are making their lives worse.\n  - Building software is not about avoiding failure; it is about strategically failing as fast as possible to get the information you need to build something good.\n- [How to be a -10x Engineer](https://taylor.town/-10x)\n    - Nullify the output of 10 engineers.\n    - Hold 10 engineers hostage in a technical discussion.\n    - Waste 10 weeks of wages on cloud costs.\n    - Waste 400 hours of engineering on bad architecture.\n    - Incur 400 hours of bug triage.\n\n## Other general material and list of resources\n\n### Other lists\n\n- [liuchong/awesome-roadmaps: A curated list of roadmaps.](https://github.com/liuchong/awesome-roadmaps)\n\n### Books\n\n- [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook) - \\$30.

Usually, you didn't specify the abstraction narrowly enough.\n  - If you avoid changing a section of code for fear of awakening the demons therein, you are living in fear. If you stay in the comfortable confines of the small section of the code you wrote or know well, you will never write legendary code. All code was written by humans and can be mastered by humans.\n  - If there's clearly a right way to do something and a wrong way, do it the right way. Coding requires incredible discipline.\n  - The best way to get the right answer is to try it the wrong way.\n  - Practice tells you that things are good or bad; theory tells you why.\n  - Not being qualified to solve a problem is no reason not to solve it.\n  - If you don't understand a system you're using, you don't control it. If nobody understands the system, the system is in control.\n- [Embedded Rules of Thumb](https://embeddedartistry.com/blog/2018/04/26/embedded-rules-of-thumb/)\n- [50 Ideas That Changed My Life](https://www.perell.com/blog/50-ideas-that-changed-my-life)\n- [Reflections on 10,000 Hours of Programming](https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming/)\n- [20 Things I've Learned in my 20 Years as a Software Engineer](https://www.simplethread.com/20-things-ive-learned-in-my-20-years-as-a-software-engineer/)\n\n### Courses\n\n- [Google Tech Dev Guide](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/)\n- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/), MIT.

In the triumvirate of software, product managers, designers, and software engineers, only the engineers are expected to turn off their creative minds and just produce.\n  - Both engineers and product managers tend to think, incorrectly, that product specifications or requirements are equivalent to the furniture manual from Ikea.\n  - This is one of the top things that make engineers grumpy: constantly shifting priorities.\n  - Even though many engineers will complain that product managers change their minds, almost none will account for that in their time estimates.\n  - Computer science programs aren’t about preparing you for the tasks you’ll face in industry.\n  - When there are more engineers than can be used, engineering time ends up going away from developing and towards planning, synchronization, and coordination.\n  - Involve engineers in the creative process\n  - Give engineers opportunities to be creative.\n  - Encourage time off.\n  - Let 'em code\n  - Express appreciation\n- [The Product-Minded Software Engineer](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-product-minded-engineer/), Gergely Orosz\n  -

If you want to make progress on the things that matter most, you need to decide who you’re going to disappoint. It’s inevitable.\n  - The best investment you can make is your own education. Never stop learning. The second best investment you can make is building your network through authentic and meaningful interactions. It is what you know and who you know.\n  - You’ll never get what you don’t ask for or actively seek out. Go for it!\n  - It’s not about the light at the end of the tunnel. It’s the tunnel. Show up every day and enjoy the process.\n  - A great teammate always puts the organization and its purpose ahead of their own self interests.\n  - Pick your spots. We have limited time and our brains can only process so much. Focus is key. Choose wisely.\n  - Every person is likely struggling with something. Be kind. Be helpful.\n- [On Coding, Ego and Attention](https://josebrowne.com/on-coding-ego-and-attention/)\n  - Beginner’s mind accepts the fact that absolute knowledge is infinite and thus keeping score is a waste of time.\n  - Mastery is simply the accumulation of momentum, not the accumulation of knowledge.\n  - Dealing with ego distraction has taught me to love the problem solving process. It’s taught me to love and respect the learning process. As a result I’m more productive. I’m less anxious. I’m a better teammate.

Incompetent people are](https://nondv.wtf/blog/posts/microservices-arent-the-problem-incompetent-people-are.html)\n\n> Imposter syndrome is underrated: a lot of talk goes into overcoming imposter syndrome. I say embrace self-skepticism and doubt yourself every day. In a fast-moving industry where lots of your knowledge expires every year, even the most junior people around you constantly cook up skills you don't have; you stay competitive by applying with the determination (and even fear) of the novice. The upside of this treadmill is that every engineer is on it: just because you're an imposter doesn't mean that other people are more deserving than you, because they're imposters too. You should advocate for yourself, take risks, pat yourself on the back when things go well, and, as you start to build a track record of solving problems, trust your skills and adaptability. Just make no mistake: you're only as good as the last problem you solve.\n\nDan Heller, Building a Career in Software\n\n> I had learned already never to empty the well of my writing, but always to stop when there was still something there in the deep part of the well, and let it refill at night from the springs that fed it. -- Ernest Hemingway\n- [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev): habits of self-aware programmer.

The fact that you’ve decided to use a language that doesn’t have an assignment operator does not mean that you can ignore the Single Responsibility Principle.\n- [Parse, don’t validate](https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/)\n  - Use a data structure that makes illegal states unrepresentable\n  - Push the burden of proof upward as far as possible, but no further\n  - Let your datatypes inform your code, don’t let your code control your datatypes\n  - Don’t be afraid to parse data in multiple passes\n  - Avoid denormalized representations of data, especially if it’s mutable\n  - Use abstract datatypes to make validators “look like” parsers\n- 🏙 [Functional Programming](https://speakerdeck.com/igstan/functional-programming)\n- [Monads in 15 minutes](https://nikgrozev.com/2013/12/10/monads-in-15-minutes/)\n- [hemanth/functional-programming-jargon](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon): jargon from the functional programming world in simple terms\n- [The definitive guide to learning functional programming](https://forum.exercism.org/t/the-definitive-guide-to-learning-functional-programming/3254), Exercism\n\n### Games development\n\n- [Introduction · Joys of Small Game Development](https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/)\n\n### Graphics\n\n- [Text Rendering Hates You](https://faultlore.com/blah/text-hates-you/)\n- [AAA - Analytical Anti-Aliasing](https://blog.frost.kiwi/analytical-anti-aliasing/)\n\n### Hardware\n\n- [NandGame](https://nandgame.com/): build a computer from scratch.\n- [What Every Programmer Should Know About SSDs](http://databasearchitects.blogspot.com/2021/06/what-every-programmer-should-know-about.html)\n- [How To Make A CPU - A Simple Picture Based Explanation](https://blog.robertelder.org/how-to-make-a-cpu/)\n\n### HTTP\n\n- [Choosing an HTTP Status Code — Stop Making It Hard](https://www.codetinkerer.com/2015/12/04/choosing-an-http-status-code.html)\n- [HTTPWTF](https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/http-wtf/)\n- [10 Surprising Things You Didn't Know About HTTP](https://webdevguild.com/blog/10-things-http/)\n- [The HTTP crash course nobody asked for](https://fasterthanli.me/articles/the-http-crash-course-nobody-asked-for)\n\n### Humor\n\n- [The Jeff Dean Facts](https://www.informatika.bg/jeffdean)\n  - Compilers don't warn Jeff Dean.

By \"meaningful\" we mean that it should capture what users experience. By \"proportional\" we mean that a change in the metric should be proportional to the change in user-perceived availability. By \"actionable\" we mean that the metric should give system owners insight into why availability for a period was low.

This extra safety net helps developers be more\n  confident in their release, because they know they can roll back a change\n  very rapidly in case of error.\n- **Testing**: the presence of a feature flag forces the feature owner to test\n  the flow. Without feature flags, the developer might deploy the change and\n  assume the absence of errors means the release was successful. Yet there's\n  numerous failure mode that don't raise explicit errors.\n- **Code iterations**: because code can be kept hidden behind a feature flag\n  until it's ready to go live, developers can push smaller code changes that\n  are not fully integrated yet. Smaller pull requests ease the job of code\n  reviewers, make testing easier, and reduce the probability of a catastrophic\n  failure.\n- **Gradual rollout**: feature flags enable gradual rollout, where a piece of\n  code is gradually activated, for instance on a per city basis, or on a per\n  user group basis. This builds confidence in the feature release process, and\n  allows the engineer to verify that the new implementation is actually better\n  (for instance, when coupled with A/B testing frameworks).\n\n## Should feature flags be used for everything?\n\nI don't think so. I think it's a matter of good judgment. Just like 100% test\ncoverage does not always make sense (provided lines that are not tested are\nexplicitly ignored), adding or not adding a feature flag is an engineering\ndecision.\n\nWhen would I not use a feature flag?\n\n- Simple changes: copy, logging, etc.\n- When rolling back takes a few seconds\n- Feature that is used only in asynchronous jobs that are safe to retry and\n  don't impact the user experience.\n\nWhen should a feature flag be used?\n\n- Large refactors\n- Changing integration points\n- Performance optimization\n- New flows\n\n## References\n\n- Martin Fowler,\n  [FeatureToggle](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html)\n- Flickr, [Flipping Out](http://code.flickr.net/2009/12/02/flipping-out/): one\n  of the first articles on the topic.\n- [Using Feature Flags to Ship Changes with\n  Confidence](http://blog.travis-ci.com/2014-03-04-use-feature-flags-to-ship-changes-with-confidence/)\n"
