To the\nextent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are\ngranted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of\nthese terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in\nconsideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the\nLicensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

They may have different numbers of fields. It will be\n#   unwieldy to support multiple versions in the same source file.\n# * Python itself for many of these structs recommends only\n#   initializing a subset of the fields. We should respect the API\n#   usage conventions of our dependencies.\n#\n# Hence, we just disable this warning altogether.

If you get stuck when developing PyTorch on your machine, check out the [tips and debugging](#tips-and-debugging) section below for common solutions.\n\n### Setup the development environment\n\nFirst, you need to [fork the PyTorch project on GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/fork) and follow the instructions at [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) to setup your SSH authentication credentials.\n\nThen clone the PyTorch project and setup the development environment:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:<USERNAME>/pytorch.git\ncd pytorch\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:pytorch/pytorch.git\n\nmake setup-env\n# Or run `make setup-env-cuda` for pre-built CUDA binaries\n# Or run `make setup-env-rocm` for pre-built ROCm binaries\nsource venv/bin/activate  # or `& .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` on Windows\n```\n\n### Tips and Debugging\n\n* If you want to have no-op incremental rebuilds (which are fast), see [Make no-op build fast](#make-no-op-build-fast) below.\n\n* When installing with `python setup.py develop` (in contrast to `python setup.py install`) Python runtime will use\n  the current local source-tree when importing `torch` package. (This is done by creating [`.egg-link`](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonPackagingTerminology#egg-link) file in `site-packages` folder)\n  This way you do not need to repeatedly install after modifying Python files (`.py`).\n  However, you would need to reinstall if you modify Python interface (`.pyi`, `.pyi.in`) or\n   non-Python files (`.cpp`, `.cc`, `.cu`, `.h`, ...).\n\n\n  One way to avoid running `python setup.py develop` every time one makes a change to C++/CUDA/ObjectiveC files on Linux/Mac,\n  is to create a symbolic link from `build` folder to `torch/lib`, for example, by issuing following:\n  ```bash\n   pushd torch/lib; sh -c \"ln -sf ../../build/lib/libtorch_cpu.* .\"; popd\n  ```\n   Afterwards rebuilding a library (for example to rebuild `libtorch_cpu.so` issue `ninja torch_cpu` from `build` folder),\n   would be sufficient to make change visible in `torch` package.\n\n\n  To reinstall, first uninstall all existing PyTorch installs. You may need to run `pip\n  uninstall torch` multiple times. You'll know `torch` is fully\n  uninstalled when you see `WARNING: Skipping torch as it is not\n  installed`. (You should only have to `pip uninstall` a few times, but\n  you can always `uninstall` with `timeout` or in a loop if you're feeling\n  lazy.)\n\n  ```bash\n  conda uninstall pytorch -y\n  yes | pip uninstall torch\n  ```\n\n  Next run `python setup.py clean`. After that, you can install in `develop` mode again.\n\n* If you run into errors when running `python setup.py develop`, here are some debugging steps:\n  1. Run `printf '#include <stdio.h>\\nint main() { printf(\"Hello World\");}'|clang -x c -; ./a.out` to make sure\n  your CMake works and can compile this simple Hello World program without errors.\n  2. Nuke your `build` directory. The `setup.py` script compiles binaries into the `build` folder and caches many\n  details along the way, which saves time the next time you build. If you're running into issues, you can always\n  `rm -rf build` from the toplevel `pytorch` directory and start over.\n  3. If you have made edits to the PyTorch repo, commit any change you'd like to keep and clean the repo with the\n  following commands (note that clean _really_ removes all untracked files and changes.):\n      ```bash\n      git submodule deinit -f .\n      git clean -xdf\n      python setup.py clean\n      git submodule update --init --recursive # very important to sync the submodules\n      python setup.py develop                 # then try running the command again\n      ```\n  4. The main step within `python setup.py develop` is running `make` from the `build` directory. If you want to\n    experiment with some environment variables, you can pass them into the command:\n      ```bash\n      ENV_KEY1=ENV_VAL1[, ENV_KEY2=ENV_VAL2]* python setup.py develop\n      ```\n\n* If you run into issue running `git submodule update --init --recursive`. Please try the following:\n  - If you encounter an error such as\n    ```\n    error: Submodule 'third_party/pybind11' could not be updated\n    ```\n    check whether your Git local or global config file contains any `submodule.*` settings. If yes, remove them and try again.\n    (please reference [this doc](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-submoduleltnamegturl) for more info).\n\n  - If you encounter an error such as\n    ```\n    fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/pybind11/pybind11.git': could not load PEM client certificate ...\n    ```\n    this is likely that you are using HTTP proxying and the certificate expired. To check if the certificate is valid, run\n    `git config --global --list` and search for config like `http.proxysslcert=<cert_file>`. Then check certificate valid date by running\n    ```bash\n    openssl x509 -noout -in <cert_file> -dates\n    ```\n\n  - If you encounter an error that some third_party modules are not checked out correctly, such as\n    ```\n    Could not find .../pytorch/third_party/pybind11/CMakeLists.txt\n    ```\n    remove any `submodule.*` settings in your local git config (`.git/config` of your pytorch repo) and try again.\n* If you're a Windows contributor, please check out [Best Practices](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Best-Practices-to-Edit-and-Compile-Pytorch-Source-Code-On-Windows).\n* For help with any part of the contributing process, please don’t hesitate to utilize our Zoom office hours! See details [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Dev-Infra-Office-Hours)\n\n## Nightly Checkout & Pull\n\nThe `tools/nightly.py` script is provided to ease pure Python development of\nPyTorch. This uses `venv` and `git` to check out the nightly development\nversion of PyTorch and installs pre-built binaries into the current repository.\nThis is like a development or editable install, but without needing the ability\nto compile any C++ code.\n\nYou can use this script to check out a new nightly branch with the following:\n\n```bash\n./tools/nightly.py checkout -b my-nightly-branch\nsource venv/bin/activate  # or `& .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` on Windows\n```\n\nOr if you would like to re-use an existing conda environment, you can pass in\nthe prefix argument (`--prefix`):\n\n```bash\n./tools/nightly.py checkout -b my-nightly-branch -p my-env\nsource my-env/bin/activate  # or `& .\\my-env\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` on Windows\n```\n\nTo install the nightly binaries built with CUDA, you can pass in the flag `--cuda`:\n\n```bash\n./tools/nightly.py checkout -b my-nightly-branch --cuda\nsource venv/bin/activate  # or `& .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` on Windows\n```\n\nTo install the nightly binaries built with ROCm, you can pass in the flag `--rocm`:\n\n```bash\n./tools/nightly.py checkout -b my-nightly-branch --rocm\nsource venv/bin/activate  # or `& .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` on Windows\n```\n\nYou can also use this tool to pull the nightly commits into the current branch:\n\n```bash\n./tools/nightly.py pull -p my-env\nsource my-env/bin/activate  # or `& .\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1` on Windows\n```\n\nPulling will recreate a fresh virtual environment and reinstall the development\ndependencies as well as the nightly binaries into the repo directory.\n\n## Codebase structure\n\n* [c10](c10) - Core library files that work everywhere, both server\n  and mobile. We are slowly moving pieces from [ATen/core](aten/src/ATen/core)\n  here. This library is intended only to contain essential functionality,\n  and appropriate to use in settings where binary size matters. (But\n  you'll have a lot of missing functionality if you try to use it\n  directly.)\n* [aten](aten) - C++ tensor library for PyTorch (no autograd support)\n  * [src](aten/src) - [README](aten/src/README.md)\n    * [ATen](aten/src/ATen)\n      * [core](aten/src/ATen/core) - Core functionality of ATen. This\n        is migrating to top-level c10 folder.\n      * [native](aten/src/ATen/native) - Modern implementations of\n        operators. If you want to write a new operator, here is where\n        it should go. Most CPU operators go in the top level directory,\n        except for operators which need to be compiled specially; see\n        cpu below.\n        * [cpu](aten/src/ATen/native/cpu) - Not actually CPU\n          implementations of operators, but specifically implementations\n          which are compiled with processor-specific instructions, like\n          AVX. See the [README](aten/src/ATen/native/cpu/README.md) for more\n          details.\n        * [cuda](aten/src/ATen/native/cuda) - CUDA implementations of\n          operators.\n        * [sparse](aten/src/ATen/native/sparse) - CPU and CUDA\n          implementations of COO sparse tensor operations\n        * [mkl](aten/src/ATen/native/mkl) [mkldnn](aten/src/ATen/native/mkldnn)\n          [miopen](aten/src/ATen/native/miopen) [cudnn](aten/src/ATen/native/cudnn)\n          - implementations of operators which simply bind to some\n            backend library.\n        * [quantized](aten/src/ATen/native/quantized/) - Quantized tensor (i.e. QTensor) operation implementations. [README](aten/src/ATen/native/quantized/README.md) contains details including how to implement native quantized operations.\n* [torch](torch) - The actual PyTorch library. Everything that is not\n  in [csrc](torch/csrc) is a Python module, following the PyTorch Python\n  frontend module structure.\n  * [csrc](torch/csrc) - C++ files composing the PyTorch library. Files\n    in this directory tree are a mix of Python binding code, and C++\n    heavy lifting. Consult `setup.py` for the canonical list of Python\n    binding files; conventionally, they are often prefixed with\n    `python_`.

[README](.circleci/README.md)\n\n## Unit testing\n\n### Python Unit Testing\n\n**Prerequisites**:\nThe following packages should be installed with either `conda` or `pip`:\n- `expecttest` and `hypothesis` - required to run tests\n- `mypy` - recommended for linting\n- `pytest` - recommended to run tests more selectively\nRunning\n```\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nwill install these dependencies for you.\n\nAll PyTorch test suites are located in the `test` folder and start with\n`test_`. Run the entire test\nsuite with\n\n```bash\npython test/run_test.py\n```\n\nor run individual test suites using the command `python test/FILENAME.py`,\nwhere `FILENAME` represents the file containing the test suite you wish\nto run.\n\nFor example, to run all the TorchScript JIT tests (located at\n`test/test_jit.py`), you would run:\n\n```bash\npython test/test_jit.py\n```\n\nYou can narrow down what you're testing even further by specifying the\nname of an individual test with `TESTCLASSNAME.TESTNAME`. Here,\n`TESTNAME` is the name of the test you want to run, and `TESTCLASSNAME`\nis the name of the class in which it is defined.\n\nGoing off the above example, let's say you want to run\n`test_Sequential`, which is defined as part of the `TestJit` class\nin `test/test_jit.py`. Your command would be:\n\n```bash\npython test/test_jit.py TestJit.test_Sequential\n```\n\n**Weird note:** In our CI (Continuous Integration) jobs, we actually run the tests from the `test` folder and **not** the root of the repo, since there are various dependencies we set up for CI that expects the tests to be run from the test folder. As such, there may be some inconsistencies between local testing and CI testing--if you observe an inconsistency, please [file an issue](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/new/choose).\n\n### Better local unit tests with `pytest`\n\nWe don't officially support `pytest`, but it works well with our\n`unittest` tests and offers a number of useful features for local\ndeveloping. Install it via `pip install pytest`.\n\nIf you want to just run tests that contain a specific substring, you can\nuse the `-k` flag:\n\n```bash\npytest test/test_nn.py -k Loss -v\n```\n\nThe above is an example of testing a change to all Loss functions: this\ncommand runs tests such as `TestNN.test_BCELoss` and\n`TestNN.test_MSELoss` and can be useful to save keystrokes.\n\n### Local linting\n\nInstall all prerequisites by running\n\n```bash\nmake setup-lint\n```\n\nYou can now run the same linting steps that are used in CI locally via `make`:\n\n```bash\nmake lint\n```\n\nLearn more about the linter on the [lintrunner wiki page](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/lintrunner)\n\n#### Running `mypy`\n\n`mypy` is an optional static type checker for Python. We have multiple `mypy`\nconfigs for the PyTorch codebase that are automatically validated against whenever the linter is run.\n\nSee [Guide for adding type annotations to\nPyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Guide-for-adding-type-annotations-to-PyTorch)\nfor more information on how to set up `mypy` and tackle type annotation\ntasks.\n\n### C++ Unit Testing\n\nPyTorch offers a series of tests located in the `test/cpp` folder.\nThese tests are written in C++ and use the Google Test testing framework.\nAfter compiling PyTorch from source, the test runner binaries will be\nwritten to the `build/bin` folder. The command to run one of these tests\nis `./build/bin/FILENAME --gtest_filter=TESTSUITE.TESTNAME`, where\n`TESTNAME` is the name of the test you'd like to run and `TESTSUITE` is\nthe suite that test is defined in.\n\nFor example, if you wanted to run the test `MayContainAlias`, which\nis part of the test suite `ContainerAliasingTest` in the file\n`test/cpp/jit/test_alias_analysis.cpp`, the command would be:\n\n```bash\n./build/bin/test_jit --gtest_filter=ContainerAliasingTest.MayContainAlias\n```\n\n\n### Run Specific CI Jobs\n\nYou can generate a commit that limits the CI to only run a specific job by using\n`tools/testing/explicit_ci_jobs.py` like so:\n\n```bash\n# --job: specify one or more times to filter to a specific job + its dependencies\n# --filter-gha: specify github actions workflows to keep\n# --make-commit: commit CI changes to git with a message explaining the change\npython tools/testing/explicit_ci_jobs.py --job binary_linux_manywheel_3_6m_cpu_devtoolset7_nightly_test --filter-gha '*generated*gcc5.4*' --make-commit\n\n# Make your changes\n\nghstack submit\n```\n\n**NB**: It is not recommended to use this workflow unless you are also using\n[`ghstack`](https://github.com/ezyang/ghstack). It creates a large commit that is\nof very low signal to reviewers.\n\n## Merging your Change\nIf you know the right people or team that should approve your PR (and you have the required permissions to do so), add them to the Reviewers list.\n\nIf not, leave the Reviewers section empty. Our triage squad will review your PR, add a module label, and assign it to the appropriate reviewer in a couple business days.  The reviewer will then look at your PR and respond.\n\nOccasionally, things might fall through the cracks (sorry!). In case your PR either doesn't get assigned to a reviewer or doesn't get any response from the reviewer for 4 business days, please leave comment on the PR (mentioning the reviewer if one has been assigned). That'll get it nudged back onto people's radar.\n\nIf that still doesn't help, come see us during [our office hours](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Dev-Infra-Office-Hours)\n\nOnce your PR is approved, you can merge it in by entering a comment with the content `@pytorchmergebot merge` ([what's this bot?](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Bot-commands))\n\n## Writing documentation\n\nSo you want to write some documentation and don't know where to start?\nPyTorch has two main types of documentation:\n- **User facing documentation**:\nThese are the docs that you see over at [our docs website](https://pytorch.org/docs).\n- **Developer facing documentation**:\nDeveloper facing documentation is spread around our READMEs in our codebase and in\nthe [PyTorch Developer Wiki](https://pytorch.org/wiki).\nIf you're interested in adding new developer docs, please read this [page on the wiki](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Where-or-how-should-I-add-documentation) on our best practices for where to put it.\n\nThe rest of this section is about user-facing documentation.\n\nPyTorch uses [Google style](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/example_google.html)\nfor formatting docstrings. Each line inside a docstrings block must be limited to 80 characters so that it fits into Jupyter documentation popups.\n\n\n### Docstring type formatting\n\nIn addition to the standard Google Style docstring formatting rules, the following guidelines should be followed for docstring types (docstring types are the type information contained in the round brackets after the variable name):\n\n* The \"`Callable`\", \"`Any`\", \"`Iterable`\", \"`Iterator`\", \"`Generator`\" types should have their first letter capitalized.\n\n* The \"`list`\" and \"`tuple`\" types should be completely lowercase.\n\n* Types should not be made plural. For example: `tuple of int` should be used instead of `tuple of ints`.\n\n* The only acceptable delimiter words for types are `or` and `of`. No other non-type words should be used other than `optional`.\n\n* The word `optional` should only be used after the types, and it is only used if the user does not have to specify a value for the variable. Default values are listed after the variable description. Example:\n\n    ```\n    my_var (int, optional): Variable description. Default: 1\n    ```\n\n* Basic Python types should match their type name so that the [Intersphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/intersphinx.html) extension can correctly identify them. For example:\n    * Use `str` instead of `string`.\n    * Use `bool` instead of `boolean`.\n    * Use `dict` instead of `dictionary`.\n\n* Square brackets should be used for the dictionary type. For example:\n\n    ```\n    my_var (dict[str, int]): Variable description.\n    ```\n\n* If a variable has two different possible types, then the word `or` should be used without a comma. Otherwise variables with 3 or more types should use commas to separate the types. Example:\n\n    ```\n    x (type1 or type2): Variable description.\n    y (type1, type2, or type3): Variable description.\n    ```\n\n\n### Building documentation\n\nTo build the documentation:\n\n1. Build and install PyTorch\n\n2. Install the prerequisites\n\n```bash\ncd docs\npip install -r requirements.txt\n# `katex` must also be available in your PATH.\n# You can either install katex globally if you have properly configured npm:\n# npm install -g katex\n# Or if you prefer an uncontaminated global executable environment or do not want to go through the node configuration:\n# npm install katex && export PATH=\"$PATH:$(pwd)/node_modules/.bin\"\n```\n> Note: if you installed `nodejs` with a different package manager (e.g.,\n`conda`) then `npm` will probably install a version of `katex` that is not\ncompatible with your version of `nodejs` and doc builds will fail.\nA combination of versions that is known to work is `node@6.13.1` and\n`katex@0.13.18`. To install the latter with `npm` you can run\n```npm install -g katex@0.13.18```\n\n\n> Note that if you are a Facebook employee using a devserver, yarn may be more convenient to install katex:\n\n```bash\nyarn global add katex\n```\n> If a specific version is required you can use for example `yarn global add katex@0.13.18`.\n\n3. Generate the documentation HTML files. The generated files will be in `docs/build/html`.\n\n```bash\nmake html\n```\n\n#### Tips\n\nThe `.rst` source files live in [docs/source](docs/source). Some of the `.rst`\nfiles pull in docstrings from PyTorch Python code (for example, via\nthe `autofunction` or `autoclass` directives). To vastly shorten doc build times,\nit is helpful to remove the files you are not working on, only keeping the base\n`index.rst` file and the files you are editing. The Sphinx build will produce\nmissing file warnings but will still complete. For example, to work on `jit.rst`:\n\n```bash\ncd docs/source\nfind . -type f | grep rst | grep -v index | grep -v jit | xargs rm\n\n# Make your changes, build the docs, etc.\n\n# Don't commit the deletions!\ngit add index.rst jit.rst\n...\n```\n\n#### Building C++ Documentation\n\nFor C++ documentation (https://pytorch.org/cppdocs), we use\n[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) and then convert it to\n[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) via\n[Breathe](https://github.com/michaeljones/breathe) and\n[Exhale](https://github.com/svenevs/exhale). Check the [Doxygen\nreference](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/) for more\ninformation on the documentation syntax.\n\nWe run Doxygen in CI (Travis) to verify that you do not use invalid Doxygen\ncommands. To run this check locally, run `./check-doxygen.sh` from inside\n`docs/cpp/source`.\n\nTo build the documentation, follow the same steps as above, but run them from\n`docs/cpp` instead of `docs`.\n\n### Previewing changes locally\n\nTo view HTML files locally, you can open the files in your web browser. For example,\nnavigate to `file:///your_pytorch_folder/docs/build/html/index.html` in a web\nbrowser.\n\nIf you are developing on a remote machine, you can set up an SSH tunnel so that\nyou can access the HTTP server on the remote machine from your local machine. To map\nremote port 8000 to local port 8000, use either of the following commands.\n\n```bash\n# For SSH\nssh my_machine -L 8000:my_machine:8000\n\n# For Eternal Terminal\net my_machine -t=\"8000:8000\"\n```\n\nThen navigate to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.\n\n**Tip:**\nYou can start a lightweight HTTP server on the remote machine with:\n\n```bash\npython -m http.server 8000 <path_to_html_output>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can run `rsync` on your local machine to copy the files from\nyour remote machine:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p build cpp/build\nrsync -az me@my_machine:/path/to/pytorch/docs/build/html build\nrsync -az me@my_machine:/path/to/pytorch/docs/cpp/build/html cpp/build\n```\n\n### Previewing documentation on PRs\n\nPyTorch will host documentation previews at `https://docs-preview.pytorch.org/pytorch/pytorch/<pr number>/index.html` once the\n`pytorch_python_doc_build` GitHub Actions job has completed on your PR. You can visit that page directly\nor find its link in the automated Dr. CI comment on your PR.\n\n### Adding documentation tests\n\nIt is easy for code snippets in docstrings and `.rst` files to get out of date. The docs\nbuild includes the [Sphinx Doctest Extension](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/doctest.html),\nwhich can run code in documentation as a unit test. To use the extension, use\nthe `.. testcode::` directive in your `.rst` and docstrings.\n\nTo manually run these tests, follow steps 1 and 2 above, then run:\n\n```bash\ncd docs\nmake doctest\n```\n\n## Profiling with `py-spy`\n\nEvaluating the performance impact of code changes in PyTorch can be complicated,\nparticularly if code changes happen in compiled code. One simple way to profile\nboth Python and C++ code in PyTorch is to use\n[`py-spy`](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy), a sampling profiler for Python\nthat has the ability to profile native code and Python code in the same session.\n\n`py-spy` can be installed via `pip`:\n\n```bash\npip install py-spy\n```\n\nTo use `py-spy`, first write a Python test script that exercises the\nfunctionality you would like to profile. For example, this script profiles\n`torch.add`:\n\n```python\nimport torch\n\nt1 = torch.tensor([[1, 1], [1, 1.]])\nt2 = torch.tensor([[0, 0], [0, 0.]])\n\nfor _ in range(1000000):\n    torch.add(t1, t2)\n```\n\nSince the `torch.add` operation happens in microseconds, we repeat it a large\nnumber of times to get good statistics. The most straightforward way to use\n`py-spy` with such a script is to generate a [flame\ngraph](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html):\n\n```bash\npy-spy record -o profile.svg --native -- python test_tensor_tensor_add.py\n```\n\nThis will output a file named `profile.svg` containing a flame graph you can\nview in a web browser or SVG viewer. Individual stack frame entries in the graph\ncan be selected interactively with your mouse to zoom in on a particular part of\nthe program execution timeline. The `--native` command-line option tells\n`py-spy` to record stack frame entries for PyTorch C++ code. To get line numbers\nfor C++ code it may be necessary to compile PyTorch in debug mode by prepending\nyour `setup.py develop` call to compile PyTorch with `DEBUG=1`. Depending on\nyour operating system it may also be necessary to run `py-spy` with root\nprivileges.\n\n`py-spy` can also work in an `htop`-like \"live profiling\" mode and can be\ntweaked to adjust the stack sampling rate, see the `py-spy` readme for more\ndetails.\n\n## Managing multiple build trees\n\nOne downside to using `python setup.py develop` is that your development\nversion of PyTorch will be installed globally on your account (e.g., if\nyou run `import torch` anywhere else, the development version will be\nused.\n\nIf you want to manage multiple builds of PyTorch, you can make use of\n[conda environments](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html) to maintain\nseparate Python package environments, each of which can be tied to a\nspecific build of PyTorch. To set one up:\n\n```bash\nconda create -n pytorch-myfeature\nsource activate pytorch-myfeature\n# if you run python now, torch will NOT be installed\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n## C++ development tips\n\nIf you are working on the C++ code, there are a few important things that you\nwill want to keep in mind:\n\n1. How to rebuild only the code you are working on.\n2. How to make rebuilds in the absence of changes go faster.\n\n### Build only what you need\n\n`python setup.py build` will build everything by default, but sometimes you are\nonly interested in a specific component.\n\n- Working on a test binary? Run `(cd build && ninja bin/test_binary_name)` to\n  rebuild only that test binary (without rerunning cmake). (Replace `ninja` with\n  `make` if you don't have ninja installed).\n\nOn the initial build, you can also speed things up with the environment\nvariables `DEBUG`, `USE_DISTRIBUTED`, `USE_MKLDNN`, `USE_CUDA`, `USE_FLASH_ATTENTION`, `USE_MEM_EFF_ATTENTION`, `BUILD_TEST`, `USE_FBGEMM`, `USE_NNPACK` and `USE_QNNPACK`.\n\n- `DEBUG=1` will enable debug builds (-g -O0)\n- `REL_WITH_DEB_INFO=1` will enable debug symbols with optimizations (-g -O3)\n- `USE_DISTRIBUTED=0` will disable distributed (c10d, gloo, mpi, etc.) build.\n- `USE_MKLDNN=0` will disable using MKL-DNN.\n- `USE_CUDA=0` will disable compiling CUDA (in case you are developing on something not CUDA related), to save compile time.\n- `BUILD_TEST=0` will disable building C++ test binaries.\n- `USE_FBGEMM=0` will disable using FBGEMM (quantized 8-bit server operators).\n- `USE_NNPACK=0` will disable compiling with NNPACK.\n- `USE_QNNPACK=0` will disable QNNPACK build (quantized 8-bit operators).\n- `USE_XNNPACK=0` will disable compiling with XNNPACK.\n- `USE_FLASH_ATTENTION=0` and `USE_MEM_EFF_ATTENTION=0` will disable compiling flash attention and memory efficient kernels respectively\n\nFor example:\n\n```bash\nDEBUG=1 USE_DISTRIBUTED=0 USE_MKLDNN=0 USE_CUDA=0 BUILD_TEST=0 USE_FBGEMM=0 USE_NNPACK=0 USE_QNNPACK=0 USE_XNNPACK=0 python setup.py develop\n```\n\nFor subsequent builds (i.e., when `build/CMakeCache.txt` exists), the build\noptions passed for the first time will persist; please run `ccmake build/`, run\n`cmake-gui build/`, or directly edit `build/CMakeCache.txt` to adapt build\noptions.\n\n### Code completion and IDE support\n\nWhen using `python setup.py develop`, PyTorch will generate\na `compile_commands.json` file that can be used by many editors\nto provide command completion and error highlighting for PyTorch's\nC++ code. You need to `pip install ninja` to generate accurate\ninformation for the code in `torch/csrc`. More information at:\n- https://sarcasm.github.io/notes/dev/compilation-database.html\n\n### Make no-op build fast\n\n#### Use Ninja\n\nBy default, cmake will use its Makefile generator to generate your build\nsystem.  You can get faster builds if you install the ninja build system\nwith `pip install ninja`.  If PyTorch was already built, you will need\nto run `python setup.py clean` once after installing ninja for builds to\nsucceed.\n\nNote: Make sure to use a machine with a larger number of CPU cores, this will significantly reduce your build times.\n\n#### Use CCache\n\nEven when dependencies are tracked with file modification, there are many\nsituations where files get rebuilt when a previous compilation was exactly the\nsame. Using ccache in a situation like this is a real time-saver.\n\nBefore building pytorch, install ccache from your package manager of choice:\n\n```bash\nconda install ccache -c conda-forge\nsudo apt install ccache\nsudo yum install ccache\nbrew install ccache\n```\n\nYou may also find the default cache size in ccache is too small to be useful.\nThe cache sizes can be increased from the command line:\n\n```bash\n# config: cache dir is ~/.ccache, conf file ~/.ccache/ccache.conf\n# max size of cache\nccache -M 25Gi  # -M 0 for unlimited\n# unlimited number of files\nccache -F 0\n```\n\nTo check this is working, do two clean builds of pytorch in a row. The second\nbuild should be substantially and noticeably faster than the first build. If\nthis doesn't seem to be the case, check the `CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`\nrules in `build/CMakeCache.txt`, where `<LANG>` is `C`, `CXX` and `CUDA`.\nEach of these 3 variables should contain ccache, e.g.\n\n```\n//CXX compiler launcher\nCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER:STRING=/usr/bin/ccache\n```\n\nIf not, you can define these variables on the command line before invoking `setup.py`.\n\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_C_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache\nexport CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache\nexport CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=ccache\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n#### Use a faster linker\n\nIf you are editing a single file and rebuilding in a tight loop, the time spent\nlinking will dominate. The system linker available in most Linux distributions\n(GNU `ld`) is quite slow. Use a faster linker, like [lld](https://lld.llvm.org/).\n\nPeople on Mac, follow [this guide](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42730345/how-to-install-llvm-for-mac) instead.\n\nThe easiest way to use `lld` this is download the\n[latest LLVM binaries](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#8.0.0) and run:\n\n```bash\nln -s /path/to/downloaded/ld.lld /usr/local/bin/ld\n```\n\n#### Use pre-compiled headers\n\nSometimes there's no way of getting around rebuilding lots of files, for example\nediting `native_functions.yaml` usually means 1000+ files being rebuilt. If\nyou're using CMake newer than 3.16, you can enable pre-compiled headers by\nsetting `USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=1` either on first setup, or in the\n`CMakeCache.txt` file.\n\n```sh\nUSE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS=1 python setup.py develop\n```\n\nThis adds a build step where the compiler takes `<ATen/ATen.h>` and essentially\ndumps its internal AST to a file so the compiler can avoid repeating itself for\nevery `.cpp` file.\n\nOne caveat is that when enabled, this header gets included in every file by default.\nWhich may change what code is legal, for example:\n- internal functions can never alias existing names in `<ATen/ATen.h>`\n- names in `<ATen/ATen.h>` will work even if you don't explicitly include it.\n\n#### Workaround for header dependency bug in nvcc\nIf re-building without modifying any files results in several CUDA files being\nre-compiled, you may be running into an `nvcc` bug where header dependencies are\nnot converted to absolute paths before reporting it to the build system. This\nmakes `ninja` think one of the header files has been deleted, so it runs the\nbuild again.\n\nA compiler-wrapper to fix this is provided in `tools/nvcc_fix_deps.py`. You can use\nthis as a compiler launcher, similar to `ccache`\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_CUDA_COMPILER_LAUNCHER=\"python;`pwd`/tools/nvcc_fix_deps.py;ccache\"\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n### Rebuild few files with debug information\n\nWhile debugging a problem one often had to maintain a debug build in a separate folder.\nBut often only a few files needs to be rebuild with debug info to get a symbolicated backtrace or enable source debugging\nOne can easily solve this with the help of `tools/build_with_debinfo.py`\n\nFor example, suppose one wants to debug what is going on while tensor index is selected, which can be achieved by setting a breakpoint at `applySelect` function:\n```\n% lldb -o \"b applySelect\" -o \"process launch\" -- python3 -c \"import torch;print(torch.rand(5)[3])\"\n(lldb) target create \"python\"\nCurrent executable set to '/usr/bin/python3' (arm64).\n(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args  \"-c\" \"import torch;print(torch.rand(5)[3])\"\n(lldb) b applySelect\nBreakpoint 1: no locations (pending).\nWARNING:  Unable to resolve breakpoint to any actual locations.\n(lldb) process launch\n2 locations added to breakpoint 1\nProcess 87729 stopped\n* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1\n    frame #0: 0x00000001023d55a8 libtorch_python.dylib`at::indexing::impl::applySelect(at::Tensor const&, long long, c10::SymInt, long long, c10::Device const&, std::__1::optional<c10::ArrayRef<c10::SymInt>> const&)\nlibtorch_python.dylib`at::indexing::impl::applySelect:\n->  0x1023d55a8 <+0>:  sub    sp, sp, #0xd0\n    0x1023d55ac <+4>:  stp    x24, x23, [sp, #0x90]\n    0x1023d55b0 <+8>:  stp    x22, x21, [sp, #0xa0]\n    0x1023d55b4 <+12>: stp    x20, x19, [sp, #0xb0]\nTarget 0: (python) stopped.\nProcess 87729 launched: '/usr/bin/python' (arm64)\n```\nWhich is not very informative, but can be easily remedied by rebuilding `python_variable_indexing.cpp` with debug information\n```\n% ./tools/build_with_debinfo.py torch/csrc/autograd/python_variable_indexing.cpp\n[1 / 2] Building caffe2/torch/CMakeFiles/torch_python.dir/csrc/autograd/python_variable_indexing.cpp.o\n[2 / 2] Building lib/libtorch_python.dylib\n```\nAnd afterwards:\n```\n% lldb -o \"b applySelect\" -o \"process launch\" -- python3 -c \"import torch;print(torch.rand(5)[3])\"\n(lldb) target create \"python\"\nCurrent executable set to '/usr/bin/python3' (arm64).\n(lldb) settings set -- target.run-args  \"-c\" \"import torch;print(torch.rand(5)[3])\"\n(lldb) b applySelect\nBreakpoint 1: no locations (pending).\nWARNING:  Unable to resolve breakpoint to any actual locations.\n(lldb) process launch\n2 locations added to breakpoint 1\nProcess 87741 stopped\n* thread #1, queue = 'com.apple.main-thread', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1\n    frame #0: 0x00000001024e2628 libtorch_python.dylib`at::indexing::impl::applySelect(self=0x00000001004ee8a8, dim=0, index=(data_ = 3), real_dim=0, (null)=0x000000016fdfe535, self_sizes= Has Value=true ) at TensorIndexing.h:239:7\n   236         const at::Device& /*self_device*/,\n   237         const std::optional<SymIntArrayRef>& self_sizes) {\n   238       // See NOTE [nested tensor size for indexing]\n-> 239       if (self_sizes.has_value()) {\n   240         auto maybe_index = index.maybe_as_int();\n   241         if (maybe_index.has_value()) {\n   242           TORCH_CHECK_INDEX(\nTarget 0: (python) stopped.\nProcess 87741 launched: '/usr/bin/python3' (arm64)\n```\nWhich is much more useful, isn't it?\n\n### C++ frontend development tips\n\nWe have very extensive tests in the [test/cpp/api](test/cpp/api) folder. The\ntests are a great way to see how certain components are intended to be used.\nWhen compiling PyTorch from source, the test runner binary will be written to\n`build/bin/test_api`. The tests use the [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/master/googletest)\nframework, which you can read up about to learn how to configure the test runner. When\nsubmitting a new feature, we care very much that you write appropriate tests.\nPlease follow the lead of the other tests to see how to write a new test case.\n\n### GDB integration\n\nIf you are debugging pytorch inside GDB, you might be interested in\n[pytorch-gdb](tools/gdb/pytorch-gdb.py). This script introduces some\npytorch-specific commands which you can use from the GDB prompt. In\nparticular, `torch-tensor-repr` prints a human-readable repr of an at::Tensor\nobject. Example of usage:\n\n```\n$ gdb python\nGNU gdb (GDB) 9.2\n[...]\n(gdb) # insert a breakpoint when we call .neg()\n(gdb) break at::Tensor::neg\nFunction \"at::Tensor::neg\" not defined.\nMake breakpoint pending on future shared library load? (y or [n]) y\nBreakpoint 1 (at::Tensor::neg) pending.\n\n(gdb) run\n[...]\n>>> import torch\n>>> t = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3, 4], dtype=torch.float64)\n>>> t\ntensor([1., 2., 3., 4.], dtype=torch.float64)\n>>> t.neg()\n\nThread 1 \"python\" hit Breakpoint 1, at::Tensor::neg (this=0x7ffb118a9c88) at aten/src/ATen/core/TensorBody.h:3295\n3295    inline at::Tensor Tensor::neg() const {\n(gdb) # the default repr of 'this' is not very useful\n(gdb) p this\n$1 = (const at::Tensor * const) 0x7ffb118a9c88\n(gdb) p *this\n$2 = {impl_ = {target_ = 0x55629b5cd330}}\n(gdb) torch-tensor-repr *this\nPython-level repr of *this:\ntensor([1., 2., 3., 4.], dtype=torch.float64)\n```\n\nGDB tries to automatically load `pytorch-gdb` thanks to the\n[.gdbinit](.gdbinit) at the root of the pytorch repo. However, auto-loadings is disabled by default, because of security reasons:\n\n```bash\n$ gdb\nwarning: File \"/path/to/pytorch/.gdbinit\" auto-loading has been declined by your `auto-load safe-path' set to \"$debugdir:$datadir/auto-load\".\nTo enable execution of this file add\n        add-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/pytorch/.gdbinit\nline to your configuration file \"/home/YOUR-USERNAME/.gdbinit\".\nTo completely disable this security protection add\n        set auto-load safe-path /\nline to your configuration file \"/home/YOUR-USERNAME/.gdbinit\".\nFor more information about this security protection see the\n\"Auto-loading safe path\" section in the GDB manual.  E.g., run from the shell:\n        info \"(gdb)Auto-loading safe path\"\n(gdb)\n```\n\nAs gdb itself suggests, the best way to enable auto-loading of `pytorch-gdb`\nis to add the following line to your `~/.gdbinit` (i.e., the `.gdbinit` file\nwhich is in your home directory, **not** `/path/to/pytorch/.gdbinit`):\n\n```bash\nadd-auto-load-safe-path /path/to/pytorch/.gdbinit\n```\n\n### C++ stacktraces\nSet `TORCH_SHOW_CPP_STACKTRACES=1` to get the C++ stacktrace when an error occurs in Python.\n\n## CUDA development tips\n\nIf you are working on the CUDA code, here are some useful CUDA debugging tips:\n\n1. `CUDA_DEVICE_DEBUG=1` will enable CUDA device function debug symbols (`-g -G`).\n    This will be particularly helpful in debugging device code. However, it will\n    slow down the build process for about 50% (compared to only `DEBUG=1`), so use wisely.\n2. `cuda-gdb` and `cuda-memcheck` are your best CUDA debugging friends. Unlike`gdb`,\n   `cuda-gdb` can display actual values in a CUDA tensor (rather than all zeros).\n3. CUDA supports a lot of C++11/14 features such as, `std::numeric_limits`, `std::nextafter`,\n   `std::tuple` etc. in device code. Many of such features are possible because of the\n   [--expt-relaxed-constexpr](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#constexpr-functions)\n   nvcc flag. There is a known [issue](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/issues/374)\n   that ROCm errors out on device code, which uses such stl functions.\n4. A good performance metric for a CUDA kernel is the\n   [Effective Memory Bandwidth](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/how-implement-performance-metrics-cuda-cc/).\n   It is useful for you to measure this metric whenever you are writing/optimizing a CUDA\n   kernel. Following script shows how we can measure the effective bandwidth of CUDA `uniform_`\n   kernel.\n   ```python\n   import torch\n   from torch.utils.benchmark import Timer\n   size = 128*512\n   nrep = 100\n   nbytes_read_write = 4 # this is number of bytes read + written by a kernel. Change this to fit your kernel.\n\n   for i in range(10):\n       a=torch.empty(size).cuda().uniform_()\n       torch.cuda.synchronize()\n       out = a.uniform_()\n       torch.cuda.synchronize()\n       t = Timer(stmt=\"a.uniform_()\", globals=globals())\n       res = t.blocked_autorange()\n       timec = res.median\n       print(\"uniform, size, elements\", size, \"forward\", timec, \"bandwidth (GB/s)\", size*(nbytes_read_write)*1e-9/timec)\n       size *=2\n   ```\n\n  See more cuda development tips [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/CUDA-basics)\n\n## Windows development tips\n\nFor building from source on Windows, consult\n[our documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/windows.html) on it.\n\nOccasionally, you will write a patch which works on Linux, but fails CI on Windows.\nThere are a few aspects in which MSVC (the Windows compiler toolchain we use) is stricter\nthan Linux, which are worth keeping in mind when fixing these problems.\n\n1. Symbols are NOT exported by default on Windows; instead, you have to explicitly\n   mark a symbol as exported/imported in a header file with `__declspec(dllexport)` /\n   `__declspec(dllimport)`. We have codified this pattern into a set of macros\n   which follow the convention `*_API`, e.g., `TORCH_API` inside Caffe2, Aten and Torch.\n   (Every separate shared library needs a unique macro name, because symbol visibility\n   is on a per shared library basis. See c10/macros/Macros.h for more details.)\n\n   The upshot is if you see an \"unresolved external\" error in your Windows build, this\n   is probably because you forgot to mark a function with `*_API`. However, there is\n   one important counterexample to this principle: if you want a *templated* function\n   to be instantiated at the call site, do NOT mark it with `*_API` (if you do mark it,\n   you'll have to explicitly instantiate all of the specializations used by the call\n   sites.)\n\n2. If you link against a library, this does not make its dependencies transitively\n   visible. You must explicitly specify a link dependency against every library whose\n   symbols you use. (This is different from Linux where in most environments,\n   transitive dependencies can be used to fulfill unresolved symbols.)\n\n3. If you have a Windows box (we have a few on EC2 which you can request access to) and\n   you want to run the build, the easiest way is to just run `.ci/pytorch/win-build.sh`.\n   If you need to rebuild, run `REBUILD=1 .ci/pytorch/win-build.sh` (this will avoid\n   blowing away your Conda environment.)\n\nEven if you don't know anything about MSVC, you can use cmake to build simple programs on\nWindows; this can be helpful if you want to learn more about some peculiar linking behavior\nby reproducing it on a small example. Here's a simple example cmake file that defines\ntwo dynamic libraries, one linking with the other:\n\n```CMake\nproject(myproject CXX)\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 14)\nadd_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)\nadd_library(bar SHARED bar.cpp)\n# NB: don't forget to __declspec(dllexport) at least one symbol from foo,\n# otherwise foo.lib will not be created.\ntarget_link_libraries(bar PUBLIC foo)\n```\n\nYou can build it with:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build .\n```\n\n### Known MSVC (and MSVC with NVCC) bugs\n\nThe PyTorch codebase sometimes likes to use exciting C++ features, and\nthese exciting features lead to exciting bugs in Windows compilers.\nTo add insult to injury, the error messages will often not tell you\nwhich line of code actually induced the erroring template instantiation.\n\nWe've found the most effective way to debug these problems is to\ncarefully read over diffs, keeping in mind known bugs in MSVC/NVCC.\nHere are a few well known pitfalls and workarounds:\n\n* This is not actually a bug per se, but in general, code generated by MSVC\n  is more sensitive to memory errors; you may have written some code\n  that does a use-after-free or stack overflows; on Linux the code\n  might work, but on Windows your program will crash. ASAN may not\n  catch all of these problems: stay vigilant to the possibility that\n  your crash is due to a real memory problem.\n\n* `constexpr` generally works less well on MSVC.\n\n  * The idiom `static_assert(f() == f())` to test if `f` is constexpr\n    does not work; you'll get \"error C2131: expression did not evaluate\n    to a constant\". Don't use these asserts on Windows.\n    (Example: `c10/util/intrusive_ptr.h`)\n\n* (NVCC) Code you access inside a `static_assert` will eagerly be\n  evaluated as if it were device code, and so you might get an error\n  that the code is \"not accessible\".\n\n```cpp\nclass A {\n  static A singleton_;\n  static constexpr inline A* singleton() {\n    return &singleton_;\n  }\n};\nstatic_assert(std::is_same(A*, decltype(A::singleton()))::value, \"hmm\");\n```\n\n* The compiler will run out of heap space if you attempt to compile files that\n  are too large. Splitting such files into separate files helps.\n  (Example: `THTensorMath`, `THTensorMoreMath`, `THTensorEvenMoreMath`.)\n\n* MSVC's preprocessor (but not the standard compiler) has a bug\n  where it incorrectly tokenizes raw string literals, ending when it sees a `\"`.\n  This causes preprocessor tokens inside the literal like an`#endif`  to be incorrectly\n  treated as preprocessor directives. See https://godbolt.org/z/eVTIJq as an example.\n\n* Either MSVC or the Windows headers have a PURE macro defined and will replace\n  any occurrences of the PURE token in code with an empty string. This is why\n  we have AliasAnalysisKind::PURE_FUNCTION and not AliasAnalysisKind::PURE.\n  The same is likely true for other identifiers that we just didn't try to use yet.\n\n### Building on legacy code and CUDA\n\nCUDA, MSVC, and PyTorch versions are interdependent; please install matching versions from this table:\n| CUDA version | Newest supported VS version                             | PyTorch version |\n| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |\n| 10.1         | Visual Studio 2019 (16.X) (`_MSC_VER` < 1930)           |  1.3.0 ~ 1.7.0  |\n| 10.2         | Visual Studio 2019 (16.X) (`_MSC_VER` < 1930)           |  1.5.0 ~ 1.7.0  |\n| 11.0         | Visual Studio 2019 (16.X) (`_MSC_VER` < 1930)           |      1.7.0      |\n\nNote: There's a [compilation issue](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN/issues/812) in several Visual Studio 2019 versions since 16.7.1, so please make sure your Visual Studio 2019 version is not in 16.7.1 ~ 16.7.5\n\n## Pre-commit tidy/linting hook\n\nWe use clang-tidy to perform additional\nformatting and semantic checking of code. We provide a pre-commit git hook for\nperforming these checks, before a commit is created:\n\n  ```bash\n  ln -s ../../tools/git-pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit\n  ```\n\nIf you have already committed files and\nCI reports `flake8` errors, you can run the check locally in your PR branch with:\n\n  ```bash\n  flake8 $(git diff --name-only $(git merge-base --fork-point main))\n  ```\n\nYou'll need to install an appropriately configured flake8; see\n[Lint as you type](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Lint-as-you-type)\nfor documentation on how to do this.\n\nFix the code so that no errors are reported when you re-run the above check again,\nand then commit the fix.\n\n## Building PyTorch with ASAN\n\n[ASAN](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer) is very\nuseful for debugging memory errors in C++. We run it in CI, but here's how to\nget the same thing to run on your local machine.\n\nFirst, install LLVM 8. The easiest way is to get [prebuilt\nbinaries](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#8.0.0) and extract them to\nfolder (later called `$LLVM_ROOT`).\n\nThen set up the appropriate scripts. You can put this in your `.bashrc`:\n\n```bash\nLLVM_ROOT=<wherever your llvm install is>\nPYTORCH_ROOT=<wherever your pytorch checkout is>\n\nLIBASAN_RT=\"$LLVM_ROOT/lib/clang/8.0.0/lib/linux/libclang_rt.asan-x86_64.so\"\nbuild_with_asan()\n{\n  LD_PRELOAD=${LIBASAN_RT} \\\n  CC=\"$LLVM_ROOT/bin/clang\" \\\n  CXX=\"$LLVM_ROOT/bin/clang++\" \\\n  LDSHARED=\"clang --shared\" \\\n  LDFLAGS=\"-stdlib=libstdc++\" \\\n  CFLAGS=\"-fsanitize=address -fno-sanitize-recover=all -shared-libasan -pthread\" \\\n  CXX_FLAGS=\"-pthread\" \\\n  USE_CUDA=0 USE_OPENMP=0 USE_DISTRIBUTED=0 DEBUG=1 \\\n  python setup.py develop\n}\n\nrun_with_asan()\n{\n  LD_PRELOAD=${LIBASAN_RT} $@\n}\n\n# you can look at build-asan.sh to find the latest options the CI uses\nexport ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0:symbolize=1:strict_init_order=true\nexport UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1:suppressions=$PYTORCH_ROOT/ubsan.supp\nexport ASAN_SYMBOLIZER_PATH=$LLVM_ROOT/bin/llvm-symbolizer\n```\n\nThen you can use the scripts like:\n\n```\nsuo-devfair ~/pytorch ❯ build_with_asan\nsuo-devfair ~/pytorch ❯ run_with_asan python test/test_jit.py\n```\n\n### Getting `ccache` to work\n\nThe scripts above specify the `clang` and `clang++` binaries directly, which\nbypasses `ccache`. Here's how to get `ccache` to work:\n\n1. Make sure the ccache symlinks for `clang` and `clang++` are set up (see\n   CONTRIBUTING.md)\n2. Make sure `$LLVM_ROOT/bin` is available on your `$PATH`.\n3. Change the `CC` and `CXX` variables in `build_with_asan()` to point\n   directly to `clang` and `clang++`.\n\n### Why this stuff with `LD_PRELOAD` and `LIBASAN_RT`?\n\nThe “standard” workflow for ASAN assumes you have a standalone binary:\n\n1. Recompile your binary with `-fsanitize=address`.\n2. Run the binary, and ASAN will report whatever errors it find.\n\nUnfortunately, PyTorch is a distributed as a shared library that is loaded by\na third-party executable (Python). It’s too much of a hassle to recompile all\nof Python every time we want to use ASAN. Luckily, the ASAN folks have a\nworkaround for cases like this:\n\n1. Recompile your library with `-fsanitize=address -shared-libasan`. The\n   extra `-shared-libasan` tells the compiler to ask for the shared ASAN\n   runtime library.\n2. Use `LD_PRELOAD` to tell the dynamic linker to load the ASAN runtime\n   library before anything else.\n\nMore information can be found\n[here](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerAsDso).\n\n### Why LD_PRELOAD in the build function?\n\nWe need `LD_PRELOAD` because there is a cmake check that ensures that a\nsimple program builds and runs. If we are building with ASAN as a shared\nlibrary, we need to `LD_PRELOAD` the runtime library, otherwise there will\ndynamic linker errors and the check will fail.\n\nWe don’t actually need either of these if we fix the cmake checks.\n\n### Why no leak detection?\n\nPython leaks a lot of memory. Possibly we could configure a suppression file,\nbut we haven’t gotten around to it.\n\n## Caffe2 notes\n\nIn 2018, we merged Caffe2 into the PyTorch source repository. While the\nsteady state aspiration is that Caffe2 and PyTorch share code freely,\nin the meantime there will be some separation.\n\nThere are a few \"unusual\" directories which, for historical reasons,\nare Caffe2/PyTorch specific. Here they are:\n\n- `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `binaries`, `cmake`, `conda`, `modules`,\n  `scripts` are Caffe2-specific. Don't put PyTorch code in them without\n  extra coordination.\n\n- `mypy*`, `requirements.txt`, `setup.py`, `test`, `tools` are\n  PyTorch-specific. Don't put Caffe2 code in them without extra\n  coordination.\n\n## CI failure tips\n\nOnce you submit a PR or push a new commit to a branch that is in\nan active PR, CI jobs will be run automatically. Some of these may\nfail and you will need to find out why, by looking at the logs.\n\nFairly often, a CI failure might be unrelated to your changes. You can\nconfirm by going to our [HUD](https://hud.pytorch.org) and seeing if the CI job\nis failing upstream already. In this case, you\ncan usually ignore the failure. See [the following\nsubsection](#which-commit-is-used-in-ci) for more details.\n\nSome failures might be related to specific hardware or environment\nconfigurations. In this case, if you're a Meta employee, you can ssh into\nthe job's session to perform manual debugging following the instructions in\nour [CI wiki](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Debugging-using-with-ssh-for-Github-Actions).\n\n\n### Which commit is used in CI?\n\nFor CI run on `main`, this repository is checked out for a given `main`\ncommit, and CI is run on that commit (there isn't really any other choice).\n\nFor PRs, however, it's a bit more complicated. Consider this commit graph, where\n`main` is at commit `A`, and the branch for PR #42 (just a placeholder) is at\ncommit `B`:\n\n```\n       o---o---B (refs/pull/42/head)\n      /         \\\n     /           C (refs/pull/42/merge)\n    /           /\n---o---o---o---A (merge-destination) - usually main\n```\n\nThere are two possible choices for which commit to use:\n\n1. Checkout commit `B`, the head of the PR (manually committed by the PR\n   author).\n2. Checkout commit `C`, the hypothetical result of what would happen if the PR\n   were merged into its destination (usually `main`).\n\nFor all practical purposes, most people can think of the commit being used as\ncommit `B` (choice **1**).\n\nHowever, if workflow files (which govern CI behavior) were modified (either by your PR or since dev branch were created ) there's\na nuance to know about:\nThe workflow files themselves get taken from checkpoint `C`, the merger of your\nPR and the `main` branch. But only the workflow files get taken from that merged\ncheckpoint. Everything else (tests, code, etc) all get taken directly from your\nPR's commit (commit `B`). Please note, this scenario would never affect PRs authored by `ghstack` as they would not automatically ingest the updates from default branch.\n\n\n## Dev Infra Office Hours\n[Dev Infra Office Hours](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/wiki/Dev-Infra-Office-Hours) are hosted every Friday to answer any questions regarding developer experience, Green HUD, and CI.\n"

Useful for data loading and Hogwild training |\n| [**torch.utils**](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) | DataLoader and other utility functions for convenience |\n\nUsually, PyTorch is used either as:\n\n- A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs.\n- A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed.\n\nElaborating Further:\n\n### A GPU-Ready Tensor Library\n\nIf you use NumPy, then you have used Tensors (a.k.a. ndarray).\n\n![Tensor illustration](./docs/source/_static/img/tensor_illustration.png)\n\nPyTorch provides Tensors that can live either on the CPU or the GPU and accelerates the\ncomputation by a huge amount.\n\nWe provide a wide variety of tensor routines to accelerate and fit your scientific computation needs\nsuch as slicing, indexing, mathematical operations, linear algebra, reductions.\nAnd they are fast!\n\n### Dynamic Neural Networks: Tape-Based Autograd\n\nPyTorch has a unique way of building neural networks: using and replaying a tape recorder.\n\nMost frameworks such as TensorFlow, Theano, Caffe, and CNTK have a static view of the world.\nOne has to build a neural network and reuse the same structure again and again.\nChanging the way the network behaves means that one has to start from scratch.\n\nWith PyTorch, we use a technique called reverse-mode auto-differentiation, which allows you to\nchange the way your network behaves arbitrarily with zero lag or overhead. Our inspiration comes\nfrom several research papers on this topic, as well as current and past work such as\n[torch-autograd](https://github.com/twitter/torch-autograd),\n[autograd](https://github.com/HIPS/autograd),\n[Chainer](https://chainer.org), etc.\n\nWhile this technique is not unique to PyTorch, it's one of the fastest implementations of it to date.\nYou get the best of speed and flexibility for your crazy research.\n\n![Dynamic graph](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/raw/main/docs/source/_static/img/dynamic_graph.gif)\n\n### Python First\n\nPyTorch is not a Python binding into a monolithic C++ framework.\nIt is built to be deeply integrated into Python.\nYou can use it naturally like you would use [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/) / [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) / [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) etc.\nYou can write your new neural network layers in Python itself, using your favorite libraries\nand use packages such as [Cython](https://cython.org/) and [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/).\nOur goal is to not reinvent the wheel where appropriate.\n\n### Imperative Experiences\n\nPyTorch is designed to be intuitive, linear in thought, and easy to use.\nWhen you execute a line of code, it gets executed. There isn't an asynchronous view of the world.\nWhen you drop into a debugger or receive error messages and stack traces, understanding them is straightforward.\nThe stack trace points to exactly where your code was defined.\nWe hope you never spend hours debugging your code because of bad stack traces or asynchronous and opaque execution engines.\n\n### Fast and Lean\n\nPyTorch has minimal framework overhead. We integrate acceleration libraries\nsuch as [Intel MKL](https://software.intel.com/mkl) and NVIDIA ([cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn), [NCCL](https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl)) to maximize speed.\nAt the core, its CPU and GPU Tensor and neural network backends\nare mature and have been tested for years.\n\nHence, PyTorch is quite fast — whether you run small or large neural networks.\n\nThe memory usage in PyTorch is extremely efficient compared to Torch or some of the alternatives.\nWe've written custom memory allocators for the GPU to make sure that\nyour deep learning models are maximally memory efficient.\nThis enables you to train bigger deep learning models than before.\n\n### Extensions Without Pain\n\nWriting new neural network modules, or interfacing with PyTorch's Tensor API was designed to be straightforward\nand with minimal abstractions.\n\nYou can write new neural network layers in Python using the torch API\n[or your favorite NumPy-based libraries such as SciPy](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/numpy_extensions_tutorial.html).\n\nIf you want to write your layers in C/C++, we provide a convenient extension API that is efficient and with minimal boilerplate.\nNo wrapper code needs to be written. You can see [a tutorial here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_extension.html) and [an example here](https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n### Binaries\nCommands to install binaries via Conda or pip wheels are on our website: [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)\n\n\n#### NVIDIA Jetson Platforms\n\nPython wheels for NVIDIA's Jetson Nano, Jetson TX1/TX2, Jetson Xavier NX/AGX, and Jetson AGX Orin are provided [here](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/pytorch-for-jetson-version-1-10-now-available/72048) and the L4T container is published [here](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/containers/l4t-pytorch)\n\nThey require JetPack 4.2 and above, and [@dusty-nv](https://github.com/dusty-nv) and [@ptrblck](https://github.com/ptrblck) are maintaining them.\n\n\n### From Source\n\n#### Prerequisites\nIf you are installing from source, you will need:\n- Python 3.9 or later\n- A compiler that fully supports C++17, such as clang or gcc (gcc 9.4.0 or newer is required, on Linux)\n- Visual Studio or Visual Studio Build Tool (Windows only)\n\n\\* PyTorch CI uses Visual C++ BuildTools, which come with Visual Studio Enterprise,\nProfessional, or Community Editions. You can also install the build tools from\nhttps://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/. The build tools *do not*\ncome with Visual Studio Code by default.\n\n\\* We highly recommend installing an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) environment. You will get a high-quality BLAS library (MKL) and you get controlled dependency versions regardless of your Linux distro.\n\nAn example of environment setup is shown below:\n\n* Linux:\n\n```bash\n$ source <CONDA_INSTALL_DIR>/bin/activate\n$ conda create -y -n <CONDA_NAME>\n$ conda activate <CONDA_NAME>\n```\n\n* Windows:\n\n```bash\n$ source <CONDA_INSTALL_DIR>\\Scripts\\activate.bat\n$ conda create -y -n <CONDA_NAME>\n$ conda activate <CONDA_NAME>\n$ call \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\<VERSION>\\Community\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64\n```\n\n##### NVIDIA CUDA Support\nIf you want to compile with CUDA support, [select a supported version of CUDA from our support matrix](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), then install the following:\n- [NVIDIA CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)\n- [NVIDIA cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) v8.5 or above\n- [Compiler](https://gist.github.com/ax3l/9489132) compatible with CUDA\n\nNote: You could refer to the [cuDNN Support Matrix](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/reference/support-matrix.html) for cuDNN versions with the various supported CUDA, CUDA driver and NVIDIA hardware\n\nIf you want to disable CUDA support, export the environment variable `USE_CUDA=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\nIf you are building for NVIDIA's Jetson platforms (Jetson Nano, TX1, TX2, AGX Xavier), Instructions to install PyTorch for Jetson Nano are [available here](https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/1049071/jetson-nano/pytorch-for-jetson-nano/)\n\n##### AMD ROCm Support\nIf you want to compile with ROCm support, install\n- [AMD ROCm](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/deploy/linux/quick_start.html) 4.0 and above installation\n- ROCm is currently supported only for Linux systems.\n\nBy default the build system expects ROCm to be installed in `/opt/rocm`. If ROCm is installed in a different directory, the `ROCM_PATH` environment variable must be set to the ROCm installation directory. The build system automatically detects the AMD GPU architecture. Optionally, the AMD GPU architecture can be explicitly set with the `PYTORCH_ROCM_ARCH` environment variable [AMD GPU architecture](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-gpus)\n\nIf you want to disable ROCm support, export the environment variable `USE_ROCM=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\n##### Intel GPU Support\nIf you want to compile with Intel GPU support, follow these\n- [PyTorch Prerequisites for Intel GPUs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pytorch-prerequisites-for-intel-gpus.html) instructions.\n- Intel GPU is supported for Linux and Windows.\n\nIf you want to disable Intel GPU support, export the environment variable `USE_XPU=0`.\nOther potentially useful environment variables may be found in `setup.py`.\n\n#### Get the PyTorch Source\n```bash\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch\ncd pytorch\n# if you are updating an existing checkout\ngit submodule sync\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n#### Install Dependencies\n\n**Common**\n\n```bash\nconda install cmake ninja\n# Run this command from the PyTorch directory after cloning the source code using the “Get the PyTorch Source“ section below\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n**On Linux**\n\n```bash\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# CUDA only: Add LAPACK support for the GPU if needed\nconda install -c pytorch magma-cuda121  # or the magma-cuda* that matches your CUDA version from https://anaconda.org/pytorch/repo\n\n# (optional) If using torch.compile with inductor/triton, install the matching version of triton\n# Run from the pytorch directory after cloning\n# For Intel GPU support, please explicitly `export USE_XPU=1` before running command.\nmake triton\n```\n\n**On MacOS**\n\n```bash\n# Add this package on intel x86 processor machines only\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed\nconda install pkg-config libuv\n```\n\n**On Windows**\n\n```bash\npip install mkl-static mkl-include\n# Add these packages if torch.distributed is needed.\n# Distributed package support on Windows is a prototype feature and is subject to changes.\nconda install -c conda-forge libuv=1.39\n```\n\n#### Install PyTorch\n**On Linux**\n\nIf you would like to compile PyTorch with [new C++ ABI](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html) enabled, then first run this command:\n```bash\nexport _GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=1\n```\n\nPlease **note** that starting from PyTorch 2.5, the PyTorch build with XPU supports both new and old C++ ABIs. Previously, XPU only supported the new C++ ABI. If you want to compile with Intel GPU support, please follow [Intel GPU Support](#intel-gpu-support).\n\nIf you're compiling for AMD ROCm then first run this command:\n```bash\n# Only run this if you're compiling for ROCm\npython tools/amd_build/build_amd.py\n```\n\nInstall PyTorch\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))/../'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\n**On macOS**\n\n```bash\npython3 setup.py develop\n```\n\n**On Windows**\n\nIf you want to build legacy python code, please refer to [Building on legacy code and CUDA](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#building-on-legacy-code-and-cuda)\n\n**CPU-only builds**\n\nIn this mode PyTorch computations will run on your CPU, not your GPU\n\n```cmd\npython setup.py develop\n```\n\nNote on OpenMP: The desired OpenMP implementation is Intel OpenMP (iomp). In order to link against iomp, you'll need to manually download the library and set up the building environment by tweaking `CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH` and `LIB`. The instruction [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/docs/source/notes/windows.rst#building-from-source) is an example for setting up both MKL and Intel OpenMP. Without these configurations for CMake, Microsoft Visual C OpenMP runtime (vcomp) will be used.\n\n**CUDA based build**\n\nIn this mode PyTorch computations will leverage your GPU via CUDA for faster number crunching\n\n[NVTX](https://docs.nvidia.com/gameworks/content/gameworkslibrary/nvtx/nvidia_tools_extension_library_nvtx.htm) is needed to build Pytorch with CUDA.\nNVTX is a part of CUDA distributive, where it is called \"Nsight Compute\". To install it onto an already installed CUDA run CUDA installation once again and check the corresponding checkbox.\nMake sure that CUDA with Nsight Compute is installed after Visual Studio.\n\nCurrently, VS 2017 / 2019, and Ninja are supported as the generator of CMake. If `ninja.exe` is detected in `PATH`, then Ninja will be used as the default generator, otherwise, it will use VS 2017 / 2019.\n<br/> If Ninja is selected as the generator, the latest MSVC will get selected as the underlying toolchain.\n\nAdditional libraries such as\n[Magma](https://developer.nvidia.com/magma), [oneDNN, a.k.a. MKLDNN or DNNL](https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN), and [Sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) are often needed. Please refer to the [installation-helper](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/installation-helpers) to install them.\n\nYou can refer to the [build_pytorch.bat](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.ci/pytorch/win-test-helpers/build_pytorch.bat) script for some other environment variables configurations\n\n\n```cmd\ncmd\n\n:: Set the environment variables after you have downloaded and unzipped the mkl package,\n:: else CMake would throw an error as `Could NOT find OpenMP`.\nset CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH={Your directory}\\mkl\\include\nset LIB={Your directory}\\mkl\\lib;%LIB%\n\n:: Read the content in the previous section carefully before you proceed.\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the underlying toolset used by Ninja and Visual Studio with CUDA, please run the following script block.\n:: \"Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt\" will be run automatically.\n:: Make sure you have CMake >= 3.12 before you do this when you use the Visual Studio generator.\nset CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION=14.27\nset DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1\nfor /f \"usebackq tokens=*\" %i in (`\"%ProgramFiles(x86)%\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\Installer\\vswhere.exe\" -version [15^,17^) -products * -latest -property installationPath`) do call \"%i\\VC\\Auxiliary\\Build\\vcvarsall.bat\" x64 -vcvars_ver=%CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET_VERSION%\n\n:: [Optional] If you want to override the CUDA host compiler\nset CUDAHOSTCXX=C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\VC\\Tools\\MSVC\\14.27.29110\\bin\\HostX64\\x64\\cl.exe\n\npython setup.py develop\n\n```\n\n##### Adjust Build Options (Optional)\n\nYou can adjust the configuration of cmake variables optionally (without building first), by doing\nthe following. For example, adjusting the pre-detected directories for CuDNN or BLAS can be done\nwith such a step.\n\nOn Linux\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))/../'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\npython setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\nOn macOS\n```bash\nexport CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"${CONDA_PREFIX:-'$(dirname $(which conda))/../'}:${CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH}\"\nMACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.9 CC=clang CXX=clang++ python setup.py build --cmake-only\nccmake build  # or cmake-gui build\n```\n\n### Docker Image\n\n#### Using pre-built images\n\nYou can also pull a pre-built docker image from Docker Hub and run with docker v19.03+\n\n```bash\ndocker run --gpus all --rm -ti --ipc=host pytorch/pytorch:latest\n```\n\nPlease note that PyTorch uses shared memory to share data between processes, so if torch multiprocessing is used (e.g.\nfor multithreaded data loaders) the default shared memory segment size that container runs with is not enough, and you\nshould increase shared memory size either with `--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.\n\n#### Building the image yourself\n\n**NOTE:** Must be built with a docker version > 18.06\n\nThe `Dockerfile` is supplied to build images with CUDA 11.1 support and cuDNN v8.\nYou can pass `PYTHON_VERSION=x.y` make variable to specify which Python version is to be used by Miniconda, or leave it\nunset to use the default.\n\n```bash\nmake -f docker.Makefile\n# images are tagged as docker.io/${your_docker_username}/pytorch\n```\n\nYou can also pass the `CMAKE_VARS=\"...\"` environment variable to specify additional CMake variables to be passed to CMake during the build.\nSee [setup.py](./setup.py) for the list of available variables.\n\n```bash\nmake -f docker.Makefile\n```\n\n### Building the Documentation\n\nTo build documentation in various formats, you will need [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the\nreadthedocs theme.\n\n```bash\ncd docs/\npip install -r requirements.txt\nmake html\nmake serve\n```\n\nRun `make` to get a list of all available output formats.\n\nIf you get a katex error run `npm install katex`.  If it persists, try\n`npm install -g katex`\n\n> Note: if you installed `nodejs` with a different package manager (e.g.,\n`conda`) then `npm` will probably install a version of `katex` that is not\ncompatible with your version of `nodejs` and doc builds will fail.\nA combination of versions that is known to work is `node@6.13.1` and\n`katex@0.13.18`. To install the latter with `npm` you can run\n```npm install -g katex@0.13.18```\n\n### Previous Versions\n\nInstallation instructions and binaries for previous PyTorch versions may be found\non [our website](https://pytorch.org/previous-versions).\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nThree-pointers to get you started:\n- [Tutorials: get you started with understanding and using PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)\n- [Examples: easy to understand PyTorch code across all domains](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)\n- [The API Reference](https://pytorch.org/docs/)\n- [Glossary](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/GLOSSARY.md)\n\n## Resources\n\n* [PyTorch.org](https://pytorch.org/)\n* [PyTorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/)\n* [PyTorch Examples](https://github.com/pytorch/examples)\n* [PyTorch Models](https://pytorch.org/hub/)\n* [Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188)\n* [Intro to Machine Learning with PyTorch from Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229)\n* [Deep Neural Networks with PyTorch from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-networks-with-pytorch)\n* [PyTorch Twitter](https://twitter.com/PyTorch)\n* [PyTorch Blog](https://pytorch.org/blog/)\n* [PyTorch YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWXI5YeOsh03QvJ59PMaXFw)\n\n## Communication\n* Forums: Discuss implementations, research, etc. https://discuss.pytorch.org\n* GitHub Issues: Bug reports, feature requests, install issues, RFCs, thoughts, etc.\n* Slack: The [PyTorch Slack](https://pytorch.slack.com/) hosts a primary audience of moderate to experienced PyTorch users and developers for general chat, online discussions, collaboration, etc. If you are a beginner looking for help, the primary medium is [PyTorch Forums](https://discuss.pytorch.org).

Cutting a release branch preparations\n1. Cutting a release branch and making release branch specific changes\n2. Drafting RCs (Release Candidates), and merging cherry picks\n3. Preparing and Creating Final Release Candidate\n4. Promoting Final RC to stable and performing release day tasks\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* Q: What is release branch cut  ?\n  * A: When bulk of the tracked features merged into the main branch, the primary release engineer starts the release process of cutting the release branch by creating a new git branch based off of the current `main` development branch of PyTorch. This allows PyTorch development flow on `main` to continue uninterrupted, while the release engineering team focuses on stabilizing the release branch in order to release a series of release candidates (RC). The activities in the release branch include both regression and performance testing as well as polishing new features and fixing release-specific bugs. In general, new features *are not* added to the release branch after it was created.\n\n* Q: What is cherry-pick ?\n  * A: A cherry pick is a process of propagating commits from the main into the release branch, utilizing git's built in [cherry-pick feature](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick). These commits are typically limited to small fixes or documentation updates to ensure that the release engineering team has sufficient time to complete a thorough round of testing on the release branch. To nominate a fix for cherry-picking, a separate pull request must be created against the respective release branch and then mentioned in the Release Tracker issue (example: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/94937) following the template from the issue description. The comment nominating a particular cherry-pick for inclusion in the release should include the committed PR against main branch, the newly created cherry-pick PR, as well as the acceptance criteria for why the cherry-pick is needed in the first place.\n\n## Cutting a release branch preparations\n\nFollowing Requirements needs to be met prior to cutting a release branch:\n\n* Resolve all outstanding issues in the milestones(for example [1.11.0](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/milestone/28))before first RC cut is completed. After RC cut is completed following script should be executed from builder repo in order to validate the presence of the fixes in the release branch :\n``` python github_analyze.py --repo-path ~/local/pytorch --remote upstream --branch release/1.11 --milestone-id 26 --missing-in-branch ```\n* Validate that all new workflows have been created in the PyTorch and domain libraries included in the release. Validate it against all dimensions of release matrix, including operating systems(Linux, MacOS, Windows), Python versions as well as CPU architectures(x86 and arm) and accelerator versions(CUDA, ROCm).\n* All the nightly jobs for pytorch and domain libraries should be green. Validate this using following HUD links:\n  * [Pytorch](https://hud.pytorch.org/hud/pytorch/pytorch/nightly)\n  * [TorchVision](https://hud.pytorch.org/hud/pytorch/vision/nightly)\n  * [TorchAudio](https://hud.pytorch.org/hud/pytorch/audio/nightly)\n\n## Cutting release branches\n\n### `pytorch/pytorch`\n\nRelease branches are typically cut from the branch [`viable/strict`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/viable/strict) as to ensure that tests are passing on the release branch.\n\nThere's a convenience script to create release branches from current `viable/strict`. Perform following actions :\n* Perform a fresh clone of pytorch repo using\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:pytorch/pytorch.git\n```\n\n* Execute following command from PyTorch repository root folder:\n```bash\nDRY_RUN=disabled scripts/release/cut-release-branch.sh\n```\nThis script should create 2 branches:\n* `release/{MAJOR}.{MINOR}`\n* `orig/release/{MAJOR}.{MINOR}`\n\n### `pytorch/builder` / PyTorch domain libraries\n\n*Note*:  Release branches for individual domain libraries should be created after first release candidate build of PyTorch is available in staging channels (which happens about a week after PyTorch release branch has been created). This is absolutely required to allow sufficient testing time for each of the domain library. Domain libraries branch cut is performed by Domain Library POC.\nBuilder branch cut should be performed at the same time as Pytorch core branch cut. Convenience script can also be used domains as well as `pytorch/builder`\n\n> NOTE: RELEASE_VERSION only needs to be specified if version.txt is not available in root directory\n\n```bash\nDRY_RUN=disabled GIT_BRANCH_TO_CUT_FROM=main RELEASE_VERSION=1.11 scripts/release/cut-release-branch.sh\n```\n\n### Making release branch specific changes for PyTorch\n\nThese are examples of changes that should be made to release branches so that CI / tooling can function normally on\nthem:\n\n* Update backwards compatibility tests to use RC binaries instead of nightlies\n  * Example: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/77983 and https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/77986\n* A release branches should also be created in [`pytorch/xla`](https://github.com/pytorch/xla) and [`pytorch/builder`](https://github.com/pytorch/builder) repos and pinned in `pytorch/pytorch`\n  * Example: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/86290 and https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/90506\n* Update branch used in composite actions from trunk to release (for example, can be done by running `for i in .github/workflows/*.yml; do sed -i -e s#@main#@release/2.0# $i; done`\n  * Example: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/commit/17f400404f2ca07ea5ac864428e3d08149de2304\n\nThese are examples of changes that should be made to the *default* branch after a release branch is cut\n\n* Nightly versions should be updated in all version files to the next MINOR release (i.e. 0.9.0 -> 0.10.0) in the default branch:\n  * Example: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/77984\n\n### Making release branch specific changes for domain libraries\n\nDomain library branch cut is done a week after branch cut for the `pytorch/pytorch`. The branch cut is performed by the Domain Library POC.\nAfter the branch cut is performed, the Pytorch Dev Infra member should be informed of the branch cut and Domain Library specific change is required before Drafting RC for this domain library.\n\nFollow these examples of PR that updates the version and sets RC Candidate upload channel:\n* torchvision : https://github.com/pytorch/vision/pull/5400\n* torchaudio: https://github.com/pytorch/audio/pull/2210\n\n## Running Launch Execution team Core XFN sync\n\nThe series of meetings for Core XFN sync should be organized. The goal of these meetings are the following:\n1. Establish release POC's from each of the workstreams\n2. Cover the tactical phase of releasing minor releases to the market\n3. Discuss possible release blockers\n\nFollowing POC's should be assigned from each of the workstreams:\n* Core/Marketing\n* Release Eng\n* Doc Eng\n* Release notes\n* Partner\n\n**NOTE**: The meetings should start after the release branch is created and should continue until the week of the release.\n\n## Drafting RCs (Release Candidates) for PyTorch and domain libraries\n\nTo draft RCs, a user with the necessary permissions can push a git tag to the main `pytorch/pytorch` git repository. Please note: exactly same process is used for each of the domain library\n\nThe git tag for a release candidate must follow the following format:\n```\nv{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}-rc{RC_NUMBER}\n```\n\nAn example of this would look like:\n```\nv1.12.0-rc1\n```\nYou can use following commands to perform tag from pytorch core repo (not fork):\n* Checkout and validate the repo history before tagging\n```\ngit checkout release/1.12\ngit log --oneline\n```\n* Perform tag and push it to github (this will trigger the binary release build)\n```\ngit tag -f  v1.12.0-rc2\ngit push origin  v1.12.0-rc2\n```\n\nPushing a release candidate should trigger the `binary_builds` workflow within CircleCI using [`pytorch/pytorch-probot`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch-probot)'s [`trigger-circleci-workflows`](trigger-circleci-workflows) functionality.\n\nThis trigger functionality is configured here: [`pytorch-circleci-labels.yml`](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.github/pytorch-circleci-labels.yml)\n\nTo view the state of the release build, please navigate to [HUD](https://hud.pytorch.org/hud/pytorch/pytorch/release%2F1.12). And make sure all binary builds are successful.\n### Release Candidate Storage\n\nRelease candidates are currently stored in the following places:\n\n* Wheels: https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/\n* Conda: https://anaconda.org/pytorch-test\n* Libtorch: https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/test\n\nBackups are stored in a non-public S3 bucket at [`s3://pytorch-backup`](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/pytorch-backup?region=us-east-1&tab=objects)\n\n### Release Candidate health validation\n\nValidate the release jobs for pytorch and domain libraries should be green. Validate this using following HUD links:\n  * [Pytorch](https://hud.pytorch.org/hud/pytorch/pytorch/release%2F1.12)\n  * [TorchVision](https://hud.pytorch.org/hud/pytorch/vision/release%2F1.12)\n  * [TorchAudio](https://hud.pytorch.org/hud/pytorch/audio/release%2F1.12)\n\nValidate that the documentation build has completed and generated entry corresponding to the release in  [docs repository](https://github.com/pytorch/docs/tree/main/).\n\n### Cherry Picking Fixes\n\nTypically, within a release cycle fixes are necessary for regressions, test fixes, etc.\n\nFor fixes that are to go into a release after the release branch has been cut we typically employ the use of a cherry pick tracker.\n\nAn example of this would look like:\n* https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/128436\n\nPlease also make sure to add milestone target to the PR/issue, especially if it needs to be considered for inclusion into the dot release.\n\n**NOTE**: The cherry pick process is not an invitation to add new features, it is mainly there to fix regressions\n\n#### How to do Cherry Picking\n\nYou can now use `pytorchbot` to cherry pick a PyTorch PR that has been committed\nto the main branch using `@pytorchbot cherry-pick` command as follows (make sure\nthat the cherry-pick tracker issue for the target release labelled as \"release tracker\" -\nthis will allow the bot to find it and post comments).\n\n```\nusage: @pytorchbot cherry-pick --onto ONTO [--fixes FIXES] -c\n                               {regression,critical,fixnewfeature,docs,release}\n\nCherry pick a pull request onto a release branch for inclusion in a release\n\noptional arguments:\n  --onto ONTO           Branch you would like to cherry pick onto (Example: release/2.2)\n  --fixes FIXES         Link to the issue that your PR fixes (i.e. https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/110666)\n  -c {regression,critical,fixnewfeature,docs,release}\n                        A machine-friendly classification of the cherry-pick reason.\n```\n\nFor example, [#120567](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/120567#issuecomment-1978964376)\ncreated a cherry pick PR [#121232](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/121232) onto `release/2.2`\nbranch to fix a regression issue. You can then refer to the original\nand the cherry-picked PRs on the release tracker issue. Please note\nthat the cherry-picked PR will still need to be reviewed by PyTorch\nRelEng team before it can go into the release branch. This feature\nrequires `pytorchbot`, so it's only available in PyTorch atm.\n\n### Cherry Picking Reverts\n\nIf PR that has been cherry-picked into release branch has been reverted, its cherry-pick must be reverted as well.\n\nReverts for changes that was committed into the main branch prior to the branch cut, must be propagated into release branch as well.\n\n## Preparing and Creating Final Release candidate\n\nThe following requirements need to be met prior to creating final Release Candidate :\n\n* Resolve all outstanding open issues in the milestone. There should be no open issues/PRs (for example [2.1.2](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/milestone/39)). The issue should either be closed or de-milestoned.\n\n* Validate that all closed milestone PRs are present in the release branch. Confirm this by running:\n``` python github_analyze.py --repo-path ~/local/pytorch --remote upstream --branch release/2.2 --milestone-id 40 --missing-in-branch ```\n\n* No outstanding cherry-picks that need to be reviewed in the issue tracker: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/115300\n\n* Perform [Release Candidate health validation](#release-candidate-health-validation). CI should have the green signal.\n\nAfter the final RC is created. The following tasks should be performed :\n\n* Perform [Release Candidate health validation](#release-candidate-health-validation). CI should have the green signal.\n\n* Run and inspect the output [Validate Binaries](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/actions/workflows/validate-binaries.yml) workflow.\n\n* All the closed issues from [milestone](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/milestone/39) need to be validated. Confirm the validation by commenting on the issue: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/113568#issuecomment-1851031064\n\n* Create validation issue for the release, see for example [Validations for 2.1.2 release](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/114904) and perform required validations.\n\n* Run performance tests in [benchmark repository](https://github.com/pytorch/benchmark). Make sure there are no performance regressions.\n\n* Prepare and stage PyPI binaries for promotion. This is done with this script:\n[`pytorch/builder:release/pypi/promote_pypi_to_staging.sh`](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/blob/main/release/pypi/promote_pypi_to_staging.sh)\n\n* Validate staged PyPI binaries. Make sure generated packages are correct and package size does not exceeds maximum allowed PyPI package size.\n\n## Promoting RCs to Stable\n\nPromotion of RCs to stable is done with this script:\n[`pytorch/builder:release/promote.sh`](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/blob/main/release/promote.sh)\n\nUsers of that script should take care to update the versions necessary for the specific packages you are attempting to promote.\n\nPromotion should occur in two steps:\n* Promote S3 artifacts (wheels, libtorch) and Conda packages\n* Promote S3 wheels to PyPI\n\n**NOTE**: The promotion of wheels to PyPI can only be done once so take caution when attempting to promote wheels to PyPI, (see https://github.com/pypa/warehouse/issues/726 for a discussion on potential draft releases within PyPI)\n\n## Additional Steps to prepare for release day\n\nThe following should be prepared for the release day\n\n### Modify release matrix\n\nNeed to modify release matrix for get started page. See following [PR](https://github.com/pytorch/test-infra/pull/4611) as reference.\n\nThe PR to update published_versions.json and quick-start-module.js is auto generated. See following [PR](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch.github.io/pull/1467) as reference.\n\nPlease note: This PR needs to be merged on the release day and hence it should be absolutely free of any failures. To test this PR, open another test PR but pointing to the Release candidate location as above [Release Candidate Storage](RELEASE.md#release-candidate-storage)\n\n### Open Google Colab issue\n\nThis is normally done right after the release is completed. We would need to create Google Colab Issue see following [PR](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/2372)\n\n# Patch Releases\n\nA patch release is a maintenance release of PyTorch that includes fixes for regressions found in a previous minor release. Patch releases typically will bump the `patch` version from semver (i.e. `[major].[minor].[patch]`).\n\nPlease note: Starting from 2.1 one can expect up to 2 patch releases after every minor ones. Patch releases would only be published for latest minor release.\n\n## Patch Release Criteria\n\nPatch releases should be considered if a regression meets the following criteria:\n\n1. Does the regression break core functionality (stable / beta features) including functionality in first party domain libraries?\n    * First party domain libraries:\n        * [pytorch/vision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)\n        * [pytorch/audio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio)\n3. Is there not a viable workaround?\n    * Can the regression be solved simply or is it not overcomable?\n\n> *NOTE*: Patch releases should only be considered when functionality is broken, documentation does not typically fall within this category\n\n## Patch Release Process\n\n### Patch Release Process Description\n\n> Main POC: Patch Release Managers, Triage Reviewers\n\nPatch releases should follow these high-level phases. This process starts immediately after the previous release has completed.\nPatch release process takes around 4-5 weeks to complete.\n\n1. Triage, is a process where issues are identified, graded, compared to Patch Release Criteria and added to Patch Release milestone. This process normally takes 2 weeks after the release completion.\n2. Go/No Go meeting between PyTorch Releng, PyTorch Core and Project Managers where potential issues triggering a release in milestones are reviewed, and following decisions are made:\n  * Should the new patch Release be created ?\n  * Timeline execution for the patch release\n3. Cherry picking phase starts after the decision is made to create patch release. At this point a new release tracker for the patch release is created, and an announcement will be made on official channels [example announcement](https://dev-discuss.pytorch.org/t/pytorch-release-2-0-1-important-information/1176). The authors of the fixes to regressions will be asked to create their own cherry picks. This process normally takes 2 weeks.\n4. Building Binaries, Promotion to Stable and testing. After all cherry picks have been merged, Release Managers trigger new build and produce new release candidate. Announcement is made on the official channel about the RC availability at this point. This process normally takes 2 weeks.\n5. General Availability\n\n### Triage\n\n> Main POC: Triage Reviewers\n\n1. Tag issues / pull requests that are candidates for a potential patch release with `triage review`\n    * ![adding triage review label](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1700823/132589089-a9210a14-6159-409d-95e5-f79067f6fa38.png)\n2. Triage reviewers will then check if the regression / fix identified fits within above mentioned [Patch Release Criteria](#patch-release-criteria)\n3. Triage reviewers will then add the issue / pull request to the related milestone (i.e. `1.9.1`) if the regressions is found to be within the [Patch Release Criteria](#patch-release-criteria)\n    * ![adding to milestone](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1700823/131175980-148ff38d-44c3-4611-8a1f-cd2fd1f4c49d.png)\n\n### Issue Tracker for Patch releases\n\nFor patch releases issue tracker needs to be created. For patch release, we require all cherry-pick changes to have links to either a high-priority GitHub issue or a CI failure from previous RC. An example of this would look like:\n* https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/128436\n\nOnly following issues are accepted:\n1. Fixes to regressions against previous major version (e.g. regressions introduced in 1.13.0 from 1.12.0 are pickable for 1.13.1)\n2. Low risk critical fixes for: silent correctness, backwards compatibility, crashes, deadlocks, (large) memory leaks\n3. Fixes to new features being introduced in this release\n4. Documentation improvements\n5. Release branch specific changes (e.g. blocking ci fixes, change version identifiers)\n\n### Building a release schedule / cherry picking\n\n> Main POC: Patch Release Managers\n\n1. After regressions / fixes have been triaged Patch Release Managers will work together and build /announce a schedule for the patch release\n    * *NOTE*: Ideally this should be ~2-3 weeks after a regression has been identified to allow other regressions to be identified\n2. Patch Release Managers will work with the authors of the regressions / fixes to cherry pick their change into the related release branch (i.e. `release/1.9` for `1.9.1`)\n    * *NOTE*: Patch release managers should notify authors of the regressions to post a cherry picks for their changes. It is up to authors of the regressions to post a cherry pick. If cherry pick is not posted the issue will not be included in the release.\n3. If cherry picking deadline is missed by cherry pick author, patch release managers will not accept any requests after the fact.\n\n### Building Binaries / Promotion to Stable\n\n> Main POC: Patch Release managers\n\n1. Patch Release Managers will follow the process of [Drafting RCs (Release Candidates)](#drafting-rcs-release-candidates-for-pytorch-and-domain-libraries)\n2. Patch Release Managers will follow the process of [Promoting RCs to Stable](#promoting-rcs-to-stable)\n\n# Hardware / Software Support in Binary Build Matrix\n\nPyTorch has a support matrix across a couple of different axis. This section should be used as a decision making framework to drive hardware / software support decisions\n\n## Python\n\nPyTorch supports all minor versions of CPython that are not EOL: https://devguide.python.org/versions/\n\nFor each minor release independently, we only support patch releases as follows:\n- If the latest patch release is a bugfix release, we only support this one.\n- Otherwise, we support all the non-bugfix patch releases.\n\nSee https://github.com/pytorch/rfcs/blob/master/RFC-0038-cpython-support.md for details on the rules and process for upgrade and sunset of each version.\n\n## Accelerator Software\n\nFor accelerator software like CUDA and ROCm we will typically use the following criteria:\n* Support latest 2 minor versions\n\n### Special support cases\n\nIn some instances support for a particular version of software will continue if a need is found. For example, our CUDA 11 binaries do not currently meet\nthe size restrictions for publishing on PyPI so the default version that is published to PyPI is CUDA 10.2.\n\nThese special support cases will be handled on a case by case basis and support may be continued if current PyTorch maintainers feel as though there may still be a\nneed to support these particular versions of software.\n\n## Operating Systems\nSupported OS flavors are summarized in the table below:\n| Operating System family | Architecture | Notes |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Linux | aarch64, x86_64 | Wheels are manylinux2014 compatible, i.e. they should be runnable on any Linux system with glibc-2.17 or above. |\n| MacOS | arm64 | Builds should be compatible with MacOS 11 (Big Sur) or newer, but are actively tested against MacOS 14 (Sonoma). MPS support is enabled on MacOS 13 (Ventura) or later. |\n| Windows | x86_64 | Builds are compatible with Windows-10 or newer. |\n\n# Submitting Tutorials\n\nTutorials in support of a release feature must be submitted to the [pytorch/tutorials](https://github.com/pytorch/tutorials) repo at least two weeks before the release date to allow for editorial and technical review. There is no cherry-pick process for tutorials. All tutorials will be merged around the release day and published at [pytorch.org/tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).\n\n# Special Topics\n\n## Updating submodules for a release\n\nIn the event a submodule cannot be fast forwarded, and a patch must be applied we can take two different approaches:\n\n* (preferred) Fork the said repository under the pytorch GitHub organization, apply the patches we need there, and then switch our submodule to accept our fork.\n* Get the dependencies maintainers to support a release branch for us\n\nEditing submodule remotes can be easily done with: (running from the root of the git repository)\n```\ngit config --file=.gitmodules -e\n```\n\nAn example of this process can be found here:\n\n* https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/48312\n\n## Triton dependency for the release\n\nIn nightly builds for conda and wheels pytorch depend on Triton build by this workflow: https://hud.pytorch.org/hud/pytorch/pytorch/nightly/1?per_page=50&name_filter=Build%20Triton%20Wheel. The pinned version of triton used by this workflow is specified here:  https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.ci/docker/ci_commit_pins/triton.txt .\n\nIn Nightly builds we have following configuration:\n* Conda builds, depend on: https://anaconda.org/pytorch-nightly/torchtriton\n* Wheel builds, depend on : https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/pytorch-triton/\n* Rocm wheel builds, depend on : https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/pytorch-triton-rocm/\n\nHowever for release we have following :\n* Conda builds, depend on: https://anaconda.org/pytorch-test/torchtriton for test and https://anaconda.org/pytorch/torchtriton for release\n* Wheel builds, depend only triton pypi package: https://pypi.org/project/triton/ for both test and release\n* Rocm wheel builds, depend on : https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/pytorch-triton-rocm/ for test and https://download.pytorch.org/whl/pytorch-triton-rocm/ for release\n\nImportant: The release of https://pypi.org/project/triton/ needs to be requested from OpenAI once branch cut is completed. Please include the release PIN hash in the request: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/release/2.1/.ci/docker/ci_commit_pins/triton.txt .\n"

We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.\n\nPlease report security issues using https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/security/advisories/new\n\nPlease refer to the following page for our responsible disclosure policy, reward guidelines, and those things that should not be reported:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/whitehat\n\n\n## Using Pytorch Securely\n**Pytorch models are programs**, so treat its security seriously -- running untrusted models is equivalent to running untrusted code. In general we recommend that model weights and the python code for the model are distributed independently. That said, be careful about where you get the python code from and who wrote it (preferentially check for a provenance or checksums, do not run any pip installed package).\n\n### Untrusted models\nBe careful when running untrusted models. This classification includes models created by unknown developers or utilizing data obtained from unknown sources[^data-poisoning-sources].\n\n**Prefer to execute untrusted models within a secure, isolated environment such as a sandbox** (e.g., containers, virtual machines). This helps protect your system from potentially malicious code. You can find further details and instructions in [this page](https://developers.google.com/code-sandboxing).\n\n**Be mindful of risky model formats**. Give preference to share and load weights with the appropriate format for your use case. [safetensors](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/en/index) gives the most safety but is the most restricted in what it supports. [`torch.load`](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html#torch.load) with `weights_only=True` is also secure to our knowledge even though it offers significantly larger surface of attack. Loading un-trusted checkpoint with `weights_only=False` MUST never be done.\n\n\n\nImportant Note: The trustworthiness of a model is not binary. You must always determine the proper level of caution depending on the specific model and how it matches your use case and risk tolerance.\n\n[^data-poisoning-sources]: To understand risks of utilization of data from unknown sources, read the following Cornell papers on Data poisoning:\n    https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04748\n    https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05566\n\n### Untrusted inputs during training and prediction\n\nIf you plan to open your model to untrusted inputs, be aware that inputs can also be used as vectors by malicious agents. To minimize risks, make sure to give your model only the permissions strictly required, and keep your libraries updated with the latest security patches.\n\nIf applicable, prepare your model against bad inputs and prompt injections. Some recommendations:\n- Pre-analysis: check how the model performs by default when exposed to prompt injection (e.g. using fuzzing for prompt injection).\n- Input Sanitation: Before feeding data to the model, sanitize inputs rigorously. This involves techniques such as:\n    - Validation: Enforce strict rules on allowed characters and data types.\n    - Filtering: Remove potentially malicious scripts or code fragments.\n    - Encoding: Convert special characters into safe representations.\n    - Verification: Run tooling that identifies potential script injections (e.g. [models that detect prompt injection attempts](https://python.langchain.com/docs/guides/safety/hugging_face_prompt_injection)).\n\n### Data privacy\n\n**Take special security measures if your model if you train models with sensitive data**. Prioritize [sandboxing](https://developers.google.com/code-sandboxing) your models and:\n- Do not feed sensitive data to untrusted model (even if runs in a sandboxed environment)\n- If you consider publishing a model that was partially trained with sensitive data, be aware that data can potentially be recovered from the trained weights (especially if model overfits).\n\n### Using distributed features\n\nPyTorch can be used for distributed computing, and as such there is a `torch.distributed` package. PyTorch Distributed features are intended for internal communication only. They are not built for use in untrusted environments or networks.\n\nFor performance reasons, none of the PyTorch Distributed primitives (including c10d, RPC, and TCPStore) include any authorization protocol and will send messages unencrypted. They accept connections from anywhere, and execute the workload sent without performing any checks. Therefore, if you run a PyTorch Distributed program on your network, anybody with access to the network can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running PyTorch.\n\n## CI/CD security principles\n_Audience_: Contributors and reviewers, especially if modifying the workflow files/build system.\n\nPyTorch CI/CD security philosophy is based on finding a balance between open and transparent CI pipelines while keeping the environment efficient and safe.\n\nPyTorch testing requirements are complex, and a large part of the code base can only be tested on specialized powerful hardware, such as GPU, making it a lucrative target for resource misuse. To prevent this, we require workflow run approval for PRs from non-member contributors. To keep the volume of those approvals relatively low, we easily extend write permissions to the repository to regular contributors.\n\nMore widespread write access to the repo presents challenges when it comes to reviewing changes, merging code into trunk, and creating releases. [Protected branches](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-protected-branches/about-protected-branches) are used to restrict the ability to merge to the trunk/release branches only to the repository administrators and merge bot. The merge bot is responsible for mechanistically merging the change and validating reviews against the path-based rules defined in [merge_rules.yml](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/.github/merge_rules.yaml). Once a PR has been reviewed by person(s) mentioned in these rules, leaving a `@pytorchbot merge` comment on the PR will initiate the merge process. To protect merge bot credentials from leaking, merge actions must be executed only on ephemeral runners (see definition below) using a specialized deployment environment.\n\nTo speed up the CI system, build steps of the workflow rely on the distributed caching mechanism backed by [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache), making them susceptible to cache corruption compromises. For that reason binary artifacts generated during CI should not be executed in an environment that contains an access to any sensitive/non-public information and should not be published for use by general audience. One should not have any expectation about the lifetime of those artifacts, although in practice they likely remain accessible for about two weeks after the PR has been closed.\n\nTo speed up CI system setup, PyTorch relies heavily on Docker to pre-build and pre-install the dependencies. To prevent a potentially malicious PR from altering ones that were published in the past, ECR has been configured to use immutable tags.\n\nTo improve runner availability and more efficient resource utilization, some of the CI runners are non-ephemeral, i.e., workflow steps from completely unrelated PRs could be scheduled sequentially on the same runner, making them susceptible to reverse shell attacks. For that reason, PyTorch does not rely on the repository secrets mechanism, as these can easily be compromised in such attacks.\n\n### Release pipelines security\n\nTo ensure safe binary releases, PyTorch release pipelines are built on the following principles:\n - All binary builds/upload jobs must be run on ephemeral runners, i.e., on a machine that is allocated from the cloud to do the build and released back to the cloud after the build is finished. This protects those builds from interference from external actors, who potentially can get reverse shell access to a non-ephemeral runner and wait there for a binary build.\n - All binary builds are cold-start builds, i.e., distributed caching/incremental builds are not permitted. This renders builds much slower than incremental CI builds but isolates them from potential compromises of the intermediate artifacts caching systems.\n - All upload jobs are executed in a [deployment environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment) that are restricted to protected branches\n - Security credentials needed to upload binaries to PyPI/conda or stable indexes `download.pytorch.org/whl` are never uploaded to repo secrets storage/environment. This requires an extra manual step to publish the release but ensures that access to those would not be compromised by deliberate/accidental leaks of secrets stored in the cloud.\n - No binary artifacts should be published to GitHub releases pages, as these are overwritable by anyone with write permission to the repo.\n"

Install [build prerequisites](#build-prerequisites) on your system\n2. `git clone https://github.com/neovim/neovim`\n3. `cd neovim && make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`\n    - If you want the **stable release**, also run `git checkout stable`.\n    - If you want to install to a custom location, set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`. See also [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md#install-from-source).\n    - On BSD, use `gmake` instead of `make`.\n    - To build on Windows, see the [Building on Windows](#building-on-windows) section. _MSVC (Visual Studio) is recommended._\n4. `sudo make install`\n    - Default install location is `/usr/local`\n    - On Debian/Ubuntu, instead of `sudo make install`, you can try `cd build && cpack -G DEB && sudo dpkg -i nvim-linux64.deb` to build DEB-package and install it. This helps ensure clean removal of installed files. Note: This is an unsupported, \"best-effort\" feature of the Nvim build.\n\n**Notes**:\n- From the repository's root directory, running `make` will download and build all the needed dependencies and put the `nvim` executable in `build/bin`.\n- Third-party dependencies (libuv, LuaJIT, etc.) are downloaded automatically to `.deps/`. See the [FAQ](https://neovim.io/doc/user/faq.html#faq-build) if you have issues.\n- After building, you can run the `nvim` executable without installing it by running `VIMRUNTIME=runtime ./build/bin/nvim`.\n- If you plan to develop Neovim, install [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) for faster builds. It will automatically be used.\n- Install [ccache](https://ccache.dev/) for faster rebuilds of Neovim. It's used by default. To disable it, use `CCACHE_DISABLE=true make`.\n\n## Running tests\n\nSee [test/README.md](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/test/README.md).\n\n## Building\n\nFirst make sure you installed the [build prerequisites](#build-prerequisites). Now that you have the dependencies, you can try other build targets explained below.\n\nThe _build type_ determines the level of used compiler optimizations and debug information:\n\n- `Release`: Full compiler optimizations and no debug information. Expect the best performance from this build type. Often used by package maintainers.\n- `Debug`: Full debug information; few optimizations. Use this for development to get meaningful output from debuggers like GDB or LLDB. This is the default if `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` is not specified.\n- `RelWithDebInfo` (\"Release With Debug Info\"): Enables many optimizations and adds enough debug info so that when Neovim ever crashes, you can still get a backtrace.\n\nSo, for a release build, just use:\n\n```\nmake CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n```\n(Do not add a `-j` flag if `ninja` is installed! The build will be in parallel automatically.)\n\nAfterwards, the `nvim` executable can be found in `build/bin`. To verify the build type after compilation, run:\n\n```sh\n./build/bin/nvim --version | grep ^Build\n```\n\nTo install the executable to a certain location, use:\n\n```\nmake CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/local/nvim install\n```\n\nCMake, our main build system, caches a lot of things in `build/CMakeCache.txt`. If you ever want to change `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` or `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`, run `rm -rf build` first. This is also required when rebuilding after a Git commit adds or removes files (including from `runtime`) — when in doubt, run `make distclean` (which is basically a shortcut for `rm -rf build .deps`).\n\nBy default (`USE_BUNDLED=1`), Neovim downloads and statically links its needed dependencies. In order to be able to use a debugger on these libraries, you might want to compile them with debug information as well:\n\n<!-- THIS CAUSES SCREEN INTERFERENCE\n```\nmake distclean\nVERBOSE=1 DEBUG=1 make deps\n```\n-->\n```\nmake distclean\nmake deps\n```\n\n## Building on Windows\n\n### Windows / MSVC\n\n**MSVC (Visual Studio) is the recommended way to build on Windows.** These steps were confirmed as of 2023.\n\n1. Install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community) (2017 or later) with the _Desktop development with C++_ workload.\n    - On 32-bit Windows, you will need [this workaround](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/content/problem/212989/ninja-binary-format.html).\n2. Open the Neovim project folder.\n    - Visual Studio should detect the cmake files and automatically start building...\n3. Choose the `nvim.exe (bin\\nvim.exe)` target and hit F5.\n    - If the build fails, it may be because Visual Studio started the build with `x64-{Debug,Release}` before you switched the configuration to `x86-Release`.\n      - Right-click _CMakeLists.txt → Delete Cache_.\n      - Right-click _CMakeLists.txt → Generate Cache_.\n    - If you see an \"access violation\" from `ntdll`, you can ignore it and continue.\n4. If you see an error like `uv.dll not found`, try the `nvim.exe (Install)` target. Then switch back to `nvim.exe (bin\\nvim.exe)`.\n\n### Windows / MSVC PowerShell\n\nTo build from the command line (i.e. invoke the `cmake` commands yourself),\n\n1. Ensure you have the Visual Studio environment variables, using any of the following:\n    - Using the [Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt or Visual Studio Developer PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022)\n    - Invoking `Import-VisualStudioVars` in PowerShell from [this PowerShell module](https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx)\n    - Invoking `VsDevCmd.bat` in Command Prompt\n      ```\n      VsDevCmd.bat -arch=x64\n      ```\n   This is to make sure that `luarocks` finds the Visual Studio installation, and doesn't fall back to MinGW with errors like:\n   ```\n   'mingw32-gcc' is not recognized as an internal or external command\n   ```\n2. From the \"Developer PowerShell\" or \"Developer Command Prompt\":\n   ```\n   cmake -S cmake.deps -B .deps -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n   cmake --build .deps --config Release\n   cmake -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n   cmake --build build --config Release\n   ```\n    - Omit `--config Release` if you want a debug build.\n    - Omit `-G Ninja` to use the \"Visual Studio\" generator.\n\n### Windows / CLion\n\n1. Install [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/).\n2. Open the Neovim project in CLion.\n3. Select _Build → Build All in 'Release'_.\n\n### Windows / Cygwin\n\nInstall all dependencies the normal way, then build Neovim the normal way for a random CMake application (i.e. do not use the `Makefile` that automatically downloads and builds \"bundled\" dependencies).\n\nThe `cygport` repo contains Cygport files (e.g. `APKBUILD`, `PKGBUILD`) for all the dependencies not available in the Cygwin distribution, and describes any special commands or arguments needed to build. The Cygport definitions also try to describe the required dependencies for each one. Unless custom commands are provided, Cygport just calls `autogen`/`cmake`, `make`, `make install`, etc. in a clean and consistent way.\n\nhttps://github.com/cascent/neovim-cygwin was built on Cygwin 2.9.0. Newer `libuv` should require slightly less patching. Some SSP stuff changed in Cygwin 2.10.0, so that might change things too when building Neovim.\n\n\n### Windows / MSYS2 / MinGW\n\n1. From the MSYS2 shell, install these packages:\n   ```\n   pacman -S \\\n       mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-{gcc,cmake,make,ninja,diffutils}\n   ```\n2. From the Windows Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`), set up the `PATH` and build.\n\n   ```cmd\n   set PATH=c:\\msys64\\ucrt64\\bin;c:\\msys64\\usr\\bin;%PATH%\n   ```\n3. You have two options:\n    - Build using `cmake` and `Ninja` generator:\n      ```cmd\n      cmake -S cmake.deps -B .deps -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n      cmake --build .deps\n      cmake -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n      cmake --build build\n      ```\n      If you cannot install neovim with `ninja install` due to permission restriction, you can install neovim in a directory you have write access to.\n      ```cmd\n      cmake -S cmake.deps -B .deps -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n      cmake --build .deps\n      cmake -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\\nvim -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n      cmake --build build\n      ```\n    - Or, alternatively, you can use `mingw32-make`:\n      ```cmd\n      mingw32-make deps\n      mingw32-make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n      :: Or you can do the previous command specifying a custom prefix\n      :: (Default is C:\\Program Files (x86)\\nvim)\n      :: mingw32-make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\\nvim\n      mingw32-make install\n      ```\n\n## Localization\n\n### Localization build\n\nA normal build will create `.mo` files in `build/src/nvim/po`.\n\n* If you see `msgfmt: command not found`, you need to install [`gettext`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext). On most systems, the package is just called `gettext`.\n\n### Localization check\n\nTo check the translations for `$LANG`, run `make -C build check-po-$LANG`. Examples:\n\n```\ncmake --build build --target check-po-de\ncmake --build build --target check-po-pt_BR\n```\n\n- `check-po-$LANG` generates a detailed report in `./build/src/nvim/po/check-${LANG}.log`. (The report is generated by `nvim`, not by `msgfmt`.)\n\n### Localization update\n\nTo update the `src/nvim/po/$LANG.po` file with the latest strings, run the following:\n\n```\ncmake --build build --target update-po-$LANG\n```\n\n- **Note**: Run `src/nvim/po/cleanup.vim` after updating.\n\n## Compiler options\n\nTo see the chain of includes, use the `-H` option ([#918](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/918)):\n\n```sh\necho '#include \"./src/nvim/buffer.h\"' | \\\n> clang -I.deps/usr/include -Isrc -std=c99 -P -E -H - 2>&1 >/dev/null | \\\n> grep -v /usr/\n```\n\n- `grep -v /usr/` is used to filter out system header files.\n- `-save-temps` can be added as well to see expanded macros or commented assembly.\n\n## Custom Makefile\n\nYou can customize the build process locally by creating a `local.mk`, which is referenced at the top of the main `Makefile`. It's listed in `.gitignore`, so it can be used across branches. **A new target in `local.mk` overrides the default make-target.**\n\nHere's a sample `local.mk` which adds a target to force a rebuild but *does not* override the default-target:\n\n```make\nall:\n\nrebuild:\n\trm -rf build\n\tmake\n```\n\n## Third-party dependencies\n\nReference the [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/sid/source/neovim) (or alternatively, the [Homebrew formula](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/neovim.rb)) for the precise list of dependencies/versions.\n\nTo build the bundled dependencies using CMake:\n\n```sh\ncmake -S cmake.deps -B .deps -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\ncmake --build .deps\n```\n\nBy default the libraries and headers are placed in `.deps/usr`. Now you can build Neovim:\n\n```sh\ncmake -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\ncmake --build build\n```\n\n### How to build without \"bundled\" dependencies\n\n1. Manually install the dependencies:\n    - libuv libluv libutf8proc luajit lua-lpeg tree-sitter tree-sitter-c tree-sitter-lua tree-sitter-markdown tree-sitter-query tree-sitter-vim tree-sitter-vimdoc unibilium\n2. Run CMake:\n   ```sh\n   cmake -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n   cmake --build build\n   ```\n   If all the dependencies are not available in the package, you can use only some of the bundled dependencies as follows (example of using `ninja`):\n   ```sh\n   cmake -S cmake.deps -B .deps -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DUSE_BUNDLED=OFF -DUSE_BUNDLED_TS=ON\n   cmake --build .deps\n   cmake -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\n   cmake --build build\n   ```\n3. Run `make`, `ninja`, or whatever build tool you told CMake to generate.\n    - Using `ninja` is strongly recommended.\n4. If treesitter parsers are not bundled, they need to be available in a `parser/` runtime directory (e.g. `/usr/share/nvim/runtime/parser/`).\n\n#### Debian 10 (Buster) example:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt install luajit libluajit-5.1-dev lua-lpeg libunibilium-dev\ncmake -S cmake.deps -B .deps -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DUSE_BUNDLED=OFF -DUSE_BUNDLED_LIBUV=ON -DUSE_BUNDLED_LUV=ON -DUSE_BUNDLED_TS=ON -DUSE_BUNDLED_UTF8PROC=ON\ncmake --build .deps\ncmake -B build -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo\ncmake --build build\n```\n\n#### Example of using a Makefile\n\n- Example of using a package with all dependencies:\n  ```\n  make USE_BUNDLED=OFF\n  ```\n- Example of using a package with some dependencies:\n  ```\n  make BUNDLED_CMAKE_FLAG=\"-DUSE_BUNDLED=OFF -DUSE_BUNDLED_LUV=ON -DUSE_BUNDLED_TS=ON -DUSE_BUNDLED_LIBUV=ON\"\n  ```\n\n## Build prerequisites\n\nGeneral requirements (see [#1469](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/1469#issuecomment-63058312)):\n\n- Clang or GCC version 4.9+\n- CMake version 3.16+, built with TLS/SSL support\n  - Optional: Get the latest CMake from https://cmake.org/download/\n    - Provides a shell script which works on most Linux systems. After running it, ensure the resulting `cmake` binary is in your $PATH so the the Nvim build will find it.\n\nPlatform-specific requirements are listed below.\n\n### Ubuntu / Debian\n\n```sh\nsudo apt-get install ninja-build gettext cmake unzip curl build-essential\n```\n\n### RHEL / Fedora\n\n```\nsudo dnf -y install ninja-build cmake gcc make unzip gettext curl glibc-gconv-extra\n```\n\n### openSUSE\n\n```\nsudo zypper install ninja cmake gcc-c++ gettext-tools curl\n```\n\n### Arch Linux\n\n```\nsudo pacman -S base-devel cmake unzip ninja curl\n```\n\n### Alpine Linux\n\n```\napk add build-base cmake coreutils curl unzip gettext-tiny-dev\n```\n\n### Void Linux\n\n```\nxbps-install base-devel cmake curl git\n```\n\n### NixOS / Nix\n\nStarting from NixOS 18.03, the Neovim binary resides in the `neovim-unwrapped` Nix package (the `neovim` package being just a wrapper to setup runtime options like Ruby/Python support):\n\n```sh\ncd path/to/neovim/src\n```\n\nDrop into `nix-shell` to pull in the Neovim dependencies:\n\n```\nnix-shell '<nixpkgs>' -A neovim-unwrapped\n```\n\nConfigure and build:\n\n```sh\nrm -rf build && cmakeConfigurePhase\nbuildPhase\n```\n\nTests are not available by default, because of some unfixed failures. You can enable them via adding this package in your overlay:\n```\n  neovim-dev = (super.pkgs.neovim-unwrapped.override  {\n    doCheck=true;\n  }).overrideAttrs(oa:{\n    cmakeBuildType=\"debug\";\n\n    nativeBuildInputs = oa.nativeBuildInputs ++ [ self.pkgs.valgrind ];\n    shellHook = ''\n      export NVIM_PYTHON_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG\n      export NVIM_LOG_FILE=/tmp/log\n      export VALGRIND_LOG=\"$PWD/valgrind.log\"\n    '';\n  });\n```\nand replacing `neovim-unwrapped` with `neovim-dev`:\n```\nnix-shell '<nixpkgs>' -A neovim-dev\n```\n\nA flake for Neovim is hosted at [nix-community/neovim-nightly-overlay](https://github.com/nix-community/neovim-nightly-overlay/), with 3 packages:\n- `neovim` to run the nightly\n- `neovim-debug` to run the package with debug symbols\n- `neovim-developer` to get all the tools to develop on `neovim`\n\nThus you can run Neovim nightly with `nix run github:nix-community/neovim-nightly-overlay`.\nSimilarly to develop on Neovim: `nix run github:nix-community/neovim-nightly-overlay#neovim-developer`.\n\nTo use a specific version of Neovim, you can pass `--override-input neovim-src .` to use your current directory,\nor a specific SHA1 like `--override-input neovim-src github:neovim/neovim/89dc8f8f4e754e70cbe1624f030fb61bded41bc2`.\n\n### FreeBSD\n\n```\nsudo pkg install cmake gmake sha unzip wget gettext curl\n```\n\nIf you get an error regarding a `sha256sum` mismatch, where the actual SHA-256 hash is `e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`, then this is your issue (that's the `sha256sum` of an empty file).\n\n### OpenBSD\n\n```sh\ndoas pkg_add gmake cmake unzip curl gettext-tools\n```\n\nBuild can sometimes fail when using the top level `Makefile`, apparently due to some third-party component (see [#2445-comment](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/2445#issuecomment-108124236)). The following instructions use CMake:\n\n```sh\nmkdir .deps\ncd .deps\ncmake ../cmake.deps/\ngmake\ncd ..\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\ngmake\n```\n\n### macOS\n\n#### macOS / Homebrew\n\n1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`\n2. Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh)\n3. Install Neovim build dependencies:\n    ```\n    brew install ninja cmake gettext curl\n    ```\n  - **Note**: If you see Wget certificate errors (for older macOS versions less than 10.10):\n    ```sh\n    brew install curl-ca-bundle\n    echo CA_CERTIFICATE=$(brew --prefix curl-ca-bundle)/share/ca-bundle.crt >> ~/.wgetrc\n    ```\n  - **Note**: If you see `'stdio.h' file not found`, try the following:\n    ```\n    open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg\n    ```\n\n#### macOS / MacPorts\n\n1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools: `xcode-select --install`\n2. Install [MacPorts](http://www.macports.org)\n3. Install Neovim build dependencies:\n    ```\n    sudo port install ninja cmake gettext\n    ```\n  - **Note**: If you see Wget certificate errors (for older macOS versions less than 10.10):\n    ```sh\n    sudo port install curl-ca-bundle\n    echo CA_CERTIFICATE=/opt/local/share/curl/curl-ca-bundle.crt >> ~/.wgetrc\n    ```\n  - **Note**: If you see `'stdio.h' file not found`, try the following:\n    ```\n    open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg\n    ```\n\n#### Building for older macOS versions\n\nFrom a newer macOS version, to build for older macOS versions, you will have to set the macOS deployment target:\n\n```\nmake CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13 DEPS_CMAKE_FLAGS=\"-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=$(xcrun -find c++)\"\n```\n\nNote that the C++ compiler is explicitly set so that it can be found when the deployment target is set.\n\n"

This is _extremely_ helpful.\n- When reporting a crash, [include a stacktrace](https://neovim.io/doc/user/dev_tools.html#dev-tools-backtrace).\n- Use [ASAN/UBSAN](#sanitizers-asan-and-ubsan) to get detailed errors for segfaults and undefined behavior.\n- Check the logs. `:edit $NVIM_LOG_FILE`\n- Include `cmake --system-information` for build-related issues.\n\nDeveloper guidelines\n--------------------\n\n- Read [:help dev](https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#dev) and [:help dev-doc][dev-doc-guide] if you are working on Nvim core.\n- Read [:help dev-ui](https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#dev-ui) if you are developing a UI.\n- Read [:help dev-api-client](https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#dev-api-client) if you are developing an API client.\n- Install `ninja` for faster builds of Nvim.\n  ```bash\n  sudo apt-get install ninja-build\n  make distclean\n  make  # Nvim build system uses ninja automatically, if available.\n  ```\n- Install `ccache` or `sccache` for faster rebuilds of Nvim. Nvim will use one\n  of these automatically if it's found. To disable caching use:\n  ```bash\n  cmake -B build -D CACHE_PRG=OFF\n  ```\n\nPull requests (PRs)\n---------------------\n\n- To avoid duplicate work, create a draft pull request.\n- Your PR must include [test coverage][run-tests].\n- Avoid cosmetic changes to unrelated files in the same commit.\n- Use a [feature branch][git-feature-branch] instead of the master branch.\n- Use a _rebase workflow_ for all PRs.\n  - After addressing review comments, it's fine to force-push.\n\n### Merging to master\n\nFor maintainers: when a PR is ready to merge to master,\n\n- prefer _Squash Merge_ for \"single-commit PRs\" (when the PR has only one meaningful commit).\n- prefer _Merge_ for \"multi-commit PRs\" (when the PR has multiple meaningful commits).\n\n### Stages: Draft and Ready for review\n\nPull requests have two stages: Draft and Ready for review.\n\n1. [Create a Draft PR][pr-draft] while you are _not_ requesting feedback as\n  you are still working on the PR.\n    - You can skip this if your PR is ready for review.\n2. [Change your PR to ready][pr-ready] when the PR is ready for review.\n    - You can convert back to Draft at any time.\n\nDo __not__ add labels like `[RFC]` or `[WIP]` in the title to indicate the\nstate of your PR: this just adds noise. Non-Draft PRs are assumed to be open\nfor comments; if you want feedback from specific people, `@`-mention them in\na comment.\n\n### Commit messages\n\nFollow the [conventional commits guidelines][conventional_commits] to *make reviews easier* and to make\nthe VCS/git logs more valuable (try `make lintcommit`). The structure of a commit message is:\n\n    type(scope): subject\n\n    Problem:\n    ...\n\n    Solution:\n    ...\n\n- Commit message **subject** (you can **ignore this for \"fixup\" commits** or any commits you expect to be squashed):\n    - Prefix with a [_type_](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json):\n        - `build ci docs feat fix perf refactor revert test vim-patch`\n    - Append an optional `(scope)` such as `(lsp)`, `(treesitter)`, `(float)`, …\n    - Use the _imperative voice_: \"Fix bug\" rather than \"Fixed bug\" or \"Fixes bug.\"\n    - Keep it short (under 72 characters).\n- Commit message **body** (detail):\n    - Concisely describe the Problem/Solution in the commit **body**. [Describing the problem](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/pubs/state-the-problem.pdf)\n      _independently of the solution_ often leads to a better understanding for you, reviewers, and future readers.\n      ```\n      Problem:\n\n      Solution:\n      ```\n- Indicate breaking API changes with \"!\" after the type, and a \"BREAKING CHANGE\" footer. Example:\n  ```\n  refactor(provider)!: drop support for Python 2\n\n  BREAKING CHANGE: refactor to use Python 3 features since Python 2 is no longer supported.\n  ```\n\n### Automated builds (CI)\n\nEach pull request must pass the automated builds on [Cirrus CI] and [GitHub Actions].\n\n- CI builds are compiled with [`-Werror`][gcc-warnings], so compiler warnings\n  will fail the build.\n- If any tests fail, the build will fail. See [test/README.md#running-tests][run-tests] to run tests locally.\n- CI runs [ASan] and other analyzers.\n    - To run valgrind locally: `VALGRIND=1 make test`\n    - To run ASan/UBSan locally: `CC=clang make CMAKE_FLAGS=\"-DENABLE_ASAN_UBSAN=ON\"`.\n      Note that MSVC requires Release or RelWithDebInfo build type to work properly.\n- The [lint](#lint) build checks that the code is formatted correctly and\n  passes various linter checks.\n- CI for FreeBSD runs on [Cirrus CI].\n- To see CI results faster in your PR, you can temporarily set `TEST_FILE` in\n  [test.yml](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/e35b9020b16985eee26e942f9a3f6b045bc3809b/.github/workflows/test.yml#L29).\n\n### Coverity\n\nCoverity runs against the master build. To view the defects you must\n[request access](https://scan.coverity.com/projects/neovim-neovim) (Coverity\ndoes not have a \"public\" view), then you will be approved as soon as\na maintainer sees the email.\n\n- Use this format for commit messages (where `{id}` is the CID (Coverity ID);\n  ([example](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/804))):\n  ```\n  fix(coverity/{id}): {description}\n  ```\n- Search the Neovim commit history to find examples:\n  ```bash\n  git log --oneline --no-merges --grep coverity\n  ```\n\n### Sanitizers (ASAN and UBSAN)\n\n  ASAN/UBSAN can be used to detect memory errors and other common forms of undefined behavior at runtime in debug builds.\n\n- To build Neovim with sanitizers enabled, use\n  ```\n  rm -rf build && CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS=\"-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DENABLE_ASAN_UBSAN=1\" make\n  ```\n- When running Neovim, use\n  ```\n  ASAN_OPTIONS=log_path=/tmp/nvim_asan nvim args...\n  ```\n- If Neovim exits unexpectedly, check `/tmp/nvim_asan.{PID}` (or your preferred `log_path`) for log files with error messages.\n\n\nCoding\n------\n\n### Lint\n\nYou can run the linter locally by:\n\n```bash\nmake lint\n```\n\n### Style\n\n- You can format files by using:\n  ```bash\n  make format  # or formatc, formatlua\n  ```\n  This will format changed Lua and C files with all appropriate flags set.\n- Style rules are (mostly) defined by `src/uncrustify.cfg` which tries to match\n  the [style-guide]. To use the Nvim `gq` command with `uncrustify`:\n  ```vim\n  if !empty(findfile('src/uncrustify.cfg', ';'))\n    setlocal formatprg=uncrustify\\ -q\\ -l\\ C\\ -c\\ src/uncrustify.cfg\\ --no-backup\n  endif\n  ```\n- There is also `.clang-format` which has drifted from the [style-guide], but\n  is available for reference. To use the Nvim `gq` command with `clang-format`:\n  ```vim\n  if !empty(findfile('.clang-format', ';'))\n    setlocal formatprg=clang-format\\ -style=file\n  endif\n  ```\n\n### Navigate\n\n- Set `blame.ignoreRevsFile` to ignore [noisy commits](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/commit/2d240024acbd68c2d3f82bc72cb12b1a4928c6bf) in git blame:\n  ```bash\n  git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs\n  ```\n\n- Recommendation is to use **[clangd]**.\n  Can use the maintained config in [nvim-lspconfig/clangd].\n- Explore the source code [on the web](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/neovim/neovim).\n\n### Includes\n\nFor managing includes in C files, use [include-what-you-use].\n\n- [Install include-what-you-use][include-what-you-use-install]\n- To see which includes needs fixing use the cmake preset `iwyu`:\n  ```bash\n  cmake --preset iwyu\n  cmake --build build\n  ```\n- There's also a make target that automatically fixes the suggestions from\n  IWYU:\n  ```bash\n  make iwyu\n  ```\n\nSee [#549][549] for more details.\n\n### Lua runtime files\n\nMost of the Lua core [`runtime/`](./runtime) modules are precompiled to\nbytecode, so changes to those files won't get used unless you rebuild Nvim or\nby passing `--luamod-dev` and `$VIMRUNTIME`. For example, try adding a function\nto `runtime/lua/vim/_editor.lua` then:\n\n```bash\nVIMRUNTIME=./runtime ./build/bin/nvim --luamod-dev\n```\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nRead [:help dev-doc][dev-doc-guide] to understand the expected documentation style and conventions.\n\n### Generating :help\n\nMany `:help` docs are autogenerated from (C or Lua) docstrings. To generate the documentation run:\n\n```bash\nmake doc\n```\n\nTo validate the documentation files, run:\n\n```bash\nmake lintdoc\n```\n\nIf you need to modify or debug the documentation flow, these are the main files:\n- `./scripts/gen_vimdoc.lua`:\n  Main doc generator. Parses C and Lua files to render vimdoc files.\n- `./scripts/luacats_parser.lua`:\n  Documentation parser for Lua files.\n- `./scripts/cdoc_parser.lua`:\n  Documentation parser for C files.\n- `./scripts/luacats_grammar.lua`:\n  Lpeg grammar for LuaCATS\n- `./scripts/cdoc_grammar.lua`:\n  Lpeg grammar for C doc comments\n- `./scripts/gen_eval_files.lua`:\n  Generates documentation and Lua type files from metadata files:\n  ```\n  runtime/lua/vim/*     =>  runtime/doc/lua.txt\n  runtime/lua/vim/*     =>  runtime/doc/lua.txt\n  runtime/lua/vim/lsp/  =>  runtime/doc/lsp.txt\n  src/nvim/api/*        =>  runtime/doc/api.txt\n  src/nvim/eval.lua     =>  runtime/doc/builtin.txt\n  src/nvim/options.lua  =>  runtime/doc/options.txt\n  ```\n\n- `./scripts/lintdoc.lua`: Validation and linting of documentation files.\n\n### Lua docstrings\n\nUse [LuaLS] annotations in Lua docstrings to annotate parameter types, return\ntypes, etc. See [:help dev-lua-doc][dev-lua-doc].\n\n- The template for function documentation is:\n  ```lua\n  --- {Brief}\n  ---\n  --- {Long explanation}\n  ---\n  --- @param arg1 type {description}\n  --- @param arg2 type {description}\n  --- ...\n  ---\n  --- @return type {description}\n  ```\n- If possible, add type information (`table`, `string`, `number`, ...). Multiple valid types are separated by a bar (`string|table`). Indicate optional parameters via `type|nil`.\n- If a function in your Lua module should _not_ be documented, add `@nodoc`.\n- If the function is internal or otherwise non-public add `@private`.\n      - Private functions usually should be underscore-prefixed (named \"_foo\", not \"foo\").\n- Mark deprecated functions with `@deprecated`.\n\nThird-party dependencies\n------------------------\n\nTo build Nvim using a different commit of a dependency change the appropriate\nURL in `cmake.deps/deps.txt`. For example, to use a different version of luajit\nreplace the value in `LUAJIT_URL` with the wanted commit hash:\n\n```bash\nLUAJIT_URL https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/archive/<sha>.tar.gz\n```\n\nSet `DEPS_IGNORE_SHA` to `TRUE` in `cmake.deps/CMakeLists.txt` to skip hash\ncheck from cmake.\n\nAlternatively, you may point the URL as a local path where the repository is.\nThis is convenient when bisecting a problem in a dependency with `git bisect`.\nThis may require running `make distclean` between each build. Hash checking is\nalways skipped in this case regardless of `DEPS_IGNORE_SHA`.\n\n```bash\nLUAJIT_URL /home/user/luajit\n```\n\nReviewing\n---------\n\nReviewing can be done on GitHub, but you may find it easier to do locally.\nUsing [GitHub CLI][gh], you can create a new branch with the contents of a pull\nrequest, e.g. [#1820][1820]:\n\n```bash\ngh pr checkout https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1820\n```\n\nUse [`git log -p master..FETCH_HEAD`][git-history-filtering] to list all\ncommits in the feature branch which aren't in the `master` branch; `-p`\nshows each commit's diff. To show the whole surrounding function of a change\nas context, use the `-W` argument as well.\n\n[549]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/549\n[1820]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/pull/1820\n[3174]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/3174\n[ASan]: http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html\n[Cirrus CI]: https://cirrus-ci.com/github/neovim/neovim\n[Clang report]: https://neovim.io/doc/reports/clang/\n[GitHub Actions]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/actions\n[Vim]: https://github.com/vim/vim\n[clangd]: https://clangd.llvm.org\n[Merge a Vim patch]: https://neovim.io/doc/user/dev_vimpatch.html\n[complexity:low]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Acomplexity%3Alow\n[conventional_commits]: https://www.conventionalcommits.org\n[dev-doc-guide]: https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#dev-doc\n[dev-lua-doc]: https://neovim.io/doc/user/develop.html#dev-lua-doc\n[LuaLS]: https://luals.github.io/wiki/annotations/\n[gcc-warnings]: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.html\n[gh]: https://cli.github.com/\n[git-bisect]: http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Debugging-with-Git\n[git-feature-branch]: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows\n[git-history-filtering]: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-log/filtering-the-commit-history\n[github-issues]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues\n[include-what-you-use-install]: https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use#how-to-install\n[include-what-you-use]: https://github.com/include-what-you-use/include-what-you-use#using-with-cmake\n[lua-language-server]: https://github.com/sumneko/lua-language-server/\n[nvim-lspconfig/clangd]: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/master/doc/server_configurations.md#clangd\n[pr-draft]: https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request\n[pr-ready]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request\n[run-tests]: https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/test/README.md#running-tests\n[style-guide]: https://neovim.io/doc/user/dev_style.html#dev-style\n[wiki-faq]: https://neovim.io/doc/user/faq.html\n"

(You can also [build Neovim from source](#install-from-source).)\n\n## Windows\n\nWindows 8+ is required. Windows 7 or older is not supported.\n\n### [Winget](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/)\n\n- **Release:** `winget install Neovim.Neovim`\n\n### [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org)\n\n- **Latest Release:** `choco install neovim` (use -y for automatically skipping confirmation messages)\n- **Development (pre-release):** `choco install neovim --pre`\n\n### [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)\n```\nscoop bucket add main\nscoop install neovim\n```\n- **Release:** `scoop install neovim`\n\nSeveral Neovim GUIs are available from scoop (extras): [scoop.sh/#/apps?q=neovim](https://scoop.sh/#/apps?q=neovim)\n\n### Pre-built archives\n\n0. If you are missing `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, install the [Visual Studio 2015 C++ redistributable](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2977003) (choose x86_64 or x86 depending on your system).\n1. Choose a package (**nvim-winXX.zip**) from the [releases page](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases).\n2. Unzip the package. Any location is fine, administrator privileges are _not_ required.\n    - `$VIMRUNTIME` will be set to that location automatically.\n3. Run `nvim.exe` from a terminal.\n\n**Optional** steps:\n\n- Add the `bin` folder (e.g. `C:\\Program Files\\nvim\\bin`) to your PATH.\n    - This makes it easy to run `nvim` from anywhere.\n- If `:set spell` does not work, create the `C:/Users/foo/AppData/Local/nvim/site/spell` folder.\n  You can then copy your spell files over (for English, located\n  [here](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/spell/en.utf-8.spl) and\n  [here](https://github.com/vim/vim/blob/master/runtime/spell/en.utf-8.sug));\n- For Python plugins you need the `pynvim` module. \"Virtual envs\" are recommended. After activating the virtual env do `pip install pynvim` (in *both*). Edit your `init.vim` so that it contains the path to the env's Python executable:\n    ```vim\n    let g:python3_host_prog='C:/Users/foo/Envs/neovim3/Scripts/python.exe'\n    ```\n    - Run `:checkhealth` and read `:help provider-python`.\n- **init.vim (\"vimrc\"):** If you already have Vim installed you can copy `%userprofile%\\_vimrc` to `%userprofile%\\AppData\\Local\\nvim\\init.vim` to use your Vim config with Neovim.\n\n\n## macOS / OS X\n\n### Pre-built archives\n\nThe [Releases](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) page provides pre-built binaries for macOS 10.15+.\n\nFor x86_64:\n\n    curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/nightly/nvim-macos-x86_64.tar.gz\n    tar xzf nvim-macos-x86_64.tar.gz\n    ./nvim-macos-x86_64/bin/nvim\n\nFor arm64:\n\n    curl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/download/nightly/nvim-macos-arm64.tar.gz\n    tar xzf nvim-macos-arm64.tar.gz\n    ./nvim-macos-arm64/bin/nvim\n\n### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS or Linux\n\n    brew install neovim\n\n### [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/)\n\n    sudo port selfupdate\n    sudo port install neovim\n\n## Linux\n\n### Pre-built archives\n\nThe [Releases](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) page provides pre-built binaries for Linux systems.\n\n```sh\ncurl -LO https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/latest/download/nvim-linux64.tar.gz\nsudo rm -rf /opt/nvim\nsudo tar -C /opt -xzf nvim-linux64.tar.gz\n```\n\nThen add this to your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, ...):\n\n    export PATH=\"$PATH:/opt/nvim-linux64/bin\"\n\n### AppImage (\"universal\" Linux package)\n\nThe [Releases](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases) page provides an [AppImage](https://appimage.org) that runs on most Linux systems. No installation is needed, just download `nvim.appimage` and run it.

This allows you to install it with `apt-get`. Follow the links to the PPAs to see which versions of Ubuntu are currently available via the PPA. Choose **stable** or **unstable**:\n\n- [https://launchpad.net/~neovim-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/**stable**](https://launchpad.net/~neovim-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/stable)\n- [https://launchpad.net/~neovim-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/**unstable**](https://launchpad.net/~neovim-ppa/+archive/ubuntu/unstable)\n\n**Important:** The Neovim team does not maintain the PPA packages. For problems or questions about the PPA specifically contact https://launchpad.net/~neovim-ppa.\n\nTo be able to use **add-apt-repository** you may need to install software-properties-common:\n\n    sudo apt-get install software-properties-common\n\nIf you're using an older version Ubuntu you must use:\n\n    sudo apt-get install python-software-properties\n\nRun the following commands:\n\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:neovim-ppa/stable\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install neovim\n\nPrerequisites for the Python modules:\n\n    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python3-dev python3-pip\n\nIf you're using an older version Ubuntu you must use:\n\n    sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python3-dev\n    sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools\n    sudo easy_install3 pip\n\n### Void-Linux\n\nNeovim can be installed using the xbps package manager\n\n    sudo xbps-install -S neovim\n\n### Alpine Linux\n\nNeovim can be installed using the apk package manager\n\n    sudo apk add neovim\n\n## BSD\n\n### FreeBSD\n\nNeovim can be installed using [`pkg(8)`](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=8&n=1):\n\n    pkg install neovim\n\nor [from the ports tree](https://www.freshports.org/editors/neovim/):\n\n    cd /usr/ports/editors/neovim/ && make install clean\n\nTo install the pynvim Python modules using [`pkg(8)`](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=pkg&sektion=8&n=1) run:\n\n    pkg install py36-pynvim\n\n### OpenBSD\n\nNeovim can be installed using [`pkg_add(1)`](https://man.openbsd.org/pkg_add):\n\n    pkg_add neovim\n\nor [from the ports tree](https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb/ports/editors/neovim/):\n\n    cd /usr/ports/editors/neovim/ && make install\n\n## Android\n\n[Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) offers a Neovim package.\n\n\nInstall from source\n===================\n\nIf a package is not provided for your platform, you can build Neovim from source. See [BUILD.md](./BUILD.md) for details.  If you have the [prerequisites](./BUILD.md#build-prerequisites) then building is easy:\n\n    make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\n    sudo make install\n\nFor Unix-like systems this installs Neovim to `/usr/local`, while for Windows to `C:\\Program Files`. Note, however, that this can complicate uninstallation. The following example avoids this by isolating an installation under `$HOME/neovim`:\n\n    rm -r build/  # clear the CMake cache\n    make CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS=\"-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME/neovim\"\n    make install\n    export PATH=\"$HOME/neovim/bin:$PATH\"\n\n## Uninstall\n\nThere is a CMake target to _uninstall_ after `make install`:\n\n```sh\nsudo cmake --build build/ --target uninstall\n```\n\nAlternatively, just delete the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` artifacts:\n\n```sh\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/nvim\nsudo rm -r /usr/local/share/nvim/\n```\n"

You can also distribute\n    unmodified parts of Vim, likewise unrestricted except that they must\n    include this license text.  You are also allowed to include executables\n    that you made from the unmodified Vim sources, plus your own usage\n    examples and Vim scripts.\n\nII) It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of Vim,\n    including executables and/or source code, when the following four\n    conditions are met:\n    1) This license text must be included unmodified.\n    2) The modified Vim must be distributed in one of the following five ways:\n       a) If you make changes to Vim yourself, you must clearly describe in\n\t  the distribution how to contact you.  When the maintainer asks you\n\t  (in any way) for a copy of the modified Vim you distributed, you\n\t  must make your changes, including source code, available to the\n\t  maintainer without fee.  The maintainer reserves the right to\n\t  include your changes in the official version of Vim.  What the\n\t  maintainer will do with your changes and under what license they\n\t  will be distributed is negotiable.  If there has been no negotiation\n\t  then this license, or a later version, also applies to your changes.\n\t  The current maintainers are listed here: https://github.com/orgs/vim/people.\n\t  If this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely\n\t  vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors).  When it is completely\n\t  impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him\n\t  your changes ceases.  Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has\n\t  received your changes they will not have to be sent again.\n       b) If you have received a modified Vim that was distributed as\n\t  mentioned under a) you are allowed to further distribute it\n\t  unmodified, as mentioned at I).  If you make additional changes the\n\t  text under a) applies to those changes.\n       c) Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of\n\t  the modified Vim you distribute.  This may be done in the form of a\n\t  context diff.  You can choose what license to use for new code you\n\t  add.  The changes and their license must not restrict others from\n\t  making their own changes to the official version of Vim.\n       d) When you have a modified Vim which includes changes as mentioned\n\t  under c), you can distribute it without the source code for the\n\t  changes if the following three conditions are met:\n\t  - The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute\n\t    the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and\n\t    permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official\n\t    version of Vim without fee or restriction.\n\t  - You keep the changes for at least three years after last\n\t    distributing the corresponding modified Vim.  When the maintainer\n\t    or someone who you distributed the modified Vim to asks you (in\n\t    any way) for the changes within this period, you must make them\n\t    available to him.\n\t  - You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you.  This\n\t    contact information must remain valid for at least three years\n\t    after last distributing the corresponding modified Vim, or as long\n\t    as possible.\n       e) When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes,\n\t  you can distribute the modified Vim under the GNU GPL version 2 or\n\t  any later version.\n    3) A message must be added, at least in the output of the \":version\"\n       command and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified Vim\n       is able to see that it was modified.  When distributing as mentioned\n       under 2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does\n       not conflict with the license used for the changes.\n    4) The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be\n       removed or changed, except that the person himself can make\n       corrections.\n\nIII) If you distribute a modified version of Vim, you are encouraged to use\n     the Vim license for your changes and make them available to the\n     maintainer, including the source code.  The preferred way to do this is\n     by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the URL.\n     If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing a\n     context diff will do.  The e-mail address to be used is\n     <maintainer@vim.org>\n\nIV)  It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the Vim\n     sources, parts of it or from a modified version.  You may use this\n     license for previous Vim releases instead of the license that they came\n     with, at your option.\n\n"

          "content": "Maintaining the Neovim project\n==============================\n\nNotes on maintaining the Neovim project.\n\nGeneral guidelines\n------------------\n\n* Decide by cost-benefit\n* Write down what was decided\n* Constraints are good\n* Use automation to solve problems\n* Never break the API... but sometimes break the UI\n\nIssue triage\n------------\n\nIn practice we haven't found a way to forecast more precisely than \"next\" and\n\"after next\". So there are usually one or two (at most) planned milestones:\n\n* Next bugfix-release (1.0.x)\n* Next feature-release (1.x.0)\n\nThe forecasting problem might be solved with an explicit priority system (like\nVim's todo.txt). Meanwhile the Neovim priority system is defined by:\n\n* PRs nearing completion.\n* Issue labels. E.g. the `has:plan` label increases the ticket's priority merely\n  for having a plan written down: it is _closer to completion_ than tickets\n  without a plan.\n* Comment activity or new information.\n\nAnything that isn't in the next milestone, and doesn't have a finished PR—is\njust not something you care very much about, by construction. Post-release you\ncan review open issues, but chances are your next milestone is already getting\nfull... :)\n\nRelease policy\n--------------\n\nRelease \"often\", but not \"early\".\n\nThe (unreleased) `master` branch is the \"early\" channel; it should not be\nreleased if it's not stable. High-risk changes may be merged to `master` if\nthe next release is not imminent.\n\nFor maintenance releases, create a `release-x.y` branch. If the current release\nhas a major bug:\n\n1. Fix the bug on `master`.\n2. Cherry-pick the fix to `release-x.y`.\n3. Cut a release from `release-x.y`.\n    * Run `./scripts/release.sh` (requires [git cliff](https://github.com/orhun/git-cliff))\n    * The [CI job](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/3d45706478cd030c3ee05b4f336164bb96138095/.github/workflows/release.yml#L11-L13)\n      will update the release assets and [force-push to the \"stable\" tag](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/cdd87222c86c5b2274a13d36f23de0637462e317/.github/workflows/release.yml#L229).\n\n### Release automation\n\nNeovim automation includes a [backport bot](https://github.com/korthout/backport-action).\nTrigger the action by labeling a PR with `ci:backport release-x.y`. See `.github/workflows/backport.yml`.\n\nDeprecating and removing features\n---------------------------------\n\nNeovim inherits many features and design decisions from Vim, not all of which\nalign with the goals of this project. It is sometimes desired or necessary to\nremove existing features, or refactor parts of the code that would change\nuser's workflow. In these cases, a deprecation policy is needed to properly\ninform users of the change.\n\nWhen a (non-experimental) feature is slated to be removed it should:\n\n1. Be _soft_ deprecated in the _next_ release\n    - Use of the deprecated feature will still work.\n    - This means deprecating via documentation and annotation (`@deprecated`).\n    - Include a note in `deprecated.txt`.\n    - For Lua features, use `vim.deprecate()`. The specified version is the\n      current minor version + 2. For example, if the current version is\n      `v0.10.0-dev-1957+gd676746c33` then use `0.12`.\n    - For Vimscript features, use `v:lua.vim.deprecate()`. Use the same version\n      as described for Lua features.\n    - `vim.deprecate(…, 'x.y.z')` where major version `x` is greater than the\n      current Nvim major version, is always treated as _soft_ deprecation.\n2. Be _hard_ deprecated in a following a release in which it was soft deprecated.\n    - Use of the deprecated feature will still work but should issue a warning.\n    - Features implemented in C will need bespoke implementations to communicate\n      to users that the feature is deprecated.\n3. Be removed in a release following the release in which it was hard deprecated\n    - Usually this will be the next release, but it may be a later release if\n      a longer deprecation cycle is desired\n    - If possible, keep the feature as a stub (e.g. function API) and issue an\n      error when it is accessed.\n\nExample:\n\n                    Deprecation                            Removal\n                         ┆                 ┆                 ┆\n                         ┆      Soft       ┆      Hard       ┆\n                         ┆   Deprecation   ┆   Deprecation   ┆\n                         ┆     Period      ┆     Period      ┆\n             ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n    Version:            0.10              0.11              0.12\n             ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n             Old code         Old code          Old code\n                                 +                 +\n                              New code          New code         New code\n\nFeature removals which may benefit from community input or further discussion\nshould also have a tracking issue (which should be linked to in the release\nnotes).\n\nExceptions to this policy may be made (for experimental subsystems or when\nthere is broad consensus among maintainers). The rationale for the exception\nshould be stated explicitly and publicly.\n\nThird-party dependencies\n------------------------\n\nFor some dependencies we maintain temporary \"forks\", which are simply private\nbranches with a few extra patches, while we wait for the upstream project to\nmerge the patches. This is done instead of maintaining the patches as (fragile)\nCMake `PATCH_COMMAND` steps.\n\nThese \"bundled\" dependencies can be updated by bumping their versions in `cmake.deps/deps.txt`.\nSome can be auto-bumped by `scripts/bump_deps.lua`.\n\n* [LuaJIT](https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT)\n* [Lua](https://www.lua.org/download.html)\n* [Luv](https://github.com/luvit/luv)\n    * When bumping, also sync [our bundled documentation](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/runtime/doc/luvref.txt) with [the upstream documentation](https://github.com/luvit/luv/blob/master/docs.md).\n* [gettext](https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gettext/)\n* [libiconv](https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/libiconv)\n* [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv)\n* [lua-compat](https://github.com/keplerproject/lua-compat-5.3)\n* [tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter)\n* [unibilium](https://github.com/neovim/unibilium)\n    * The original project [was abandoned](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/10302), so the [neovim/unibilium](https://github.com/neovim/unibilium) fork is considered \"upstream\" and is maintained on the `master` branch.\n* [treesitter parsers](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/7e97c773e3ba78fcddbb2a0b9b0d572c8210c83e/cmake.deps/deps.txt#L47-L62)\n\n### Vendored dependencies\n\nThese dependencies are \"vendored\" (inlined), we must update the sources manually:\n\n* `src/mpack/`: [libmpack](https://github.com/libmpack/libmpack)\n    * send improvements upstream!\n* `src/mpack/lmpack.c`: [libmpack-lua](https://github.com/libmpack/libmpack-lua)\n    * send improvements upstream!\n* `src/xdiff/`: [xdiff](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/xdiff)\n* `src/cjson/`: [lua-cjson](https://github.com/openresty/lua-cjson)\n* `src/klib/`: [Klib](https://github.com/attractivechaos/klib)\n* `runtime/lua/vim/inspect.lua`: [inspect.lua](https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua)\n* `src/nvim/tui/terminfo_defs.h`: terminfo definitions\n    * Run `scripts/update_terminfo.sh` to update these definitions.\n* `runtime/lua/vim/lsp/_meta/protocol.lua`: LSP specification\n    * Run `scripts/gen_lsp.lua` to update.\n* `runtime/lua/vim/_meta/lpeg.lua`: LPeg definitions.\n    * Refer to [`LuaCATS/lpeg`](https://github.com/LuaCATS/lpeg) for updates.\n    * Update the git SHA revision from which the documentation was taken.\n* `runtime/lua/vim/re.lua`: LPeg regex module.\n    * Vendored from LPeg. Needs to be updated when LPeg is updated.\n* `runtime/lua/vim/_meta/re.lua`: docs for LPeg regex module.\n    * Needs to be updated when LPeg is updated.\n* `src/bit.c`: only for PUC lua: port of `require'bit'` from luajit https://bitop.luajit.org/\n* `runtime/lua/coxpcall.lua`: coxpcall (only needed for PUC lua, builtin to luajit)\n\nOther dependencies\n--------------------------\n\n* GitHub users:\n    * https://github.com/marvim\n    * https://github.com/nvim-winget\n* Org secrets/tokens:\n    * `CODECOV_TOKEN`\n    * `BACKPORT_KEY`\n* Org/repo variables:\n    * `BACKPORT_APP`\n* Domain names (held in https://namecheap.com):\n    * neovim.org\n    * neovim.io\n    * packspec.org\n    * pkgjson.org\n* DNS for the above domains is managed in https://cloudflare.com (not the domain registrar)\n\n\nRefactoring\n-----------\n\n### Frozen legacy modules\n\nRefactoring Vim structurally and aesthetically is an important goal of Neovim.\nBut there are some modules that should not be changed significantly, because\nthey are maintained by Vim, at present. Until someone takes \"ownership\" of\nthese modules, the cost of any significant changes (including style or\nstructural changes that re-arrange the code) to these modules outweighs the\nbenefit. The modules are:\n\n- `regexp.c`\n- `indent_c.c`\n\nAutomation (CI)\n---------------\n\n### Backup\n\nDiscussions from issues and PRs are backed up here:\nhttps://github.com/neovim/neovim-backup\n\n### Development guidelines\n\n* CI and automation jobs are primarily driven by GitHub Actions.\n* Avoid macOS if an Ubuntu or a Windows runner can be used instead. This is\n  because macOS runners have [tighter restrictions on the number of concurrent\n  jobs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits).\n* Runner versions:\n    * For special-purpose jobs where the runner version doesn't really matter,\n      prefer `-latest` tags so we don't need to manually bump the versions. An\n      example of a special-purpose workflow is `labeler_pr.yml`.\n    * For our testing job `test.yml`, prefer to use the latest version\n      explicitly. Avoid using the `-latest` tags here as it makes it difficult\n      to determine from an unrelated PR if a failure is due to the PR itself or\n      due to GitHub bumping the `-latest` tag without our knowledge. There's\n      also a high risk that automatically bumping the CI versions will fail due\n      to manual work being required from experience.\n    * For our release job, which is `release.yml`, prefer to use the oldest\n      stable (i.e. non-deprecated) versions available. The reason is that we're\n      trying to produce images that work in the broadest number of environments,\n      and therefore want to use older releases.\n\n### Special labels\n\nSome github labels are used to trigger certain jobs:\n\n* `ci:backport release-x.y` - backport to branch `release-x.y`\n* `ci:s390x` - enable s390x CI\n* `ci:skip-news` - skip news.yml workflows\n* `ci:windows-asan` - test windows with ASAN enabled\n* `needs:response` - close PR after a certain amount of time if author doesn't\n  respond\n\nSee also\n--------\n\n* https://github.com/neovim/neovim/issues/862\n* https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt\n"

architecture, modernizes our output to ESM only, promotes Vite to a first-class peer to Webpack, rethinks our Docs addon, cleans up the UI, and contains hundreds of improvements at every level of the stack. We've been sharing some of these changes on [the Storybook blog](https://storybook.js.org/blog/) and will share more over the coming weeks.\n\nBeta means that we don't have any more major changes on the radar for 7.0 and it's mostly stabilization from here on out. The core team is doing some basic testing now, and once we have a good QA plan, we'd love your help to make that happen. Please keep an eye out on the blog and on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/storybookjs) or Mastadon (coming soon!) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/storybook) if you're interested in helping.\n\n####

          "content": "# Getting started\n\nStorybook is developed against a specific node version which is defined in an `.nvmrc` file. You can use any Node version manager that uses the `.nvmrc` configuration file (we recommend [fnm](https://fnm.vercel.app/)).\n\n## Ensure you have the required system utilities\n\nYou will need to have the following installed:\n\n- git\n- node\n- yarn\n\n## Using fnm as a Node version manager\n\n- Install fnm [as per instructions](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/tree/master#installation)\n- In your shell setup include the `use-on-cd`, `corepack-enabled` and `version-file-strategy recursive` parameters in the `fnm env` command, e.g.\n\n  ```sh\n  eval \"$(fnm env --use-on-cd --corepack-enabled --version-file-strategy recursive)\"\n  ```\n\n## Running the local development environment\n\n- All commands should be run in a terminal with administrator privileges in Windows environments.\n- Run `yarn start` in the root directory to run a basic test Storybook \"sandbox\".\n\nThe `yarn start` script will generate a React Vite TypeScript sandbox with a set of test stories inside it, as well as taking all steps required to get it running (building the various packages we need etc). There is no need to run `yarn` or `yarn install` as `yarn start` will do this for you.\n\n### Issues\n\nIf you run `yarn start` and encounter the following error, try rerunning `yarn start` a second time:\n\n```sh\n>  NX   ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'storybook/code/node_modules/nx/package.json'\n```\n\nIf you are a Storybook contributor and still experience issues, it is recommended that you verify your local Storybook instance for any unintentional local changes. To do this, you can use the following command:\n\n```sh\ngit clean -dx --dry-run\n```\n\nBy executing this command, you will be able to see which untracked or ignored files and directories will be removed from your working directory if you run it with the `--force` flag. Before running the command with the `--force` flag, please commit any local changes that you want to keep. Otherwise they will be lost.\n\n## Forked repos\n\nIf you have forked the repository, you should [disable Github Actions for your repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository) as many of them (e.g. pushing to sandbox) will fail without proper authorization. In your Github repo, go to Settings > Actions > General > set the Actions Permissions to **Disable actions**.\n\n## Running against different sandbox templates\n\nYou can also pick a specific template to use as your sandbox by running `yarn task`, which will prompt you to make further choices about which template you want and which task you want to run.\n\n## Making code changes\n\nIf you want to make code changes to Storybook packages while running a sandbox, you'll need to do the following:\n\n1. In a second terminal run `yarn build --watch <package-1> <package-2>` in the `code/` directory. The package names is the bit after the `@storybook/` in the published package. For instance, to build the `@storybook/react @storybook/core-server @storybook/api @storybook/addon-docs` packages at the same time in watch mode:\n\n```bash\ncd code\nyarn build --watch react core addon-docs\n```\n\n2. If you are running the sandbox in \"linked\" mode (the default), you should see the changes reflected on a refresh (you may need to restart it if changing server packages)\n\n3. If you are running the sandbox in \"unlinked\" mode you'll need to re-run the sandbox from the `publish` step to see the changes:\n\n```sh\nyarn task --task dev --template <your template> --start-from=publish\n```\n\n### Making code changes when working on Angular-specific code\n\nIf you are working on Angular-specific code, you will need to append `--prod` to the above mentioned commands to ensure that the Angular compiler is able to pick up the changes appropriately and doesn't fail. This will build all the packages in production mode.\n\n```sh\nyarn task --prod\n```\n\n```bash\ncd code\nyarn build --prod --watch angular core addon-docs\n```\n\n## Contributing to Storybook\n\nFor further advice on how to contribute, please refer to our [NEW contributing guide on the Storybook website](https://storybook.js.org/docs/contribute).\n"

We are a community-driven project and welcome contributions of all kinds: from discussion to documentation to bugfixes to feature improvements.\n\nPlease review this document to help to streamline the process and save everyone's precious time.\n\nThis repo uses yarn workspaces, so you should install `yarn` as the package manager. See [installation guide](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).\n\n## Issues\n\nNo software is bug-free. So, if you got an issue, follow these steps:\n\n- Search the [issue list](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues) for current and old issues.\n  - If you find an existing issue, please UPVOTE the issue by adding a \"thumbs-up reaction\". We use this to help prioritize issues!\n- If none of that is helping, create an issue with the following information:\n  - Clear title (shorter is better).\n  - Describe the issue in clear language.\n  - Share error logs, screenshots and etc.\n  - To speed up the issue fixing process, send us a sample repo with the issue you faced:\n\n### Testing against `main`\n\nTo test your project against the current latest version of storybook, you can clone the repository and link it with `yarn`. Try following these steps:\n\n#### 1. Download the latest version of this project, and build it:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook.git\ncd storybook\nyarn bootstrap\n```\n\n> **_Note:_** On Windows, you may need to run `yarn` before `yarn bootstrap`!\n\nThe bootstrap command might ask which sections of the codebase you want to bootstrap. Unless you're doing something special you can keep the default.\n\nYou can also pick directly from CLI:\n\n```sh\nyarn bootstrap --core\n```\n\n#### 2a. Run unit tests\n\nYou can use one of the example projects in `examples/` to develop on.\n\nThis command will list all the suites and options for running tests.\n\n```sh\nyarn test\n```\n\nThe options for running tests can be selected from the cli or be passed to `yarn test` with specific parameters. Available modes include `--watch`, `--coverage`, and `--runInBand`, which will respectively run tests in watch mode, output code coverage, and run selected test suites serially in the current process.\n\nYou can use the `--update` flag (or `jest -u`) to update snapshots or screenshots as needed.\n\n> **_Note:_** On Windows, remember to make sure git config `core.autocrlf` is set to false, in order to not override EOL in snapshots ( `git config --global core.autocrlf false` to set it globally). It is also recommended to run tests from WSL2 to avoid errors with unix-style paths.\n\nYou can also pick suites from CLI. Suites available are listed below.\n\n##### Core & Examples Tests\n\n`yarn test`\n\nThis option executes tests from `<rootdir>/app/react`, `<rootdir>/app/vue`, and `<rootdir>/lib`.\nBefore the tests are run, the project must be bootstrapped with core. You can accomplish this with `yarn bootstrap --core`\n\n#### 2b. Run Linter\n\nWe use eslint as a linter for all code (including typescript code).\n\nAll you have to run is:\n\n```sh\nyarn lint\n```\n\nIt can be immensely helpful to get feedback in your editor, if you're using VsCode, you should install the `eslint` plugin and configure it with these settings:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"editor.codeActionsOnSave\": {\n    \"source.fixAll.eslint\": true\n  },\n  \"eslint.packageManager\": \"yarn\",\n  \"eslint.options\": {\n    \"cache\": true,\n    \"cacheLocation\": \".cache/eslint\",\n    \"extensions\": [\".js\", \".jsx\", \".json\", \".html\", \".ts\", \".tsx\", \".mjs\"]\n  },\n  \"eslint.alwaysShowStatus\": true\n}\n```\n\nThis should enable auto-fix for all source files, and give linting warnings and errors within your editor.\n\n### Reproductions\n\n#### In the monorepo\n\nThe best way to help figure out an issue you are having is to produce a minimal reproduction against the `main` branch.\n\nA good way to do that is using the example `official-storybook` app embedded in this repository:\n\n```sh\n# Download and build this repository:\ngit clone https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook.git\ncd storybook\nyarn\nyarn bootstrap --core\n\n# make changes to try and reproduce the problem, such as adding components + stories\ncd examples/official-storybook\nyarn storybook\n\n# see if you can see the problem, if so, commit it:\ngit checkout \"branch-describing-issue\"\ngit add -A\ngit commit -m \"reproduction for issue #123\"\n\n# fork the storybook repo to your account, then add the resulting remote\ngit remote add <your-username> https://github.com/<your-username>/storybook.git\ngit push -u <your-username> next\n```\n\nIf you follow that process, you can then link to the GitHub repository in the issue. See <https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/708#issuecomment-290589886> for an example.\n\n**_Note:_** If your issue involves a webpack config, create-react-app will prevent you from modifying the _app's_ webpack config, however, you can still modify storybook's to mirror your app's version of the storybook. Alternatively, use `yarn eject` in the CRA app to get a modifiable webpack config.\n\n#### Outside the monorepo\n\nSometimes your storybook is deeply ingrained in your own setup and it's hard to create a minimal viable reproduction somewhere else.\n\nInside the storybook repo we have a script that allows you to test the packages inside this repo in your own separate project.\n\nYou can use `npm link` on all packages, but npm linking is cumbersome and has subtle differences from what happens in a registry-based installation.\nSo the way our script works is that it:\n\n- sets up a npm registry running on your own local machine\n- changes your default registry to this local one\n- builds all packages in the storybook repo\n- publishes all packages as latest\n\nOur script leaves the local registry running, for **as long as you keep it running** you can install storybook packages from this local registry.\n\n- Navigate to your own project and then change `package.json` so the storybook packages match the version of the one you just published.\n- Then you can install using `yarn` or `npm`\n- Start using your storybook as normally.\n\nIf you've made a change to storybook's codebase and would want this change to be reflected in your app:\n\n- Ensure the storybook packages are transpiled, by either having run `yarn dev` or `yarn bootstrap --core`.\n- Go to the terminal where the local registry is running and press `<Enter>`. This will kick off a new publish.\n- Run the install procedure again in your local repo, (you may need to clean out node_modules first).\n- Restart your storybook.\n\n### Updating Tests\n\nBefore any contributions are submitted in a PR, make sure to add or update meaningful tests. A PR that has failing tests will be regarded as a “Work in Progress” and will not be merged until all tests pass.\n\nWhen creating new unit test files, the tests should adhere to a particular folder structure and naming convention, as defined below.\n\n```sh\n# Proper naming convention and structure for js tests files\n+-- parentFolder\n|   +-- [filename].js\n|   +-- [filename].test.js\n```\n\n## Pull Requests (PRs)\n\nWe welcome all contributions. There are many ways you can help us. This is few of those ways:\n\nBefore you submit a new PR, make sure you run `yarn test`. Do not submit a PR if tests are failing. If you need any help, the best way is to [join the discord server and ask in the maintenance channel](https://discord.gg/storybook).\n\n### Reviewing PRs\n\n**As a PR submitter**, you should reference the issue if there is one, include a short description of what you contributed and, if it is a code change, instructions for how to manually test out the change. This is informally enforced by our [PR template](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md). If your PR is reviewed as only needing trivial changes (e.g. small typos etc), and you have commit access then you can merge the PR after making those changes.\n\n> **_Note:_** Although the latest stable version of storybook corresponds to the `main` branch, nearly all Storybook development happens in the `next` branch. If you submit a PR, branch off `next` and target your PR to `next`.\n\n**As a PR reviewer**, you should read through the changes and comment on any potential problems. If you see something cool, a kind word never hurts either! Additionally, you should follow the testing instructions and manually test the changes. If the instructions are missing, unclear, or overly complex, feel free to request better instructions from the submitter. Unless the PR is tagged with the `do not merge` label, if you approve the review and there is no other required discussion or changes, you should also go ahead and merge the PR.\n\n## Issue Triage\n\nIf you are looking for a way to help the project, triaging issues is a great place to start. Here's how you can help:\n\n### Responding to issues\n\nIssues that are tagged `question / support` or `needs reproduction` are great places to help. If you can answer a question, it will help the asker as well as anyone who has a similar question. Also in the future if anyone has that same question they can easily find it by searching. If an issue needs reproduction, you may be able to guide the reporter toward one, or even reproduce it yourself using [this technique](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reproductions).\n\n### Triaging issues\n\nOnce you've helped out on a few issues, if you'd like triage access you can help label issues and respond to reporters.\n\nWe use the following label scheme to categorize issues:\n\n- **type** - `bug`, `feature`, `question / support`, `discussion`, `dependencies`, `maintenance`.\n- **area** - `addon: x`, `addons-api`, `stories-api`, `ui`, etc.\n- **status** - `needs reproduction`, `needs PR`, `in progress`, etc.\n\nAll issues should have a `type` label. `bug`/`feature`/`question`/`discussion` are self-explanatory. `dependencies` is for keeping package dependencies up to date. `maintenance` is a catch-all for any kind of cleanup or refactoring.\n\nThey should also have one or more `area`/`status` labels. We use these labels to filter issues down so we can see all of the issues for a particular area, and keep the total number of open issues under control.\n\nFor example, here is the list of [open, untyped issues](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20-label%3A%22bug%22%20-label%3A%22discussion%22%20-label%3A%22feature%22%20-label%3A%22maintenance%22%20-label%3A%22question%20%2F%20support%22%20-label%3A%22documentation%22%20-label%3A%22greenkeeper%22), or here is a list of [bugs that have not been modified since 2017-04-01](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22bug%22%20updated%3A%3C%3D2017-04-01%20). For more info see [searching issues](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) in the GitHub docs.\n\nIf an issue is a `bug`, and it doesn't have a clear reproduction that you have personally confirmed, label it `needs reproduction` and ask the author to try and create a reproduction, or have a go yourself.\n\n### Closing issues\n\n- Duplicate issues should be closed with a link to the original.\n- Unreproducible issues should be closed if it's not possible to reproduce them (if the reporter drops offline,\n  it is reasonable to wait 2 weeks before closing).\n- `bug`s should be labelled `merged` when merged, and be closed when the issue is fixed and released.\n- `feature`s, `maintenance`s, `greenkeeper`s should be labelled `merged` when merged,\n  and closed when released or if the feature is deemed not appropriate.\n- `question / support`s should be closed when the question has been answered.\n  If the questioner drops offline, a reasonable period to wait is two weeks.\n- `discussion`s should be closed at a maintainer's discretion.\n\n## Development Guide\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nPlease have the **_latest_** stable versions of the following on your machine\n\n- node\n- yarn\n\n### Initial Setup\n\nIf you run into trouble here, make sure your node, npm, and **_yarn_** are on the latest versions (yarn at least v1.3.2).\n\n1.  `cd ~` (optional)\n2.  `git clone https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook.git` _bonus_: use your own fork for this step\n3.  `cd storybook`\n4.  `yarn bootstrap --core`\n\n> **_Note:_** On Windows, you may need to run `yarn` before `yarn bootstrap` (between steps 3 and 4).\n\nThis builds the entire project statically, but when you're updating Storybook code it's nice to see those changes show up in the example apps under `examples`. There are two ways to do this:\n\n1.  `yarn dev`\n2.  OR `yarn build <package1> <package2> --watch`\n\nThe former watches ALL packages, which is extremely slow. The latter only watches a fixed list of packages, e.g. `yarn build add-docs components --watch` to build `@storybook/addon-docs` and `@storybook/components`. This is much more practical on slower machines or if you know ahead of time the packages you'll be updating.\n\n#### Bootstrapping everything\n\n_This method is slow_\n\n1.  `yarn bootstrap --all`\n2.  Take a break 🍵\n3.  `yarn test` (to verify everything worked)\n\n#### Building specific packages\n\nIf you're working on one or several packages, for every change that you make, you have to rebuild those packages. To make the process easier, there is a CLI command for that:\n\n- Run `yarn build` to bring you a list of packages to select from. There will be also an option to run in watch mode.\n- Run `yarn build <package-name>` to build that package specifically. \\\n  For the package name, use its short version. Example: for `@storybook/addon-docs`, run `yarn build addon-docs`.\n- Run `yarn build --all` to build everything.\n- Add `--watch` to run automatically in watch mode if you are either building a selection of packages by name or building all.\n  Example: `yarn build core addon-docs --watch` or `yarn build --all --watch`.\n\n### Working with the kitchen sink apps\n\nWithin the `examples` folder of the Storybook repo, you will find kitchen sink examples of storybook implementations for the various platforms that storybook supports.\n\nNot only do these show many of the options and add-ons available, they are also automatically linked to all the development packages. We highly encourage you to use these to develop/test contributions on.\n\n#### React and Vue\n\n1. `cd examples/official-storybook`\n2. `yarn storybook`\n3. Verify that your local version works\n\n### Working with your own app\n\n#### Linking Storybook\n\nStorybook is broken up into sub-projects that you can install as you need them. For this example, we will be working with `@storybook/react`.\n\n**_Note:_** You need to `yarn link` from inside the subproject you are working on **_NOT_** the storybook root directory.\n\n1.  `cd app/react`\n2.  `yarn link`\n\n#### Connecting Your App To Storybook\n\n**_Note:_** If you aren't seeing addons after linking storybook, you probably have a versioning issue which can be fixed by linking each addon you want to use.\nThis applies for the kitchen sink apps as well as your own projects.\n\n_Make sure `yarn dev` is running_\n\n##### 1. Setup storybook in your project\n\nFirst we are going to install storybook, then we are going to link `@storybook/react` into our project. This will replace `node_modules/@storybook/react` with a symlink to our local version of storybook.\n\n1.  `getstorybook`\n2.  `yarn storybook`\n3.  Verify that your local version works\n\n##### 2. Link\n\n**_Note:_** This process is the same for `@storybook/vue`, `@storybook/addon-foo`, etc\n\n1.  Go to your storybook _root_ directory\n2.  `yarn dev`\n3.  Wait until the output stops (changes you make will be transpiled into dist and logged here)\n4.  Go to your storybook-sandbox-app directory\n5.  `yarn link @storybook/react`\n6.  `yarn storybook`\n\n#### Verify your local version is working\n\nYou should now have a working storybook dev environment up and running.\n\nSave and go to `http://localhost:9011` (or wherever storybook is running).\n\nIf you don't see the changes rerun `yarn storybook` again in your sandbox app.\n\n### Documentation\n\nThe documentation for Storybook is served by the [frontpage](https://github.com/storybookjs/frontpage), but the docs files are in this repository.\n\nTo see changes in a development version of the docs, use the \"linking\" method documented [here](https://github.com/storybookjs/frontpage#docs-content).\n\n## Release Guide\n\nThis section is for Storybook maintainers who will be creating releases. It assumes:\n\n- yarn >= 1.3.2\n- you've yarn linked `pr-log` from <https://github.com/storybookjs/pr-log/pull/2>\n\nThe current manual release sequence is as follows:\n\n- Generate a changelog and verify the release by hand\n- Push the changelog to main or the release branch\n- Clean, build and publish the release\n- Cut and paste the changelog to the [GitHub release page](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases), and mark it as a (pre-) release\n\n**_Note:_** The very first time you publish a scoped package (`@storybook/x`) you need to make sure that its package.json contains the following\n\n```js\n\"publishConfig\": {\n  \"access\": \"public\"\n}\n```\n\nThis sequence applies to both releases and pre-releases, but differs slightly between the two.\n\n**_Note:_ This is a work in progress. Don't try this unless you know what you're doing. We hope to automate this in CI, so this process is designed with that in mind.**\n\n#### Prerelease:\n\n```sh\n# make sure you current with origin/next.\ngit checkout next\ngit status\n\n# generate changelog and edit as appropriate\n# generates a Next section\nyarn changelog:next x.y.z-alpha.a\n\n# Edit the changelog/PRs as needed, then commit\ngit commit -m \"x.y.z-alpha.a changelog\"\n\n# clean build\nyarn bootstrap --reset --core\n\n# publish and tag the release\nyarn run publish:next\n\n# update the release page\nopen https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases\n```\n\n#### Full release:\n\n```sh\n# make sure you current with origin/main.\ngit checkout main\ngit status\n\n# generate changelog and edit as appropriate\n# generates a vNext section\nyarn changelog x.y.z\n\n# Edit the changelog/PRs as needed, then commit\ngit commit -m \"x.y.z changelog\"\n\n# clean build\nyarn bootstrap --reset --core\n\n# publish and tag the release\nyarn run publish:latest\n\n# update the release page\nopen https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/releases\n```\n"

This feature flag allows you to set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `development` in built Storybooks, enabling development-related optimizations that are typically disabled in production builds.\n\nIn development mode, React and other libraries often include additional checks and warnings that help catch potential issues early. These checks are usually stripped out in production builds to optimize performance. However, when running tests or debugging issues in a built Storybook, having these additional checks can be incredibly valuable. One such feature is React's `act`, which ensures that all updates related to a test are processed and applied before making assertions. `act` is crucial for reliable and predictable test results, but it only works correctly when `NODE_ENV` is set to `development`.\n\n```js\n// main.js\nexport default {\n  features: {\n    developmentModeForBuild: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Added source code panel to docs\n\nStarting in 8.5, Storybook Docs (`@storybook/addon-docs`) automatically adds a new addon panel to stories that displays a source snippet beneath each story. This works similarly to the existing [source snippet doc block](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-docs/doc-blocks#source), but in the story view. It is intended to replace the [Storysource addon](https://storybook.js.org/addons/@storybook/addon-storysource).\n\nIf you wish to disable this panel globally, add the following line to your `.storybook/preview.js` project configuration. You can also selectively disable/enable at the story level.\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  parameters: {\n    docs: {\n      codePanel: false,\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Addon-a11y: Component test integration\n\nIn Storybook 8.4, we introduced the [Test addon](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/test-addon) (`@storybook/experimental-addon-test`). Powered by Vitest under the hood, this addon lets you watch, run, and debug your component tests directly in Storybook.\n\nIn Storybook 8.5, we revamped the [Accessibility addon](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/accessibility-testing) (`@storybook/addon-a11y`) to integrate it with the component tests feature. This means you can now extend your component tests to include accessibility tests.\n\nIf you upgrade to Storybook 8.5 via `npx storybook@latest upgrade`, the Accessibility addon will be automatically configured to work with the component tests. However, if you're upgrading manually and you have the Test addon installed, adjust your configuration as follows:\n\n```diff\n// .storybook/vitest.setup.ts\n...\n+import * as a11yAddonAnnotations from '@storybook/addon-a11y/preview';\n\nconst annotations = setProjectAnnotations([\n  previewAnnotations,\n+ a11yAddonAnnotations,\n]);\n\n// Run Storybook's beforeAll hook\nbeforeAll(annotations.beforeAll);\n```\n\n### Addon-a11y: Deprecated `parameters.a11y.manual`\n\nWe have deprecated `parameters.a11y.manual` in 8.5. Please use `globals.a11y.manual` instead.\n\n### Indexing behavior of @storybook/experimental-addon-test is changed\n\nThe Storybook test addon used to index stories based on the `test.include` field in the Vitest config file. This caused indexing issues with Storybook, because stories could have been indexed by Storybook and not Vitest, and vice versa. Starting in Storybook 8.5.0-alpha.18, we changed the indexing behavior so that it always uses the globs defined in the `stories` field in `.storybook/main.js` for a more consistent experience. It is now discouraged to use `test.include`, please remove it.\n\n## From version 8.2.x to 8.3.x\n\n### Removed `experimental_SIDEBAR_BOTTOM` and deprecated `experimental_SIDEBAR_TOP` addon types\n\nThe experimental SIDEBAR_BOTTOM addon type was removed in favor of a built-in filter UI. The enum type definition will remain available until Storybook 9.0 but will be ignored. Similarly the experimental SIDEBAR_TOP addon type is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n\nThese APIs allowed addons to render arbitrary content in the Storybook sidebar. Due to potential conflicts between addons and challenges regarding styling, these APIs are/will be removed. In the future, Storybook will provide declarative API hooks to allow addons to add content to the sidebar without risk of conflicts or UI inconsistencies. One such API is `experimental_updateStatus` which allow addons to set a status for stories. The SIDEBAR_BOTTOM slot is now used to allow filtering stories with a given status.\n\n### New parameters format for addon backgrounds\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You need to set the feature flag `backgroundsStoryGlobals` to `true` in your `.storybook/main.ts` to use the new format and set the value with `globals`.\n>\n> See here how to set feature flags: https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/main-config/main-config-features\n\nThe `addon-backgrounds` addon now uses a new format for configuring its list of selectable backgrounds.\nThe `backgrounds` parameter is now an object with an `options` property.\nThis `options` object is a key-value pair where the key is used when setting the global value, the value is an object with a `name` and `value` property.\n\n```diff\n// .storybook/preview.js\nexport const parameters = {\n  backgrounds: {\n-   values: [\n-     { name: 'twitter', value: '#00aced' },\n-     { name: 'facebook', value: '#3b5998' },\n-   ],\n+   options: {\n+     twitter: { name: 'Twitter', value: '#00aced' },\n+     facebook: { name: 'Facebook', value: '#3b5998' },\n+   },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nSetting an override value should now be done via a `globals` property on your component/meta or story itself:\n\n```diff\n// Button.stories.ts\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n- parameters: {\n-   backgrounds: {\n-     default: \"twitter\",\n-   },\n- },\n+ globals: {\n+   backgrounds: { value: \"twitter\" },\n+ },\n};\n```\n\nThis locks that story to the `twitter` background, it cannot be changed by the addon UI.\n\n### New parameters format for addon viewport\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You need to set the feature flag `viewportStoryGlobals` to `true` in your `.storybook/main.ts` to use the new format and set the value with `globals`.\n>\n> See here how to set feature flags: https://storybook.js.org/docs/api/main-config/main-config-features\n\nThe `addon-viewport` addon now uses a new format for configuring its list of selectable viewports.\nThe `viewport` parameter is now an object with an `options` property.\nThis `options` object is a key-value pair where the key is used when setting the global value, the value is an object with a `name` and `styles` property.\nThe `styles` property is an object with a `width` and a `height` property.\n\n```diff\n// .storybook/preview.js\nexport const parameters = {\n  viewport: {\n-   viewports: {\n-     iphone5: {\n-       name: 'phone',\n-       styles: {\n-         width: '320px',\n-         height: '568px',\n-       },\n-     },\n-    },\n+   options: {\n+     iphone5: {\n+       name: 'phone',\n+       styles: {\n+         width: '320px',\n+         height: '568px',\n+       },\n+     },\n+   },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nSetting an override value should now be done via a `globals` property on your component/meta or story itself.\nAlso note the change from `defaultOrientation: \"landscape\"` to `isRotated: true`.\n\n```diff\n// Button.stories.ts\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n- parameters: {\n-   viewport: {\n-     defaultViewport: \"iphone5\",\n-     defaultOrientation: \"landscape\",\n-   },\n- },\n+ globals: {\n+   viewport: {\n+     value: \"iphone5\",\n+     isRotated: true,\n+   },\n+ },\n};\n```\n\nThis locks that story to the `iphone5` viewport in landscape orientation, it cannot be changed by the addon UI.\n\n## From version 8.1.x to 8.2.x\n\n### Failed to resolve import \"@storybook/X\" error\n\nStorybook's package structure changed in 8.2. It is a non-breaking change, but can expose missing project dependencies.\n\nThis happens when `@storybook/X` is missing in your `package.json`, but your project references `@storybook/X` in your source code (typically in a story file or in a `.storybook` config file). This is a problem with your project, and if it worked in earlier versions of Storybook, it was purely accidental.\n\nNow in Storybook 8.2, that incorrect project configuration no longer works. The solution is to install `@storybook/X` as a dev dependency and re-run.\n\nExample errors:\n\n```sh\nCannot find module @storybook/preview-api or its corresponding type declarations\n```\n\n```sh\nInternal server error: Failed to resolve import \"@storybook/theming/create\" from \".storybook/theme.ts\". Does the file exist?\n```\n\nTo protect your project from missing dependencies, try the `no-extraneous-dependencies` rule in [eslint-plugin-import](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import).\n\n### Preview.js globals renamed to initialGlobals\n\nStarting in 8.2 `preview.js` `globals` are deprecated and have been renamed to `initialGlobals`. We will remove `preview.js` `globals` in 9.0.\n\n```diff\n// .storybook/preview.js\nexport default {\n-  globals: [ a: 1, b: 2 ],\n+  initialGlobals: [ a: 1, b: 2 ],\n}\n```\n\n## From version 8.0.x to 8.1.x\n\n### Portable stories\n\n#### @storybook/nextjs requires specific path aliases to be setup\n\nIn order to properly mock the `next/router`, `next/header`, `next/navigation` and `next/cache` APIs, the `@storybook/nextjs` framework includes internal Webpack aliases to those modules. If you use portable stories in your Jest tests, you should set the aliases in your Jest config files `moduleNameMapper` property using the `getPackageAliases` helper from `@storybook/nextjs/export-mocks`:\n\n```js\nconst nextJest = require(\"next/jest.js\");\nconst { getPackageAliases } = require(\"@storybook/nextjs/export-mocks\");\nconst createJestConfig = nextJest();\nconst customJestConfig = {\n  moduleNameMapper: {\n    ...getPackageAliases(), // Add aliases for @storybook/nextjs mocks\n  },\n};\nmodule.exports = createJestConfig(customJestConfig);\n```\n\nThis will make sure you end using the correct implementation of the packages and avoid having issues in your tests.\n\n### main.js `docs.autodocs` is deprecated\n\nThe `docs.autodocs` setting in `main.js` is deprecated in 8.1 and will be removed in 9.0.\n\nIt has been replaced with a tags-based system which is more flexible than before.\n\n`docs.autodocs` takes three values:\n\n- `true`: generate autodocs for every component\n- `false`: don't generate autodocs at all\n- `tag`: generate autodocs for components that have been tagged `'autodocs'`.\n\nStarting in 8.1, to generate autodocs for every component (`docs.autodocs = true`), add the following code to `.storybook/preview.js`:\n\n```js\n// .storybook/preview.js\nexport default {\n  tags: [\"autodocs\"],\n};\n```\n\nTags cascade, so setting `'autodocs'` at the project level automatically propagates to every component and story. If you set autodocs globally and want to opt-out for a particular component, you can remove the `'autodocs'` tag for a component like this:\n\n```js\n// Button.stories.ts\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n  tags: [\"!autodocs\"],\n};\n```\n\nIf you had set `docs.autodocs = 'tag'`, the default setting, you can remove the setting from `.storybook/main.js`. That is now the default behavior.\n\nIf you had set `docs.autodocs = false`, this still works in 8.x, but will go away in 9.0 as a breaking change. If you don't want autodocs at all, simply remove the `'autodocs'` tag throughout your Storybook and autodocs will not be created.\n\n### `docs` and `story` system tags removed\n\nStorybook automatically added the tag `'docs'` to any docs entry in the index and `'story'` to any story entry in the index. This behavior was undocumented, and in an effort to reduce the number of tags we've removed them in 8.1. If you depended on these tags, please file an issue on the [Storybook monorepo](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) and let us know!\n\n### Subtitle block and `parameters.componentSubtitle`\n\nThe `Subtitle` block now accepts an `of` prop, which can be a reference to a CSF file or a default export (meta).\n\n`parameters.componentSubtitle` has been deprecated to be consistent with other parameters related to autodocs, instead use `parameters.docs.subtitle`.\n\n### Title block `of` prop\n\nThe `Title` block now accepts an `of` prop, which can be a reference to a CSF file or a default export (meta).\n\nIt still accepts being passed `children`.\n\n## From version 7.x to 8.0.0\n\n### Portable stories\n\n#### Project annotations are now merged instead of overwritten in composeStory\n\nWhen passing project annotations overrides via `composeStory` such as:\n\n```tsx\nconst projectAnnotationOverrides = { parameters: { foo: \"bar\" } };\nconst Primary = composeStory(\n  stories.Primary,\n  stories,\n  projectAnnotationOverrides\n);\n```\n\nthey are now merged with the annotations passed via `setProjectAnnotations` rather than completely overwriting them. This was seen as a bug and it's now fixed. If you have a use case where you really need this, please open an issue to elaborate.\n\n#### Type change in `composeStories` API\n\nThere is a TypeScript type change in the `play` function returned from `composeStories` or `composeStory` in `@storybook/react` or `@storybook/vue3`, where before it was always defined, now it is potentially undefined. This means that you might have to make a small change in your code, such as:\n\n```ts\nconst { Primary } = composeStories(stories)\n\n// before\nawait Primary.play(...)\n\n// after\nawait Primary.play?.(...) // if you don't care whether the play function exists\nawait Primary.play!(...) // if you want a runtime error when the play function does not exist\n```\n\nThere are plans to make the type of the play function be inferred based on your imported story's play function in a near future, so the types will be 100% accurate.\n\n#### Composed Vue stories are now components instead of functions\n\n`composeStory` (and `composeStories`) from `@storybook/vue3` now return Vue components rather than story functions that return components. This means that when rendering these composed stories you just pass the composed story _without_ first calling it.\n\nPreviously when using `composeStory` from `@storybook/testing-vue3`, you would render composed stories with e.g. `render(MyStoryComposedStory({ someProp: true}))`. That is now changed to more [closely match how you would render regular Vue components](https://testing-library.com/docs/vue-testing-library/examples).\n\nWhen migrating from `@storybook/testing-vue3`, you will likely hit the following error:\n\n```ts\nTypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'devtoolsRawSetupState')\n```\n\nTo fix it, you should change the usage of the composed story to reference it instead of calling it as a function. Here's an example using `@testing-library/vue` and Vitest:\n\n```diff\nimport { it } from 'vitest';\nimport { render } from '@testing-library/vue';\nimport * as stories from './Button.stories';\nimport { composeStory } from '@storybook/vue3';\n\nit('renders primary button', () => {\n  const Primary = composeStory(stories.Primary, stories.default);\n-  render(Primary({ label: 'Hello world' }));\n+  render(Primary, { props: { label: 'Hello world' } });\n});\n```\n\n### Tab addons are now routed to a query parameter\n\nThe URL of a tab used to be: `http://localhost:6006/?path=/my-addon-tab/my-story`.\n\nThe new URL of a tab is `http://localhost:6006/?path=/story/my-story&tab=my-addon-tab`.\n\n### Default keyboard shortcuts changed\n\nThe default keyboard shortcuts have changed to avoid any conflicts with the browser's default shortcuts or when you are directly typing in the Manager. If you want to get the new default shortcuts, you can reset your shortcuts in the keyboard shortcuts panel by pressing the `Restore default` button.\n\n### Manager addons are now rendered with React 18\n\nThe UI added to the manager via addons is now rendered with React 18.\n\nExample:\n\n```tsx\nimport { addons, types } from \"@storybook/manager-api\";\n\naddons.register(\"my-addon\", () => {\n  addons.add(\"my-addon/panel\", {\n    type: types.PANEL,\n    title: \"My Addon\",\n    // This will be called as a JSX element by react 18\n    render: ({ active }) => (active ? <div>Hello World</div> : null),\n  });\n});\n```\n\nPreviously the `key` prop was passed to the render function, that is now no longer the case.\n\n### Removal of `storiesOf`-API\n\nThe `storiesOf` API has been removed in Storybook 8.0.\n\nIf you need to dynamically create stories, you will need to implement this via the experimental `experimental_indexers` [API](#storyindexers-is-replaced-with-experimental_indexers).\n\nFor migrating to CSF, see: [`storyStoreV6` and `storiesOf` is deprecated](#storystorev6-and-storiesof-is-deprecated)\n\n### Removed deprecated shim packages\n\nIn Storybook 7, these packages existed for backwards compatibility, but were marked as deprecated:\n\n- `@storybook/addons` - this package has been split into 2 packages: `@storybook/preview-api` and `@storybook/manager-api`, see more here: [New Addons API](#new-addons-api).\n- `@storybook/channel-postmessage` - this package has been merged into `@storybook/channels`.\n- `@storybook/channel-websocket` - this package has been merged into `@storybook/channels`.\n- `@storybook/client-api` - this package has been merged into `@storybook/preview-api`.\n- `@storybook/core-client` - this package has been merged into `@storybook/preview-api`.\n- `@storybook/preview-web` - this package has been merged into `@storybook/preview-api`.\n- `@storybook/store` - this package has been merged into `@storybook/preview-api`.\n- `@storybook/api` - this package has been replaced with `@storybook/manager-api`.\n\nThese sections explain the rationale, and the required changes you might have to make:\n\n- [New Addons API](#new-addons-api)\n- [`addons.setConfig` should now be imported from `@storybook/manager-api`.](#addonssetconfig-should-now-be-imported-from-storybookmanager-api)\n\n### Deprecated `@storybook/testing-library` package\n\nIn Storybook 8, `@storybook/testing-library` has been integrated to a new package called `@storybook/test`, which uses Vitest APIs for an improved experience. When upgrading to Storybook 8 with 'npx storybook@latest upgrade', you will get prompted and will get an automigration for the new package. Please migrate when you can.\n\nTo migrate by hand, install `@storybook/test` and replace `@storybook/testing-libary` imports globally:\n\n```ts\n- import { userEvent } from '@storybook/testing-library';\n+ import { userEvent } from '@storybook/test';\n```\n\nFor more information on the change, see the [announcement post](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-test/).\n\n### Framework-specific Vite plugins have to be explicitly added\n\nIn Storybook 7, we would automatically add frameworks-specific Vite plugins, e.g. `@vitejs/plugin-react` if not installed.\nIn Storybook 8 those plugins have to be added explicitly in the user's `vite.config.ts`:\n\n#### For React:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport react from \"@vitejs/plugin-react\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [react()],\n});\n```\n\n#### For Vue:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport vue from \"@vitejs/plugin-vue\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [vue()],\n});\n```\n\n#### For Svelte (without Sveltekit):\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport { svelte } from \"@sveltejs/vite-plugin-svelte\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [svelte()],\n});\n```\n\n#### For Preact:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport preact from \"@preact/preset-vite\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [preact()],\n});\n```\n\n#### For Solid:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport solid from \"vite-plugin-solid\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [solid()],\n});\n```\n\n#### For Qwik:\n\n```ts\nimport { defineConfig } from \"vite\";\nimport qwik from \"vite-plugin-qwik\";\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [qwik()],\n});\n```\n\n### TurboSnap Vite plugin is no longer needed\n\nAt least in build mode, `builder-vite` now supports the `--webpack-stats-json` flag and will output `preview-stats.json`.\n\nThis means https://github.com/IanVS/vite-plugin-turbosnap is no longer necessary, and duplicative, and the plugin will automatically be removed if found.\n\n### `--webpack-stats-json` option renamed `--stats-json`\n\nNow that both Vite and Webpack support the `preview-stats.json` file, the flag has been renamed. The old flag will continue to work.\n\n### Implicit actions can not be used during rendering (for example in the play function)\n\nIn Storybook 7, we inferred if the component accepts any action props,\nby checking if it starts with `onX` (for example `onClick`), or as configured by `actions.argTypesRegex`.\nIf that was the case, we would fill in jest spies for those args automatically.\n\n```ts\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n};\n\nexport const ButtonClick = {\n  play: async ({ args, canvasElement }) => {\n    await userEvent.click(within(canvasElement).getByRole(\"button\"));\n    // args.onClick is a jest spy in 7.0\n    await expect(args.onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIn Storybook 8 this feature is removed, and spies have to added explicitly:\n\n```ts\nimport { fn } from \"@storybook/test\";\n\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n  args: {\n    onClick: fn(),\n  },\n};\n\nexport const ButtonClick = {\n  play: async ({ args, canvasElement }) => {\n    await userEvent.click(within(canvasElement).getByRole(\"button\"));\n    await expect(args.onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  },\n};\n```\n\nFor more context, see this RFC:\nhttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/23649\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- This makes CSF files less magical and more portable, so that CSF files will render the same in a test environment where docgen is not available.\n- This allows users and (test) integrators to run or build storybook without docgen, boosting the user performance and allows tools to give quicker feedback.\n- This will make sure that we can one day lazy load docgen, without changing how stories are rendered.\n\n### MDX related changes\n\n#### MDX is upgraded to v3\n\nStorybook now uses MDX3 under the hood. This change contains many improvements and a few small breaking changes that probably won't affect you. However we recommend checking the [migration notes from MDX here](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v3/).\n\n#### Dropping support for \\*.stories.mdx (CSF in MDX) format and MDX1 support\n\nIn Storybook 7, we deprecated the ability of using MDX both for documentation and for defining stories in the same .stories.mdx file. It is now removed, and Storybook won't support .stories.mdx files anymore. We provide migration scripts to help you onto the new format.\n\nIf you were using the [legacy MDX1 format](#legacy-mdx1-support), you will have to remove the `legacyMdx1` main.js feature flag and the `@storybook/mdx1-csf` package.\n\nAlongside with this change, the `jsxOptions` configuration was removed as it is not used anymore.\n\n[More info here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/migration-guide#storiesmdx-to-mdxcsf).\n\n#### Dropping support for id, name and story in Story block\n\nReferencing stories by `id`, `name` or `story` in the Story block is not possible anymore. [More info here](#story-block).\n\n### Core changes\n\n#### `framework.options.builder.useSWC` for Webpack5-based projects removed\n\nIn Storybook 8.0, we have removed the `framework.options.builder.useSWC` option. The `@storybook/builder-webpack5` package is now compiler-agnostic and does not depend on Babel or SWC.\n\nIf you want to use SWC, you can add the necessary addon:\n\n```sh\nnpx storybook@latest add @storybook/addon-webpack5-compiler-swc\n```\n\nThe goal is to make @storybook/builder-webpack5 lighter and more flexible. We are not locked into a specific compiler or compiler version anymore. This allows us to support Babel 7/8, SWC, and other compilers simultaneously.\n\n#### Removed `@babel/core` and `babel-loader` from `@storybook/builder-webpack5`\n\nIn Storybook 8.0, we have removed the `@storybook/builder-webpack5` package's dependency on Babel. This means that Babel is not preconfigured in `@storybook/builder-webpack5`. If you want to use Babel, you can add the necessary addon:\n\n```sh\nnpx storybook@latest add @storybook/addon-webpack5-compiler-babel\n```\n\nWe are doing this to make Storybook more flexible and to allow users to use a variety of compilers like SWC, Babel or even pure TypeScript.\n\n#### `framework.options.fastRefresh` for Webpack5-based projects removed\n\nIn Storybook 8.0, we have removed the `framework.options.fastRefresh` option.\n\nThe fast-refresh implementation currently relies on the `react-refresh/babel` package. While this has served us well, integrating this dependency could pose challenges. Specifically, it locks users into a specific Babel version. This could become a problem when Babel 8 is released. There is uncertainty about whether react-refresh/babel will seamlessly support Babel 8, potentially hindering users from updating smoothly.\n\nFurthermore, the existing implementation does not account for cases where fast-refresh might already be configured in a user's Babel configuration. Rather than filtering out existing configurations, our current approach could lead to duplications, resulting in a sub-optimal development experience.\n\nWe believe in empowering our users, and setting up fast-refresh manually is a straightforward process. The following configuration will configure fast-refresh if Storybook does not automatically pick up your fast-refresh configuration:\n\n`package.json`:\n\n```diff\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n+   \"@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin\": \"^0.5.11\",\n+   \"react-refresh\": \"^0.14.0\",\n  }\n}\n```\n\n`babel.config.js` (optionally, add it to `.storybook/main.js`):\n\n```diff\n+const isProdBuild = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';\n\nmodule.exports = (api) => {\n  return {\n    plugins: [\n+     !isProdBuild && 'react-refresh/babel',\n    ].filter(Boolean),\n  };\n};\n```\n\n`.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```diff\n+import ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin from \"@pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin\";\n+const isProdBuild = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';\nconst config = {\n  webpackFinal: (config) => {\n+   config.plugins = [\n+     !isProdBuild && new ReactRefreshWebpackPlugin({\n+       overlay: {\n+         sockIntegration: 'whm',\n+       },\n+     }),\n+     ...config.plugins,\n+   ].filter(Boolean);\n    return config;\n  },\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\nThis approach aligns with our philosophy of transparency and puts users in control of their Webpack and Babel configurations.\n\nWe want to minimize magic behind the scenes. By removing `framework.options.fastRefresh`, we are reducing unnecessary configuration. Instead, we encourage users to leverage their existing Webpack and Babel setups, fostering a more transparent and customizable development environment.\n\nYou don't have to add fast refresh to `@storybook/nextjs` since it is already configured there as a default to match the same experience as `next dev`.\n\n#### `typescript.skipBabel` removed\n\nWe have removed the `typescript.skipBabel` option in Storybook 8.0. Please use `typescript.skipCompiler` instead.\n\n#### Dropping support for Yarn 1\n\nStorybook will stop providing fixes aimed at Yarn 1 projects. This does not necessarily mean that Storybook will stop working for Yarn 1 projects, just that the team won't provide more fixes aimed at it. For context, it's been 6 years since the release of Yarn 1, and Yarn is currently in version 4, which was [released in October 2023](https://yarnpkg.com/blog/release/4.0).\n\n#### Dropping support for Node.js 16\n\nIn Storybook 8, we have dropped Node.js 16 support since it reached end-of-life on 2023-09-11. Storybook 8 supports Node.js 18 and above.\n\n#### Autotitle breaking fixes\n\nIn Storybook 7, the file name `path/to/foo.bar.stories.js` would result in the [autotitle](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/overview#configure-story-loading) `path/to/foo`. In 8.0, this has been changed to generate `path/to/foo.bar`. We consider this a bugfix but it is also a breaking change if you depended on the old behavior. To get the old titles, you can manually specify the desired title in the default export of your story file. For example:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  title: \"path/to/foo\",\n};\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you need to achieve a different behavior for a large number of files, you can provide a [custom indexer](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/vue/configure/sidebar-and-urls#processing-custom-titles) to generate the titles dynamically.\n\n#### Storyshots has been removed\n\nStoryshots was an addon for Storybook which allowed users to turn their stories into automated snapshot tests.\n\nEvery story would automatically be taken into account and create a snapshot file.\n\nSnapshot testing has since fallen out of favor and is no longer recommended.\n\nIn addition to its limited use, and high chance of false positives, Storyshots ran code developed to run in the browser in NodeJS via JSDOM.\nJSDOM has limitations and is not a perfect emulation of the browser environment; therefore, Storyshots was always a pain to set up and maintain.\n\nThe Storybook team has built the test-runner as a direct replacement, which utilizes Playwright to connect to an actual browser where Storybook runs the code.\n\nIn addition, CSF has expanded to allow for play functions to be defined on stories, which allows for more complex testing scenarios, fully integrated within Storybook itself (and supported by the test-runner, and not Storyshots).\n\nFinally, storyStoreV7: true (the default and only option in Storybook 8), was not supported by Storyshots.\n\nBy removing Storyshots, the Storybook team was unblocked from moving (eventually) to an ESM-only Storybook, which is a big step towards a more modern Storybook.\n\nPlease check the [migration guide](https://storybook.js.org/docs/writing-tests/storyshots-migration-guide) that we prepared.\n\n#### UI layout state has changed shape\n\nIn Storybook 7 it was possible to use `addons.setConfig({...});` to configure Storybook UI features and behavior as documented [here (v7)](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.3/react/configure/features-and-behavior), [(latest)](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/features-and-behavior). The state and API for the UI layout has changed:\n\n- `showNav: boolean` is now `navSize: number`, where the number represents the size of the sidebar in pixels.\n- `showPanel: boolean` is now split into `bottomPanelHeight: number` and `rightPanelWidth: number`, where the numbers represents the size of the panel in pixels.\n- `isFullscreen: boolean` is no longer supported, but can be achieved by setting a combination of the above.\n\n#### New UI and props for Button and IconButton components\n\nWe used to have a lot of different buttons in `@storybook/components` that were not used anywhere. In Storybook 8.0 we are deprecating `Form.Button` and added a new `Button` component that can be used in all places. The `IconButton` component has also been updated to use the new `Button` component under the hood. Going forward addon creators and Storybook maintainers should use the new `Button` component instead of `Form.Button`.\n\nFor the `Button` component, the following props are now deprecated:\n\n- `isLink` - Please use the `asChild` prop instead like this: `<Button asChild><a href=\"\">Link</a></Button>`\n- `primary` - Please use the `variant` prop instead.\n- `secondary` - Please use the `variant` prop instead.\n- `tertiary` - Please use the `variant` prop instead.\n- `gray` - Please use the `variant` prop instead.\n- `inForm` - Please use the `variant` prop instead.\n- `small` - Please use the `size` prop instead.\n- `outline` - Please use the `variant` prop instead.\n- `containsIcon`. Please add your icon as a child directly. No need for this prop anymore.\n\nThe `IconButton` doesn't have any deprecated props but it now uses the new `Button` component under the hood so all props for `IconButton` will be the same as `Button`.\n\n#### Icons is deprecated\n\nIn Storybook 8.0 we are introducing a new icon library available with `@storybook/icons`. We are deprecating the `Icons` component in `@storybook/components` and recommend that addon creators and Storybook maintainers use the new `@storybook/icons` component instead.\n\n#### Removed postinstall\n\nWe removed the `@storybook/postinstall` package, which provided some utilities for addons to programmatically modify user configuration files on install. This package was years out of date, so this should be a non-disruptive change. If your addon used the package, you can view the old source code [here](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/release-7-5/code/lib/postinstall) and adapt it into your addon.\n\n#### Removed stories.json\n\nIn addition to the built storybook, `storybook build` generates two files, `index.json` and `stories.json`, that list out the contents of the Storybook. `stories.json` is a legacy format and we included it for backwards compatibility. As of 8.0 we no longer build `stories.json` by default, and we will remove it completely in 9.0.\n\nIn the meantime if you have code that relies on `stories.json`, you can find code that transforms the \"v4\" `index.json` to the \"v3\" `stories.json` format (and their respective TS types): https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/release-7-5/code/lib/core-server/src/utils/stories-json.ts#L71-L91\n\n#### Removed `sb babelrc` command\n\nThe `sb babelrc` command was used to generate a `.babelrc` file for Storybook. This command is now removed.\n\nFrom version 8.0 onwards, Storybook is compiler-agnostic and does not depend on Babel or SWC if you use Webpack 5. This move was made to make Storybook more flexible and allow users to configure their own Babel setup according to their project needs and setup. If you need a custom Babel configuration, you can create a `.babelrc` file yourself and configure it according to your project setup.\n\nThe reasoning behind is to condense and provide some clarity to what's happened to both the command and what's shifted with the upcoming release.\n\n#### Changed interfaces for `@storybook/router` components\n\nThe `hideOnly` prop has been removed from the `<Route />` component in `@storybook/router`. If needed this can be implemented manually with the `<Match />` component.\n\n#### Extract no longer batches\n\n`Preview.extract()` no longer loads CSF files in batches. This was a workaround for resource limitations that slowed down extract. This shouldn't affect behaviour.\n\n### Framework-specific changes\n\n#### React\n\n##### `react-docgen` component analysis by default\n\nIn Storybook 7, we used `react-docgen-typescript` to analyze React component props and auto-generate controls. In Storybook 8, we have moved to `react-docgen` as the new default. `react-docgen` is dramatically more efficient, shaving seconds off of dev startup times. However, it only analyzes basic TypeScript constructs.\n\nWe feel `react-docgen` is the right tradeoff for most React projects. However, if you need the full fidelity of `react-docgen-typescript`, you can opt-in using the following setting in `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  typescript: {\n    reactDocgen: \"react-docgen-typescript\",\n  },\n};\n```\n\nFor more information see: https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/main-config-typescript#reactdocgen\n\n#### Next.js\n\n##### Require Next.js 13.5 and up\n\nStarting in 8.0, Storybook requires Next.js 13.5 and up.\n\n##### Automatic SWC mode detection\n\nSimilar to how Next.js detects if SWC should be used, Storybook will follow more or less the same rules:\n\n- If you use Next.js 14 or higher and you don't have a .babelrc file, Storybook will use SWC to transpile your code.\n- Even if you have a .babelrc file, Storybook will still use SWC to transpile your code if you set the experimental `experimental.forceSwcTransforms` flag to `true` in your `next.config.js`.\n\n##### RSC config moved to React renderer\n\nStorybook 7.6 introduced a new feature flag, `experimentalNextRSC`, to enable React Server Components in a Next.js project. It also introduced a parameter `nextjs.rsc` to selectively disable it on particular components or stories.\n\nThese flags have been renamed to `experimentalRSC` and `react.rsc`, respectively. This is a breaking change to accommodate RSC support in other, non-Next.js frameworks. For now, `@storybook/nextjs` is the only framework that supports it, and does so experimentally.\n\n#### Vue\n\n##### Require Vue 3 and up\n\nStarting in 8.0, Storybook requires Vue 3 and up.\n\n#### Angular\n\n##### Require Angular 15 and up\n\nStarting in 8.0, Storybook requires Angular 15 and up.\n\n#### Svelte\n\n##### Require Svelte 4 and up\n\nStarting in 8.0, Storybook requires Svelte 4 and up.\n\n#### Preact\n\n##### Require Preact 10 and up\n\nStarting in 8.0, Storybook requires Preact 10 and up.\n\n##### No longer adds default Babel plugins\n\nUntil now, Storybook provided a set of default Babel plugins that were applied to Preact projects using Webpack, including the runtime automatic import plugin to allow Preact's `h` pragma to render JSX. However, this is no longer the case in Storybook 8.0. If you want to use this plugin, or if you're going to use TypeScript with Preact, you will need to add it to your Babel config.\n\n```js\n.babelrc\n\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\n      // Add this to automatically import `h` from `preact` when needed\n      \"@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx\", {\n        \"importSource\": \"preact\",\n        \"runtime\": \"automatic\"\n      }\n    ],\n    // Add this if you want to use TypeScript with Preact\n    \"@babel/preset-typescript\"\n  ],\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to configure the plugins only for Storybook, you can add the same setting to your `.storybook/main.js` file.\n\n```js\nconst config = {\n  ...\n  babel: async (options) => {\n    options.plugins.push(\n      [\n        \"@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx\", {\n          \"importSource\": \"preact\",\n          \"runtime\": \"automatic\"\n        }\n      ],\n      \"@babel/preset-typescript\"\n    )\n    return options;\n  },\n}\n\nexport default config\n```\n\nWe are doing this to apply the same configuration you defined in your project. This streamlines the experience of using Storybook with Preact. Additionally, we are not vendor-locked to a specific Babel version anymore, which means that you can upgrade Babel without breaking your Storybook.\n\n#### Web Components\n\n##### Dropping default babel plugins in Webpack5-based projects\n\nUntil the 8.0 release, Storybook provided the `@babel/preset-env` preset for Web Component projects by default. This is no longer the case, as any Web Components project will use the configuration you've included. Additionally, if you're using either the `@babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import` or `@babel/plugin-syntax-import-meta` plugins, you no longer have to include them as they are now part of `@babel/preset-env`.\n\n### Deprecations which are now removed\n\n#### Removed `config` preset\n\nIn Storybook 7.0 we have deprecated the preset field `config` and it has been replaced with 'previewAnnotations'. The `config` preset is now completely removed in Storybook 8.0.\n\n```diff\n// .storybook/main.js\n\n// before\nconst config = {\n  framework: \"@storybook/your-framework\",\n- config: (entries) => [...entries, yourEntry],\n+ previewAnnotations: (entries) => [...entries, yourEntry],\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n#### Removed `passArgsFirst` option\n\nSince Storybook 6, we have had an option called `parameters.passArgsFirst` (default=`true`), which sallows you to pass the context to the story function first when set to `false.` We have removed this option. In Storybook 8.0, the args are always passed first, and as a second argument, the context is passed.\n\n```js\n// Storybook < 8\nexport default {\n  parameters: {\n    passArgsFirst: false,\n  },\n};\n\nexport const Button = (context) => <button {...args} />;\n\n// Storybook >= 8\nexport const Button = (args, context) => <button {...args} />;\n```\n\n#### Methods and properties from AddonStore\n\nThe following methods and properties from the class `AddonStore` in `@storybook/manager-api` are now removed:\n\n- `serverChannel` -> Use `channel` instead\n- `getServerChannel` -> Use `getChannel` instead\n- `setServerChannel` -> Use `setChannel` instead\n- `hasServerChannel` -> Use `hasChannel` instead\n- `addPanel`\n\nThe following methods and properties from the class `AddonStore` in `@storybook/preview-api` are now removed:\n\n- `serverChannel` -> Use `channel` instead\n- `getServerChannel` -> Use `getChannel` instead\n- `setServerChannel` -> Use `setChannel` instead\n- `hasServerChannel` -> Use `hasChannel` instead\n\n#### Methods and properties from PreviewAPI\n\nThe following exports from `@storybook/preview-api` are now removed:\n\n- `useSharedState`\n- `useAddonState`\n\nPlease file an issue if you need these APIs.\n\n#### Removals in @storybook/components\n\nThe `TooltipLinkList` UI component used to customize the Storybook toolbar has been updated to use the `icon` property instead of the `left` property to position its content. If you've enabled this property in your `globalTypes` configuration, addons, or any other place, you'll need to replace it with an `icon` property to mimic the same behavior. For example:\n\n```diff\n// .storybook/preview.js|ts\n// Replace your-framework with the framework you are using (e.g., react, vue3)\nimport { Preview } from '@storybook/your-framework';\n\nconst preview: Preview = {\n  globalTypes: {\n    locale: {\n      description: 'Internationalization locale',\n      defaultValue: 'en',\n      toolbar: {\n        icon: 'globe',\n        items: [\n          {\n            value: 'en',\n            right: '🇺🇸',\n-            left: '＄'\n+            icon: 'facehappy'\n            title: 'English'\n          },\n          { value: 'fr', right: '🇫🇷', title: 'Français' },\n          { value: 'es', right: '🇪🇸', title: 'Español' },\n          { value: 'zh', right: '🇨🇳', title: '中文' },\n          { value: 'kr', right: '🇰🇷', title: '한국어' },\n        ],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nexport default preview;\n```\n\nTo learn more about the available icons and their names, see the [Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/8.0/faq#what-icons-are-available-for-my-toolbar-or-my-addon).\n\n#### Removals in @storybook/types\n\nThe following exports from `@storybook/types` are now removed:\n\n- `API_ADDON` -> Use `Addon_Type` instead\n- `API_COLLECTION` -> Use `Addon_Collection` instead\n- `API_Panels`\n\n#### --use-npm flag in storybook CLI\n\nThe `--use-npm` is now removed. Use `--package-manager=npm` instead. [More info here](#cli-option---use-npm-deprecated).\n\n#### hideNoControlsWarning parameter from addon controls\n\nThe `hideNoControlsWarning` parameter is now removed. [More info here](#addon-controls-hidenocontrolswarning-parameter-is-deprecated).\n\n#### `setGlobalConfig` from `@storybook/react`\n\nThe `setGlobalConfig` (used for reusing stories in your tests) is now removed in favor of `setProjectAnnotations`.\n\n```ts\nimport { setProjectAnnotations } from `@storybook/react`.\n```\n\n#### StorybookViteConfig type from @storybook/builder-vite\n\nThe `StorybookViteConfig` type is now removed in favor of `StorybookConfig`:\n\n```ts\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from \"@storybook/react-vite\";\n```\n\n#### props from WithTooltipComponent from @storybook/components\n\nThe deprecated properties `tooltipShown`, `closeOnClick`, and `onVisibilityChange` of `WithTooltipComponent` from `@storybook/components` are now removed. Please replace them:\n\n```tsx\n<WithTooltip\n  closeOnClick // becomes closeOnOutsideClick\n  tooltipShown // becomes defaultVisible\n  onVisibilityChange // becomes onVisibleChange\n>\n  ...\n</WithTooltip>\n```\n\n#### LinkTo direct import from addon-links\n\nThe `LinkTo` (React component) direct import from `@storybook/addon-links` is now removed. You have to import it from `@storybook/addon-links/react` instead.\n\n```ts\n// before\nimport LinkTo from \"@storybook/addon-links\";\n\n// after\nimport LinkTo from \"@storybook/addon-links/react\";\n```\n\n#### DecoratorFn, Story, ComponentStory, ComponentStoryObj, ComponentStoryFn and ComponentMeta TypeScript types\n\nThe `Story` type is now removed in favor of `StoryFn` and `StoryObj`. More info [here](#story-type-deprecated).\n\nThe `DecoratorFn` type is now removed in favor of `Decorator`. [More info](#renamed-decoratorfn-to-decorator).\n\nFor React, the `ComponentStory`, `ComponentStoryObj`, `ComponentStoryFn` and `ComponentMeta` types are now removed in favor of `StoryFn`, `StoryObj` and `Meta`. [More info](#componentstory-componentstoryobj-componentstoryfn-and-componentmeta-types-are-deprecated).\n\n#### \"Framework\" TypeScript types\n\nThe Framework types such as `ReactFramework` are now removed in favor of Renderer types such as `ReactRenderer`. This affects all frameworks. [More info](#renamed-xframework-to-xrenderer).\n\n#### `navigateToSettingsPage` method from Storybook's manager-api\n\nThe `navigateToSettingsPage` method from manager-api is now removed in favor of `changeSettingsTab`.\n\n```ts\nexport const Component = () => {\n  const api = useStorybookApi();\n\n  const someHandler = () => {\n    // Old method: api.navigateToSettingsPage('/settings/about');\n    api.changeSettingsTab(\"about\"); // the /settings path is not necessary anymore\n  };\n\n  // ...\n};\n```\n\n#### storyIndexers\n\nThe Storybook's main.js configuration property `storyIndexers` is now removed in favor of `experimental_indexers`. [More info](#storyindexers-is-replaced-with-experimental_indexers).\n\n#### Deprecated docs parameters\n\nThe following story and meta parameters are now removed:\n\n```ts\nparameters.docs.iframeHeight; // becomes docs.story.iframeHeight\nparameters.docs.inlineStories; // becomes docs.story.inline\nparameters.jsx.transformSource; // becomes parameters.docs.source.transform\nparameters.docs.transformSource; // becomes parameters.docs.source.transform\nparameters.docs.source.transformSource; // becomes parameters.docs.source.transform\n```\n\nMore info [here](#autodocs-changes) and [here](#source-block).\n\n#### Description Doc block properties\n\n`children`, `markdown` and `type` are now removed in favor of the `of` property. [More info](#doc-blocks).\n\n#### Story Doc block properties\n\nThe `story` prop is now removed in favor of the `of` property. [More info](#doc-blocks).\n\nAdditionally, given that CSF in MDX is not supported anymore, the following props are also removed: `args`, `argTypes`, `decorators`, `loaders`, `name`, `parameters`, `play`, `render`, and `storyName`. [More info](#dropping-support-for-storiesmdx-csf-in-mdx-format-and-mdx1-support).\n\n#### Manager API expandAll and collapseAll methods\n\nThe `collapseAll` and `expandAll` APIs (possibly used by addons) are now removed. Please emit events for these actions instead:\n\n```ts\nimport {\n  STORIES_COLLAPSE_ALL,\n  STORIES_EXPAND_ALL,\n} from \"@storybook/core-events\";\nimport { useStorybookApi } from \"@storybook/manager-api\";\n\nconst api = useStorybookApi();\napi.collapseAll(); // becomes api.emit(STORIES_COLLAPSE_ALL)\napi.expandAll(); // becomes api.emit(STORIES_EXPAND_ALL)\n```\n\n#### `ArgsTable` Doc block removed\n\nThe `ArgsTable` doc block has been removed in favor of `ArgTypes` and `Controls`. [More info](#argstable-block).\n\nWith this removal we've reintroduced `subcomponents` support to `ArgTypes`, `Controls`, and autodocs. We've also undeprecated `subcomponents`, by popular demand.\n\n#### `Source` Doc block properties\n\n`id` and `ids` are now removed in favor of the `of` property. [More info](#doc-blocks).\n\n#### `Canvas` Doc block properties\n\nThe following properties were removed from the Canvas Doc block:\n\n- children\n- isColumn\n- columns\n- withSource\n- mdxSource\n\n[More info](#doc-blocks).\n\n#### `Primary` Doc block properties\n\nThe `name` prop is now removed in favor of the `of` property. [More info](#doc-blocks).\n\n#### `createChannel` from `@storybook/postmessage` and `@storybook/channel-websocket`\n\nThe `createChannel` APIs from both `@storybook/channel-websocket` and `@storybook/postmessage` are now removed. Please use `createBrowserChannel` instead, from the `@storybook/channels` package.\n\nAdditionally, the `PostmsgTransport` type is now removed in favor of `PostMessageTransport`.\n\n#### StoryStore and methods deprecated\n\nThe StoryStore (`__STORYBOOK_STORY_STORE__` and `__STORYBOOK_PREVIEW__.storyStore`) are deprecated, and will no longer be accessible in Storybook 9.0.\n\nIn particular, the following methods on the `StoryStore` are deprecated and will be removed in 9.0:\n\n- `store.fromId()` - please use `preview.loadStory({ storyId })` instead.\n- `store.raw()` - please use `preview.extract()` instead.\n\nNote that both these methods require initialization, so you should await `preview.ready()`.\n\n### Addon author changes\n\n#### Tab addons cannot manually route, Tool addons can filter their visibility via tabId\n\nThe TAB type addons now should no longer specify the `match` or `route` property.\n\nInstead storybook will automatically show the addon's rendered content when the query parameter `tab` is set to the addon's ID.\n\nExample:\n\n```tsx\nimport { addons, types } from \"@storybook/manager-api\";\n\naddons.register(\"my-addon\", () => {\n  addons.add(\"my-addon/tab\", {\n    type: types.TAB,\n    title: \"My Addon\",\n    render: () => <div>Hello World</div>,\n  });\n});\n```\n\nTool type addon will now receive the `tabId` property passed to their `match` function.\nThat way they can chose to show/hide their content based on the current tab.\n\nWhen the canvas is shown, the `tabId` will be set to `undefined`.\n\nExample:\n\n```tsx\nimport { addons, types } from \"@storybook/manager-api\";\n\naddons.register(\"my-addon\", () => {\n  addons.add(\"my-addon/tool\", {\n    type: types.TOOL,\n    title: \"My Addon\",\n    match: ({ tabId }) => tabId === \"my-addon/tab\",\n    render: () => <div>👀</div>,\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Removed `config` preset\n\nIn Storybook 7.0 we have deprecated the preset field `config` and it has been replaced with `previewAnnotations`. The `config` preset is now completely removed in Storybook 8.0.\n\n```diff\n// your-addon/preset.js\n\nmodule.exports = {\n-  config: (entries = []) => [...entries, ...yourEntry],\n+  previewAnnotations: (entries = []) => [...entries, ...yourEntry],\n};\n```\n\n## From version 7.5.0 to 7.6.0\n\n#### CommonJS with Vite is deprecated\n\nUsing CommonJS in the `main` configuration with `main.cjs` or `main.cts` is deprecated, and will be removed in Storybook 8.0. This is a necessary change because [Vite will remove support for CommonJS in an upcoming release](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/discussions/13928).\n\nYou can address this by converting your `main` configuration file to ESM syntax and renaming it to `main.mjs` or `main.mts` if your project does not have `\"type\": \"module\"` in its `package.json`. To convert the config file to ESM you will need to replace any CommonJS syntax like `require()`, `module.exports`, or `__dirname`. If you haven't already, you may also consider adding `\"type\": \"module\"` to your package.json and converting your project to ESM.\n\n#### Using implicit actions during rendering is deprecated\n\nIn Storybook 7, we inferred if the component accepts any action props,\nby checking if it starts with `onX` (for example `onClick`), or as configured by `actions.argTypesRegex`.\nIf that was the case, we would fill in jest spies for those args automatically.\n\n```ts\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n};\n\nexport const ButtonClick = {\n  play: async ({ args, canvasElement }) => {\n    await userEvent.click(within(canvasElement).getByRole(\"button\"));\n    // args.onClick is a jest spy in 7.0\n    await expect(args.onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIn Storybook 8 this feature will be removed, and spies have to added explicitly:\n\n```ts\nimport { fn } from \"@storybook/test\";\n\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n  args: {\n    onClick: fn(),\n  },\n};\n\nexport const ButtonClick = {\n  play: async ({ args, canvasElement }) => {\n    await userEvent.click(within(canvasElement).getByRole(\"button\"));\n    await expect(args.onClick).toHaveBeenCalled();\n  },\n};\n```\n\nFor more context, see this RFC:\nhttps://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/23649\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- This makes CSF files less magical and more portable, so that CSF files will render the same in a test environment where docgen is not available.\n- This allows users and (test) integrators to run or build storybook without docgen, boosting the user performance and allows tools to give quicker feedback.\n- This will make sure that we can one day lazy load docgen, without changing how stories are rendered.\n\n#### typescript.skipBabel deprecated\n\nWe will remove the `typescript.skipBabel` option in Storybook 8.0. Please use `typescript.skipCompiler` instead.\n\n#### Primary doc block accepts of prop\n\nThe `Primary` doc block now also accepts an `of` prop as described in the [Doc Blocks](#doc-blocks) section. It still accepts being passed `name` or no props at all.\n\n#### Addons no longer need a peer dependency on React\n\nHistorically the majority of addons have had a peer dependency on React and a handful of Storybook core packages. In most cases this has not been necessary since 7.0 because the Storybook manager makes those available on the global scope. It has created an unnecessary burden for users in non-React projects.\n\nWe've migrated all the core addons (except for `addon-docs`) to not depend on these packages by:\n\n1. Moving `react`, `react-dom` and the globalized Storybook packages from `peerDependencies` to `devDependencies`\n2. Added the list of globalized packages to the `externals` property in the `tsup` configuration, to ensure they are not part of the bundle.\n\nAs of Storybook 7.6.0 the list of globalized packages can be imported like this:\n\n```ts\n// tsup.config.ts\n\nimport { globalPackages as globalManagerPackages } from \"@storybook/manager/globals\";\nimport { globalPackages as globalPreviewPackages } from \"@storybook/preview/globals\";\n\nconst allGlobalPackages = [...globalManagerPackages, ...globalPreviewPackages];\n```\n\nWe recommend checking out [the updates we've made to the addon-kit](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-kit/pull/60/files#diff-8fed899bdbc24789a7bb4973574e624ed6207c6ce572338bc3c3e117672b2a20), that can serve as a base for the changes you can do in your own addon. These changes are not necessary for your addon to keep working, but they will remove the need for your users to unnecessary install `react` and `react-dom` to their projects, and they'll significantly reduce the install size of your addon.\nThese changes should not be breaking for your users, unless you support Storybook pre-v7.\n\n## From version 7.4.0 to 7.5.0\n\n#### `storyStoreV6` and `storiesOf` is deprecated\n\n`storyStoreV6` and `storiesOf` is deprecated and will be completely removed in Storybook 8.0.\n\nIf you're using `storiesOf` we recommend you migrate your stories to CSF3 for a better story writing experience.\nIn many cases you can get started with the migration by using two migration scripts:\n\n```bash\n\n# 1. convert storiesOf to CSF\nnpx storybook@latest migrate storiesof-to-csf --glob=\"**/*.stories.tsx\" --parser=tsx\n\n# 2. Convert CSF 2 to CSF 3\nnpx storybook@latest migrate csf-2-to-3 --glob=\"**/*.stories.tsx\" --parser=tsx\n```\n\nThey won't do a perfect migration so we recommend that you manually go through each file afterwards.\n\nAlternatively you can build your own `storiesOf` implementation by leveraging the new (experimental) indexer API ([documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/main-config-indexers), [migration](#storyindexers-is-replaced-with-experimental_indexers)). A proof of concept of such an implementation can be seen in [this StackBlitz demo](https://stackblitz.com/edit/github-h2rgfk?file=README.md). See the demo's `README.md` for a deeper explanation of the implementation.\n\n#### `storyIndexers` is replaced with `experimental_indexers`\n\nDefining custom indexers for stories has become a more official - yet still experimental - API which is now configured at `experimental_indexers` instead of `storyIndexers` in `main.ts`. `storyIndexers` has been deprecated and will be fully removed in version 8.0.\n\nThe new experimental indexers are documented [here](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/main-config-indexers). The most notable change from `storyIndexers` is that the indexer must now return a list of [`IndexInput`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/lib/types/src/modules/indexer.ts#L104-L148) instead of `CsfFile`. It's possible to construct an `IndexInput` from a `CsfFile` using the `CsfFile.indexInputs` getter.\n\nThat means you can convert an existing story indexer like this:\n\n```diff\n// .storybook/main.ts\n\nimport { readFileSync } from 'fs';\nimport { loadCsf } from '@storybook/csf-tools';\n\nexport default {\n-  storyIndexers = (indexers) => {\n-    const indexer = async (fileName, opts) => {\n+  experimental_indexers = (indexers) => {\n+    const createIndex = async (fileName, opts) => {\n      const code = readFileSync(fileName, { encoding: 'utf-8' });\n      const makeTitle = (userTitle) => {\n        // Do something with the auto title retrieved by Storybook\n        return userTitle;\n      };\n\n      // Parse the CSF file with makeTitle as a custom context\n-      return loadCsf(code, { ...compilationOptions, makeTitle, fileName }).parse();\n+      return loadCsf(code, { ...compilationOptions, makeTitle, fileName }).parse().indexInputs;\n    };\n\n    return [\n      {\n        test: /(stories|story)\\.[tj]sx?$/,\n-        indexer,\n+        createIndex,\n      },\n      ...(indexers || []),\n    ];\n  },\n};\n```\n\nAs an addon author you can support previous versions of Storybook by setting both `storyIndexers` and `indexers_experimental`, without triggering the deprecation warning.\n\n## From version 7.0.0 to 7.2.0\n\n#### Addon API is more type-strict\n\nWhen registering an addon using `@storybook/manager-api`, the addon API is now more type-strict. This means if you use TypeScript to compile your addon before publishing, it might start giving you errors.\n\nThe `type` property is now a required field, and the `id` property should not be set anymore.\n\nHere's a correct example:\n\n```tsx\nimport { addons, types } from \"@storybook/manager-api\";\n\naddons.register(\"my-addon\", () => {\n  addons.add(\"my-addon/panel\", {\n    type: types.PANEL,\n    title: \"My Addon\",\n    render: ({ active }) => (active ? <div>Hello World</div> : null),\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThe API: `addons.addPanel()` is now deprecated, and will be removed in 8.0. Please use `addons.add()` instead.\n\nThe `render` method can now be a `React.FunctionComponent` (without the `children` prop). Storybook will now render it, rather than calling it as a function.\n\n#### Addon-controls hideNoControlsWarning parameter is deprecated\n\nThe `hideNoControlsWarning` parameter is now unused and deprecated, given that the UI of the Controls addon changed in a way that does not display that message anymore.\n\n```ts\nexport const Primary = {\n  parameters: {\n    controls: { hideNoControlsWarning: true }, // this parameter is now unnecessary\n  },\n};\n```\n\n## From version 6.5.x to 7.0.0\n\nA number of these changes can be made automatically by the Storybook CLI. To take advantage of these \"automigrations\", run `npx storybook@7 upgrade` or `pnpx dlx storybook@7 upgrade`.\n\n### 7.0 breaking changes\n\n#### Dropped support for Node 15 and below\n\nStorybook 7.0 requires **Node 16** or above. If you are using an older version of Node, you will need to upgrade or keep using Storybook 6 in the meantime.\n\n#### Default export in Preview.js\n\nStorybook 7.0 supports a default export in `.storybook/preview.js` that should contain all of its annotations. The previous format is still compatible, but **the default export will be the recommended way going forward**.\n\nIf your `preview.js` file looks like this:\n\n```js\nexport const parameters = {\n  actions: { argTypesRegex: \"^on[A-Z].*\" },\n};\n```\n\nPlease migrate it to use a default export instead:\n\n```js\nconst preview = {\n  parameters: {\n    actions: { argTypesRegex: \"^on[A-Z].*\" },\n  },\n};\nexport default preview;\n```\n\nAdditionally, we introduced typings for that default export (Preview), so you can import it in your config file. If you're using Typescript, make sure to rename your file to be `preview.ts`.\n\nThe `Preview` type will come from the Storybook package for the **renderer** you are using. For example, if you are using Angular, you will import it from `@storybook/angular`, or if you're using Vue3, you will import it from `@storybook/vue3`:\n\n```ts\nimport { Preview } from \"@storybook/react\";\n\nconst preview: Preview = {\n  parameters: {\n    actions: { argTypesRegex: \"^on[A-Z].*\" },\n  },\n};\nexport default preview;\n```\n\nIn JavaScript projects using `preview.js`, it's also possible to use the `Preview` type (for autocompletion, not type safety), via the JSDoc @type tag:\n\n```js\n/** @type { import('@storybook/react').Preview } */\nconst preview = {\n  parameters: {\n    actions: { argTypesRegex: \"^on[A-Z].*\" },\n  },\n};\nexport default preview;\n```\n\n#### ESM format in Main.js\n\nIt's now possible to use ESM in `.storybook/main.js` out of the box. Storybook 7.0 supports a default export in `.storybook/main.js` that should contain all of its configurations. The previous format is still compatible, but **the default export will be the recommended way going forward**.\n\nIf your main.js file looks like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\n    \"../stories/**/*.stories.mdx\",\n    \"../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)\",\n  ],\n  framework: { name: \"@storybook/react-vite\" },\n};\n```\n\nOr like this:\n\n```js\nexport const stories = [\n  \"../stories/**/*.stories.mdx\",\n  \"../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)\",\n];\nexport const framework = { name: \"@storybook/react-vite\" };\n```\n\nPlease migrate it to use a default export instead:\n\n```js\nconst config = {\n  stories: [\n    \"../stories/**/*.stories.mdx\",\n    \"../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)\",\n  ],\n  framework: { name: \"@storybook/react-vite\" },\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n\nAdditionally, we introduced typings for that default export (StorybookConfig), so you can import it in your config file. If you're using Typescript, make sure to rename your file to be `main.ts`.\n\nThe `StorybookConfig` type will come from the Storybook package for the **framework** you are using, which relates to the package in the \"framework\" field you have in your main.ts file. For example, if you are using React Vite, you will import it from `@storybook/react-vite`:\n\n```ts\nimport { StorybookConfig } from \"@storybook/react-vite\";\n\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  stories: [\n    \"../stories/**/*.stories.mdx\",\n    \"../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)\",\n  ],\n  framework: { name: \"@storybook/react-vite\" },\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n\nIn JavaScript projects using `main.js`, it's also possible to use the `StorybookConfig` type (for autocompletion, not type safety), via the JSDoc @type tag:\n\n```ts\n/** @type { import('@storybook/react-vite').StorybookConfig } */\nconst config = {\n  stories: [\n    \"../stories/**/*.stories.mdx\",\n    \"../stories/**/*.stories.@(js|jsx|ts|tsx)\",\n  ],\n  framework: { name: \"@storybook/react-vite\" },\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n\n#### Modern browser support\n\nStarting in Storybook 7.0, Storybook will no longer support IE11, amongst other legacy browser versions.\nWe now transpile our code with a target of `chrome >= 100` and node code is transpiled with a target of `node >= 16`.\n\nThis means code-features such as (but not limited to) `async/await`, arrow-functions, `const`,`let`, etc will exist in the code at runtime, and thus the runtime environment must support it.\nNot just the runtime needs to support it, but some legacy loaders for Webpack or other transpilation tools might need to be updated as well. For example, certain versions of Webpack 4 had parsers that could not parse the new syntax (e.g. optional chaining).\n\nSome addons or libraries might depended on this legacy browser support, and thus might break. You might get an error like:\n\n```\nregeneratorRuntime is not defined\n```\n\nTo fix these errors, the addon will have to be re-released with a newer browser-target for transpilation. This often looks something like this (but it's dependent on the build system the addon uses):\n\n```js\n// babel.config.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  presets: [\n    [\n      \"@babel/preset-env\",\n      {\n        shippedProposals: true,\n        useBuiltIns: \"usage\",\n        corejs: \"3\",\n        modules: false,\n        targets: { chrome: \"100\" },\n      },\n    ],\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nHere's an example PR to one of the Storybook addons: https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-coverage/pull/3 doing just that.\n\n#### React peer dependencies required\n\n_Has automigration_\n\nStarting in 7.0, `react` and `react-dom` are now required peer dependencies of Storybook when using addon-docs (or docs via addon-essentials).\n\nStorybook uses `react` in a variety of docs-related packages. In the past, we've done various trickery hide this from non-React users. However, with stricter peer dependency handling by `npm8`, `npm`, and `yarn pnp` those tricks have started to cause problems for those users. Rather than resorting to even more complicated tricks, we are making `react` and `react-dom` required peer dependencies.\n\nTo upgrade manually, add any version of `react` and `react-dom` as devDependencies using your package manager of choice, e.g.\n\n```\nnpm add react react-dom --save-dev\n```\n\n#### start-storybook / build-storybook binaries removed\n\n_Has automigration_\n\nSB6.x framework packages shipped binaries called `start-storybook` and `build-storybook`.\n\nIn SB7.0, we've removed these binaries and replaced them with new commands in Storybook's CLI: `storybook dev` and `storybook build`. These commands will look for the `framework` field in your `.storybook/main.js` config--[which is now required](#framework-field-mandatory)--and use that to determine how to start/build your Storybook. The benefit of this change is that it is now possible to install multiple frameworks in a project without having to worry about hoisting issues.\n\nA typical Storybook project includes two scripts in your projects `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"storybook\": \"start-storybook <some flags>\",\n    \"build-storybook\": \"build-storybook <some flags>\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo convert this project to 7.0:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"storybook\": \"storybook dev <some flags>\",\n    \"build-storybook\": \"storybook build <some flags>\"\n  },\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"storybook\": \"next\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe new CLI commands remove the following flags:\n\n| flag     | migration                                                                                     |\n| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| --modern | No migration needed. [All ESM code is modern in SB7](#modern-esm--ie11-support-discontinued). |\n\n#### New Framework API\n\n_Has automigration_\n\nStorybook 7 introduces the concept of `frameworks`, which abstracts configuration for `renderers` (e.g. React, Vue), `builders` (e.g. Webpack, Vite) and defaults to make integrations easier. This requires quite a few changes, depending on what your project is using. **We recommend you to use the automigrations**, but in case the command fails or you'd like to do the changes manually, here's a guide:\n\n> Note:\n> All of the following changes can be done automatically either via `npx storybook@latest upgrade --prerelease` or via the `npx storybook@latest automigrate` command. It's highly recommended to use these commands, which will tell you exactly what to do.\n\n##### Available framework packages\n\nIn 7.0, `frameworks` combine a `renderer` and a `builder`, with the exception of a few packages that do not contain multiple builders, such as `@storybook/angular`, which only has Webpack 5 support.\n\nYou have to pick which framework you want to use from the list below, which will depend on your project configuration. If you're using a framework that has multiple builders, you'll have to pick one. For example, if you're using `@storybook/react`, you'll have to pick between `@storybook/react-vite` and `@storybook/react-webpack5`. If you're using a framework that only has one builder (and therefore hasn't changed), you can just use that.\n\nAdditionally, there are framework packages which are specific to meta-frameworks, like Next.js and SvelteKit. If you pick them, make sure to also see [this section]().\n\nThe current list of frameworks include:\n\n- `@storybook/angular` (did not change)\n- `@storybook/ember` (did not change)\n- `@storybook/html-vite`\n- `@storybook/html-webpack5`\n- `@storybook/preact-vite`\n- `@storybook/preact-webpack5`\n- `@storybook/react-vite`\n- `@storybook/react-webpack5`\n- `@storybook/nextjs`\n- `@storybook/server-webpack5`\n- `@storybook/svelte-vite`\n- `@storybook/svelte-webpack5`\n- `@storybook/sveltekit`\n- `@storybook/vue-vite`\n- `@storybook/vue-webpack5`\n- `@storybook/vue3-vite`\n- `@storybook/vue3-webpack5`\n- `@storybook/web-components-vite`\n- `@storybook/web-components-webpack5`\n\nYou can find more info on the rationale here: [Frameworks RFC](https://chromatic-ui.notion.site/Frameworks-RFC-89f8aafe3f0941ceb4c24683859ed65c).\n\n**After picking your framework, you'll need to install it as a dev dependency.**\n\nBecause the new framework package will include the builder as well, you can remove any of the builder packages you were using before:\n\n```js\n'@storybook/builder-webpack5',\n'@storybook/manager-webpack5',\n'@storybook/builder-webpack4',\n'@storybook/manager-webpack4',\n'@storybook/builder-vite',\n'storybook-builder-vite',\n```\n\n> Note:\n> if your project is still using Webpack 4, you'll have to upgrade to Webpack 5 as [Webpack 4 support was discontinued](#webpack4-support-discontinued)\n\n##### Framework field mandatory\n\nIn 6.4 we introduced a new `main.js` field called [`framework`](#mainjs-framework-field). Starting in 7.0, the `main.js` file has to include a `framework` field and it should be of the package you picked in earlier steps.\n\nHere's an example, in case you picked `@storybook/react-vite`:\n\n```js\n// .storybook/main.js\nexport default {\n  // ... your configuration\n  framework: {\n    name: \"@storybook/react-vite\",\n    options: {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\n##### frameworkOptions renamed\n\nIn 7.0, the `main.js` fields `reactOptions` and `angularOptions` have been renamed. They are now options on the `framework` field.\n\nFor React, what used to be:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  reactOptions: { fastRefresh: true },\n  framework: {\n    name: \"@storybook/react-webpack5\",\n    options: {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\nBecomes:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  framework: {\n    name: \"@storybook/react-webpack5\",\n    options: { fastRefresh: true },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nFor Angular, what used to be:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  angularOptions: { enableIvy: true },\n  framework: {\n    name: \"@storybook/angular\",\n    options: {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\nBecomes:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  framework: {\n    name: \"@storybook/angular\",\n    options: { enableIvy: true },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n##### builderOptions renamed\n\nIn 7.0, the `main.js` fields `core.builder` are now removed, in favor of the new frameworks api. The builder is defined as part of the framework package you pick, e.g. `@storybook/vue3-vite`. If you had options for your builder, they are now options on the `framework.builder` field.\n\nWhat used to be:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  core: {\n    builder: {\n      name: 'webpack5',\n      options: { lazyCompilation: true }\n    },\n  }\n  framework: {\n    name: '@storybook/react-webpack5',\n    options: {},\n  },\n};\n```\n\nBecomes:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  framework: {\n    name: \"@storybook/react-webpack5\",\n    options: {\n      builder: { lazyCompilation: true },\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n> Note:\n> If after making this change, your `main.js` `core` field is empty, just delete it.\n\n#### TypeScript: StorybookConfig type moved\n\nIf you are using TypeScript you should import the `StorybookConfig` type from your framework package.\n\nFor example:\n\n```ts\nimport type { StorybookConfig } from \"@storybook/react-vite\";\nconst config: StorybookConfig = {\n  framework: {\n    name: \"@storybook/react-vite\",\n    options: {},\n  },\n  // ... your configuration\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n\n#### Titles are statically computed\n\nUp until version 7.0, it was possible to generate the default export of a CSF story by calling a function, or mixing in variables defined in other ES Modules. For instance:\n\n```js\n// Dynamically computed local title\nconst categories = {\n  atoms: 'Atoms',\n  molecules: 'Molecules',\n  // etc.\n}\n\nexport default {\n  title: `${categories.atoms}/MyComponent`\n}\n\n// Title returned by a function\nimport { genDefault } from '../utils/storybook'\n\nexport default genDefault({\n  category: 'Atoms',\n  title: 'MyComponent',\n})\n```\n\nThis is no longer possible in Storybook 7.0, as story titles are parsed at build time. In earlier versions, titles were mostly produced manually. Now that [CSF3 auto-title](#csf3-auto-title-improvements) is available, optimisations were made that constrain how `id` and `title` can be defined manually.\n\nAs a result, titles cannot depend on variables or functions, and cannot be dynamically computed (even with local variables). Stories must have a static `title` property, or a static `component` property used by the [CSF3 auto-title](#csf3-auto-title-improvements) feature to compute a title.\n\nLikewise, the `id` property must be statically defined. The URL defined for a story in the sidebar will be statically computed, so if you dynamically add an `id` through a function call like above, the story URL will not match the one in the sidebar and the story will be unreachable.\n\nTo opt-out of the old behavior you can set the `storyStoreV7` feature flag to `false` in `main.js`. However, a variety of performance optimizations depend on the new behavior, and the old behavior is deprecated and will be removed from Storybook in 8.0.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  features: {\n    storyStoreV7: false,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n#### Framework standalone build moved\n\nIn 7.0 the location of the standalone node API has moved to `@storybook/core-server`.\n\nIf you used the React standalone API, for example, you might have written:\n\n```js\nconst buildStandalone = require(\"@storybook/react/standalone\");\nconst options = {};\nbuildStandalone(options).then(() => console.log(\"done\"));\n```\n\nIn 7.0, you would now use:\n\n```js\nconst { build } = require(\"@storybook/core-server\");\nconst options = {};\nbuild(options).then(() => console.log(\"done\"));\n```\n\n#### Change of root html IDs\n\nThe root ID unto which Storybook renders stories is renamed from `root` to `#storybook-root` to avoid conflicts with user's code.\n\n#### Stories glob matches MDX files\n\nIf you used a directory based stories glob, in 6.x it would match `.stories.js` (and other JS extensions) and `.stories.mdx` files. For instance:\n\n```js\n// in main.js\nexport default {\n  stories: ['../path/to/directory']\n};\n\n// or\nexport default {\n  stories: [{ directory: '../path/to/directory' }]\n};\n```\n\nIn 7.0, this pattern will also match `.mdx` files (the new extension for docs files - see docs changes below). If you have `.mdx` files you don't want to appear in your storybook, either move them out of the directory, or add a `files` specifier with the old pattern (`\"**/*.stories.@(mdx|tsx|ts|jsx|js)\"`):\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  stories: [\n    {\n      directory: \"../path/to/directory\",\n      files: \"**/*.stories.@(mdx|tsx|ts|jsx|js)\",\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n#### Add strict mode\n\nStarting in 7.0, Storybook's build tools add [`\"use strict\"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) to the compiled JS output.\n\nIf user code in `.storybook/preview.js` or stories relies on \"sloppy\" mode behavior, it will need to be updated. As a workaround, it is sometimes possible to move the sloppy mode code inside a script tag in `.storybook/preview-head.html`.\n\n#### Importing plain markdown files with `transcludeMarkdown` has changed\n\nThe `transcludeMarkdown` option in `addon-docs` have been removed, and the automatic handling of `.md` files in Vite projects have also been disabled.\n\nInstead `.md` files can be imported as plain strings by adding the `?raw` suffix to the import, and then passed to the new `Markdown` block. In an MDX file that would look like this:\n\n```\nimport { Markdown } from '@storybook/blocks';\nimport ReadMe from './README.md?raw';\n\n...\n\n<Markdown>{ReadMe}</Markdown>\n\n```\n\n#### Stories field in .storybook/main.js is mandatory\n\nIn 6.x, the `stories` key field in `.storybook/main.js` was optional. In 7.0, it is mandatory.\nPlease follow up the [Configure your Storybook project](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/#configure-your-storybook-project) section to configure your Storybook project.\n\n#### Stricter global types\n\nIn 6.x, you could declare and use [`globals`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/toolbars-and-globals) without declaring their corresponding `globalTypes`. We've made this more strict in 7.0, so that the `globalTypes` declaration is required, and undeclared globals will be ignored.\n\n#### Deploying build artifacts\n\nStarting with 7.x, we are using modern [ECMAScript Modules (ESM)](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html).\n\nThose end up as `.mjs` files in your static Storybook artifact and need to be served as `application/javascript`, indicated by the `Content-Type` HTTP header.\n\nFor a simple HTTP server to view a Storybook build, you can run `npx http-server storybook-static`.\n\nNote that [using the serve package](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/faq#i-see-a-no-preview-error-with-a-storybook-production-build) will not work.\n\n##### Dropped support for file URLs\n\nIn 6.x it was possible to open a Storybook build from the file system.\n\nESM requires loading over HTTP(S), which is incompatible with the browser's CORS settings for `file://` URLs.\n\nSo you now need to use a web server as described above.\n\n##### Serving with nginx\n\nWith [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/), you need to extend [the MIME type handling](https://github.com/nginx/nginx/blob/master/conf/mime.types) in your configuration:\n\n```\n    include mime.types;\n    types {\n        application/javascript mjs;\n    }\n```\n\nIt would otherwise default to serving the `.mjs` files as `application/octet-stream`.\n\n##### Ignore story files from node_modules\n\nIn 6.x Storybook literally followed the glob patterns specified in your `.storybook/main.js` `stories` field. Storybook 7.0 ignores files from `node_modules` unless your glob pattern includes the string `\"node_modules\"`.\n\nGiven the following `main.js`:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  stories: [\"../**/*.stories.*\"],\n};\n```\n\nIf you want to restore the previous behavior to include `node_modules`, you can update it to:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  stories: [\"../**/*.stories.*\", \"../**/node_modules/**/*.stories.*\"],\n};\n```\n\nThe first glob would have node_modules automatically excluded by Storybook, and the second glob would include all stories that are under a nested `node_modules` directory.\n\n### 7.0 Core changes\n\n#### 7.0 feature flags removed\n\nStorybook uses temporary feature flags to opt-in to future breaking changes or opt-in to legacy behaviors. For example:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  features: {\n    emotionAlias: false,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIn 7.0 we've removed the following feature flags:\n\n| flag                | migration instructions                                      |\n| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `emotionAlias`      | This flag is no longer needed and should be deleted.        |\n| `breakingChangesV7` | This flag is no longer needed and should be deleted.        |\n| `previewCsfV3`      | This flag is no longer needed and should be deleted.        |\n| `babelModeV7`       | See [Babel mode v7 exclusively](#babel-mode-v7-exclusively) |\n\n#### Story context is prepared before for supporting fine grained updates\n\nThis change modifies the way Storybook prepares stories to avoid reactive args to get lost for fine-grained updates JS frameworks as `SolidJS` or `Vue`. That's because those frameworks handle args/props as proxies behind the scenes to make reactivity work. So when `argType` mapping was done in `prepareStory` the Proxies were destroyed and args becomes a plain object again, losing the reactivity.\n\nFor avoiding that, this change passes the mapped args instead of raw args at `renderToCanvas` so that the proxies stay intact. Also decorators will benefit from this as well by receiving mapped args instead of raw args.\n\n#### Changed decorator order between preview.js and addons/frameworks\n\nIn Storybook 7.0 we have changed the order of decorators being applied to allow you to access context information added by decorators defined in addons/frameworks from decorators defined in `preview.js`. To revert the order to the previous behavior, you can set the `features.legacyDecoratorFileOrder` flag to `true` in your `main.js` file:\n\n```js\n// main.js\nexport default {\n  features: {\n    legacyDecoratorFileOrder: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n#### Dark mode detection\n\nStorybook 7 uses `prefers-color-scheme` to detects your system's dark mode preference if a theme is not set.\n\nEarlier versions used the light theme by default, so if you don't set a theme and your system's settings are in dark mode, this could surprise you.\n\nTo learn more about theming, read our [documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/theming).\n\n#### `addons.setConfig` should now be imported from `@storybook/manager-api`.\n\nThe previous package, `@storybook/addons`, is now deprecated and will be removed in 8.0.\n\n```diff\n- import { addons } from '@storybook/addons';\n+ import { addons } from '@storybook/manager-api';\n\naddons.setConfig({\n  // ...\n})\n```\n\n### 7.0 core addons changes\n\n#### Removed auto injection of @storybook/addon-actions decorator\n\nThe `withActions` decorator is no longer automatically added to stories. This is because it is really only used in the html renderer, for all other renderers it's redundant.\nIf you are using the html renderer and use the `handles` parameter, you'll need to manually add the `withActions` decorator:\n\n```diff\nimport globalThis from 'global';\n+import { withActions } from '@storybook/addon-actions/decorator';\n\nexport default {\n  component: globalThis.Components.Button,\n  args: {\n    label: 'Click Me!',\n  },\n  parameters: {\n    chromatic: { disable: true },\n  },\n};\nexport const Basic = {\n  parameters: {\n    handles: [{ click: 'clicked', contextmenu: 'right clicked' }],\n  },\n+  decorators: [withActions],\n};\n```\n\n#### Addon-backgrounds: Removed deprecated grid parameter\n\nStarting in 7.0 the `grid.cellSize` parameter should now be `backgrounds.grid.cellSize`. This was [deprecated in SB 6.1](#deprecated-grid-parameter).\n\n#### Addon-a11y: Removed deprecated withA11y decorator\n\nWe removed the deprecated `withA11y` decorator. This was [deprecated in 6.0](#removed-witha11y-decorator)\n\n#### Addon-interactions: Interactions debugger is now default\n\nThe interactions debugger in the panel is now displayed by default. The feature flag is now removed.\n\n```js\n// .storybook/main.js\n\nconst config = {\n  features: {\n    interactionsDebugger: true, // This should be removed!\n  },\n};\nexport default config;\n```\n\n### 7.0 Vite changes\n\n#### Vite builder uses Vite config automatically\n\nWhen using a [Vite-based framework](#framework-field-mandatory), Storybook will automatically use your `vite.config.(ctm)js` config file starting in 7.0.\nSome settings will be overridden by Storybook so that it can function properly, and the merged settings can be modified using `viteFinal` in `.storybook/main.js` (see the [Storybook Vite configuration docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/builders/vite#configuration)).\nIf you were using `viteFinal` in 6.5 to simply merge in your project's standard Vite config, you can now remove it.\n\nFor Svelte projects this means that the `svelteOptions` property in the `main.js` config should be omitted, as it will be loaded automatically via the project's `vite.config.js`.\n\n#### Vite cache moved to node_modules/.cache/.vite-storybook\n\nPreviously, Storybook's Vite builder placed cache files in node_modules/.vite-storybook. However, it's more common for tools to place cached files into `node_modules/.cache`, and putting them there makes it quick and easy to clear the cache for multiple tools at once. We don't expect this change will cause any problems, but it's something that users of Storybook Vite projects should know about. It can be configured by setting `cacheDir` in `viteFinal` within `.storybook/main.js` [Storybook Vite configuration docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/builders/vite#configuration)).\n\n### 7.0 Webpack changes\n\n#### Webpack4 support discontinued\n\nSB7.0 no longer supports Webpack4.\n\nDepending on your project specifics, it might be possible to run your Storybook using the webpack5 builder without error.\n\nIf you are running into errors, you can upgrade your project to Webpack5 or you can try debugging those errors.\n\nTo upgrade:\n\n- If you're configuring Webpack directly, see the Webpack5 [release announcement](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/) and [migration guide](https://webpack.js.org/migrate/5).\n- If you're using Create React App, see the [migration notes](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#migrating-from-40x-to-500) to upgrade from V4 (Webpack4) to 5\n\nDuring the 7.0 dev cycle we will be updating this section with useful resources as we run across them.\n\n#### Babel mode v7 exclusively\n\n_Has automigration_\n\nStorybook now uses [Babel mode v7](#babel-mode-v7) exclusively. In 6.x, Storybook provided its own babel settings out of the box. Now, Storybook's uses your project's babel settings (`.babelrc`, `babel.config.js`, etc.) instead.\n\n> Note:\n> If you are using @storybook/react-webpack5 with the @storybook/preset-create-react-app package, you don't need to do anything. The preset already provides the babel configuration you need.\n\nIn the new mode, Storybook expects you to provide a configuration file. Depending on the complexity your project, Storybook will fail to run without a babel configuration. If you want a configuration file that's equivalent to the 6.x default, you can run the following command in your project directory:\n\n```sh\nnpx storybook@latest babelrc\n```\n\nThis command will create a `.babelrc.json` file in your project, containing a few babel plugins which will be installed as dev dependencies.\n\n#### Postcss removed\n\nStorybook 6.x installed postcss by default. In 7.0 built-in support has been removed for Webpack-based frameworks. If you need it, you can add it back using [`@storybook/addon-postcss`](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-postcss).\n\n#### Removed DLL flags\n\nEarlier versions of Storybook used Webpack DLLs as a performance crutch. In 6.1, we've removed Storybook's built-in DLLs and have deprecated the command-line parameters `--no-dll` and `--ui-dll`. In 7.0 those options are removed.\n\n### 7.0 Framework-specific changes\n\n#### Angular: Removed deprecated `component` and `propsMeta` field\n\nThe deprecated fields `component` and `propsMeta` on the NgStory type have been removed.\n\n#### Angular: Drop support for Angular < 14\n\nStarting in 7.0, we drop support for Angular < 14\n\n#### Angular: Drop support for calling Storybook directly\n\n_Has automigration_\n\nIn Storybook 6.4 we deprecated calling Storybook directly (e.g. `npm run storybook`) for Angular. In Storybook 7.0, we've removed it entirely. Instead, you have to set up the Storybook builder in your `angular.json` and execute `ng run <your-project>:storybook` to start Storybook.\n\nYou can run `npx storybook@next automigrate` to automatically fix your configuration, or visit https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/code/frameworks/angular/README.md#how-do-i-migrate-to-an-angular-storybook-builder for instructions on how to set up Storybook for Angular manually.\n\n#### Angular: Application providers and ModuleWithProviders\n\nIn Storybook 7.0 we use the new bootstrapApplication API to bootstrap a standalone component to the DOM. The component is configured in a way to respect your configured imports, declarations and schemas, which you can define via the `moduleMetadata` decorator imported from `@storybook/angular`.\n\nThis means also, that there is no root ngModule anymore. Previously you were able to add ModuleWithProviders, likely the result of a 'Module.forRoot()'-style call, to your 'imports' array of the moduleMetadata definition. This is now discouraged. Instead, you should use the `applicationConfig` decorator to add your application-wide providers. These providers will be passed to the bootstrapApplication function.\n\nFor example, if you want to configure BrowserAnimationModule in your stories, please extract the necessary providers the following way and provide them via the `applicationConfig` decorator:\n\n```js\nimport { BrowserAnimationsModule } from \"@angular/platform-browser/animations\";\nimport { importProvidersFrom } from \"@angular/core\";\nimport { applicationConfig, Meta, StoryObj } from \"@storybook/angular\";\nimport { ExampleComponent } from \"./example.component\";\n\nconst meta: Meta = {\n  title: \"Example\",\n  component: ExampleComponent,\n  decorators: [\n    // Define application-wide providers with the applicationConfig decorator\n    applicationConfig({\n      providers: [\n        importProvidersFrom(BrowserAnimationsModule),\n        // Extract all providers (and nested ones) from a ModuleWithProviders\n        importProvidersFrom(SomeOtherModule.forRoot()),\n      ],\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n\nexport default meta;\n\ntype Story = StoryObj<typeof ExampleComponent>;\n\nexport const Default: Story = {\n  render: () => ({\n    // Define application-wide providers directly in the render function\n    applicationConfig: {\n      providers: [importProvidersFrom(BrowserAnimationsModule)],\n    },\n  }),\n};\n```\n\nYou can also use the `provide-style` decorator to provide an application-wide service:\n\n```js\nimport { provideAnimations } from \"@angular/platform-browser/animations\";\nimport { moduleMetadata } from \"@storybook/angular\";\n\nexport default {\n  title: \"Example\",\n  decorators: [\n    applicationConfig({\n      providers: [provideAnimations()],\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nPlease visit https://angular.io/guide/standalone-components#configuring-dependency-injection for more information.\n\n#### Angular: Removed legacy renderer\n\nThe `parameters.angularLegacyRendering` option is removed. You cannot use the old legacy renderer anymore.\n\n#### Angular: Initializer functions\n\nInitializer functions using the `APP_INITIALIZER` dependency injection token only run when the component renders. To ensure an initializer function is always executed, you can adjust your `.storybook/preview.ts` and invoke it directly.\n\n```js\nmyCustomInitializer();\nexport default preview;\n```\n\n#### Next.js: use the `@storybook/nextjs` framework\n\nIn Storybook 7.0 we introduced a convenient package that provides an out of the box experience for Next.js projects: `@storybook/nextjs`. Please see the [following resource](./code/frameworks/nextjs/README.md#getting-started) to get started with it.\n\n#### SvelteKit: needs the `@storybook/sveltekit` framework\n\nIn Storybook 7.0 we introduced a convenient package that provides an out of the box experience for SvelteKit projects: `@storybook/sveltekit`. Please see the [following resource](./code/frameworks/sveltekit/README.md#getting-started) to get started with it.\n\nFor existing users, SvelteKit projects need to use the `@storybook/sveltekit` framework in the `main.js` file. Previously it was enough to just setup Storybook with Svelte+Vite, but that is no longer the case.\n\n```js\n// .storybook/main.js\nexport default {\n  framework: \"@storybook/sveltekit\",\n};\n```\n\nAlso see the note in [Vite builder uses Vite config automatically](#vite-builder-uses-vite-config-automatically) about removing `svelteOptions`.\n\n#### Vue3: replaced app export with setup\n\nIn 6.x `@storybook/vue3` exported a Vue application instance called `app`. In 7.0, this has been replaced by a `setup` function that can be used to initialize the application in your `.storybook/preview.js`:\n\nBefore:\n\n```js\nimport { app } from \"@storybook/vue3\";\nimport Button from \"./Button.vue\";\n\napp.component(\"GlobalButton\", Button);\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```js\nimport { setup } from \"@storybook/vue3\";\nimport Button from \"./Button.vue\";\n\nsetup((app) => {\n  app.component(\"GlobalButton\", Button);\n});\n```\n\n#### Web-components: dropped lit-html v1 support\n\nIn v6.x `@storybook/web-components` had a peer dependency on `lit-html` v1 or v2. In 7.0 we've dropped support for `lit-html` v1 and now uses `lit` v2 instead. Please upgrade your project's `lit-html` dependency if you're still on 1.x.\n\n#### Create React App: dropped CRA4 support\n\nSince v7 [drops webpack4 support](#webpack4-support-discontinued), it no longer supports Create React App < 5.0. If you're using an earlier version of CRA, please upgrade or stay on Storybook 6.x.\n\n#### HTML: No longer auto-dedents source code\n\nThe `@storybook/html` renderer doesn't dedent the source code when displayed in the \"Show Code\" source viewer any more.\n\nYou can get the same result by setting [the parameter `parameters.docs.source.format = \"dedent\"`](https://storybook.js.org/docs/7.0/html/api/doc-block-source#format) either on a story level or globally in `preview.js`.\n\n### 7.0 Addon authors changes\n\n#### New Addons API\n\nStorybook 7 adds 2 new packages for addon authors to use: `@storybook/preview-api` and `@storybook/manager-api`.\nThese 2 packages replace `@storybook/addons`.\n\nWhen adding addons to storybook, you can (for example) add panels:\n\n```js\nimport { addons } from \"@storybook/manager-api\";\n\naddons.addPanel(\"my-panel\", {\n  title: \"My Panel\",\n  render: ({ active, key }) => <div>My Panel</div>,\n});\n```\n\nNote that this before would import `addons` from `@storybook/addons`, but now it imports `{ addons }` from `@storybook/manager-api`.\nThe `addons` export is now a named export only, there's no default export anymore, so make sure to update this usage.\n\nThe package `@storybook/addons` is still available, but it's only for backwards compatibility. It's not recommended to use it anymore.\n\nIt's also been used by addon creators to gain access to a few APIs like `makeDecorator`.\nThese APIs are now available in `@storybook/preview-api`.\n\nStorybook users have had access to a few storybook-lifecycle hooks such as `useChannel`, `useParameter`, `useStorybookState`;\nwhen these hooks are used in panels, they should be imported from `@storybook/manager-api`.\nWhen these hooks are used in decorators/stories, they should be imported from `@storybook/preview-api`.\n\nStorybook 7 includes `@storybook/addons` shim package that provides the old API and calls the new API under the hood.\nThis backwards compatibility will be removed in a future release of storybook.\n\nHere's an example of using the new API:\nThe `@storybook/preview-api` is used here, because the `useEffect` hook is used in a decorator.\n\n```js\nimport { useEffect, makeDecorator } from \"@storybook/preview-api\";\n\nexport const withMyAddon = makeDecorator({\n  name: \"withMyAddon\",\n  parameterName: \"myAddon\",\n  wrapper: (getStory) => {\n    useEffect(() => {\n      // do something with the options\n    }, []);\n    return getStory(context);\n  },\n});\n```\n\n##### Specific instructions for addon creators\n\nIf you're an addon creator, you'll have to update your addon to use the new APIs.\n\nThat means you'll have to release a breaking release of your addon to make it compatible with Storybook 7.\nIt should no longer depend on `@storybook/addons`, but instead on `@storybook/preview-api` and/or `@storybook/manager-api`.\n\nYou might also depend (and use) these packages in your addon's decorators: `@storybook/store`, `@storybook/preview-web`, `@storybook/core-client`, `@storybook/client-api`; these have all been consolidated into `@storybook/preview-api`.\nSo if you use any of these packages, please import what you need from `@storybook/preview-api` instead.\n\nStorybook 7 will prepare manager-code for the browser using ESbuild (before it was using a combination of webpack + babel).\nThis is a very important change, though it will not affect most addons.\nIt means that when creating custom addons, particularly custom addons within the repo in which they are consumed,\nyou will need to be aware that this code is not passed though babel, and thus will not use your babel config.\nThis can result in errors if you are using experimental JS features in your addon code, not supported yet by ESbuild,\nor using babel dependent features such as Component selectors in Emotion.\n\nESbuild also places some constraints on things you can import into your addon's manager code: only woff2 files are supported, and not all image file types are supported.\nHere's the [list](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/builders/builder-manager/src/index.ts#L53-L70) of supported file types.\n\nThis is not configurable.\n\nIf this is a problem for your addon, you need to pre-compile your addon's manager code to ensure it works.\n\nIf you addon also introduces preview code (such a decorators) it will be passed though whatever builder + config the user has configured for their project; this hasn't changed.\n\nIn both the preview and manager code it's good to remember [Storybook now targets modern browser only](#modern-browser-support).\n\nThe package `@storybook/components` contain a lot of components useful for building addons.\nSome of these addons have been moved to a new package `@storybook/blocks`.\nThese components were moved: `ColorControl`, `ColorPalette`, `ArgsTable`, `ArgRow`, `TabbedArgsTable`, `SectionRow`, `Source`, `Code`.\n\n##### Specific instructions for addon users\n\nAll of storybook's core addons have been updated and are ready to use with Storybook 7.\n\nWe're working with the community to update the most popular addons.\nBut if you're using an addon that hasn't been updated yet, it might not work.\n\nIt's possible for example for older addons to use APIs that are no longer available in Storybook 7.\nYour addon might not show upside of the storybook (manager) UI, or storybook might fail to start entirely.\n\nWhen this happens to you please open an issue on the addon's repo, and ask the addon author to update their addon to be compatible with Storybook 7.\nIt's also useful for the storybook team to know which addons are not yet compatible, so please open an issue on the storybook repo as well; particularly if the addon is popular and causes a critical failure.\n\nHere's a list of popular addons that are known not to be compatible with Storybook 7 yet:\n\n- [ ] [storybook-addon-jsx](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-jsx)\n- [ ] [storybook-addon-dark-mode](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/storybook-dark-mode)\n\nThough storybook should de-duplicate storybook packages, storybook CLI's `upgrade` command will warn you when you have multiple storybook-dependencies, because it is a possibility that this causes addons/storybook to not work, so when running into issues, please run this:\n\n```\nnpx sb upgrade\n```\n\n#### register.js removed\n\nIn SB 6.x and earlier, addons exported a `register.js` entry point by convention, and users would import this in `.storybook/manager.js`. This was [deprecated in SB 6.5](#deprecated-registerjs)\n\nIn 7.0, most of Storybook's addons now export a `manager.js` entry point, which is automatically registered in Storybook's manager when the addon is listed in `.storybook/main.js`'s `addons` field.\n\nIf your `.manager.js` config references `register.js` of any of the following addons, you can remove it: `a11y`, `actions`, `backgrounds`, `controls`, `interactions`, `jest`, `links`, `measure`, `outline`, `toolbars`, `viewport`.\n\n#### No more default export from `@storybook/addons`\n\nThe default export from `@storybook/addons` has been removed. Please use the named exports instead:\n\n```js\nimport { addons } from \"@storybook/addons\";\n```\n\nThe named export has been available since 6.0 or earlier, so your updated code will be backwards-compatible with older versions of Storybook.\n\n#### No more configuration for manager\n\nThe Storybook manager is no longer built with Webpack. Now it's built with esbuild.\nTherefore, it's no longer possible to configure the manager. Esbuild comes preconfigured to handle importing CSS, and images.\n\nIf you're currently loading files other than CSS or images into the manager, you'll need to make changes so the files get converted to JS before publishing your addon.\n\nThis means the preset value `managerWebpack` is no longer respected, and should be removed from presets and `main.js` files.\n\nAddons that run in the manager can depend on `react` and `@storybook/*` packages directly. They do not need to be peerDependencies.\nBut very importantly, the build system ensures there will only be 1 version of these packages at runtime. The version will come from the `@storybook/ui` package, and not from the addon.\nFor this reason it's recommended to have these dependencies as `devDependencies` in your addon's `package.json`.\n\nThe full list of packages that Storybook's manager bundler makes available for addons is here: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/lib/ui/src/globals/types.ts\n\nAddons in the manager will no longer be bundled together anymore, which means that if 1 fails, it doesn't break the whole manager.\nEach addon is imported into the manager as an ESM module that's bundled separately.\n\n#### Icons API changed\n\nFor addon authors who use the `Icons` component, its API has been updated in Storybook 7.\n\n```diff\nexport interface IconsProps extends ComponentProps<typeof Svg> {\n-  icon?: IconKey;\n-  symbol?: IconKey;\n+  icon: IconType;\n+  useSymbol?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nFull change here: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/18809\n\n#### Removed global client APIs\n\nThe `addParameters` and `addDecorator` APIs to add global decorators and parameters, exported by the various frameworks (e.g. `@storybook/react`) and `@storybook/client` were deprecated in 6.0 and have been removed in 7.0.\n\nInstead, use `export const parameters = {};` and `export const decorators = [];` in your `.storybook/preview.js`. Addon authors similarly should use such an export in a preview entry file (see [Preview entries](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/docs/addons/writing-presets.md#preview-entries)).\n\n#### framework parameter renamed to renderer\n\nAll SB6.x frameworks injected a parameter called `framework` indicating to addons which framework is running.\nFor example, the framework value of `@storybook/react` would be `react`, `@storybook/vue` would be `vue`, etc.\nNow those packages are called renderers in SB7, so the renderer information is now available in the `renderer`\nparameter.\n\n### 7.0 Docs changes\n\nThe information hierarchy of docs in Storybook has changed in 7.0. The main difference is that each docs is listed in the sidebar as a separate entry underneath the component, rather than attached to individual stories. You can also opt-in to a Autodocs entry rather than having one for every component (previously stories).\n\nWe've also modernized the API for all the doc blocks (the MDX components you use to write custom docs pages), which we'll describe below.\n\n#### Autodocs changes\n\nIn 7.0, rather than rendering each story in \"docs view mode\", Autodocs (formerly known as \"Docs Page\") operates by adding additional sidebar entries for each component. By default it uses the same template as was used in 6.x, and the entries are entitled `Docs`.\n\nYou can configure Autodocs in `main.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  docs: {\n    autodocs: true, // see below for alternatives\n    defaultName: \"Docs\", // set to change the name of generated docs entries\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIf you are migrating from 6.x your `docs.autodocs` option will have been set to `true`, which has the effect of enabling docs page for _every_ CSF file. However, as of 7.0, the new default is `'tag'`, which requires opting into Autodocs per-CSF file, with the `autodocs` **tag** on your component export:\n\n```ts\nexport default {\n  component: MyComponent\n  // Tags are a new feature coming in 7.1, that we are using to drive this behaviour.\n  tags: ['autodocs']\n}\n```\n\nYou can also set `autodocs: false` to opt-out of Autodocs entirely. Further configuration of Autodocs is described below.\n\n**Parameter changes**\n\nWe've renamed many of the parameters that control docs rendering for consistency with the blocks (see below). The old parameters are now deprecated and will be removed in 8.0. Here is a full list of changes:\n\n- `docs.inlineStories` has been renamed `docs.story.inline`\n- `docs.iframeHeight` has been renamed `docs.story.iframeHeight`\n- `notes` and `info` are no longer supported, instead use `docs.description.story | component`\n\n#### MDX docs files\n\nPreviously `.stories.mdx` files were used to both define and document stories. In 7.0, we have deprecated defining stories in MDX files, and consequently have changed the suffix to simply `.mdx`. Our default `stories` glob in `main.js` will now match such files -- if you want to write MDX files that do not appear in Storybook, you may need to adjust the glob accordingly.\n\nIf you were using `.stories.mdx` files to write stories, we encourage you to move the stories to a CSF file, and _attach_ an `.mdx` file to that CSF file to document them. You can use the `Meta` block to attach a MDX file to a CSF file, and the `Story` block to render the stories:\n\n```mdx\nimport { Meta, Story } from \"@storybook/blocks\";\nimport * as ComponentStories from \"./some-component.stories\";\n\n<Meta of={ComponentStories} />\n\n<Story of={ComponentStories.Primary} />\n```\n\n(Note the `of` prop is only supported if you change your MDX files to plain `.mdx`, it's not supported in `.stories.mdx` files)\n\nYou can create as many docs entries as you like for a given component. By default the docs entry will be named the same as the `.mdx` file (e.g. `Introduction.mdx` becomes `Introduction`). If the docs file is named the same as the component (e.g. `Button.mdx`, it will use the default autodocs name (`\"Docs\"`) and override autodocs).\n\nBy default docs entries are listed first for the component. You can sort them using story sorting.\n\n#### Unattached docs files\n\nIn Storybook 6.x, to create a unattached docs MDX file (that is, one not attached to story or a CSF file), you'd have to create a `.stories.mdx` file, and describe its location with the `Meta` doc block:\n\n```mdx\nimport { Meta } from \"@storybook/addon-docs\";\n\n<Meta title=\"Introduction\" />\n```\n\nIn 7.0, things are a little simpler -- you should call the file `.mdx` (drop the `.stories`). This will mean behind the scenes there is no story attached to this entry. You may also drop the `title` and use autotitle (and leave the `Meta` component out entirely, potentially).\n\n#### Doc Blocks\n\nAdditionally to changing the docs information architecture, we've updated the API of the doc blocks themselves to be more consistent and future proof.\n\n**General changes**\n\n- Each block now uses `of={}` as a primary API -- where the argument to the `of` prop is a CSF or story _export_. The `of` prop is only supported in plain `.mdx` files and not `.stories.mdx` files.\n\n- When you've attached to a CSF file (with the `Meta` block, or in Autodocs), you can drop the `of` and the block will reference the first story or the CSF file as a whole.\n\n- Most other props controlling rendering of blocks now correspond precisely to the parameters for that block [defined for autodocs above](#autodocs-changes).\n\n##### Meta block\n\nThe primary change of the `Meta` block is the ability to attach to CSF files with `<Meta of={}>` as described above.\n\n##### Description block, `parameters.notes` and `parameters.info`\n\nIn 6.5 the Description doc block accepted a range of different props, `markdown`, `type` and `children` as a way to customize the content.\nThe props have been simplified and the block now only accepts an `of` prop, which can be a reference to either a CSF file, a default export (meta) or a story export, depending on which description you want to be shown. See TDB DOCS LINK for a deeper explanation of the new prop.\n\n`parameters.notes` and `parameters.info` have been deprecated as a way to specify descriptions. Instead use JSDoc comments above the default export or story export, or use `parameters.docs.description.story | component` directly. See TDB DOCS LINK for a deeper explanation on how to write descriptions.\n\nIf you were previously using the `Description` block to render plain markdown in your docs, that behavior can now be achieved with the new `Markdown` block instead like this:\n\n```\nimport { Markdown } from '@storybook/blocks';\nimport ReadMe from './README.md?raw';\n\n...\n\n<Markdown>{ReadMe}</Markdown>\n\n```\n\nNotice the `?raw` suffix in the markdown import is needed for this to work.\n\n##### Story block\n\nTo reference a story in a MDX file, you should reference it with `of`:\n\n```mdx\nimport { Meta, Story } from \"@storybook/blocks\";\nimport * as ComponentStories from \"./some-component.stories\";\n\n<Meta of={ComponentStories} />\n\n<Story of={ComponentStories.standard} />\n```\n\nYou can also reference a story from a different component:\n\n```mdx\nimport { Meta, Story } from \"@storybook/blocks\";\nimport * as ComponentStories from \"./some-component.stories\";\nimport * as SecondComponentStories from \"./second-component.stories\";\n\n<Meta of={ComponentStories} />\n\n<Story of={SecondComponentStories.standard} meta={SecondComponentStories} />\n```\n\nReferencing stories by `id=\"xyz--abc\"` is deprecated and should be replaced with `of={}` as above.\n\n##### Source block\n\nThe source block now references a single story, the component, or a CSF file itself via the `of={}` parameter.\n\nReferencing stories by `id=\"xyz--abc\"` is deprecated and should be replaced with `of={}` as above. Referencing multiple stories via `ids={[\"xyz--abc\"]}` is now deprecated and should be avoided (instead use two source blocks).\n\nThe parameter to transform the source has been consolidated from the multiple parameters of `parameters.docs.transformSource`, `parameters.docs.source.transformSource`, and `parameters.jsx.transformSource` to the single `parameters.docs.source.transform`. The behavior is otherwise unchanged.\n\n##### Canvas block\n\nThe Canvas block follows the same changes as [the Story block described above](#story-block).\n\nPreviously the Canvas block accepted children (Story blocks) as a way to reference stories. That has now been replaced with the `of={}` prop that accepts a reference to _a story_.\nThat also means the Canvas block no longer supports containing multiple stories or elements, and thus the props related to that - `isColumn` and `columns` - have also been deprecated.\n\n- To pass props to the inner Story block use the `story={{ }}` prop\n- Similarly, to pass props to the inner Source block use the `source={{ }}` prop.\n- The `mdxSource` prop has been deprecated in favor of using `source={{ code: '...' }}`\n- The `withSource` prop has been renamed to `sourceState`\n\nHere's a full example of the new API:\n\n```mdx\nimport { Meta, Canvas } from \"@storybook/blocks\";\nimport * as ComponentStories from \"./some-component.stories\";\n\n<Meta of={ComponentStories} />\n\n<Canvas\n  of={ComponentStories.standard}\n  story={{\n    inline: false,\n    height: '200px'\n  }}\n  source={{\n    language: 'html',\n    code: 'custom code...'\n  }}\n  withToolbar={true}\n  additionalActions={[...]}\n  layout=\"fullscreen\"\n  className=\"custom-class\"\n/>\n```\n\n##### ArgsTable block\n\nThe `ArgsTable` block is now deprecated, and two new blocks: `ArgTypes` and `Controls` should be preferred.\n\n- `<ArgTypes of={storyExports OR metaExports OR component} />` will render a readonly table of args/props descriptions for a story, CSF file or component. If `of` omitted and the MDX file is attached it will render the arg types defined at the CSF file level.\n\n- `<Controls of={storyExports} />` will render the controls for a story (or the primary story if `of` is omitted and the MDX file is attached).\n\nThe following props are not supported in the new blocks:\n\n- `components` - to render more than one component in a single table\n- `showComponent` to show the component's props as well as the story's args\n- the `subcomponents` annotation to show more components on the table.\n- `of=\"^\"` to reference the meta (just omit `of` in that case, for `ArgTypes`).\n- `story=\"^\"` to reference the primary story (just omit `of` in that case, for `Controls`).\n- `story=\".\"` to reference the current story (this no longer makes sense in Docs 2).\n- `story=\"name\"` to reference a story (use `of={}`).\n\n#### Configuring Autodocs\n\nAs in 6.x, you can override the docs container to configure docs further. This is the container that each docs entry is rendered inside:\n\n```js\n// in preview.js\n\nexport const parameters = {\n  docs: {\n    container: // your container\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote that the container must be implemented as a _React component_.\n\nYou likely want to use the `DocsContainer` component exported by `@storybook/blocks` and consider the following examples:\n\n**Overriding theme**:\n\nTo override the theme, you can continue to use the `docs.theme` parameter.\n\n**Overriding MDX components**\n\nIf you want to override the MDX components supplied to your docs page, use the `MDXProvider` from `@mdx-js/react`:\n\n```js\nimport { MDXProvider } from \"@mdx-js/react\";\nimport { DocsContainer } from \"@storybook/blocks\";\nimport * as DesignSystem from \"your-design-system\";\n\nexport const MyDocsContainer = (props) => (\n  <MDXProvider\n    components={{\n      h1: DesignSystem.H1,\n      h2: DesignSystem.H2,\n    }}\n  >\n    <DocsContainer {...props} />\n  </MDXProvider>\n);\n```\n\n**_NOTE_**: due to breaking changes in MDX2, such override will _only_ apply to elements you create via the MDX syntax, not pure HTML -- ie. `## content` not `<h2>content</h2>`.\n\n#### MDX2 upgrade\n\nStorybook 7 Docs uses MDXv2 instead of MDXv1. This means an improved syntax, support for inline JS expression, and improved performance among [other benefits](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/).\n\nIf you use `.stories.mdx` files in your project, you'll probably need to edit them since MDX2 contains [breaking changes](https://mdxjs.com/migrating/v2/#update-mdx-files). In general, MDX2 is stricter and more structured than MDX1.\n\nWe've provided an automigration, `mdx1to2` that makes a few of these changes automatically. For example, `mdx1to2` automatically converts MDX1-style HTML comments into MDX2-style JSX comments to save you time.\n\nUnfortunately, the set of changes from MDX1 to MDX2 is vast, and many changes are subtle, so the bulk of the migration will be manual. You can use the [MDX Playground](https://mdxjs.com/playground/) to try out snippets interactively.\n\n#### Legacy MDX1 support\n\nIf you get stuck with the [MDX2 upgrade](#mdx2-upgrade), we also provide opt-in legacy MDX1 support. This is intended as a temporary solution while you upgrade your Storybook; MDX1 will be discontinued in Storybook 8.0. The MDX1 library is no longer maintained and installing it results in `npm audit` security warnings.\n\nTo process your `.stories.mdx` files with MDX1, first install the `@storybook/mdx1-csf` package in your project:\n\n```\nyarn add -D @storybook/mdx1-csf@latest\n```\n\nThen enable the `legacyMdx1` feature flag in your `.storybook/main.js` file:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  features: {\n    legacyMdx1: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nNOTE: This only affects `.(stories|story).mdx` files. Notably, if you want to use Storybook 7's \"pure\" `.mdx` format, you'll need to use MDX2 for that.\n\n#### Default docs styles will leak into non-story user components\n\nStorybook's default styles in docs are now globally applied to any element instead of using classes. This means that any component that you add directly in a docs file will also get the default styles.\n\nTo mitigate this you need to wrap any content you don't want styled with the `Unstyled` block like this:\n\n```mdx\nimport { Unstyled } from \"@storybook/blocks\";\nimport { MyComponent } from \"./MyComponent\";\n\n# This is a header\n\n<Unstyled>\n  <MyComponent />\n</Unstyled>\n```\n\nComponents that are part of your stories or in a canvas will not need this mitigation, as the `Story` and `Canvas` blocks already have this built-in.\n\n#### Explicit `<code>` elements are no longer syntax highlighted\n\nDue to how MDX2 works differently from MDX1, manually defined `<code>` elements are no longer transformed to the `Code` component, so it will not be syntax highlighted. This is not the case for markdown \\`\\`\\` code-fences, that will still end up as `Code` with syntax highlighting.\n\nLuckily [MDX2 supports markdown (like code-fences) inside elements better now](https://mdxjs.com/blog/v2/#improvements-to-the-mdx-format), so most cases where you needed a `<code>` element before, you can use code-fences instead:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n````md\n<code>This will now be an unstyled line of code</code>\n\n```js\nconst a = 'This is still a styled code block.';\n```\n\n<div style={{ background: 'red', padding: '10px' }}>\n  ```js\n  const a = 'MDX2 supports markdown in elements better now, so this is possible.';\n  ```\n</div>\n````\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n#### Dropped source loader / storiesOf static snippets\n\nIn SB 6.x, Storybook Docs used a Webpack loader called `source-loader` to help display static code snippets. This was configurable using the `options.sourceLoaderOptions` field.\n\nIn SB 7.0, we've moved to a faster, simpler alternative called `csf-plugin` that **only supports CSF**. It is configurable using the `options.csfPluginOptions` field.\n\nIf you're using `storiesOf` and want to restore the previous behavior, you can add `source-loader` by hand to your Webpack config using the following snippet in `main.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  webpackFinal: (config) => {\n    config.module.rules.push({\n      test: /\\.stories\\.[tj]sx?$/,\n      use: [\n        {\n          loader: require.resolve(\"@storybook/source-loader\"),\n          options: {} /* your sourceLoaderOptions here */,\n        },\n      ],\n      enforce: \"pre\",\n    });\n    return config;\n  },\n};\n```\n\n#### Removed docs.getContainer and getPage parameters\n\nIt is no longer possible to set `parameters.docs.getContainer()` and `getPage()`. Instead use `parameters.docs.container` or `parameters.docs.page` directly.\n\n#### Addon-docs: Removed deprecated blocks.js entry\n\nRemoved `@storybook/addon-docs/blocks` entry. Import directly from `@storybook/blocks` instead. This was [deprecated in SB 6.3](#deprecated-scoped-blocks-imports).\n\n#### Dropped addon-docs manual babel configuration\n\nAddon-docs previously accepted `configureJsx` and `mdxBabelOptions` options, which allowed full customization of the babel options used to process markdown and mdx files. This has been simplified in 7.0, with a new option, `jsxOptions`, which can be used to customize the behavior of `@babel/preset-react`.\n\n#### Dropped addon-docs manual configuration\n\nStorybook Docs 5.x shipped with instructions for how to manually configure Webpack and Storybook without the use of Storybook's \"presets\" feature. Over time, these docs went out of sync. Now in Storybook 7 we have removed support for manual configuration entirely.\n\n#### Autoplay in docs\n\nRunning play functions in docs is generally tricky, as they can steal focus and cause the window to scroll. Consequently, we've disabled play functions in docs by default.\n\nIf your story depends on a play function to render correctly, _and_ you are confident the function autoplaying won't mess up your docs, you can set `parameters.docs.autoplay = true` to have it auto play.\n\n#### Removed STORYBOOK_REACT_CLASSES global\n\nThis was a legacy global variable from the early days of react docgen. If you were using this variable, you can instead use docgen information which is added directly to components using `.__docgenInfo`.\n\n### 7.0 Deprecations and default changes\n\n#### storyStoreV7 enabled by default\n\nSB6.4 introduced [Story Store V7](#story-store-v7), an optimization which allows code splitting for faster build and load times. This was an experimental, opt-in change and you can read more about it in [the migration notes below](#story-store-v7). TLDR: you can't use the legacy `storiesOf` API or dynamic titles in CSF.\n\nNow in 7.0, Story Store V7 is the default. You can opt-out of it by setting the feature flag in `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  features: {\n    storyStoreV7: false,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nDuring the 7.0 dev cycle we will be preparing recommendations and utilities to make it easier for `storiesOf` users to upgrade.\n\n#### `Story` type deprecated\n\n_Has codemod_\n\nIn 6.x you were able to do this:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Story } from \"@storybook/react\";\n\nexport const MyStory: Story = () => <div />;\n```\n\nHowever with the introduction of CSF3, the `Story` type has been deprecated in favor of two other types: `StoryFn` for CSF2 and `StoryObj` for CSF3.\n\n```ts\nimport type { StoryFn, StoryObj } from \"@storybook/react\";\n\nexport const MyCsf2Story: StoryFn = () => <div />;\nexport const MyCsf3Story: StoryObj = {\n  render: () => <div />,\n};\n```\n\nThis change is part of our move to CSF3, which uses objects instead of functions to represent stories.\nYou can read more about the CSF3 format here: https://storybook.js.org/blog/component-story-format-3-0/\n\nWe have set up a codemod that attempts to automatically migrate your code for you (update the glob to suit your needs):\n\n```\nnpx storybook@next migrate upgrade-deprecated-types --glob=\"**/*.stories.tsx\"\n```\n\n#### `ComponentStory`, `ComponentStoryObj`, `ComponentStoryFn` and `ComponentMeta` types are deprecated\n\n_Has codemod_\n\nThe type of `StoryObj` and `StoryFn` have been changed in 7.0 so that both the \"component\" as \"the props of the component\" will be accepted as the generic parameter. You can now replace the types:\n\n```\nComponentStory -> StoryFn (CSF2) or StoryObj (CSF3)\nComponentStoryObj -> StoryObj\nComponentStoryFn -> StoryFn\nComponentMeta -> Meta\n```\n\nHere are a few examples:\n\n```ts\nimport type { StoryFn, StoryObj } from \"@storybook/react\";\nimport { Button, ButtonProps } from \"./Button\";\n\n// This works in 7.0, making the ComponentX types redundant.\nconst meta: Meta<typeof Button> = { component: Button };\n\nexport const CSF3Story: StoryObj<typeof Button> = { args: { label: \"Label\" } };\n\nexport const CSF2Story: StoryFn<typeof Button> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;\nCSF2Story.args = { label: \"Label\" };\n\n// Passing props directly still works as well.\nconst meta: Meta<ButtonProps> = { component: Button };\n\nexport const CSF3Story: StoryObj<ButtonProps> = { args: { label: \"Label\" } };\n\nexport const CSF2Story: StoryFn<ButtonProps> = (args) => <Button {...args} />;\nCSF2Story.args = { label: \"Label\" };\n```\n\nWe have set up a codemod that attempts to automatically migrate your code for you (update the glob to suit your needs):\n\n```\nnpx storybook@next migrate upgrade-deprecated-types --glob=\"**/*.stories.tsx\"\n```\n\n#### Renamed `renderToDOM` to `renderToCanvas`\n\nThe \"rendering\" function that renderers (ex-frameworks) must export (`renderToDOM`) has been renamed to `renderToCanvas` to acknowledge that some consumers of frameworks/the preview do not work with DOM elements.\n\n#### Renamed `XFramework` to `XRenderer`\n\nIn 6.x you could import XFramework types:\n\n```ts\nimport type { ReactFramework } from \"@storybook/react\";\nimport type { VueFramework } from \"@storybook/vue\";\nimport type { SvelteFramework } from \"@storybook/svelte\";\n\n// etc.\n```\n\nThose are deprecated in 7.0 as they are renamed to:\n\n```ts\nimport type { ReactRenderer } from \"@storybook/react\";\nimport type { VueRenderer } from \"@storybook/vue\";\nimport type { SvelteRenderer } from \"@storybook/svelte\";\n\n// etc.\n```\n\n#### Renamed `DecoratorFn` to `Decorator`\n\nIn 6.x you could import the type `DecoratorFn`:\n\n```ts\nimport type { DecoratorFn } from \"@storybook/react\";\n```\n\nThis type is deprecated in 7.0, instead you can use the type `Decorator`, which is now available for all renderers:\n\n```ts\nimport type { Decorator } from \"@storybook/react\";\n// or\nimport type { Decorator } from \"@storybook/vue\";\n// or\nimport type { Decorator } from \"@storybook/svelte\";\n// etc.\n```\n\nThe type `Decorator` accepts a generic parameter `TArgs`. This can be used like this:\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Decorator } from \"@storybook/react\";\nimport { LocaleProvider } from \"./locale\";\n\nconst withLocale: Decorator<{ locale: \"en\" | \"es\" }> = (Story, { args }) => (\n  <LocaleProvider lang={args.locale}>\n    <Story />\n  </LocaleProvider>\n);\n```\n\nIf you want to use `Decorator` in a backwards compatible way to `DecoratorFn`, you can use:\n\n```tsx\nimport type { Args, Decorator } from '@storybook/react';\n\n// Decorator<Args> behaves the same as DecoratorFn (without generic)\nconst withLocale: Decorator<Args> = (Story, { args }) => // args has type { [name: string]: any }\n```\n\n#### CLI option `--use-npm` deprecated\n\nWith increased support for more package managers (pnpm), we have introduced the `--package-manager` CLI option. Please use `--package-manager=npm` to force NPM to be used to install dependencies when running Storybook CLI commands. Other valid options are `pnpm`, `yarn1`, and `yarn2` (`yarn2` is for versions 2 and higher).\n\n#### 'config' preset entry replaced with 'previewAnnotations'\n\nThe preset field `'config'` has been replaced with `'previewAnnotations'`. `'config'` is now deprecated and will be removed in Storybook 8.0.\n\nAdditionally, the internal field `'previewEntries'` has been removed. If you need a preview entry, just use a `'previewAnnotations'` file and don't export anything.\n\n## From version 6.4.x to 6.5.0\n\n### Vue 3 upgrade\n\nStorybook 6.5 supports Vue 3 out of the box when you install it fresh. However, if you're upgrading your project from a previous version, you'll need to [follow the steps for opting-in to webpack 5](#webpack-5).\n\n### React18 new root API\n\nReact 18 introduces a [new root API](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide.html#updates-to-client-rendering-apis). Starting in 6.5, Storybook for React will auto-detect your react version and use the new root API automatically if you're on React18.\n\nIf you wish to opt out of the new root API, set the `reactOptions.legacyRootApi` flag in your `.storybook/main.js` config:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  reactOptions: { legacyRootApi: true },\n};\n```\n\n### Renamed isToolshown to showToolbar\n\nStorybook's [manager API](docs/addons/addons-api.md) has deprecated the `isToolshown` option (to show/hide the toolbar) and renamed it to `showToolbar` for consistency with other similar UI options.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\n// .storybook/manager.js\nimport { addons } from \"@storybook/addons\";\n\naddons.setConfig({\n  showToolbar: false,\n});\n```\n\n### Dropped support for addon-actions addDecorators\n\nPrior to SB6.5, `addon-actions` provided an option called `addDecorators`. In SB6.5, decorators are applied always. This is technically a breaking change, so if this affects you please file an issue in Github and we can consider reverting this in a patch release.\n\n### Vite builder renamed\n\nSB6.5 renames Storybook's [Vite builder](https://github.com/storybookjs/builder-vite) from `storybook-builder-vite` to `@storybook/builder-vite`. This move is part of a larger effort to improve Vite support in Storybook.\n\nStorybook's `automigrate` command can migrate for you. To manually migrate:\n\n1. Remove `storybook-builder-vite` from your `package.json` dependencies\n2. Install `@storybook/builder-vite`\n3. Update your `core.builder` setting in `.storybook/main.js` to `@storybook/builder-vite`.\n\n### Docs framework refactor for React\n\nSB6.5 moves framework specializations (e.g. ArgType inference, dynamic snippet rendering) out of `@storybook/addon-docs` and into the specific framework packages to which they apply (e.g. `@storybook/react`).\n\nThis change should not require any specific migrations on your part if you are using the docs addon as described in the documentation. However, if you are using `react-docgen` or `react-docgen-typescript` information in some custom way outside of `addon-docs`, you should be aware of this change.\n\nIn SB6.4, `@storybook/react` added `react-docgen` to its babel settings and `react-docgen-typescript` to its Webpack settings. In SB6.5, this only happens if you are using `addon-docs` or `addon-controls`, either directly or indirectly through `addon-essentials`. If you're not using either of those addons, but require that information for some other addon, please configure that manually in your `.storybook/main.js` configuration. You can see the docs configuration here: https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/presets/react-webpack/src/framework-preset-react-docs.ts\n\n### Opt-in MDX2 support\n\nSB6.5 adds experimental opt-in support for MDXv2. To install:\n\n```sh\nyarn add @storybook/mdx2-csf -D\n```\n\nThen add the `previewMdx2` feature flag to your `.storybook/main.js` config:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  features: {\n    previewMdx2: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### CSF3 auto-title improvements\n\nSB 6.4 introduced experimental \"auto-title\", in which a story's location in the sidebar (aka `title`) can be automatically inferred from its location on disk. For example, the file `atoms/Button.stories.js` might result in the title `Atoms/Button`.\n\nWe've made two improvements to Auto-title based on user feedback:\n\n- Auto-title preserves filename case\n- Auto-title removes redundant filenames from the path\n\n#### Auto-title filename case\n\nSB 6.4's implementation of auto-title ran `startCase` on each path component. For example, the file `atoms/MyButton` would be transformed to `Atoms/My Button`.\n\nWe've changed this in SB 6.5 to preserve the filename case, so that instead it the same file would result in the title `atoms/MyButton`. The rationale is that this gives more control to users about what their auto-title will be.\n\nThis might be considered a breaking change. However, we feel justified to release this in 6.5 because:\n\n1. We consider it a bug in the initial auto-title implementation\n2. CSF3 and the auto-title feature are experimental, and we reserve the right to make breaking changes outside of semver (tho we try to avoid it)\n\nIf you want to restore the old titles in the UI, you can customize your sidebar with the following code snippet in `.storybook/manager.js`:\n\n```js\nimport { addons } from \"@storybook/addons\";\nimport startCase from \"lodash/startCase\";\n\naddons.setConfig({\n  sidebar: {\n    renderLabel: ({ name, type }) =>\n      type === \"story\" ? name : startCase(name),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n#### Auto-title redundant filename\n\nThe heuristic failed in the common scenario in which each component gets its own directory, e.g. `atoms/Button/Button.stories.js`, which would result in the redundant title `Atoms/Button/Button`. Alternatively, `atoms/Button/index.stories.js` would result in `Atoms/Button/Index`.\n\nTo address this problem, 6.5 introduces a new heuristic to removes the filename if it matches the directory name or `index`. So `atoms/Button/Button.stories.js` and `atoms/Button/index.stories.js` would both result in the title `Atoms/Button` (or `atoms/Button` if `autoTitleFilenameCase` is set, see above).\n\nSince CSF3 is experimental, we are introducing this technically breaking change in a minor release. If you desire the old structure, you can manually specify the title in file. For example:\n\n```js\n// atoms/Button/Button.stories.js\nexport default { title: \"Atoms/Button/Button\" };\n```\n\n#### Auto-title always prefixes\n\nWhen the user provides a `prefix` in their `main.js` `stories` field, it now prefixes all titles to matching stories, whereas in 6.4 and earlier it only prefixed auto-titles.\n\nConsider the following example:\n\n```js\n// main.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [{ directory: '../src', titlePrefix: 'Custom' }]\n}\n\n// ../src/NoTitle.stories.js\nexport default { component: Foo };\n\n// ../src/Title.stories.js\nexport default { component: Bar, title: 'Bar' }\n```\n\nIn 6.4, the final titles would be:\n\n- `NoTitle.stories.js` => `Custom/NoTitle`\n- `Title.stories.js` => `Bar`\n\nIn 6.5, the final titles would be:\n\n- `NoTitle.stories.js` => `Custom/NoTitle`\n- `Title.stories.js` => `Custom/Bar`\n\n<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->\n\n### 6.5 Deprecations\n\n#### Deprecated register.js\n\nIn ancient versions of Storybook, addons were registered by referring to `addon-name/register.js`. This is going away in SB7.0. Instead you should just add `addon-name` to the `addons` array in `.storybook/main.js`.\n\nBefore:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = { addons: [\"my-addon/register.js\"] };\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = { addons: [\"my-addon\"] };\n```\n\n## From version 6.3.x to 6.4.0\n\n### Automigrate\n\nAutomigrate is a new 6.4 feature that provides zero-config upgrades to your dependencies, configurations, and story files.\n\nEach automigration analyzes your project, and if it's is applicable, propose a change alongside relevant documentation. If you accept the changes, the automigration will update your files accordingly.\n\nFor example, if you're in a webpack5 project but still use Storybook's default webpack4 builder, the automigration can detect this and propose an upgrade. If you opt-in, it will install the webpack5 builder and update your `main.js` configuration automatically.\n\nYou can run the existing suite of automigrations to see which ones apply to your project. This won't update any files unless you accept the changes:\n\n```\n\nnpx sb@latest automigrate\n\n```\n\nThe automigration suite also runs when you create a new project (`sb init`) or when you update Storybook (`sb upgrade`).\n\n### CRA5 upgrade\n\nStorybook 6.3 supports CRA5 out of the box when you install it fresh. However, if you're upgrading your project from a previous version, you'll need to upgrade the configuration. You can do this automatically by running:\n\n```\n\nnpx sb@latest automigrate\n\n```\n\nOr you can do the following steps manually to force Storybook to use Webpack 5 for building your project:\n\n```shell\nyarn add @storybook/builder-webpack5 @storybook/manager-webpack5 --dev\n# Or\nnpm install @storybook/builder-webpack5 @storybook/manager-webpack5 --save-dev\n```\n\nThen edit your `.storybook/main.js` config:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  core: {\n    builder: \"webpack5\",\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### CSF3 enabled\n\nSB6.3 introduced a feature flag, `features.previewCsfV3`, to opt-in to experimental [CSF3 syntax support](https://storybook.js.org/blog/component-story-format-3-0/). In SB6.4, CSF3 is supported regardless of `previewCsfV3`'s value. This should be a fully backwards-compatible change. The `previewCsfV3` flag has been deprecated and will be removed in SB7.0.\n\n#### Optional titles\n\nIn SB6.3 and earlier, component titles were required in CSF default exports. Starting in 6.4, they are optional.\nIf you don't specify a component file, it will be inferred from the file's location on disk.\n\nConsider a project configuration `/path/to/project/.storybook/main.js` containing:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = { stories: [\"../src/**/*.stories.*\"] };\n```\n\nAnd the file `/path/to/project/src/components/Button.stories.tsx` containing the default export:\n\n```js\nimport { Button } from \"./Button\";\nexport default { component: Button };\n// named exports...\n```\n\nThe inferred title of this file will be `components/Button` based on the stories glob in the configuration file.\nWe will provide more documentation soon on how to configure this.\n\n#### String literal titles\n\nStarting in 6.4 CSF component [titles are optional](#optional-titles). However, if you do specify titles, title handing is becoming more strict in V7 and is limited to string literals.\n\nEarlier versions of Storybook supported story titles that are dynamic Javascript expressions\n\n```js\n// ✅ string literals 6.3 OK / 7.0 OK\nexport default {\n  title: 'Components/Atoms/Button',\n};\n\n// ✅ undefined 6.3 OK / 7.0 OK\nexport default {\n  component: Button,\n};\n\n// ❌ expressions: 6.3 OK / 7.0 KO\nexport default {\n  title: foo('bar'),\n};\n\n// ❌ template literals 6.3 OK / 7.0 KO\nexport default {\n  title: `${bar}`,\n};\n```\n\n#### StoryObj type\n\nThe TypeScript type for CSF3 story objects is `StoryObj`, and this will become the default in Storybook 7.0. In 6.x, the `StoryFn` type is the default, and `Story` is aliased to `StoryFn`.\n\nIf you are migrating to experimental CSF3, the following is compatible with 6.4 and requires the least amount of change to your code today:\n\n```ts\n// CSF2 function stories, current API, will break in 7.0\nimport type { Story } from \"@storybook/<framework>\";\n\n// CSF3 object stories, will persist in 7.0\nimport type { StoryObj } from \"@storybook/<framework>\";\n```\n\nThe following is compatible with 6.4 and also forward-compatible with anticipated 7.0 changes:\n\n```ts\n// CSF2 function stories, forward-compatible mode\nimport type { StoryFn } from \"@storybook/<framework>\";\n\n// CSF3 object stories, using future 7.0 types\nimport type { Story } from \"@storybook/<framework>/types-7-0\";\n```\n\n### Story Store v7\n\nSB6.4 introduces an opt-in feature flag, `features.storyStoreV7`, which loads stories in an \"on demand\" way (that is when rendered), rather than up front when the Storybook is booted. This way of operating will become the default in 7.0 and will likely be switched to opt-out in that version.\n\nThe key benefit of the on demand store is that stories are code-split automatically (in `builder-webpack4` and `builder-webpack5`), which allows for much smaller bundle sizes, faster rendering, and improved general performance via various opt-in Webpack features.\n\nThe on-demand store relies on the \"story index\" data structure which is generated in the server (node) via static code analysis. As such, it has the following limitations:\n\n- Does not work with `storiesOf()`\n- Does not work if you use dynamic story names or component titles.\n\nHowever, the `autoTitle` feature is supported.\n\n#### Behavioral differences\n\nThe key behavioral differences of the v7 store are:\n\n- `SET_STORIES` is not emitted on boot up. Instead the manager loads the story index independently.\n- A new event `STORY_PREPARED` is emitted when a story is rendered for the first time, which contains metadata about the story, such as `parameters`.\n- All \"entire\" store APIs such as `extract()` need to be proceeded by an async call to `loadAllCSFFiles()` which fetches all CSF files and processes them.\n\n#### Main.js framework field\n\nIn earlier versions of Storybook, each framework package (e.g. `@storybook/react`) provided its own `start-storybook` and `build-storybook` binaries, which automatically filled in various settings.\n\nIn 7.0, we're moving towards a model where the user specifies their framework in `main.js`.\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ... your existing config\n  framework: \"@storybook/react\", // OR whatever framework you're using\n};\n```\n\nEach framework must export a `renderToDOM` function and `parameters.framework`. We'll be adding more documentation for framework authors in a future release.\n\n#### Using the v7 store\n\nTo activate the v7 mode set the feature flag in your `.storybook/main.js` config:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ... your existing config\n  framework: \"@storybook/react\", // OR whatever framework you're using\n  features: {\n    storyStoreV7: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nNOTE: `features.storyStoreV7` implies `features.buildStoriesJson` and has the same limitations.\n\n#### v7-style story sort\n\nIf you've written a custom `storySort` function, you'll need to rewrite it for V7.\n\nSB6.x supports a global story function specified in `.storybook/preview.js`. It accepts two arrays which each contain:\n\n- The story ID\n- A story object that contains the name, title, etc.\n- The component's parameters\n- The project-level parameters\n\nSB 7.0 streamlines the story function. It now accepts a `StoryIndexEntry` which is\nan object that contains only the story's `id`, `title`, `name`, and `importPath`.\n\nConsider the following example, before and after:\n\n```js\n// v6-style sort\nfunction storySort(a, b) {\n  return a[1].kind === b[1].kind\n    ? 0\n    : a[1].id.localeCompare(b[1].id, undefined, { numeric: true });\n},\n```\n\nAnd the after version using `title` instead of `kind` and not receiving the full parameters:\n\n```js\n// v7-style sort\nfunction storySort(a, b) {\n  return a.title === b.title\n    ? 0\n    : a.id.localeCompare(b.id, undefined, { numeric: true });\n},\n```\n\n**NOTE:** v7-style sorting is statically analyzed by Storybook, which puts a variety of constraints versus v6:\n\n- Sorting must be specified in the user's `.storybook/preview.js`. It cannot be specified by an addon or preset.\n- The `preview.js` export should not be generated by a function.\n- `storySort` must be a self-contained function that does not reference external variables.\n\n#### v7 default sort behavior\n\nThe behavior of the default `storySort` function has also changed in v7 thanks to [#18423](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/18243), which gives better control over hierarchical sorting.\n\nIn 6.x, the following configuration would sort any story/doc containing the title segment `Introduction` to the top of the sidebar, so this would match `Introduction`, `Example/Introduction`, `Very/Nested/Introduction`, etc.\n\n```js\n// preview.js\nexport default {\n  parameters: {\n    options: {\n      storySort: {\n        order: [\"Introduction\", \"*\"],\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIn 7.0+, the targeting is more precise, so the preceding example would match `Introduction`, but not anything nested. If you wanted to sort `Example/Introduction` first, you'd need to specify that:\n\n```js\nstorySort: {\n  order: ['*', ['Introduction', '*']],\n}\n```\n\nThis would sort `*/Introduction` first, but not `Introduction` or `Very/Nested/Introduction`. If you want to target `Introduction` stories/docs anywhere in the hierarchy, you can do this with a [custom sort function](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/naming-components-and-hierarchy#sorting-stories).\n\n#### v7 Store API changes for addon authors\n\nThe Story Store in v7 mode is async, so synchronous story loading APIs no longer work. In particular:\n\n- `store.fromId()` has been replaced by `store.loadStory()`, which is async (i.e. returns a `Promise` you will need to await).\n- `store.raw()/store.extract()` and friends that list all stories require a prior call to `store.cacheAllCSFFiles()` (which is async). This will load all stories, and isn't generally a good idea in an addon, as it will force the whole store to load.\n\n#### Storyshots compatibility in the v7 store\n\nStoryshots is not currently compatible with the v7 store. However, you can use the following workaround to opt-out of the v7 store when running storyshots; in your `main.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  features: {\n    storyStoreV7: !global.navigator?.userAgent?.match?.(\"jsdom\"),\n  },\n};\n```\n\nThere are some caveats with the above approach:\n\n- The code path in the v6 store is different to the v7 store and your mileage may vary in identical behavior. Buyer beware.\n- The story sort API [changed between the stores](#v7-style-story-sort). If you are using a custom story sort function, you will need to ensure it works in both contexts (perhaps using the check `global.navigator.userAgent.match('jsdom')`).\n\n### Emotion11 quasi-compatibility\n\nNow that the web is moving to Emotion 11 for styling, popular libraries like MUI5 and ChakraUI are breaking with Storybook 6.3 which only supports emotion@10.\n\nUnfortunately we're unable to upgrade Storybook to Emotion 11 without a semver major release, and we're not ready for that. So, as a workaround, we've created a feature flag which opts-out of the previous behavior of pinning the Emotion version to v10. To enable this workaround, add the following to your `.storybook/main.js` config:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  features: {\n    emotionAlias: false,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nSetting this should unlock theming for emotion11-based libraries in Storybook 6.4.\n\n### Babel mode v7\n\nSB6.4 introduces an opt-in feature flag, `features.babelModeV7`, that reworks the way Babel is configured in Storybook to make it more consistent with the Babel is configured in your app. This breaking change will become the default in SB 7.0, but we encourage you to migrate today.\n\n> NOTE: CRA apps using `@storybook/preset-create-react-app` use CRA's handling, so the new flag has no effect on CRA apps.\n\nIn SB6.x and earlier, Storybook provided its own default configuration and inconsistently handled configurations from the user's babelrc file. This resulted in a final configuration that differs from your application's configuration AND is difficult to debug.\n\nIn `babelModeV7`, Storybook no longer provides its own default configuration and is primarily configured via babelrc file, with small, incremental updates from Storybook addons.\n\nIn 6.x, Storybook supported a `.storybook/babelrc` configuration option. This is no longer supported and it's up to you to reconcile this with your project babelrc.\n\nTo activate the v7 mode set the feature flag in your `.storybook/main.js` config:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  // ... your existing config\n  features: {\n    babelModeV7: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIn the new mode, Storybook expects you to provide a configuration file. If you want a configuration file that's equivalent to the 6.x default, you can run the following command in your project directory:\n\n```sh\nnpx sb@latest babelrc\n```\n\nThis will create a `.babelrc.json` file. This file includes a bunch of babel plugins, so you may need to add new package devDependencies accordingly.\n\n### Loader behavior with args changes\n\nIn 6.4 the behavior of loaders when arg changes occurred was tweaked so loaders do not re-run. Instead the previous value of the loader is passed to the story, irrespective of the new args.\n\n### 6.4 Angular changes\n\n#### SB Angular builder\n\nSince SB6.3, Storybook for Angular supports a builder configuration in your project's `angular.json`. This provides an Angular-style configuration for running and building your Storybook. An example builder configuration is now part of the [get started documentation page](https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/get-started/install).\n\nIf you want to know all the available options, please checks the builders' validation schemas :\n\n- `start-storybook`: [schema](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/frameworks/angular/src/builders/start-storybook/schema.json)\n- `build-storybook`: [schema](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/frameworks/angular/src/builders/build-storybook/schema.json)\n\n#### Angular13\n\nAngular 13 introduces breaking changes that require updating your Storybook configuration if you are migrating from a previous version of Angular.\n\nMost notably, the documented way of including global styles is no longer supported by Angular13. Previously you could write the following in your `.storybook/preview.js` config:\n\n```\nimport '!style-loader!css-loader!sass-loader!./styles.scss';\n```\n\nIf you use Angular 13 and above, you should use the builder configuration instead:\n\n```json\n   \"my-default-project\": {\n      \"architect\": {\n        \"build\": {\n          \"builder\": \"@angular-devkit/build-angular:browser\",\n          \"options\": {\n            \"styles\": [\"src/styles.css\", \"src/styles.scss\"],\n          }\n        }\n      },\n   },\n```\n\nIf you need storybook-specific styles separate from your app, you can configure the styles in the [SB Angular builder](#sb-angular-builder), which completely overrides your project's styles:\n\n```json\n      \"storybook\": {\n        \"builder\": \"@storybook/angular:start-storybook\",\n        \"options\": {\n          \"browserTarget\": \"my-default-project:build\",\n          \"styles\": [\".storybook/custom-styles.scss\"],\n        },\n      }\n```\n\nThen, once you've set this up, you should run Storybook through the builder:\n\n```sh\nng run my-default-project:storybook\nng run my-default-project:build-storybook\n```\n\n#### Angular component parameter removed\n\nIn SB6.3 and earlier, the `default.component` metadata was implemented as a parameter, meaning that stories could set `parameters.component` to override the default export. This was an internal implementation that was never documented, but it was mistakenly used in some Angular examples.\n\nIf you have Angular stories of the form:\n\n```js\nexport const MyStory = () => ({ ... })\nSomeStory.parameters = { component: MyComponent };\n```\n\nYou should rewrite them as:\n\n```js\nexport const MyStory = () => ({ component: MyComponent, ... })\n```\n\n[More discussion here.](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/16010#issuecomment-917378595)\n\n### 6.4 deprecations\n\n#### Deprecated --static-dir CLI flag\n\nIn 6.4 we've replaced the `--static-dir` CLI flag with the `staticDirs` field in `.storybook/main.js`. Note that the CLI directories are relative to the current working directory, whereas the `staticDirs` are relative to the location of `main.js`.\n\nBefore:\n\n```sh\nstart-storybook --static-dir ./public,./static,./foo/assets:/assets\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```js\n// .storybook/main.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  staticDirs: [\n    \"../public\",\n    \"../static\",\n    { from: \"../foo/assets\", to: \"/assets\" },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nThe `--static-dir` flag has been deprecated and will be removed in Storybook 7.0.\n\n## From version 6.2.x to 6.3.0\n\n### Webpack 5\n\nStorybook 6.3 brings opt-in support for building both your project and the manager UI with webpack 5. To do so, there are two ways:\n\n1 - Upgrade command\n\nIf you're upgrading your Storybook version, run this command, which will both upgrade your dependencies but also detect whether you should migrate to webpack5 builders and apply the changes automatically:\n\n```shell\nnpx sb upgrade\n```\n\n2 - Automigrate command\n\nIf you don't want to change your Storybook version but want Storybook to detect whether you should migrate to webpack5 builders and apply the changes automatically:\n\n```shell\nnpx sb automigrate\n```\n\n3 - Manually\n\nIf either methods did not work or you just want to proceed manually, do the following steps:\n\nInstall the dependencies:\n\n```shell\nyarn add @storybook/builder-webpack5 @storybook/manager-webpack5 --dev\n# Or\nnpm install @storybook/builder-webpack5 @storybook/manager-webpack5 --save-dev\n```\n\nThen edit your `.storybook/main.js` config:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  core: {\n    builder: \"webpack5\",\n  },\n};\n```\n\n> NOTE: If you're using `@storybook/preset-create-react-app` make sure to update it to version 4.0.0 as well.\n\n#### Fixing hoisting issues\n\n##### Webpack 5 manager build\n\nStorybook 6.2 introduced **experimental** webpack5 support for building user components. Storybook 6.3 also supports building the manager UI in webpack 5 to avoid strange hoisting issues.\n\nIf you're upgrading from 6.2 and already using the experimental webpack5 feature, this might be a breaking change (hence the 'experimental' label) and you should try adding the manager builder:\n\n```shell\nyarn add @storybook/manager-webpack5 --dev\n# Or\nnpm install @storybook/manager-webpack5 --save-dev\n```\n\n##### Wrong webpack version\n\nBecause Storybook uses `webpack@4` as the default, it's possible for the wrong version of webpack to get hoisted by your package manager. If you receive an error that looks like you might be using the wrong version of webpack, install `webpack@5` explicitly as a dev dependency to force it to be hoisted:\n\n```shell\nyarn add webpack@5 --dev\n# Or\nnpm install webpack@5 --save-dev\n```\n\nAlternatively or additionally you might need to add a resolution to your package.json to ensure that a consistent webpack version is provided across all of storybook packages. Replacing the {app} with the app (react, vue, etc.) that you're using:\n\n```js\n// package.json\n...\nresolutions: {\n  \"@storybook/{app}/webpack\": \"^5\"\n}\n...\n```\n\n### Angular 12 upgrade\n\nStorybook 6.3 supports Angular 12 out of the box when you install it fresh. However, if you're upgrading your project from a previous version, you'll need to [follow the steps for opting-in to webpack 5](#webpack-5).\n\n### Lit support\n\nStorybook 6.3 introduces Lit 2 support in a non-breaking way to ease migration from `lit-html`/`lit-element` to `lit`.\n\nTo do so, it relies on helpers added in the latest minor versions of `lit-html`/`lit-element`. So when upgrading to Storybook 6.3, please ensure your project is using `lit-html` 1.4.x or `lit-element` 2.5.x.\n\nAccording to the package manager you are using, it can be handled automatically when updating Storybook or can require to manually update the versions and regenerate the lockfile.\n\n### No longer inferring default values of args\n\nPreviously, unset `args` were set to the `argType.defaultValue` if set or inferred from the component's prop types (etc.). In 6.3 we no longer infer default values and instead set arg values to `undefined` when unset, allowing the framework to supply the default value.\n\nIf you were using `argType.defaultValue` to fix issues with the above inference, it should no longer be necessary, you can remove that code.\n\nIf you were using `argType.defaultValue` or relying on inference to set a default value for an arg, you should now set a value for the arg at the component level:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  component: MyComponent,\n  args: {\n    argName: \"default-value\",\n  },\n};\n```\n\nTo manually configure the value that is shown in the ArgsTable doc block, you can configure the `table.defaultValue` setting:\n\n```js\nexport default {\n  component: MyComponent,\n  argTypes: {\n    argName: {\n      table: { defaultValue: { summary: \"SomeType<T>\" } },\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### 6.3 deprecations\n\n#### Deprecated addon-knobs\n\nWe are replacing `@storybook/addon-knobs` with `@storybook/addon-controls`.\n\n- [Rationale & discussion](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/discussions/15060)\n- [Migration notes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/addons/controls/README.md#how-do-i-migrate-from-addon-knobs)\n\n#### Deprecated scoped blocks imports\n\nIn 6.3, we changed doc block imports from `@storybook/addon-docs/blocks` to `@storybook/addon-docs`. This makes it possible for bundlers to automatically choose the ESM or CJS version of the library depending on the context.\n\nTo update your code, you should be able to global replace `@storybook/addon-docs/blocks` with `@storybook/addon-docs`. Example:\n\n```js\n// before\nimport { Meta, Story } from \"@storybook/addon-docs/blocks\";\n\n// after\nimport { Meta, Story } from \"@storybook/addon-docs\";\n```\n\n#### Deprecated layout URL params\n\nSeveral URL params to control the manager layout have been deprecated and will be removed in 7.0:\n\n- `addons=0`: use `panel=false` instead\n- `panelRight=1`: use `panel=right` instead\n- `stories=0`: use `nav=false` instead\n\nAdditionally, support for legacy URLs using `selectedKind` and `selectedStory` will be removed in 7.0. Use `path` instead.\n\n## From version 6.1.x to 6.2.0\n\n### MDX pattern tweaked\n\nIn 6.2 files ending in `stories.mdx` or `story.mdx` are now processed with Storybook's MDX compiler. Previously it only applied to files ending in `.stories.mdx` or `.story.mdx`. See more here: [#13996](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/13996).\n\n### 6.2 Angular overhaul\n\n#### New Angular storyshots format\n\nWe've updated the Angular storyshots format in 6.2, which is technically a breaking change. Apologies to semver purists: if you're using storyshots, you'll need to [update your snapshots](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/snapshot-testing#updating-snapshots).\n\nThe new format hides the implementation details of `@storybook/angular` so that we can evolve its renderer without breaking your snapshots in the future.\n\n#### Deprecated Angular story component\n\nStorybook 6.2 for Angular uses `parameters.component` as the preferred way to specify your stories' components. The previous method, in which the component was a return value of the story, has been deprecated.\n\nConsider the existing story from 6.1 or earlier:\n\n```ts\nexport default { title: \"Button\" };\nexport const Basic = () => ({\n  component: Button,\n  props: { label: \"Label\" },\n});\n```\n\nFrom 6.2 this should be rewritten as:\n\n```ts\nexport default { title: \"Button\", component: Button };\nexport const Basic = () => ({\n  props: { label: \"Label\" },\n});\n```\n\nThe new convention is consistent with how other frameworks and addons work in Storybook. The old way will be supported until 7.0. For a full discussion see <https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/8673>.\n\n#### New Angular renderer\n\nWe've rewritten the Angular renderer in Storybook 6.2. It's meant to be entirely backwards compatible, but if you need to use the legacy renderer it's still available via a [parameter](https://storybook.js.org/docs/angular/writing-stories/parameters). To opt out of the new renderer, add the following to `.storybook/preview.ts`:\n\n```ts\nexport const parameters = {\n  angularLegacyRendering: true,\n};\n```\n\nPlease also file an issue if you need to opt out. We plan to remove the legacy renderer in 7.0.\n\n#### Components without selectors\n\nWhen the new Angular renderer is used, all Angular Story components must either have a selector, or be added to the `entryComponents` array of the story's `moduleMetadata`. If the component has any `Input`s or `Output`s to be controlled with `args`, a selector should be added.\n\n### Packages now available as ESModules\n\nMany Storybook packages are now available as ESModules in addition to CommonJS. If your jest tests stop working, this is likely why. One common culprit is doc blocks, which [is fixed in 6.3](#deprecated-scoped-blocks-imports). In 6.2, you can configure jest to transform the packages like so ([more info](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration#transformignorepatterns-arraystring)):\n\n```json\n// In your jest config\ntransformIgnorePatterns: ['/node_modules/(?!@storybook)']\n```\n\n### 6.2 Deprecations\n\n#### Deprecated implicit PostCSS loader\n\nPreviously, `@storybook/core` would automatically add the `postcss-loader` to your preview. This caused issues for consumers when PostCSS upgraded to v8 and tools, like Autoprefixer and Tailwind, starting requiring the new version. Implicitly adding `postcss-loader` will be removed in Storybook 7.0.\n\nInstead of continuing to include PostCSS inside the core library, it has been moved to [`@storybook/addon-postcss`](https://github.com/storybookjs/addon-postcss). This addon provides more fine-grained customization and will be upgraded more flexibly to track PostCSS upgrades.\n\nIf you require PostCSS support, please install `@storybook/addon-postcss` in your project, add it to your list of addons inside `.storybook/main.js`, and configure a `postcss.config.js` file.\n\nFurther information is available at <https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/12668> and <https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/13669>.\n\nIf you're not using Postcss and you don't want to see the warning, you can disable it by adding the following to your `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  features: {\n    postcss: false,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n#### Deprecated default PostCSS plugins\n\nWhen relying on the [implicit PostCSS loader](#deprecated-implicit-postcss-loader), it would also add [autoprefixer v9](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer/v/9.8.6) and [postcss-flexbugs-fixes v4](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-flexbugs-fixes/v/4.2.1) plugins to the `postcss-loader` configuration when you didn't have a PostCSS config file (such as `postcss.config.js`) within your project.\n\nThey will no longer be applied when switching to `@storybook/addon-postcss` and the implicit PostCSS features will be removed in Storybook 7.0.\n\nIf you depend upon these plugins being applied, install them and create a `postcss.config.js` file within your project that contains:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  plugins: [\n    require(\"postcss-flexbugs-fixes\"),\n    require(\"autoprefixer\")({\n      flexbox: \"no-2009\",\n    }),\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n#### Deprecated showRoots config option\n\nConfig options for the sidebar are now under the `sidebar` namespace. The `showRoots` option should be set as follows:\n\n```js\naddons.setConfig({\n  sidebar: {\n    showRoots: false,\n  },\n  // showRoots: false   <- this is deprecated\n});\n```\n\nThe top-level `showRoots` option will be removed in Storybook 7.0.\n\n#### Deprecated control.options\n\nPossible `options` for a radio/check/select controls has been moved up to the argType level, and no longer accepts an object. Instead, you should specify `options` as an array. You can use `control.labels` to customize labels. Additionally, you can use a `mapping` to deal with complex values.\n\n```js\nargTypes: {\n  answer:\n    options: ['yes', 'no'],\n    mapping: {\n      yes: <Check />,\n      no: <Cross />,\n    },\n    control: {\n      type: 'radio',\n      labels: {\n        yes: 'да',\n        no: 'нет',\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nKeys in `control.labels` as well as in `mapping` should match the values in `options`. Neither object has to be exhaustive, in case of a missing property, the option value will be used directly.\n\nIf you are currently using an object as value for `control.options`, be aware that the key and value are reversed in `control.labels`.\n\n#### Deprecated storybook components html entry point\n\nStorybook HTML components are now exported directly from '@storybook/components' for better ESM and Typescript compatibility. The old entry point will be removed in SB 7.0.\n\n```js\n// before\nimport { components } from \"@storybook/components/html\";\n\n// after\nimport { components } from \"@storybook/components\";\n```\n\n## From version 6.0.x to 6.1.0\n\n### Addon-backgrounds preset\n\nIn 6.1 we introduced an unintentional breaking change to `addon-backgrounds`.\n\nThe addon uses decorators which are set up automatically by a preset. The required preset is ignored if you register the addon in `main.js` with the `/register` entry point. This used to be valid in `v6.0.x` and earlier:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\"../**/*.stories.js\"],\n  addons: [\"@storybook/addon-backgrounds/register\"],\n};\n```\n\nTo fix it, just replace `@storybook/addon-backgrounds/register` with `@storybook/addon-backgrounds`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\"../**/*.stories.js\"],\n  addons: [\"@storybook/addon-backgrounds\"],\n};\n```\n\n### Single story hoisting\n\nStories which have **no siblings** (i.e. the component has only one story) and which name **exactly matches** the component name will now be hoisted up to replace their parent component in the sidebar. This means you can have a hierarchy like this:\n\n```\nDESIGN SYSTEM   [root]\n- Atoms         [group]\n  - Button      [component]\n    - Button    [story]\n  - Checkbox    [component]\n    - Checkbox  [story]\n```\n\nThis will then be visually presented in the sidebar like this:\n\n```\nDESIGN SYSTEM   [root]\n- Atoms         [group]\n  - Button      [story]\n  - Checkbox    [story]\n```\n\nSee [Naming components and hierarchy](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/writing-stories/naming-components-and-hierarchy#single-story-hoisting) for details.\n\n### React peer dependencies\n\nStarting in 6.1, `react` and `react-dom` are required peer dependencies of `@storybook/react`, meaning that if your React project does not have dependencies on them, you need to add them as `devDependencies`. If you don't you'll see errors like this:\n\n```\nError: Cannot find module 'react-dom/package.json'\n```\n\nThey were also peer dependencies in earlier versions, but due to the package structure they would be installed by Storybook if they were not required by the user's project. For more discussion: <https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/13269>\n\n### 6.1 deprecations\n\n#### Deprecated DLL flags\n\nEarlier versions of Storybook used Webpack DLLs as a performance crutch. In 6.1, we've removed Storybook's built-in DLLs and have deprecated the command-line parameters `--no-dll` and `--ui-dll`. They will be removed in 7.0.\n\n#### Deprecated storyFn\n\nEach item in the story store contains a field called `storyFn`, which is a fully decorated story that's applied to the denormalized story parameters. Starting in 6.0 we've stopped using this API internally, and have replaced it with a new field called `unboundStoryFn` which, unlike `storyFn`, must passed a story context, typically produced by `applyLoaders`;\n\nBefore:\n\n```js\nconst { storyFn } = store.fromId(\"some--id\");\nconsole.log(storyFn());\n```\n\nAfter:\n\n```js\nconst { unboundStoryFn, applyLoaders } = store.fromId(\"some--id\");\nconst context = await applyLoaders();\nconsole.log(unboundStoryFn(context));\n```\n\nIf you're not using loaders, `storyFn` will work as before. If you are, you'll need to use the new approach.\n\n> NOTE: If you're using `@storybook/addon-docs`, this deprecation warning is triggered by the Docs tab in 6.1. It's safe to ignore and we will be providing a proper fix in a future release. You can track the issue at <https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/13074>.\n\n#### Deprecated onBeforeRender\n\nThe `@storybook/addon-docs` previously accepted a `jsx` option called `onBeforeRender`, which was unfortunately named as it was called after the render.\n\nWe've renamed it `transformSource` and also allowed it to receive the `StoryContext` in case source rendering requires additional information.\n\n#### Deprecated grid parameter\n\nPreviously when using `@storybook/addon-backgrounds` if you wanted to customize the grid, you would define a parameter like this:\n\n```js\nexport const Basic = () => <Button />\nBasic.parameters: {\n  grid: {\n    cellSize: 10\n  }\n},\n```\n\nAs grid is not an addon, but rather backgrounds is, the grid configuration was moved to be inside `backgrounds` parameter instead. Also, there are new properties that can be used to further customize the grid. Here's an example with the default values:\n\n```js\nexport const Basic = () => <Button />\nBasic.parameters: {\n  backgrounds: {\n    grid: {\n      disable: false,\n      cellSize: 20,\n      opacity: 0.5,\n      cellAmount: 5,\n      offsetX: 16, // default is 0 if story has 'fullscreen' layout, 16 if layout is 'padded'\n      offsetY: 16, // default is 0 if story has 'fullscreen' layout, 16 if layout is 'padded'\n    }\n  }\n},\n```\n\n#### Deprecated package-composition disabled parameter\n\nLike [Deprecated disabled parameter](#deprecated-disabled-parameter). The `disabled` parameter has been deprecated, please use `disable` instead.\n\nFor more information, see the [the related documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/workflows/package-composition#configuring).\n\n## From version 5.3.x to 6.0.x\n\n### Hoisted CSF annotations\n\nStorybook 6 introduces hoisted CSF annotations and deprecates the `StoryFn.story` object-style annotation.\n\nIn 5.x CSF, you would annotate a story like this:\n\n```js\nexport const Basic = () => <Button />\nBasic.story = {\n  name: 'foo',\n  parameters: { ... },\n  decorators: [ ... ],\n};\n```\n\nIn 6.0 CSF this becomes:\n\n```js\nexport const Basic = () => <Button />\nBasic.storyName = 'foo';\nBasic.parameters = { ... };\nBasic.decorators = [ ... ];\n```\n\n1. The new syntax is slightly more compact/ergonomic compared the old one\n2. Similar to React's `displayName`, `propTypes`, `defaultProps` annotations\n3. We're introducing a new feature, [Storybook Args](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mhp1UFRCKCsN8pjlfPdz8ZdisgjNXeMXpXvGoALjxYM/edit?usp=sharing), where the new syntax will be significantly more ergonomic\n\nTo help you upgrade your stories, we've created a codemod:\n\n```\nnpx @storybook/cli@latest migrate csf-hoist-story-annotations --glob=\"**/*.stories.js\"\n```\n\nFor more information, [see the documentation](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/lib/codemod/README.md#csf-hoist-story-annotations).\n\n### Zero config typescript\n\nStorybook has built-in Typescript support in 6.0. That means you should remove your complex Typescript configurations from your `.storybook` config. We've tried to pick sensible defaults that work out of the box, especially for nice prop table generation in `@storybook/addon-docs`.\n\nTo migrate from an old setup, we recommend deleting any typescript-specific webpack/babel configurations in your project. You should also remove `@storybook/preset-typescript`, which is superseded by the built-in configuration.\n\nIf you want to override the defaults, see the [typescript configuration docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/typescript).\n\n### Correct globs in main.js\n\nIn 5.3 we introduced the `main.js` file with a `stories` property. This property was documented as a \"glob\" pattern. This was our intention, however the implementation allowed for non valid globs to be specified and work. In fact, we promoted invalid globs in our documentation and CLI templates.\n\nWe've corrected this, the CLI templates have been changed to use valid globs.\n\nWe've also changed the code that resolves these globs, so that invalid globs will log a warning. They will break in the future, so if you see this warning, please ensure you're specifying a valid glob.\n\nExample of an **invalid** glob:\n\n```\nstories: ['./**/*.stories.(ts|js)']\n```\n\nExample of a **valid** glob:\n\n```\nstories: ['./**/*.stories.@(ts|js)']\n```\n\n### CRA preset removed\n\nThe built-in create-react-app preset, which was [previously deprecated](#create-react-app-preset), has been fully removed.\n\nIf you're using CRA and migrating from an earlier Storybook version, please install [`@storybook/preset-create-react-app`](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-create-react-app) if you haven't already.\n\n### Core-JS dependency errors\n\nSome users have experienced `core-js` dependency errors when upgrading to 6.0, such as:\n\n```\nModule not found: Error: Can't resolve 'core-js/modules/web.dom-collections.iterator'\n```\n\nWe think this comes from having multiple versions of `core-js` installed, but haven't isolated a good solution (see [#11255](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/11255) for discussion).\n\nFor now, the workaround is to install `core-js` directly in your project as a dev dependency:\n\n```sh\nnpm install core-js@^3.0.1 --save-dev\n```\n\n### Args passed as first argument to story\n\nStarting in 6.0, the first argument to a story function is an [Args object](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf#args-story-inputs). In 5.3 and earlier, the first argument was a [StoryContext](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/release/5.3/lib/addons/src/types.ts#L24-L31), and that context is now passed as the second argument by default.\n\nThis breaking change only affects you if your stories actually use the context, which is not common. If you have any stories that use the context, you can either (1) update your stories, or (2) set a flag to opt-out of new behavior.\n\nConsider the following story that uses the context:\n\n```js\nexport const Dummy = ({ parameters }) => (\n  <div>{JSON.stringify(parameters)}</div>\n);\n```\n\nHere's an updated story for 6.0 that ignores the args object:\n\n```js\nexport const Dummy = (_args, { parameters }) => (\n  <div>{JSON.stringify(parameters)}</div>\n);\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you want to opt out of the new behavior, you can add the following to your `.storybook/preview.js` config:\n\n```js\nexport const parameters = {\n  passArgsFirst: false,\n};\n```\n\n### 6.0 Docs breaking changes\n\n#### Remove framework-specific docs presets\n\nIn SB 5.2, each framework had its own preset, e.g. `@storybook/addon-docs/react/preset`. In 5.3 we [unified this into a single preset](#unified-docs-preset): `@storybook/addon-docs/preset`. In 6.0 we've removed the deprecated preset.\n\n#### Preview/Props renamed\n\nIn 6.0 we renamed `Preview` to `Canvas`, `Props` to `ArgsTable`. The change should be otherwise backwards-compatible.\n\n#### Docs theme separated\n\nIn 6.0, you should theme Storybook Docs with the `docs.theme` parameter.\n\nIn 5.x, the Storybook UI and Storybook Docs were themed using the same theme object. However, in 5.3 we introduced a new API, `addons.setConfig`, which improved UI theming but broke Docs theming. Rather than trying to keep the two unified, we introduced a separate theming mechanism for docs, `docs.theme`. [Read about Docs theming here](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/theming.md#storybook-theming).\n\n#### DocsPage slots removed\n\nIn SB5.2, we introduced the concept of [DocsPage slots](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/0de8575eab73bfd5c5c7ba5fe33e53a49b92db3a/addons/docs/docs/docspage.md#docspage-slots) for customizing the DocsPage.\n\nIn 5.3, we introduced `docs.x` story parameters like `docs.prepareForInline` which get filled in by frameworks and can also be overwritten by users, which is a more natural/convenient way to make global customizations.\n\nWe also introduced [Custom DocsPage](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/docspage.md#replacing-docspage), which makes it possible to add/remove/update DocBlocks on the page.\n\nThese mechanisms are superior to slots, so we've removed slots in 6.0. For each slot, we provide a migration path here:\n\n| Slot        | Slot function     | Replacement                                  |\n| ----------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------------------- |\n| Title       | `titleSlot`       | Custom DocsPage                              |\n| Subtitle    | `subtitleSlot`    | Custom DocsPage                              |\n| Description | `descriptionSlot` | `docs.extractComponentDescription` parameter |\n| Primary     | `primarySlot`     | Custom DocsPage                              |\n| Props       | `propsSlot`       | `docs.extractProps` parameter                |\n| Stories     | `storiesSlot`     | Custom DocsPage                              |\n\n#### React prop tables with Typescript\n\nProps handling in React has changed in 6.0 and should be much less error-prone. This is not a breaking change per se, but documenting the change here since this is an area that has a lot of issues and we've gone back and forth on it.\n\nStarting in 6.0, we have [zero-config typescript support](#zero-config-typescript). The out-of-box experience should be much better now, since the default configuration is designed to work well with `addon-docs`.\n\nThere are also two typescript handling options that can be set in `.storybook/main.js`. `react-docgen-typescript` (default) and `react-docgen`. This is [discussed in detail in the docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/react/README.md#typescript-props-with-react-docgen).\n\n#### ConfigureJSX true by default in React\n\nIn SB 6.0, the Storybook Docs preset option `configureJSX` is now set to `true` for all React projects. It was previously `false` by default for React only in 5.x). This `configureJSX` option adds `@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`, to process the output of the MDX compiler, which should be a safe change for all projects.\n\nIf you need to restore the old JSX handling behavior, you can configure `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  addons: [\n    {\n      name: \"@storybook/addon-docs\",\n      options: { configureJSX: false },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n#### User babelrc disabled by default in MDX\n\nIn SB 6.0, the Storybook Docs no longer applies the user's babelrc by default when processing MDX files. It caused lots of hard-to-diagnose bugs.\n\nTo restore the old behavior, or pass any MDX-specific babel options, you can configure `.storybook/main.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  addons: [\n    {\n      name: \"@storybook/addon-docs\",\n      options: { mdxBabelOptions: { babelrc: true, configFile: true } },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n#### Docs description parameter\n\nIn 6.0, you can customize a component description using the `docs.description.component` parameter, and a story description using `docs.description.story` parameter.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nimport { Button } from './Button';\n\nexport default {\n  title: 'Button'\n  parameters: { docs: { description: { component: 'some component **markdown**' }}}\n}\n\nexport const Basic = () => <Button />\nBasic.parameters = { docs: { description: { story: 'some story **markdown**' }}}\n```\n\nIn 5.3 you customized a story description with the `docs.storyDescription` parameter. This has been deprecated, and support will be removed in 7.0.\n\n#### 6.0 Inline stories\n\nThe following frameworks now render stories inline on the Docs tab by default, rather than in an iframe: `react`, `vue`, `web-components`, `html`.\n\nTo disable inline rendering, set the `docs.stories.inline` parameter to `false`.\n\n### New addon presets\n\nIn Storybook 5.3 we introduced a declarative [main.js configuration](#to-mainjs-configuration), which is now the recommended way to configure Storybook. Part of the change is a simplified syntax for registering addons, which in 6.0 automatically registers many addons _using a preset_, which is a slightly different behavior than in earlier versions.\n\nThis breaking change currently applies to: `addon-a11y`, `addon-actions`, `addon-knobs`, `addon-links`, `addon-queryparams`.\n\nConsider the following `main.js` config for `addon-knobs`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\"../**/*.stories.js\"],\n  addons: [\"@storybook/addon-knobs\"],\n};\n```\n\nIn earlier versions of Storybook, this would automatically call `@storybook/addon-knobs/register`, which adds the knobs panel to the Storybook UI. As a user you would also add a decorator:\n\n```js\nimport { withKnobs } from \"../index\";\n\naddDecorator(withKnobs);\n```\n\nNow in 6.0, `addon-knobs` comes with a preset, `@storybook/addon-knobs/preset`, that does this automatically for you. This change simplifies configuration, since now you don't need to add that decorator.\n\nIf you wish to disable this new behavior, you can modify your `main.js` to force it to use the `register` logic rather than the `preset`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\"../**/*.stories.js\"],\n  addons: [\"@storybook/addon-knobs/register\"],\n};\n```\n\nIf you wish to selectively disable `knobs` checks for a subset of stories, you can control this with story parameters:\n\n```js\nexport const MyNonCheckedStory = () => <SomeComponent />;\nMyNonCheckedStory.story = {\n  parameters: {\n    knobs: { disable: true },\n  },\n};\n```\n\n### Removed babel-preset-vue from Vue preset\n\n`babel-preset-vue` is not included by default anymore when using Storybook with Vue.\nThis preset is outdated and [caused problems](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/4475) with more modern setups.\n\nIf you have an older Vue setup that relied on this preset, make sure it is included in your babel config\n(install `babel-preset-vue` and add it to the presets).\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"babel-preset-vue\"]\n}\n```\n\nHowever, please take a moment to review why this preset is necessary in your setup.\nOne usecase used to be to enable JSX in your stories. For this case, we recommend to use `@vue/babel-preset-jsx` instead.\n\n### Removed Deprecated APIs\n\nIn 6.0 we removed a number of APIs that were previously deprecated.\n\nSee the migration guides for further details:\n\n- [Addon a11y uses parameters, decorator renamed](#addon-a11y-uses-parameters-decorator-renamed)\n- [Addon backgrounds uses parameters](#addon-backgrounds-uses-parameters)\n- [Source-loader](#source-loader)\n- [Unified docs preset](#unified-docs-preset)\n- [Addon centered decorator deprecated](#addon-centered-decorator-deprecated)\n\n### New setStories event\n\nThe `setStories`/`SET_STORIES` event has changed and now denormalizes global and kind-level parameters. The new format of the event data is:\n\n```js\n{\n  globalParameters: { p: 'q' },\n  kindParameters: { kind: { p: 'q' } },\n  stories: /* as before but with only story-level parameters */\n}\n```\n\nIf you want the full denormalized parameters for a story, you can do something like:\n\n```js\nimport { combineParameters } from \"@storybook/api\";\n\nconst story = data.stories[storyId];\nconst parameters = combineParameters(\n  data.globalParameters,\n  data.kindParameters[story.kind],\n  story.parameters\n);\n```\n\n### Removed renderCurrentStory event\n\nThe story store no longer emits `renderCurrentStory`/`RENDER_CURRENT_STORY` to tell the renderer to render the story. Instead it emits a new declarative `CURRENT_STORY_WAS_SET` (in response to the existing `SET_CURRENT_STORY`) which is used to decide to render.\n\n### Removed hierarchy separators\n\nWe've removed the ability to specify the hierarchy separators (how you control the grouping of story kinds in the sidebar). From Storybook 6.0 we have a single separator `/`, which cannot be configured.\n\nIf you are currently using custom separators, we encourage you to migrate to using `/` as the sole separator. If you are using `|` or `.` as a separator currently, we provide a codemod, [`upgrade-hierarchy-separators`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/lib/codemod/README.md#upgrade-hierarchy-separators), that can be used to rename your components. **Note: the codemod will not work for `.mdx` components, you will need to make the changes by hand.**\n\n```\nnpx sb@latest migrate upgrade-hierarchy-separators --glob=\"*/**/*.stories.@(tsx|jsx|ts|js)\"\n```\n\nWe also now default to showing \"roots\", which are non-expandable groupings in the sidebar for the top-level groups. If you'd like to disable this, set the `showRoots` option in `.storybook/manager.js`:\n\n```js\nimport { addons } from \"@storybook/addons\";\n\naddons.setConfig({\n  showRoots: false,\n});\n```\n\n### No longer pass denormalized parameters to storySort\n\nThe `storySort` function (set via the `parameters.options.storySort` parameter) previously compared two entries `[storyId, storeItem]`, where `storeItem` included the full \"denormalized\" set of parameters of the story (i.e. the global, kind and story parameters that applied to that story).\n\nFor performance reasons, we now store the parameters uncombined, and so pass the format: `[storyId, storeItem, kindParameters, globalParameters]`.\n\n### Client API changes\n\n#### Removed Legacy Story APIs\n\nIn 6.0 we removed a set of APIs from the underlying `StoryStore` (which wasn't publicly accessible):\n\n- `getStories`, `getStoryFileName`, `getStoryAndParameters`, `getStory`, `getStoryWithContext`, `hasStoryKind`, `hasStory`, `dumpStoryBook`, `size`, `clean`\n\nAlthough these were private APIs, if you were using them, you could probably use the newer APIs (which are still private): `getStoriesForKind`, `getRawStory`, `removeStoryKind`, `remove`.\n\n#### Can no longer add decorators/parameters after stories\n\nYou can no longer add decorators and parameters globally after you added your first story, and you can no longer add decorators and parameters to a kind after you've added your first story to it.\n\nIt's unclear and confusing what would happened if you did. If you want to disable a decorator for certain stories, use a parameter to do so:\n\n```js\nexport StoryOne = ...;\nStoryOne.story = { parameters: { addon: { disable: true } } };\n```\n\nIf you want to use a parameter for a subset of stories in a kind, simply use a variable to do so:\n\n```js\nconst commonParameters = { x: { y: 'z' } };\nexport StoryOne = ...;\nStoryOne.story = { parameters: { ...commonParameters, other: 'things' } };\n```\n\n> NOTE: also the use of `addParameters` and `addDecorator` at arbitrary points is also deprecated, see [the deprecation warning](#deprecated-addparameters-and-adddecorator).\n\n#### Changed Parameter Handling\n\nThere have been a few rationalizations of parameter handling in 6.0 to make things more predictable and fit better with the intention of parameters:\n\n_All parameters are now merged recursively to arbitrary depth._\n\nIn 5.3 we sometimes merged parameters all the way down and sometimes did not depending on where you added them. It was confusing. If you were relying on this behaviour, let us know.\n\n_Array parameters are no longer \"merged\"._\n\nIf you override an array parameter, the override will be the end product. If you want the old behaviour (appending a new value to an array parameter), export the original and use array spread. This will give you maximum flexibility:\n\n```js\nimport { allBackgrounds } from './util/allBackgrounds';\n\nexport StoryOne = ...;\nStoryOne.story = { parameters: { backgrounds: [...allBackgrounds, '#zyx' ] } };\n```\n\n_You cannot set parameters from decorators_\n\nParameters are intended to be statically set at story load time. So setting them via a decorator doesn't quite make sense. If you were using this to control the rendering of a story, chances are using the new `args` feature is a more idiomatic way to do this.\n\n_You can only set storySort globally_\n\nIf you want to change the ordering of stories, use `export const parameters = { options: { storySort: ... } }` in `preview.js`.\n\n### Simplified Render Context\n\nThe `RenderContext` that is passed to framework rendering layers in order to render a story has been simplified, dropping a few members that were not used by frameworks to render stories. In particular, the following have been removed:\n\n- `selectedKind`/`selectedStory` -- replaced by `kind`/`name`\n- `configApi`\n- `storyStore`\n- `channel`\n- `clientApi`\n\n### Story Store immutable outside of configuration\n\nYou can no longer change the contents of the StoryStore outside of a `configure()` call. This is to ensure that any changes are properly published to the manager. If you want to add stories \"out of band\" you can call `store.startConfiguring()` and `store.finishConfiguring()` to ensure that your changes are published.\n\n### Improved story source handling\n\nThe story source code handling has been improved in both `addon-storysource` and `addon-docs`.\n\nIn 5.x some users used an undocumented _internal_ API, `mdxSource` to customize source snippetization in `addon-docs`. This has been removed in 6.0.\n\nThe preferred way to customize source snippets for stories is now:\n\n```js\nexport const Example = () => <Button />;\nExample.story = {\n  parameters: {\n    storySource: {\n      source: \"custom source\",\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nThe MDX analog:\n\n```jsx\n<Story name=\"Example\" parameters={{ storySource: { source: \"custom source\" } }}>\n  <Button />\n</Story>\n```\n\n### 6.0 Addon API changes\n\n#### Consistent local addon paths in main.js\n\nIf you use `.storybook/main.js` config and have locally-defined addons in your project, you need to update your file paths.\n\nIn 5.3, `addons` paths were relative to the project root, which was inconsistent with `stories` paths, which were relative to the `.storybook` folder. In 6.0, addon paths are now relative to the config folder.\n\nSo, for example, if you had:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = { addons: [\"./.storybook/my-local-addon/register\"] };\n```\n\nYou'd need to update this to:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = { addons: [\"./my-local-addon/register\"] };\n```\n\n#### Deprecated setAddon\n\nWe've deprecated the `setAddon` method of the `storiesOf` API and plan to remove it in 7.0.\n\nSince early versions, Storybook shipped with a `setAddon` API, which allows you to extend `storiesOf` with arbitrary code. We've removed this from all core addons long ago and recommend writing stories in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df) rather than using the internal Storybook API.\n\n#### Deprecated disabled parameter\n\nStarting in 6.0.17, we've renamed the `disabled` parameter to `disable` to resolve an inconsistency where `disabled` had been used to hide the addon panel, whereas `disable` had been used to disable an addon's execution. Since `disable` was much more widespread in the code, we standardized on that.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n```\nStory.parameters = { actions: { disabled: true } }\n```\n\nShould be rewritten as:\n\n```\nStory.parameters = { actions: { disable: true } }\n```\n\n#### Actions addon uses parameters\n\nLeveraging the new preset `@storybook/addon-actions` uses parameters to pass action options. If you previously had:\n\n```js\nimport { withActions } from `@storybook/addon-actions`;\n\nexport StoryOne = ...;\nStoryOne.story = {\n  decorators: [withActions('mouseover', 'click .btn')],\n}\n\n```\n\nYou should replace it with:\n\n```js\nexport StoryOne = ...;\nStoryOne.story = {\n  parameters: { actions: ['mouseover', 'click .btn'] },\n}\n```\n\n#### Removed action decorator APIs\n\nIn 6.0 we removed the actions addon decorate API. Actions handles can be configured globally, for a collection of stories or per story via parameters. The ability to manipulate the data arguments of an event is only relevant in a few frameworks and is not a common enough usecase to be worth the complexity of supporting.\n\n#### Removed withA11y decorator\n\nIn 6.0 we removed the `withA11y` decorator. The code that runs accessibility checks is now directly injected in the preview.\n\nTo configure a11y now, you have to specify configuration using story parameters, e.g. in `.storybook/preview.js`:\n\n```js\nexport const parameters = {\n  a11y: {\n    element: \"#storybook-root\",\n    config: {},\n    options: {},\n    manual: true,\n  },\n};\n```\n\n#### Essentials addon disables differently\n\nIn 6.0, `addon-essentials` doesn't configure addons if the user has already configured them in `main.js`. In 5.3 it previously checked to see whether the package had been installed in `package.json` to disable configuration. The new setup is preferably because now users' can install essential packages and import from them without disabling their configuration.\n\n#### Backgrounds addon has a new api\n\nStarting in 6.0, the backgrounds addon now receives an object instead of an array as parameter, with a property to define the default background.\n\nConsider the following example of its usage in `Button.stories.js`:\n\n```jsx\n// Button.stories.js\nexport default {\n  title: \"Button\",\n  parameters: {\n    backgrounds: [\n      { name: \"twitter\", value: \"#00aced\", default: true },\n      { name: \"facebook\", value: \"#3b5998\" },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\nHere's an updated version of the example, using the new api:\n\n```jsx\n// Button.stories.js\nexport default {\n  title: \"Button\",\n  parameters: {\n    backgrounds: {\n      default: \"twitter\",\n      values: [\n        { name: \"twitter\", value: \"#00aced\" },\n        { name: \"facebook\", value: \"#3b5998\" },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIn addition, backgrounds now ships with the following defaults:\n\n- no selected background (transparent)\n- light/dark options\n\n### 6.0 Deprecations\n\nWe've deprecated the following in 6.0: `addon-info`, `addon-notes`, `addon-contexts`, `addon-centered`, `polymer`.\n\n#### Deprecated addon-info, addon-notes\n\nThe info/notes addons have been replaced by [addon-docs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/docs). We've documented a migration in the [docs recipes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#migrating-from-notesinfo-addons).\n\nBoth addons are still widely used, and their source code is still available in the [deprecated-addons repo](https://github.com/storybookjs/deprecated-addons). We're looking for maintainers for both addons. If you're interested, please get in touch on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/storybook).\n\n#### Deprecated addon-contexts\n\nThe contexts addon has been replaced by [addon-toolbars](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/toolbars), which is simpler, more ergonomic, and compatible with all Storybook frameworks.\n\nThe addon's source code is still available in the [deprecated-addons repo](https://github.com/storybookjs/deprecated-addons). If you're interested in maintaining it, please get in touch on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/storybook).\n\n#### Removed addon-centered\n\nIn 6.0 we removed the centered addon. Centering is now core feature of storybook, so we no longer need an addon.\n\nRemove the addon-centered decorator and instead add a `layout` parameter:\n\n```js\nexport const MyStory = () => <div>my story</div>;\nMyStory.story = {\n  parameters: { layout: \"centered\" },\n};\n```\n\nOther possible values are: `padded` (default) and `fullscreen`.\n\n#### Deprecated polymer\n\nWe've deprecated `@storybook/polymer` and are focusing on `@storybook/web-components`. If you use Polymer and are interested in maintaining it, please get in touch on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/storybook).\n\n#### Deprecated immutable options parameters\n\nThe UI options `sidebarAnimations`, `enableShortcuts`, `theme`, `showRoots` should not be changed on a per-story basis, and as such there is no reason to set them via parameters.\n\nYou should use `addon.setConfig` to set them:\n\n```js\n// in .storybook/manager.js\nimport { addons } from \"@storybook/addons\";\n\naddons.setConfig({\n  showRoots: false,\n});\n```\n\n#### Deprecated addParameters and addDecorator\n\nThe `addParameters` and `addDecorator` APIs to add global decorators and parameters, exported by the various frameworks (e.g. `@storybook/react`) and `@storybook/client` are now deprecated.\n\nInstead, use `export const parameters = {};` and `export const decorators = [];` in your `.storybook/preview.js`. Addon authors similarly should use such an export in a preview entry file (see [Preview entries](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/docs/addons/writing-presets.md#preview-entries)).\n\n#### Deprecated clearDecorators\n\nSimilarly, `clearDecorators`, exported by the various frameworks (e.g. `@storybook/react`) is deprecated.\n\n#### Deprecated configure\n\nThe `configure` API to load stories from `preview.js`, exported by the various frameworks (e.g. `@storybook/react`) is now deprecated.\n\nTo load stories, use the `stories` field in `main.js`. You can pass a glob or array of globs to load stories like so:\n\n```js\n// in .storybook/main.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\"../src/**/*.stories.js\"],\n};\n```\n\nYou can also pass an array of single file names if you want to be careful about loading files:\n\n```js\n// in .storybook/main.js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\n    \"../src/components/Button.stories.js\",\n    \"../src/components/Table.stories.js\",\n    \"../src/components/Page.stories.js\",\n  ],\n};\n```\n\n#### Deprecated support for duplicate kinds\n\nIn 6.0 we deprecated the ability to split a kind's (component's) stories into multiple files because it was causing issues in hot module reloading (HMR). It will likely be removed completely in 7.0.\n\nIf you had N stories that contained `export default { title: 'foo/bar' }` (or the MDX equivalent `<Meta title=\"foo/bar\">`), Storybook will now raise the warning `Duplicate title '${kindName}' used in multiple files`.\n\nTo split a component's stories into multiple files, e.g. for the `foo/bar` example above:\n\n- Create a single file with the `export default { title: 'foo/bar' }` export, which is the primary file\n- Comment out or delete the default export from the other files\n- Re-export the stories from the other files in the primary file\n\nSo the primary example might look like:\n\n```js\nexport default { title: 'foo/bar' };\nexport * from './Bar1.stories'\nexport * from './Bar2.stories'\nexport * from './Bar3.stories'\n\nexport const SomeStory = () => ...;\n```\n\n## From version 5.2.x to 5.3.x\n\n### To main.js configuration\n\nIn storybook 5.3 3 new files for configuration were introduced, that replaced some previous files.\n\nThese files are now soft-deprecated, (_they still work, but over time we will promote users to migrate_):\n\n- `presets.js` has been renamed to `main.js`. `main.js` is the main point of configuration for storybook.\n- `config.js` has been renamed to `preview.js`. `preview.js` configures the \"preview\" iframe that renders your components.\n- `addons.js` has been renamed to `manager.js`. `manager.js` configures Storybook's \"manager\" UI that wraps the preview, and also configures addons panel.\n\n#### Using main.js\n\n`main.js` is now the main point of configuration for Storybook. This is what a basic `main.js` looks like:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\"../**/*.stories.js\"],\n  addons: [\"@storybook/addon-knobs\"],\n};\n```\n\nYou remove all \"register\" import from `addons.js` and place them inside the array. You can also safely remove the `/register` suffix from these entries, for a cleaner, more readable configuration. If this means `addons.js` is now empty for you, it's safe to remove.\n\nNext you remove the code that imports/requires all your stories from `config.js`, and change it to a glob-pattern and place that glob in the `stories` array. If this means `config.js` is empty, it's safe to remove.\n\nIf you had a `presets.js` file before you can add the array of presets to the main.js file and remove `presets.js` like so:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  stories: [\"../**/*.stories.js\"],\n  addons: [\n    \"@storybook/preset-create-react-app\",\n    {\n      name: \"@storybook/addon-docs\",\n      options: { configureJSX: true },\n    },\n  ],\n};\n```\n\nBy default, adding a package to the `addons` array will first try to load its `preset` entry, then its `register` entry, and finally, it will just assume the package itself is a preset.\n\nIf you want to load a specific package entry, for example you want to use `@storybook/addon-docs/register`, you can also include that in the addons array and Storybook will do the right thing.\n\n#### Using preview.js\n\nIf after migrating the imports/requires of your stories to `main.js` you're left with some code in `config.js` it's likely the usage of `addParameters` & `addDecorator`.\n\nThis is fine, rename `config.js` to `preview.js`.\n\nThis file can also be used to inject global stylesheets, fonts etc, into the preview bundle.\n\n#### Using manager.js\n\nIf you are setting storybook options in `config.js`, especially `theme`, you should migrate it to `manager.js`:\n\n```js\nimport { addons } from \"@storybook/addons\";\nimport { create } from \"@storybook/theming/create\";\n\nconst theme = create({\n  base: \"light\",\n  brandTitle: \"My custom title\",\n});\n\naddons.setConfig({\n  panelPosition: \"bottom\",\n  theme,\n});\n```\n\nThis makes storybook load and use the theme in the manager directly.\nThis allows for richer theming in the future, and has a much better performance!\n\n> If you're using addon-docs, you should probably not do this. Docs uses the theme as well, but this change makes the theme inaccessible to addon-docs. We'll address this in 6.0.0.\n\n### Create React App preset\n\nYou can now move to the new preset for [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). The in-built preset for Create React App will be disabled in Storybook 6.0.\n\nSimply install [`@storybook/preset-create-react-app`](https://github.com/storybookjs/presets/tree/master/packages/preset-create-react-app) and it will be used automatically.\n\n### Description doc block\n\nIn 5.3 we've changed `addon-docs`'s `Description` doc block's default behavior. Technically this is a breaking change, but MDX was not officially released in 5.2 and we reserved the right to make small breaking changes. The behavior of `DocsPage`, which was officially released, remains unchanged.\n\nThe old behavior of `<Description of={Component} />` was to concatenate the info parameter or notes parameter, if available, with the docgen information loaded from source comments. If you depend on the old behavior, it's still available with `<Description of={Component} type='legacy-5.2' />`. This description type will be removed in Storybook 6.0.\n\nThe new default behavior is to use the framework-specific description extractor, which for React/Vue is still docgen, but may come from other places (e.g. a JSON file) for other frameworks.\n\nThe description doc block on DocsPage has also been updated. To see how to configure it in 5.3, please see [the updated recipe](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#migrating-from-notesinfo-addons)\n\n### React Native Async Storage\n\nStarting from version React Native 0.59, Async Storage is deprecated in React Native itself. The new @react-native-async-storage/async-storage module requires native installation, and we don't want to have it as a dependency for React Native Storybook.\n\nTo avoid that now you have to manually pass asyncStorage to React Native Storybook with asyncStorage prop. To notify users we are displaying a warning about it.\n\nSolution:\n\n- Use `require('@react-native-async-storage/async-storage').default` for React Native v0.59 and above.\n- Use `require('react-native').AsyncStorage` for React Native v0.58 or below.\n- Use `null` to disable Async Storage completely.\n\n```javascript\ngetStorybookUI({\n  ...\n  asyncStorage: require('@react-native-async-storage/async-storage').default || require('react-native').AsyncStorage || null\n});\n```\n\nThe benefit of using Async Storage is so that when users refresh the app, Storybook can open their last visited story.\n\n### Deprecate displayName parameter\n\nIn 5.2, the story parameter `displayName` was introduced as a publicly visible (but internal) API. Storybook's Component Story Format (CSF) loader used it to modify a story's display name independent of the story's `name`/`id` (which were coupled).\n\nIn 5.3, the CSF loader decouples the story's `name`/`id`, which means that `displayName` is no longer necessary. Unfortunately, this is a breaking change for any code that uses the story `name` field. Storyshots relies on story `name`, and the appropriate migration is to simply update your snapshots. Apologies for the inconvenience!\n\n### Unified docs preset\n\nAddon-docs configuration gets simpler in 5.3. In 5.2, each framework had its own preset, e.g. `@storybook/addon-docs/react/preset`. Starting in 5.3, everybody should use `@storybook/addon-docs/preset`.\n\n### Simplified hierarchy separators\n\nWe've deprecated the ability to specify the hierarchy separators (how you control the grouping of story kinds in the sidebar). From Storybook 6.0 we will have a single separator `/`, which cannot be configured.\n\nIf you are currently using custom separators, we encourage you to migrate to using `/` as the sole separator. If you are using `|` or `.` as a separator currently, we provide a codemod, [`upgrade-hierarchy-separators`](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/code/lib/codemod/README.md#upgrade-hierarchy-separators), that can be used to rename all your components.\n\n```\nyarn sb migrate upgrade-hierarchy-separators --glob=\"*.stories.js\"\n```\n\nIf you were using `|` and wish to keep the \"root\" behavior, use the `showRoots: true` option to re-enable roots:\n\n```js\naddParameters({\n  options: {\n    showRoots: true,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nNOTE: it is no longer possible to have some stories with roots and others without. If you want to keep the old behavior, simply add a root called \"Others\" to all your previously unrooted stories.\n\n### Addon StoryShots Puppeteer uses external puppeteer\n\nTo give you more control on the Chrome version used when running StoryShots Puppeteer, `puppeteer` is no more included in the addon dependencies. So you can now pick the version of `puppeteer` you want and set it in your project.\n\nIf you want the latest version available just run:\n\n```sh\nyarn add puppeteer --dev\nOR\nnpm install puppeteer --save-dev\n```\n\n## From version 5.1.x to 5.2.x\n\n### Source-loader\n\nAddon-storysource contains a loader, `@storybook/addon-storysource/loader`, which has been deprecated in 5.2. If you use it, you'll see the warning:\n\n```\n@storybook/addon-storysource/loader is deprecated, please use @storybook/source-loader instead.\n```\n\nTo upgrade to `@storybook/source-loader`, run `npm install -D @storybook/source-loader` (or use `yarn`), and replace every instance of `@storybook/addon-storysource/loader` with `@storybook/source-loader`.\n\n### Default viewports\n\nThe default viewports have been reduced to a smaller set, we think is enough for most use cases.\nYou can get the old default back by adding the following to your `config.js`:\n\n```js\nimport { INITIAL_VIEWPORTS } from \"@storybook/addon-viewport\";\n\naddParameters({\n  viewport: {\n    viewports: INITIAL_VIEWPORTS,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Grid toolbar-feature\n\nThe grid feature in the toolbar has been relocated to [addon-background](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/next/addons/backgrounds), follow the setup instructions on that addon to get the feature again.\n\n### Docs mode docgen\n\nThis isn't a breaking change per se, because `addon-docs` is a new feature. However it's intended to replace `addon-info`, so if you're migrating from `addon-info` there are a few things you should know:\n\n1. Support for only one prop table\n2. Prop table docgen info should be stored on the component and not in the global variable `STORYBOOK_REACT_CLASSES` as before.\n\n### storySort option\n\nIn 5.0.x the global option `sortStoriesByKind` option was [inadvertently removed](#sortstoriesbykind). In 5.2 we've introduced a new option, `storySort`, to replace it. `storySort` takes a comparator function, so it is strictly more powerful than `sortStoriesByKind`.\n\nFor example, here's how to sort by story ID using `storySort`:\n\n```js\naddParameters({\n  options: {\n    storySort: (a, b) =>\n      a[1].kind === b[1].kind\n        ? 0\n        : a[1].id.localeCompare(b[1].id, undefined, { numeric: true }),\n  },\n});\n```\n\n## From version 5.1.x to 5.1.10\n\n### babel.config.js support\n\nSB 5.1.0 added [support for project root `babel.config.js` files](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/6634), which was an [unintentional breaking change](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/7058#issuecomment-515398228). 5.1.10 fixes this, but if you relied on project root `babel.config.js` support, this bugfix is a breaking change. The workaround is to copy the file into your `.storybook` config directory. We may add back project-level support in 6.0.\n\n## From version 5.0.x to 5.1.x\n\n### React native server\n\nStorybook 5.1 contains a major overhaul of `@storybook/react-native` as compared to 4.1 (we didn't ship a version of RN in 5.0 due to timing constraints). Storybook for RN consists of an UI for browsing stories on-device or in a simulator, and an optional webserver which can also be used to browse stories and web addons.\n\n5.1 refactors both pieces:\n\n- `@storybook/react-native` no longer depends on the Storybook UI and only contains on-device functionality\n- `@storybook/react-native-server` is a new package for those who wish to run a web server alongside their device UI\n\nIn addition, both packages share more code with the rest of Storybook, which will reduce bugs and increase compatibility (e.g. with the latest versions of babel, etc.).\n\nAs a user with an existing 4.1.x RN setup, no migration should be necessary to your RN app. Upgrading the library should be enough.\n\nIf you wish to run the optional web server, you will need to do the following migration:\n\n- Add `babel-loader` as a dev dependency\n- Add `@storybook/react-native-server` as a dev dependency\n- Change your \"storybook\" `package.json` script from `storybook start [-p ...]` to `start-storybook [-p ...]`\n\nAnd with that you should be good to go!\n\n### Angular 7\n\nStorybook 5.1 relies on `core-js@^3.0.0` and therefore causes a conflict with Angular 7 that relies on `core-js@^2.0.0`. In order to get Storybook running on Angular 7 you can either update to Angular 8 (which dropped `core-js` as a dependency) or follow these steps:\n\n- Remove `node_modules/@storybook`\n- `npm i core-js@^3.0.0` / `yarn add core-js@^3.0.0`\n- Add the following paths to your `tsconfig.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"core-js/es7/reflect\": [\n        \"node_modules/core-js/proposals/reflect-metadata\"\n      ],\n      \"core-js/es6/*\": [\"node_modules/core-js/es\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nYou should now be able to run Storybook and Angular 7 without any errors.\n\nReference issue: [https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13954](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/13954)\n\n### CoreJS 3\n\nFollowing the rest of the JS ecosystem, Storybook 5.1 upgrades [CoreJS](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js) 2 to 3, which is a breaking change.\n\nThis upgrade is problematic because many apps/libraries still rely on CoreJS 2, and many users get corejs-related errors due to bad resolution. To address this, we're using [corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ndelangen/corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin), which attempts to automatically upgrade code to CoreJS 3.\n\nAfter a few iterations, this approach seems to be working. However, there are a few exceptions:\n\n- If your app uses `babel-polyfill`, try to remove it\n\nWe'll update this section as we find more problem cases. If you have a `core-js` problem, please file an issue (preferably with a repro), and we'll do our best to get you sorted.\n\n**Update**: [corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ndelangen/corejs-upgrade-webpack-plugin) has been removed again after running into further issues as described in [https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/7445](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/7445).\n\n## From version 5.0.1 to 5.0.2\n\n### Deprecate webpack extend mode\n\nExporting an object from your custom webpack config puts storybook in \"extend mode\".\n\nThere was a bad bug in `v5.0.0` involving webpack \"extend mode\" that caused webpack issues for users migrating from `4.x`. We've fixed this problem in `v5.0.2` but it means that extend-mode has a different behavior if you're migrating from `5.0.0` or `5.0.1`. In short, `4.x` extended a base config with the custom config, whereas `5.0.0-1` extended the base with a richer config object that could conflict with the custom config in different ways from `4.x`.\n\nWe've also deprecated \"extend mode\" because it doesn't add a lot of value over \"full control mode\", but adds more code paths, documentation, user confusion etc. Starting in SB6.0 we will only support \"full control mode\" customization.\n\nTo migrate from extend-mode to full-control mode, if your extend-mode webpack config looks like this:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = {\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      /* ... */\n    ],\n  },\n};\n```\n\nIn full control mode, you need modify the default config to have the rules of your liking:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = ({ config }) => ({\n  ...config,\n  module: {\n    ...config.module,\n    rules: [\n      /* your own rules \"...\" here and/or some subset of config.module.rules */\n    ],\n  },\n});\n```\n\nPlease refer to the [current custom webpack documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/webpack) for more information on custom webpack config and to [Issue #6081](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/6081) for more information about the change.\n\n## From version 4.1.x to 5.0.x\n\nStorybook 5.0 includes sweeping UI changes as well as changes to the addon API and custom webpack configuration. We've tried to keep backwards compatibility in most cases, but there are some notable exceptions documented below.\n\n### sortStoriesByKind\n\nIn Storybook 5.0 we changed a lot of UI related code, and 1 oversight caused the `sortStoriesByKind` options to stop working.\nWe're working on providing a better way of sorting stories for now the feature has been removed. Stories appear in the order they are loaded.\n\nIf you're using webpack's `require.context` to load stories, you can sort the execution of requires:\n\n```js\nvar context = require.context(\"../stories\", true, /\\.stories\\.js$/);\nvar modules = context.keys();\n\n// sort them\nvar sortedModules = modules.slice().sort((a, b) => {\n  // sort the stories based on filename/path\n  return a < b ? -1 : a > b ? 1 : 0;\n});\n\n// execute them\nsortedModules.forEach((key) => {\n  context(key);\n});\n```\n\n### Webpack config simplification\n\nThe API for custom webpack configuration has been simplified in 5.0, but it's a breaking change. Storybook's \"full control mode\" for webpack allows you to override the webpack config with a function that returns a configuration object.\n\nIn Storybook 5 there is a single signature for full-control mode that takes a parameters object with the fields `config` and `mode`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = ({ config, mode }) => { config.module.rules.push(...); return config; }\n```\n\nIn contrast, the 4.x configuration function accepted either two or three arguments (`(baseConfig, mode)`, or `(baseConfig, mode, defaultConfig)`). The `config` object in the 5.x signature is equivalent to 4.x's `defaultConfig`.\n\nPlease see the [current custom webpack documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/webpack) for more information on custom webpack config.\n\n### Theming overhaul\n\nTheming has been rewritten in v5. If you used theming in v4, please consult the [theming docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/theming) to learn about the new API.\n\n### Story hierarchy defaults\n\nStorybook's UI contains a hierarchical tree of stories that can be configured by `hierarchySeparator` and `hierarchyRootSeparator` [options](https://github.com/storybookjs/deprecated-addons/blob/master/MIGRATION.md#options-addon-deprecated).\n\nIn Storybook 4.x the values defaulted to `null` for both of these options, so that there would be no hierarchy by default.\n\nIn 5.0, we now provide recommended defaults:\n\n```js\n{\n  hierarchyRootSeparator: '|',\n  hierarchySeparator: /\\/|\\./,\n}\n```\n\nThis means if you use the characters { `|`, `/`, `.` } in your story kinds it will trigger the story hierarchy to appear. For example `storiesOf('UI|Widgets/Basics/Button')` will create a story root called `UI` containing a `Widgets/Basics` group, containing a `Button` component.\n\nIf you wish to opt-out of this new behavior and restore the flat UI, set them back to `null` in your storybook config, or remove { `|`, `/`, `.` } from your story kinds:\n\n```js\naddParameters({\n  options: {\n    hierarchyRootSeparator: null,\n    hierarchySeparator: null,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### Options addon deprecated\n\nIn 4.x we added story parameters. In 5.x we've deprecated the options addon in favor of [global parameters](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/features-and-behavior), and we've also renamed some of the options in the process (though we're maintaining backwards compatibility until 6.0).\n\nHere's an old configuration:\n\n```js\naddDecorator(\n  withOptions({\n    name: \"Storybook\",\n    url: \"https://storybook.js.org\",\n    goFullScreen: false,\n    addonPanelInRight: true,\n  })\n);\n```\n\nAnd here's its new counterpart:\n\n```js\nimport { create } from \"@storybook/theming/create\";\naddParameters({\n  options: {\n    theme: create({\n      base: \"light\",\n      brandTitle: \"Storybook\",\n      brandUrl: \"https://storybook.js.org\",\n      // To control appearance:\n      // brandImage: 'http://url.of/some.svg',\n    }),\n    isFullscreen: false,\n    panelPosition: \"right\",\n    isToolshown: true,\n  },\n});\n```\n\nHere is the mapping from old options to new:\n\n| Old               | New              |\n| ----------------- | ---------------- |\n| name              | theme.brandTitle |\n| url               | theme.brandUrl   |\n| goFullScreen      | isFullscreen     |\n| showStoriesPanel  | showNav          |\n| showAddonPanel    | showPanel        |\n| addonPanelInRight | panelPosition    |\n| showSearchBox     |                  |\n|                   | isToolshown      |\n\nStorybook v5 removes the search dialog box in favor of a quick search in the navigation view, so `showSearchBox` has been removed.\n\nStorybook v5 introduce a new tool bar above the story view and you can show\\hide it with the new `isToolshown` option.\n\n### Individual story decorators\n\nThe behavior of adding decorators to a kind has changed in SB5 ([#5781](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/5781)).\n\nIn SB4 it was possible to add decorators to only a subset of the stories of a kind.\n\n```js\nstoriesOf(\"Stories\", module)\n  .add(\"noncentered\", () => \"Hello\")\n  .addDecorator(centered)\n  .add(\"centered\", () => \"Hello\");\n```\n\nThe semantics has changed in SB5 so that calling `addDecorator` on a kind adds a decorator to all its stories, no matter the order. So in the previous example, both stories would be centered.\n\nTo allow for a subset of the stories in a kind to be decorated, we've added the ability to add decorators to individual stories using parameters:\n\n```js\nstoriesOf(\"Stories\", module)\n  .add(\"noncentered\", () => \"Hello\")\n  .add(\"centered\", () => \"Hello\", { decorators: [centered] });\n```\n\n### Addon backgrounds uses parameters\n\nSimilarly, `@storybook/addon-backgrounds` uses parameters to pass background options. If you previously had:\n\n```js\nimport { withBackgrounds } from `@storybook/addon-backgrounds`;\n\nstoriesOf('Stories', module)\n  .addDecorator(withBackgrounds(options));\n```\n\nYou should replace it with:\n\n```js\nstoriesOf(\"Stories\", module).addParameters({ backgrounds: options });\n```\n\nYou can pass `backgrounds` parameters at the global level (via `addParameters` imported from `@storybook/react` et al.), and the story level (via the third argument to `.add()`).\n\n### Addon cssresources name attribute renamed\n\nIn the options object for `@storybook/addon-cssresources`, the `name` attribute for each resource has been renamed to `id`. If you previously had:\n\n```js\nimport { withCssResources } from \"@storybook/addon-cssresources\";\nimport { addDecorator } from \"@storybook/react\";\n\naddDecorator(\n  withCssResources({\n    cssresources: [\n      {\n        name: `bluetheme`, // Previous\n        code: `<style>body { background-color: lightblue; }</style>`,\n        picked: false,\n      },\n    ],\n  })\n);\n```\n\nYou should replace it with:\n\n```js\nimport { withCssResources } from \"@storybook/addon-cssresources\";\nimport { addDecorator } from \"@storybook/react\";\n\naddDecorator(\n  withCssResources({\n    cssresources: [\n      {\n        id: `bluetheme`, // Renamed\n        code: `<style>body { background-color: lightblue; }</style>`,\n        picked: false,\n      },\n    ],\n  })\n);\n```\n\n### Addon viewport uses parameters\n\nSimilarly, `@storybook/addon-viewport` uses parameters to pass viewport options. If you previously had:\n\n```js\nimport { configureViewport } from `@storybook/addon-viewport`;\n\nconfigureViewport(options);\n```\n\nYou should replace it with:\n\n```js\nimport { addParameters } from \"@storybook/react\"; // or others\n\naddParameters({ viewport: options });\n```\n\nThe `withViewport` decorator is also no longer supported and should be replaced with a parameter based API as above. Also the `onViewportChange` callback is no longer supported.\n\nSee the [viewport addon README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/viewport/README.md) for more information.\n\n### Addon a11y uses parameters, decorator renamed\n\nSimilarly, `@storybook/addon-a11y` uses parameters to pass a11y options. If you previously had:\n\n```js\nimport { configureA11y } from `@storybook/addon-a11y`;\n\nconfigureA11y(options);\n```\n\nYou should replace it with:\n\n```js\nimport { addParameters } from \"@storybook/react\"; // or others\n\naddParameters({ a11y: options });\n```\n\nYou can also pass `a11y` parameters at the component level (via `storiesOf(...).addParameters`), and the story level (via the third argument to `.add()`).\n\nFurthermore, the decorator `checkA11y` has been deprecated and renamed to `withA11y` to make it consistent with other Storybook decorators.\n\nSee the [a11y addon README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/a11y/README.md) for more information.\n\n### Addon centered decorator deprecated\n\nIf you previously had:\n\n```js\nimport centered from \"@storybook/addon-centered\";\n```\n\nYou should replace it with the React or Vue version as appropriate\n\n```js\nimport centered from \"@storybook/addon-centered/react\";\n```\n\nor\n\n```js\nimport centered from \"@storybook/addon-centered/vue\";\n```\n\n### New keyboard shortcuts defaults\n\nStorybook's keyboard shortcuts are updated in 5.0, but they are configurable via the menu so if you want to set them back you can:\n\n| Shortcut               | Old         | New   |\n| ---------------------- | ----------- | ----- |\n| Toggle sidebar         | cmd-shift-X | S     |\n| Toggle addons panel    | cmd-shift-Z | A     |\n| Toggle addons position | cmd-shift-G | D     |\n| Toggle fullscreen      | cmd-shift-F | F     |\n| Next story             | cmd-shift-→ | alt-→ |\n| Prev story             | cmd-shift-← | alt-← |\n| Next component         |             | alt-↓ |\n| Prev component         |             | alt-↑ |\n| Search                 |             | /     |\n\n### New URL structure\n\nWe've update Storybook's URL structure in 5.0. The old structure used URL parameters to save the UI state, resulting in long ugly URLs. v5 respects the old URL parameters, but largely does away with them.\n\nThe old structure encoded `selectedKind` and `selectedStory` among other parameters. Storybook v5 respects these parameters but will issue a deprecation message in the browser console warning of potential future removal.\n\nThe new URL structure looks like:\n\n```\nhttps://url-of-storybook?path=/story/<storyId>\n```\n\nThe structure of `storyId` is a slugified `<selectedKind>--<selectedStory>` (slugified = lowercase, hyphen-separated). Each `storyId` must be unique. We plan to build more features into Storybook in upcoming versions based on this new structure.\n\n### Rename of the `--secure` cli parameter to `--https`\n\nStorybook for React Native's start commands & the Web versions' start command were a bit different, for no reason.\nWe've changed the start command for Reactnative to match the other.\n\nThis means that when you previously used the `--secure` flag like so:\n\n```sh\nstart-storybook --secure\n# or\nstart-storybook --s\n```\n\nYou have to replace it with:\n\n```sh\nstart-storybook --https\n```\n\n### Vue integration\n\nThe Vue integration was updated, so that every story returned from a story or decorator function is now being normalized with `Vue.extend` **and** is being wrapped by a functional component. Returning a string from a story or decorator function is still supported and is treated as a component with the returned string as the template.\n\nCurrently there is no recommended way of accessing the component options of a story inside a decorator.\n\n## From version 4.0.x to 4.1.x\n\nThere are a few migrations you should be aware of in 4.1, including one unintentionally breaking change for advanced addon usage.\n\n### Private addon config\n\nIf your Storybook contains custom addons defined that are defined in your app (as opposed to installed from packages) and those addons rely on reconfiguring webpack/babel, Storybook 4.1 may break for you. There's a workaround [described in the issue](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/issues/4995), and we're working on official support in the next release.\n\n### React 15.x\n\nStorybook 4.1 supports React 15.x (which had been [lost in the 4.0 release](#react-163)). So if you've been blocked on upgrading, we've got you covered. You should be able to upgrade according to the 4.0 migration notes below, or following the [4.0 upgrade guide](https://medium.com/storybookjs/migrating-to-storybook-4-c65b19a03d2c).\n\n## From version 3.4.x to 4.0.x\n\nWith 4.0 as our first major release in over a year, we've collected a lot of cleanup tasks. Most of the deprecations have been marked for months, so we hope that there will be no significant impact on your project. We've also created a [step-by-step guide to help you upgrade](https://medium.com/storybookjs/migrating-to-storybook-4-c65b19a03d2c).\n\n### React 16.3+\n\nStorybook uses [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) for styling which currently requires React 16.3 and above.\n\nIf you're using Storybook for anything other than React, you probably don't need to worry about this.\n\nHowever, if you're developing React components, this means you need to upgrade to 16.3 or higher to use Storybook 4.0.\n\n> **NOTE:** This is a temporary requirement, and we plan to restore 15.x compatibility in a near-term 4.x release.\n\nAlso, here's the error you'll get if you're running an older version of React:\n\n```\n\ncore.browser.esm.js:15 Uncaught TypeError: Object(...) is not a function\nat Module../node_modules/@emotion/core/core.browser.esm.js (core.browser.esm.js:15)\nat **webpack_require** (bootstrap:724)\nat fn (bootstrap:101)\nat Module../node_modules/@emotion/styled-base/dist/styled-base.browser.esm.js (styled-base.browser.esm.js:1)\nat **webpack_require** (bootstrap:724)\nat fn (bootstrap:101)\nat Module../node_modules/@emotion/styled/dist/styled.esm.js (styled.esm.js:1)\nat **webpack_require** (bootstrap:724)\nat fn (bootstrap:101)\nat Object../node_modules/@storybook/components/dist/navigation/MenuLink.js (MenuLink.js:12)\n\n```\n\n### Generic addons\n\n4.x introduces generic addon decorators that are not tied to specific view layers [#3555](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/3555). So for example:\n\n```js\nimport { number } from \"@storybook/addon-knobs/react\";\n```\n\nBecomes:\n\n```js\nimport { number } from \"@storybook/addon-knobs\";\n```\n\n### Knobs select ordering\n\n4.0 also reversed the order of addon-knob's `select` knob keys/values, which had been called `selectV2` prior to this breaking change. See the knobs [package README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/knobs/README.md#select) for usage.\n\n### Knobs URL parameters\n\nAddon-knobs no longer updates the URL parameters interactively as you edit a knob. This is a UI change but it shouldn't break any code because old URLs are still supported.\n\nIn 3.x, editing knobs updated the URL parameters interactively. The implementation had performance and architectural problems. So in 4.0, we changed this to a \"copy\" button in the addon which generates a URL with the updated knob values and copies it to the clipboard.\n\n### Keyboard shortcuts moved\n\n- Addon Panel to `Z`\n- Stories Panel to `X`\n- Show Search to `O`\n- Addon Panel right side to `G`\n\n### Removed addWithInfo\n\n`Addon-info`'s `addWithInfo` has been marked deprecated since 3.2. In 4.0 we've removed it completely. See the package [README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/info/README.md) for the proper usage.\n\n### Removed RN packager\n\nSince storybook version v4.0 packager is removed from storybook. The suggested storybook usage is to include it inside your app.\nIf you want to keep the old behaviour, you have to start the packager yourself with a different project root.\n`npm run storybook start -p 7007 | react-native start --projectRoot storybook`\n\nRemoved cli options: `--packager-port --root --projectRoots -r, --reset-cache --skip-packager --haul --platform --metro-config`\n\n### Removed RN addons\n\nThe `@storybook/react-native` had built-in addons (`addon-actions` and `addon-links`) that have been marked as deprecated since 3.x. They have been fully removed in 4.x. If your project still uses the built-ins, you'll need to add explicit dependencies on `@storybook/addon-actions` and/or `@storybook/addon-links` and import directly from those packages.\n\n### Storyshots Changes\n\n1. `imageSnapshot` test function was extracted from `addon-storyshots`\n   and moved to a new package - `addon-storyshots-puppeteer` that now will\n   be dependent on puppeteer. [README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots/storyshots-puppeteer)\n2. `getSnapshotFileName` export was replaced with the `Stories2SnapsConverter`\n   class that now can be overridden for a custom implementation of the\n   snapshot-name generation. [README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots/storyshots-core#stories2snapsconverter)\n3. Storybook that was configured with Webpack's `require.context()` feature\n   will need to add a babel plugin to polyfill this functionality.\n   A possible plugin might be [babel-plugin-require-context-hook](https://github.com/smrq/babel-plugin-require-context-hook).\n   [README](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots/storyshots-core#configure-jest-to-work-with-webpacks-requirecontext)\n\n### Webpack 4\n\nStorybook now uses webpack 4. If you have a [custom webpack config](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/webpack), make sure that all the loaders and plugins you use support webpack 4.\n\n### Babel 7\n\nStorybook now uses Babel 7. There's a couple of cases when it can break with your app:\n\n- If you aren't using Babel yourself, and don't have .babelrc, install following dependencies:\n\n  ```\n  npm i -D @babel/core babel-loader@latest\n  ```\n\n- If you're using Babel 6, make sure that you have direct dependencies on `babel-core@6` and `babel-loader@7` and that you have a `.babelrc` in your project directory.\n\n### Create-react-app\n\nIf you are using `create-react-app` (aka CRA), you may need to do some manual steps to upgrade, depending on the setup.\n\n- `create-react-app@1` may require manual migrations.\n  - If you're adding storybook for the first time: `sb init` should add the correct dependencies.\n  - If you're upgrading an existing project, your `package.json` probably already uses Babel 6, making it incompatible with `@storybook/react@4` which uses Babel 7. There are two ways to make it compatible, each of which is spelled out in detail in the next section:\n    - Upgrade to Babel 7 if you are not dependent on Babel 6-specific features.\n    - Migrate Babel 6 if you're heavily dependent on some Babel 6-specific features).\n- `create-react-app@2` should be compatible as is, since it uses babel 7.\n\n#### Upgrade CRA1 to babel 7\n\n```\nyarn remove babel-core babel-runtime\nyarn add @babel/core babel-loader --dev\n```\n\n#### Migrate CRA1 while keeping babel 6\n\n```\nyarn add babel-loader@7\n```\n\nAlso, make sure you have a `.babelrc` in your project directory. You probably already do if you are using Babel 6 features (otherwise you should consider upgrading to Babel 7 instead). If you don't have one, here's one that works:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"presets\": [\"env\", \"react\"]\n}\n```\n\n### start-storybook opens browser\n\nIf you're using `start-storybook` on CI, you may need to opt out of this using the new `--ci` flag.\n\n### CLI Rename\n\nWe've deprecated the `getstorybook` CLI in 4.0. The new way to install storybook is `sb init`. We recommend using `npx` for convenience and to make sure you're always using the latest version of the CLI:\n\n```\nnpx -p @storybook/cli sb init\n```\n\n### Addon story parameters\n\nStorybook 4 introduces story parameters, a more convenient way to configure how addons are configured.\n\n```js\nstoriesOf('My component', module)\n  .add('story1', withNotes('some notes')(() => <Component ... />))\n  .add('story2', withNotes('other notes')(() => <Component ... />));\n```\n\nBecomes:\n\n```js\n// config.js\naddDecorator(withNotes);\n\n// Component.stories.js\nstoriesOf('My component', module)\n  .add('story1', () => <Component ... />, { notes: 'some notes' })\n  .add('story2', () => <Component ... />, { notes: 'other notes' });\n```\n\nThis example applies notes globally to all stories. You can apply it locally with `storiesOf(...).addDecorator(withNotes)`.\n\nThe story parameters correspond directly to the old withX arguments, so it's less demanding to migrate your code. See the parameters documentation for the packages that have been upgraded:\n\n- [Notes](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/notes/README.md)\n- [Jest](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/jest/README.md)\n- [Knobs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/knobs/README.md)\n- [Viewport](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/viewport/README.md)\n- [Backgrounds](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/backgrounds/README.md)\n- [Options](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/addons/options/README.md)\n\n## From version 3.3.x to 3.4.x\n\nThere are no expected breaking changes in the 3.4.x release, but 3.4 contains a major refactor to make it easier to support new frameworks, and we will document any breaking changes here if they arise.\n\n## From version 3.2.x to 3.3.x\n\nIt wasn't expected that there would be any breaking changes in this release, but unfortunately it turned out that there are some. We're revisiting our [release strategy](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/master/RELEASES.md) to follow semver more strictly.\nAlso read on if you're using `addon-knobs`: we advise an update to your code for efficiency's sake.\n\n### `babel-core` is now a peer dependency #2494\n\nThis affects you if you don't use babel in your project. You may need to add `babel-core` as dev dependency:\n\n```sh\nyarn add babel-core --dev\n```\n\nThis was done to support different major versions of babel.\n\n### Base webpack config now contains vital plugins #1775\n\nThis affects you if you use custom webpack config in [Full Control Mode](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/webpack#full-control-mode) while not preserving the plugins from `storybookBaseConfig`. Before `3.3`, preserving them was a recommendation, but now it [became](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/2578) a requirement.\n\n### Refactored Knobs\n\nKnobs users: there was a bug in 3.2.x where using the knobs addon imported all framework runtimes (e.g. React and Vue). To fix the problem, we [refactored knobs](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/pull/1832). Switching to the new style is only takes one line of code.\n\nIn the case of React or React-Native, import knobs like this:\n\n```js\nimport { withKnobs, text, boolean, number } from \"@storybook/addon-knobs/react\";\n```\n\nIn the case of Vue: `import { ... } from '@storybook/addon-knobs/vue';`\n\nIn the case of Angular: `import { ... } from '@storybook/addon-knobs/angular';`\n\n## From version 3.1.x to 3.2.x\n\n**NOTE:** technically this is a breaking change, but only if you use TypeScript. Sorry people!\n\n### Moved TypeScript addons definitions\n\nTypeScript users: we've moved the rest of our addons type definitions into [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/). Starting in 3.2.0 make sure to use the right addons types:\n\n```sh\nyarn add @types/storybook__addon-notes @types/storybook__addon-options @types/storybook__addon-knobs @types/storybook__addon-links --dev\n```\n\nSee also [TypeScript definitions in 3.1.x](#moved-typescript-definitions).\n\n### Updated Addons API\n\nWe're in the process of upgrading our addons APIs. As a first step, we've upgraded the Info and Notes addons. The old API will still work with your existing projects but will be deprecated soon and removed in Storybook 4.0.\n\nHere's an example of using Notes and Info in 3.2 with the new API.\n\n```js\nstoriesOf(\"composition\", module).add(\n  \"new addons api\",\n  withInfo(\"see Notes panel for composition info\")(\n    withNotes({ text: \"Composition: Info(Notes())\" })((context) => (\n      <MyComponent name={context.story} />\n    ))\n  )\n);\n```\n\nIt's not beautiful, but we'll be adding a more convenient/idiomatic way of using these [withX primitives](https://gist.github.com/shilman/792dc25550daa9c2bf37238f4ef7a398) in Storybook 3.3.\n\n## From version 3.0.x to 3.1.x\n\n**NOTE:** technically this is a breaking change and should be a 4.0.0 release according to semver. However, we're still figuring things out and didn't think this change necessitated a major release. Please bear with us!\n\n### Moved TypeScript definitions\n\nTypeScript users: we are in the process of moving our typescript definitions into [DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/). If you're using TypeScript, starting in 3.1.0 you need to make sure your type definitions are installed:\n\n```sh\nyarn add @types/node @types/react @types/storybook__react --dev\n```\n\n### Deprecated head.html\n\nWe have deprecated the use of `head.html` for including scripts/styles/etc. into stories, though it will still work with a warning.\n\nNow we use:\n\n- `preview-head.html` for including extra content into the preview pane.\n- `manager-head.html` for including extra content into the manager window.\n\n[Read our docs](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/configure/story-rendering#adding-to-head) for more details.\n\n## From version 2.x.x to 3.x.x\n\nThis major release is mainly an internal restructuring.\nUpgrading requires work on behalf of users, this was unavoidable.\nWe're sorry if this inconveniences you, we have tried via this document and provided tools to make the process as easy as possible.\n\n### Webpack upgrade\n\nStorybook will now use webpack 2 (and only webpack 2).\nIf you are using a custom `webpack.config.js` you need to change this to be compatible.\nYou can find the guide to upgrading your webpack config [on webpack.js.org](https://webpack.js.org/guides/migrating/).\n\n### Packages renaming\n\nAll our packages have been renamed and published to npm as version 3.0.0 under the `@storybook` namespace.\n\nTo update your app to use the new package names, you can use the cli:\n\n```bash\nnpx -p @storybook/cli sb init\n```\n\n**Details**\n\nIf the above doesn't work, or you want to make the changes manually, the details are below:\n\n> We have adopted the same versioning strategy that has been adopted by babel, jest and apollo.\n> It's a strategy best suited for ecosystem type tools, which consist of many separately installable features / packages.\n> We think this describes storybook pretty well.\n\nThe new package names are:\n\n| old                                          | new                              |\n| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n| `getstorybook`                               | `@storybook/cli`                 |\n| `@kadira/getstorybook`                       | `@storybook/cli`                 |\n|                                              |                                  |\n| `@kadira/storybook`                          | `@storybook/react`               |\n| `@kadira/react-storybook`                    | `@storybook/react`               |\n| `@kadira/react-native-storybook`             | `@storybook/react-native`        |\n|                                              |                                  |\n| `storyshots`                                 | `@storybook/addon-storyshots`    |\n| `@kadira/storyshots`                         | `@storybook/addon-storyshots`    |\n|                                              |                                  |\n| `@kadira/storybook-ui`                       | `@storybook/ui`                  |\n| `@kadira/storybook-addons`                   | `@storybook/addons`              |\n| `@kadira/storybook-channels`                 | `@storybook/channels`            |\n| `@kadira/storybook-channel-postmsg`          | `@storybook/channel-postmessage` |\n| `@kadira/storybook-channel-websocket`        | `@storybook/channel-websocket`   |\n|                                              |                                  |\n| `@kadira/storybook-addon-actions`            | `@storybook/addon-actions`       |\n| `@kadira/storybook-addon-links`              | `@storybook/addon-links`         |\n| `@kadira/storybook-addon-info`               | `@storybook/addon-info`          |\n| `@kadira/storybook-addon-knobs`              | `@storybook/addon-knobs`         |\n| `@kadira/storybook-addon-notes`              | `@storybook/addon-notes`         |\n| `@kadira/storybook-addon-options`            | `@storybook/addon-options`       |\n| `@kadira/storybook-addon-graphql`            | `@storybook/addon-graphql`       |\n| `@kadira/react-storybook-decorator-centered` | `@storybook/addon-centered`      |\n\nIf your codebase is small, it's probably doable to replace them by hand (in your codebase and in `package.json`).\n\nBut if you have a lot of occurrences in your codebase, you can use a [codemod we created](./code/lib/codemod) for you.\n\n> A codemod makes automatic changed to your app's code.\n\nYou have to change your `package.json`, prune old and install new dependencies by hand.\n\n`npm prune` will remove all dependencies from `node_modules` which are no longer referenced in `package.json`.\n\n### Deprecated embedded addons\n\nWe used to ship 2 addons with every single installation of storybook: `actions` and `links`. But in practice not everyone is using them, so we decided to deprecate this and in the future, they will be completely removed. If you use `@storybook/react/addons` you will get a deprecation warning.\n\nIf you **are** using these addons, it takes two steps to migrate:\n\n- add the addons you use to your `package.json`.\n- update your code:\n  change `addons.js` like so:\n\n  ```js\n  import \"@storybook/addon-actions/register\";\n  import \"@storybook/addon-links/register\";\n  ```\n\n  change `x.story.js` like so:\n\n  ```js\n  import React from \"react\";\n  import { storiesOf } from \"@storybook/react\";\n  import { action } from \"@storybook/addon-actions\";\n  import { linkTo } from \"@storybook/addon-links\";\n  ```\n\n  <!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->\n"

Useful scripts include:\n\n#### `yarn start`\n\n> Runs a sandbox template storybook with test stories\n\n#### `yarn task`\n\n> As above, but gives you options to customize the sandbox (e.g. selecting other frameworks)\n\n#### `yarn lint`\n\n> boolean check if code conforms to linting rules - uses remark & eslint\n\n- `yarn lint:js` - will check js\n- `yarn lint:md` - will check markdown + code samples\n- `yarn lint:js --fix` - will automatically fix js\n\n#### `yarn test`\n\n> boolean check if unit tests all pass - uses jest\n\n- `yarn run test --core --watch` - will run core tests in watch-mode\n\n### Sponsors\n\nBecome a sponsor to have your logo and website URL on our README on Github. \\[[Become a sponsor](https://opencollective.com/storybook#sponsor)]\n\n<a

Our first lesson, [Introduction to Programming Languages and Tools of the Trade](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/1-getting-started-lessons/1-intro-to-programming-languages), will walk you through various options for each of these tools for you to select what works best for you.\n\nOur recommendation is to use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) as your editor, which also has a built-in [Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon). You can download Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon).\n\n\n1. Clone your repository to your computer. You can do this by clicking the **Code** button and copying the URL:\n\n    <img src=\"./images/createcodespace.png\" alt=\"Copy your repository URL\" style=\"width:270px;\"/>\n\n    Then, open [Terminal](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) within [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) and run the following command, replacing `<your-repository-url>` with the URL you just copied:\n\n    ```bash \n    git clone <your-repository-url>\n    ```\n\n2. Open the folder in Visual Studio Code. You can do this by clicking **File** > **Open Folder** and selecting the folder you just cloned.\n\n\n>  Recommended Visual Studio Code extensions:\n>\n> * [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer&WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) - to preview HTML pages within Visual Studio Code\n> * [Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot&WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) - to help you write code faster\n\n## 📂 Each lesson includes: \n\n- optional sketchnote\n- optional supplemental video\n- pre-lesson warmup quiz\n- written lesson\n- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project\n- knowledge checks\n- a challenge\n- supplemental reading\n- assignment\n- post-lesson quiz\n\n> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained in the Quiz-app folder, 48 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder. They are gradually being localized.\n\n## 🗃️ Lessons\n\n|     |                       Project Name                       |                            Concepts Taught                             |

principles in mind: \n* project-based learning\n* frequent quizzes\n\nThe program teaches the fundamentals of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, as well as the latest tools and techniques used by today's web developers. Students will have the opportunity to develop hands-on experience by building a typing game, virtual terrarium, eco-friendly browser extension, space-invader-style game, and a banking app for businesses. By the end of the series, students will have gained a solid understanding of web development.\n\n> 🎓 You can take the first few lessons in this curriculum as a [Learn Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/web-development-101/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon) on Microsoft Learn!\n\nBy ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented. We also wrote several starter lessons in JavaScript basics to introduce concepts, paired with a video from the \"[Beginners Series to: JavaScript](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-JavaScript/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)\" collection of video tutorials, some of whose authors contributed to this curriculum.\n\nIn addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12-week cycle.\n\nWhile we have purposefully avoided introducing JavaScript frameworks to concentrate on the basic skills needed as a web developer before adopting a framework, a good next step to completing this curriculum would be learning about Node.js via another collection of videos: \"[Beginner Series to: Node.js](https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Beginners-Series-to-Nodejs/?WT.mc_id=academic-77807-sagibbon)\".\n\n> Visit our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!\n\n\n## 🧭 Offline access \n\nYou can run this documentation offline by using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/#/).

Add your translation to the quiz-app by adding a file [here](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/tree/main/quiz-app/src/assets/translations), with the proper naming convention (en.json, fr.json). **Please don't localize the words 'true' or 'false' however. thanks!**\n\n2. Edit the quiz-app's [translations index.js file](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/blob/main/quiz-app/src/assets/translations/index.js) to add your language.\n\n3.

Please feel free to!\n\nIn fact, you can use it within GitHub itself by using GitHub Classroom.\n\nTo do that, fork this repo. You are going to need to create a repo for each lesson, so you're going to need to extract each folder into a separate repo. That way, [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) can pick up each lesson separately. \n\nThese [full instructions](https://github.blog/2020-03-18-set-up-your-digital-classroom-with-github-classroom/) will give you an idea of how to set up your classroom.\n\n## Using it in Moodle, Canvas or Blackboard\n\nThis curriculum works well in these Learning Management Systems! Use the [Moodle upload file](/teaching-files/webdev-moodle.mbz) for the full content, or try the [Common Cartridge file](/teaching-files/webdev-common-cartridge.imscc) which contains some of the content. Moodle Cloud does not support full Common Cartridge exports, so it is preferable to use the Moodle download file which can be uploaded into Canvas. Please let us know how we can improve this experience.\n\n![Moodle](/teaching-files/moodle.png)\n> The curriculum in a Moodle classroom\n\n![Canvas](/teaching-files/canvas.png)\n> The curriculum in Canvas\n\n## Using the repo as is\n\nIf you would like to use this repo as it currently stands, without using GitHub Classroom, that can be done as well. You would need to communicate with your students which lesson to work through together.\n\nIn an online format (Zoom, Teams, or other) you might form breakout rooms for the quizzes, and mentor students to help them get ready to learn. Then invite students to the quizzes and submit their answers as 'issues' at a certain time. You might do the same with assignments if you want students to work collaboratively out in the open.\n\nIf you prefer a more private format, ask your students to fork the curriculum, lesson by lesson, to their own GitHub repos as private repos, and give you access. Then they can complete quizzes and assignments privately and submit them to you via issues on your classroom repo.\n\nThere are many ways to make this work in an online classroom format. Please let us know what works best for you!\n\n## Please give us your thoughts!\n\nWe want to make this curriculum work for you and your students. Connect with us at the [Teacher corner](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/discussions/categories/teacher-corner) and open a [**new issue**](https://github.com/microsoft/Web-Dev-For-Beginners/issues/new/choose) for any requests, bugs and feedback.\n"

HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE\n==========================\n\nPython was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting\nMathematisch Centrum (CWI, see https://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands\nas a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's\nprincipal author, although it includes many contributions from others.\n\nIn 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for\nNational Research Initiatives (CNRI, see https://www.cnri.reston.va.us)\nin Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the\nsoftware.\n\nIn May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to\nBeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same\nyear, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became\nZope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see\nhttps://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization\ncreated specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.\nZope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.\n\nAll Python releases are Open Source (see https://opensource.org for\nthe Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python\nreleases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes\nthe various releases.\n\n    Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-\n                    from                                compatible? (1)\n\n    0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes\n    1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes\n    1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no\n    2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no\n    1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)\n    2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no\n    2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes\n    2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes\n    2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under\n    the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute\n    a modified version without making your changes open source.  The\n    GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with\n    other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.\n\n(2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,\n    because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to\n    CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1\n    is \"not incompatible\" with the GPL.\n\nThanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's\ndirection to make these releases possible.\n\n\nB.

Thanks for checking it out.\n\nAll documentation is in the \"``docs``\" directory and online at\nhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/. If you're just getting started,\nhere's how we recommend you read the docs:\n\n* First, read ``docs/intro/install.txt`` for instructions on installing Django.\n\n* Next, work through the tutorials in order (``docs/intro/tutorial01.txt``,\n  ``docs/intro/tutorial02.txt``, etc.).\n\n* If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read\n  ``docs/howto/deployment/index.txt`` for instructions.\n\n* You'll probably want to read through the topical guides (in ``docs/topics``)\n  next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in ``docs/howto``) for specific\n  problems, and check out the reference (``docs/ref``) for gory details.\n\n* See ``docs/README`` for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.\n\nDocs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think\nthey should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a\nticket here: https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket\n\nTo get more help:\n\n* Join the ``#django`` channel on ``irc.libera.chat``. Lots of helpful people\n  hang out there. `Webchat is available <https://web.libera.chat/#django>`_.\n\n* Join the django-users mailing list, or read the archives, at\n  https://groups.google.com/group/django-users.\n\n* Join the `Django Discord community <https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa>`_.\n\n* Join the community on the `Django Forum <https://forum.djangoproject.com/>`_.\n\nTo contribute to Django:\n\n* Check out https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/ for\n  information about getting involved.\n\nTo run Django's test suite:\n\n* Follow the instructions in the \"Unit tests\" section of\n  ``docs/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests.txt``, published online at\n  https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-the-unit-tests\n\nSupporting the Development of Django\n====================================\n\nDjango's development depends on your contributions.\n\nIf you depend on Django, remember to support the Django Software Foundation: https://www.djangoproject.com/fundraising/\n"

Projects maintainers commit to:\n\n- maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident\n- to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation when required.\n\n### Foundation Spaces\n\nFor reporting issues in spaces managed by the OpenJS Foundation, for example, repositories within the OpenJS organization, use the email `report@lists.openjsf.org`.\nThe Cross Project Council (CPC) is responsible for managing these reports and commits to:\n\n- maintain the confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident\n- to participate in the path for escalation as outlined in the section on Escalation when required.\n\n## Escalation\n\nThe OpenJS Foundation maintains a Code of Conduct Panel (CoCP).\nThis is a foundation-wide team established to manage escalation when a reporter believes that a report to a member project or the CPC has not been properly handled.\nIn order to escalate to the CoCP send an email to `coc-escalation@lists.openjsf.org`.\n\nFor more information, refer to the full [Code of Conduct governance document](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n---\n\n# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\nWe pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\n\n* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\n* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\n* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\n* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience\n* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind\n* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Enforcement Responsibilities\n\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.\nExamples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [@ljharb](ljharb@gmail.com).\nAll complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\n\n## Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 2.1, available at\n[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct.html][v2.1].\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by\n[Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder][Mozilla CoC].\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\n[https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq][FAQ].

          "content": "# Contributing\n\n:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute to `nvm`! :tada::+1:\n\nWe love pull requests and issues, they're our favorite.\n\nThe following is a set of guidelines for contributing to `nvm` managed by [@LJHarb](https://github.com/ljharb), which is hosted on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.\n\nHowever, before submitting, please review the following:\n\n# How Can I Contribute?\n\nThere are lots of ways to get involved. Here are some suggestions of things we'd love some help with.\n\n## Resolving existing issues\n\nYou can consider helping out with issues already requiring attention - look for a \"help wanted\" label.\n\n### How Do I Submit a (Good) Bug Report? :bug:\n\nExplain the problem and include additional details to help maintainers reproduce the problem:\n\n* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.\n\n* **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible. For example, start by explaining which command exactly you used in the terminal. When listing steps, **don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it**. For example, if you moved the cursor to the end of a line, explain if you used the mouse, or a keyboard shortcut or a command, and if so which one?\n* **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or Github projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).\n* **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.\n* **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**\n* **Provide as much context as possible** in order to help others verify and ultimately fix the issue. This includes giving us as much details as possible about your environment, so we can more easily confirm the problem.\n\n## Documentation\n\nWe are happy to welcome contributions from anyone willing to improve documentation by adding missing information or making it more consistent and coherent.\n\n# Dev Environment\n\nPlease refer to the [README](README.md) for complete instructions how to install, update, as well as troubleshoot `nvm` in your environment depending on your Operating System.\n\n# Style Guide / Coding conventions\n\n### Pull requests\n\n#### Before creating a pull request\n\n  - Please include tests. Changes with tests will be merged very quickly.\n  - Please manually confirm that your changes work in `bash`, `sh`/`dash`, `ksh`, and `zsh`. Fast tests do run in these shells, but it's nice to manually verify also.\n  - Please maintain consistent whitespace - 2-space indentation, trailing newlines in all files, etc.\n  - Any time you make a change to your PR, please rebase freshly on top of the default branch. Nobody likes merge commits.\n\nEven if you don't have all of these items covered, please still feel free to submit a PR/issue! Someone else may be inspired and volunteer to complete it for you.\n\n#### How to create a pull request\n\nCreate a new branch\n\n```\ngit checkout -b issue1234\n```\n\nCommit the changes to your branch, including a coherent commit message that follows our [standards](#commit-messages)\n\n```\ngit commit -a\n```\n\nBefore sending the pull request, make sure your code is running on the latest available code by rebasing onto the upstream source\n\n```\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/main\n```\n\nVerify your changes\n\n```\nnpm test\n```\n\nPush your changes\n\n```\ngit push origin issue1234\n```\n\nSend the [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests), make requested changes, and get merged.\n\n### Commit Messages\n\n* Limit the first line of the commit message (message summary) to 72 characters or less.\n* Use the present tense (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\") and imperative mood (\"Move cursor to...\" not \"Moves cursor to...\") when providing a description of what you did.\n* If your PR addresses an issue, reference it in the body of the commit message.\n* See the rest of the conventions [here](https://gist.github.com/ljharb/772b0334387a4bee89af24183114b3c7)\n\n#### Commit message example\n\n```\n[Tag]: Short description of what you did\n\nLonger description here if necessary\n\nFixes #1234\n```\n\n> **Note:**  Add co-authors to your commit message for commits with multiple authors\n\n```\nCo-authored-by: Name Here <email@here>\n```\n\n\n# Code of Conduct\n[Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n# Where can I ask for help?\nIf you have any questions, please contact [@LJHarb](mailto:ljharb@gmail.com).\n\n# Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1\n\nBy making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n  - The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or\n  - The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or\n  - The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.\n  - I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s) involved.\n"

Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.\n\n## Section 1: Scope\n\n`nvm` is a node version manager, focused on making it easy to install and manage multiple Node.js versions. Any features related to managing the installation and removal of Node.js on any node-supported platform are potentially in scope.\n\n## Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.\n\nTechnical leadership for the projects within the [OpenJS Foundation][openjs foundation] is delegated to the projects through their project charters by the [OpenJS Foundation Cross-Project Council](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/) (CPC). In the case of the `nvm` project, it is delegated to the [`nvm` Maintainers](README.md#maintainers) (the “Maintainers”). The OpenJS Foundation's business leadership is the Board of Directors (the “Board”).\n\nThis `nvm` Charter reflects a carefully constructed balanced role for the Maintainers and the CPC in the governance of the OpenJS Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the Maintainers to propose changes using simple majority of the full Maintainers, the proposed changes being subject to review and approval by the CPC. The CPC may additionally make amendments to the project charter at any time, though the CPC will not interfere with day-to-day discussions, votes or meetings of the Maintainers.\n\n### 2.1 Other Formal Project Relationships\n\nSection Intentionally Left Blank\n\n## Section 3: `nvm`'s Maintainers Governing Body\n\n`nvm` is governed by its [maintainers](README.md#maintainers).\n\n## Section 4: Roles & Responsibilities\n\nThe roles and responsibilities of `nvm`'s Maintainers are described in [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md).\n\n### Section 4.1 Project Operations & Management\n\nSection Intentionally Left Blank\n\n### Section 4.2: Decision-making, Voting, and/or Elections\n\nSection Intentionally Left Blank\n\n### Section 4.3: Other Project Roles\n\nSection Intentionally Left Blank\n\n## Section 5: Definitions\n\n  - *Contributors*: contribute code or other artifacts, but do not have the right to commit to the codebase. Contributors work with the project’s maintainers to have code committed to the code base. A Contributor may be promoted to a Maintainer by the Maintainers. Contributors should rarely be encumbered by the Maintainers and never by the CPC or OpenJS Foundation Board.\n\n  - *Maintainers*: Contributors with any kind of decision-making authority in the project.\n\n[openjs foundation]: https://openjsf.org\n"

To do that, you may either download and run the script manually, or use the following cURL or Wget command:\n```sh\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash\n```\n```sh\nwget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash\n```\n\nRunning either of the above commands downloads a script and runs it. The script clones the nvm repository to `~/.nvm`, and attempts to add the source lines from the snippet below to the correct profile file (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).\n\n<a id=\"profile_snippet\"></a>\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$([ -z \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME-}\" ] && printf %s \"${HOME}/.nvm\" || printf %s \"${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/nvm\")\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" # This loads nvm\n```\n\n#### Additional Notes\n\n- If the environment variable `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is present, it will place the `nvm` files there.</sub>\n\n- You can add `--no-use` to the end of the above script (...`nvm.sh --no-use`) to postpone using `nvm` until you manually [`use`](#usage) it.\n\n- You can customize the install source, directory, profile, and version using the `NVM_SOURCE`, `NVM_DIR`, `PROFILE`, and `NODE_VERSION` variables.\nEg: `curl ... | NVM_DIR=\"path/to/nvm\"`. Ensure that the `NVM_DIR` does not contain a trailing slash.\n\n- The installer can use `git`, `curl`, or `wget` to download `nvm`, whichever is available.\n\n- You can instruct the installer to not edit your shell config (for example if you already get completions via a [zsh nvm plugin](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/nvm)) by setting `PROFILE=/dev/null` before running the `install.sh` script. Here's an example one-line command to do that: `PROFILE=/dev/null bash -c 'curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash'`\n\n#### Troubleshooting on Linux\n\nOn Linux, after running the install script, if you get `nvm: command not found` or see no feedback from your terminal after you type `command -v nvm`, simply close your current terminal, open a new terminal, and try verifying again.\nAlternatively, you can run the following commands for the different shells on the command line:\n\n*bash*: `source ~/.bashrc`\n\n*zsh*: `source ~/.zshrc`\n\n*ksh*: `. ~/.profile`\n\nThese should pick up the `nvm` command.\n\n#### Troubleshooting on macOS\n\nSince OS X 10.9, `/usr/bin/git` has been preset by Xcode command line tools, which means we can't properly detect if Git is installed or not. You need to manually install the Xcode command line tools before running the install script, otherwise, it'll fail. (see [#1782](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/1782))\n\nIf you get `nvm: command not found` after running the install script, one of the following might be the reason:\n\n  - Since macOS 10.15, the default shell is `zsh` and nvm will look for `.zshrc` to update, none is installed by default. Create one with `touch ~/.zshrc` and run the install script again.\n\n  - If you use bash, the previous default shell, your system may not have `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` files where the command is set up. Create one of them with `touch ~/.bash_profile` or `touch ~/.bashrc` and run the install script again. Then, run `. ~/.bash_profile` or `. ~/.bashrc` to pick up the `nvm` command.\n\n  - You have previously used `bash`, but you have `zsh` installed. You need to manually add [these lines](#manual-install) to `~/.zshrc` and run `. ~/.zshrc`.\n\n  - You might need to restart your terminal instance or run `. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh`. Restarting your terminal/opening a new tab/window, or running the source command will load the command and the new configuration.\n\n  - If the above didn't help, you might need to restart your terminal instance. Try opening a new tab/window in your terminal and retry.\n\nIf the above doesn't fix the problem, you may try the following:\n\n  - If you use bash, it may be that your `.bash_profile` (or `~/.profile`) does not source your `~/.bashrc` properly. You could fix this by adding `source ~/<your_profile_file>` to it or following the next step below.\n\n  - Try adding [the snippet from the install section](#profile_snippet), that finds the correct nvm directory and loads nvm, to your usual profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`).\n\n  - For more information about this issue and possible workarounds, please [refer here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/576)\n\n**Note** For Macs with the Apple Silicon chip, node started offering **arm64** arch Darwin packages since v16.0.0 and experimental **arm64** support when compiling from source since v14.17.0. If you are facing issues installing node using `nvm`, you may want to update to one of those versions or later.\n\n#### Ansible\n\nYou can use a task:\n\n```yaml\n- name: Install nvm\n  ansible.builtin.shell: >\n    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash\n  args:\n    creates: \"{{ ansible_env.HOME }}/.nvm/nvm.sh\"\n```\n\n### Verify Installation\n\nTo verify that nvm has been installed, do:\n\n```sh\ncommand -v nvm\n```\n\nwhich should output `nvm` if the installation was successful. Please note that `which nvm` will not work, since `nvm` is a sourced shell function, not an executable binary.\n\n**Note:** On Linux, after running the install script, if you get `nvm: command not found` or see no feedback from your terminal after you type `command -v nvm`, simply close your current terminal, open a new terminal, and try verifying again.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nIf you're running a system without prepackaged binary available, which means you're going to install node or io.js from its source code, you need to make sure your system has a C++ compiler. For OS X, Xcode will work, for Debian/Ubuntu based GNU/Linux, the `build-essential` and `libssl-dev` packages work.\n\n**Note:** `nvm` also supports Windows in some cases. It should work through WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) depending on the version of WSL. It should also work with [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/) (MSYS) or [Cygwin](https://cygwin.com). Otherwise, for Windows, a few alternatives exist, which are neither supported nor developed by us:\n\n  - [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)\n  - [nodist](https://github.com/marcelklehr/nodist)\n  - [nvs](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs)\n\n**Note:** `nvm` does not support [Fish] either (see [#303](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/303)). Alternatives exist, which are neither supported nor developed by us:\n\n  - [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) allows you to use utilities written for Bash in fish shell\n  - [fast-nvm-fish](https://github.com/brigand/fast-nvm-fish) only works with version numbers (not aliases) but doesn't significantly slow your shell startup\n  - [plugin-nvm](https://github.com/derekstavis/plugin-nvm) plugin for [Oh My Fish](https://github.com/oh-my-fish/oh-my-fish), which makes nvm and its completions available in fish shell\n  - [fnm](https://github.com/fisherman/fnm) - [fisherman](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman)-based version manager for fish\n  - [fish-nvm](https://github.com/FabioAntunes/fish-nvm) - Wrapper around nvm for fish, delays sourcing nvm until it's actually used.\n\n**Note:** We still have some problems with FreeBSD, because there is no official pre-built binary for FreeBSD, and building from source may need [patches](https://www.freshports.org/www/node/files/patch-deps_v8_src_base_platform_platform-posix.cc); see the issue ticket:\n\n  - [[#900] [Bug] node on FreeBSD may need to be patched](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/900)\n  - [nodejs/node#3716](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/3716)\n\n**Note:** On OS X, if you do not have Xcode installed and you do not wish to download the ~4.3GB file, you can install the `Command Line Tools`. You can check out this blog post on how to just that:\n\n  - [How to Install Command Line Tools in OS X Mavericks & Yosemite (Without Xcode)](https://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/)\n\n**Note:** On OS X, if you have/had a \"system\" node installed and want to install modules globally, keep in mind that:\n\n  - When using `nvm` you do not need `sudo` to globally install a module with `npm -g`, so instead of doing `sudo npm install -g grunt`, do instead `npm install -g grunt`\n  - If you have an `~/.npmrc` file, make sure it does not contain any `prefix` settings (which is not compatible with `nvm`)\n  - You can (but should not?) keep your previous \"system\" node install, but `nvm` will only be available to your user account (the one used to install nvm). This might cause version mismatches, as other users will be using `/usr/local/lib/node_modules/*` VS your user account using `~/.nvm/versions/node/vX.X.X/lib/node_modules/*`\n\nHomebrew installation is not supported. If you have issues with homebrew-installed `nvm`, please `brew uninstall` it, and install it using the instructions below, before filing an issue.\n\n**Note:** If you're using `zsh` you can easily install `nvm` as a zsh plugin. Install [`zsh-nvm`](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-nvm) and run `nvm upgrade` to upgrade.\n\n**Note:** Git versions before v1.7 may face a problem of cloning `nvm` source from GitHub via https protocol, and there is also different behavior of git before v1.6, and git prior to [v1.17.10](https://github.com/git/git/commit/5a7d5b683f869d3e3884a89775241afa515da9e7) can not clone tags, so the minimum required git version is v1.7.10. If you are interested in the problem we mentioned here, please refer to GitHub's [HTTPS cloning errors](https://help.github.com/articles/https-cloning-errors/) article.\n\n### Git Install\n\nIf you have `git` installed (requires git v1.7.10+):\n\n1. clone this repo in the root of your user profile\n    - `cd ~/` from anywhere then `git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git .nvm`\n1. `cd ~/.nvm` and check out the latest version with `git checkout v0.40.1`\n1. activate `nvm` by sourcing it from your shell: `. ./nvm.sh`\n\nNow add these lines to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc` file to have it automatically sourced upon login:\n(you may have to add to more than one of the above files)\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"  # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"  # This loads nvm bash_completion\n```\n\n### Manual Install\n\nFor a fully manual install, execute the following lines to first clone the `nvm` repository into `$HOME/.nvm`, and then load `nvm`:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\" && (\n  git clone https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git \"$NVM_DIR\"\n  cd \"$NVM_DIR\"\n  git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags --match \"v[0-9]*\" $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)`\n) && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"\n```\n\nNow add these lines to your `~/.bashrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.zshrc` file to have it automatically sourced upon login:\n(you may have to add to more than one of the above files)\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" # This loads nvm\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/bash_completion\"  # This loads nvm bash_completion\n```\n\n### Manual Upgrade\n\nFor manual upgrade with `git` (requires git v1.7.10+):\n\n1. change to the `$NVM_DIR`\n1. pull down the latest changes\n1. check out the latest version\n1. activate the new version\n\n```sh\n(\n  cd \"$NVM_DIR\"\n  git fetch --tags origin\n  git checkout `git describe --abbrev=0 --tags --match \"v[0-9]*\" $(git rev-list --tags --max-count=1)`\n) && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\"\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nTo download, compile, and install the latest release of node, do this:\n\n```sh\nnvm install node # \"node\" is an alias for the latest version\n```\n\nTo install a specific version of node:\n\n```sh\nnvm install 14.7.0 # or 16.3.0, 12.22.1, etc\n```\n\nTo set an alias:\n\n```sh\nnvm alias my_alias v14.4.0\n```\nMake sure that your alias does not contain any spaces or slashes.\n\nThe first version installed becomes the default. New shells will start with the default version of node (e.g., `nvm alias default`).\n\nYou can list available versions using `ls-remote`:\n\n```sh\nnvm ls-remote\n```\n\nAnd then in any new shell just use the installed version:\n\n```sh\nnvm use node\n```\n\nOr you can just run it:\n\n```sh\nnvm run node --version\n```\n\nOr, you can run any arbitrary command in a subshell with the desired version of node:\n\n```sh\nnvm exec 4.2 node --version\n```\n\nYou can also get the path to the executable to where it was installed:\n\n```sh\nnvm which 12.22\n```\n\nIn place of a version pointer like \"14.7\" or \"16.3\" or \"12.22.1\", you can use the following special default aliases with `nvm install`, `nvm use`, `nvm run`, `nvm exec`, `nvm which`, etc:\n\n  - `node`: this installs the latest version of [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/)\n  - `iojs`: this installs the latest version of [`io.js`](https://iojs.org/en/)\n  - `stable`: this alias is deprecated, and only truly applies to `node` `v0.12` and earlier. Currently, this is an alias for `node`.\n  - `unstable`: this alias points to `node` `v0.11` - the last \"unstable\" node release, since post-1.0, all node versions are stable. (in SemVer, versions communicate breakage, not stability).\n\n### Long-term Support\n\nNode has a [schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) for long-term support (LTS) You can reference LTS versions in aliases and `.nvmrc` files with the notation `lts/*` for the latest LTS, and `lts/argon` for LTS releases from the \"argon\" line, for example. In addition, the following commands support LTS arguments:\n\n  - `nvm install --lts` / `nvm install --lts=argon` / `nvm install 'lts/*'` / `nvm install lts/argon`\n  - `nvm uninstall --lts` / `nvm uninstall --lts=argon` / `nvm uninstall 'lts/*'` / `nvm uninstall lts/argon`\n  - `nvm use --lts` / `nvm use --lts=argon` / `nvm use 'lts/*'` / `nvm use lts/argon`\n  - `nvm exec --lts` / `nvm exec --lts=argon` / `nvm exec 'lts/*'` / `nvm exec lts/argon`\n  - `nvm run --lts` / `nvm run --lts=argon` / `nvm run 'lts/*'` / `nvm run lts/argon`\n  - `nvm ls-remote --lts` / `nvm ls-remote --lts=argon` `nvm ls-remote 'lts/*'` / `nvm ls-remote lts/argon`\n  - `nvm version-remote --lts` / `nvm version-remote --lts=argon` / `nvm version-remote 'lts/*'` / `nvm version-remote lts/argon`\n\nAny time your local copy of `nvm` connects to https://nodejs.org, it will re-create the appropriate local aliases for all available LTS lines. These aliases (stored under `$NVM_DIR/alias/lts`), are managed by `nvm`, and you should not modify, remove, or create these files - expect your changes to be undone, and expect meddling with these files to cause bugs that will likely not be supported.\n\nTo get the latest LTS version of node and migrate your existing installed packages, use\n\n```sh\nnvm install --reinstall-packages-from=current 'lts/*'\n```\n\n### Migrating Global Packages While Installing\n\nIf you want to install a new version of Node.js and migrate npm packages from a previous version:\n\n```sh\nnvm install --reinstall-packages-from=node node\n```\n\nThis will first use \"nvm version node\" to identify the current version you're migrating packages from. Then it resolves the new version to install from the remote server and installs it. Lastly, it runs \"nvm reinstall-packages\" to reinstall the npm packages from your prior version of Node to the new one.\n\nYou can also install and migrate npm packages from specific versions of Node like this:\n\n```sh\nnvm install --reinstall-packages-from=5 6\nnvm install --reinstall-packages-from=iojs v4.2\n```\n\nNote that reinstalling packages _explicitly does not update the npm version_ — this is to ensure that npm isn't accidentally upgraded to a broken version for the new node version.\n\nTo update npm at the same time add the `--latest-npm` flag, like this:\n\n```sh\nnvm install --reinstall-packages-from=default --latest-npm 'lts/*'\n```\n\nor, you can at any time run the following command to get the latest supported npm version on the current node version:\n```sh\nnvm install-latest-npm\n```\n\nIf you've already gotten an error to the effect of \"npm does not support Node.js\", you'll need to (1) revert to a previous node version (`nvm ls` & `nvm use <your latest _working_ version from the ls>`), (2) delete the newly created node version (`nvm uninstall <your _broken_ version of node from the ls>`), then (3) rerun your `nvm install` with the `--latest-npm` flag.\n\n\n### Default Global Packages From File While Installing\n\nIf you have a list of default packages you want installed every time you install a new version, we support that too -- just add the package names, one per line, to the file `$NVM_DIR/default-packages`. You can add anything npm would accept as a package argument on the command line.\n\n```sh\n# $NVM_DIR/default-packages\n\nrimraf\nobject-inspect@1.0.2\nstevemao/left-pad\n```\n\n### io.js\n\nIf you want to install [io.js](https://github.com/iojs/io.js/):\n\n```sh\nnvm install iojs\n```\n\nIf you want to install a new version of io.js and migrate npm packages from a previous version:\n\n```sh\nnvm install --reinstall-packages-from=iojs iojs\n```\n\nThe same guidelines mentioned for migrating npm packages in node are applicable to io.js.\n\n### System Version of Node\n\nIf you want to use the system-installed version of node, you can use the special default alias \"system\":\n\n```sh\nnvm use system\nnvm run system --version\n```\n\n### Listing Versions\n\nIf you want to see what versions are installed:\n\n```sh\nnvm ls\n```\n\nIf you want to see what versions are available to install:\n\n```sh\nnvm ls-remote\n```\n\n### Setting Custom Colors\n\nYou can set five colors that will be used to display version and alias information. These colors replace the default colors.\n  Initial colors are: g b y r e\n\n  Color codes:\n\n    r/R = red / bold red\n\n    g/G = green / bold green\n\n    b/B = blue / bold blue\n\n    c/C = cyan / bold cyan\n\n    m/M = magenta / bold magenta\n\n    y/Y = yellow / bold yellow\n\n    k/K = black / bold black\n\n    e/W = light grey / white\n\n```sh\nnvm set-colors rgBcm\n```\n\n#### Persisting custom colors\n\nIf you want the custom colors to persist after terminating the shell, export the `NVM_COLORS` variable in your shell profile. For example, if you want to use cyan, magenta, green, bold red and bold yellow, add the following line:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_COLORS='cmgRY'\n```\n\n#### Suppressing colorized output\n\n`nvm help (or -h or --help)`, `nvm ls`, `nvm ls-remote` and `nvm alias` usually produce colorized output. You can disable colors with the `--no-colors` option (or by setting the environment variable `TERM=dumb`):\n\n```sh\nnvm ls --no-colors\nnvm help --no-colors\nTERM=dumb nvm ls\n```\n\n### Restoring PATH\nTo restore your PATH, you can deactivate it:\n\n```sh\nnvm deactivate\n```\n\n### Set default node version\nTo set a default Node version to be used in any new shell, use the alias 'default':\n\n```sh\nnvm alias default node # this refers to the latest installed version of node\nnvm alias default 18 # this refers to the latest installed v18.x version of node\nnvm alias default 18.12  # this refers to the latest installed v18.12.x version of node\n```\n\n### Use a mirror of node binaries\nTo use a mirror of the node binaries, set `$NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR`:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist\nnvm install node\n\nNVM_NODEJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://nodejs.org/dist nvm install 4.2\n```\n\nTo use a mirror of the io.js binaries, set `$NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR`:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist\nnvm install iojs-v1.0.3\n\nNVM_IOJS_ORG_MIRROR=https://iojs.org/dist nvm install iojs-v1.0.3\n```\n\n`nvm use` will not, by default, create a \"current\" symlink. Set `$NVM_SYMLINK_CURRENT` to \"true\" to enable this behavior, which is sometimes useful for IDEs. Note that using `nvm` in multiple shell tabs with this environment variable enabled can cause race conditions.\n\n#### Pass Authorization header to mirror\nTo pass an Authorization header through to the mirror url, set `$NVM_AUTH_HEADER`\n\n```sh\nNVM_AUTH_HEADER=\"Bearer secret-token\" nvm install node\n```\n\n### .nvmrc\n\nYou can create a `.nvmrc` file containing a node version number (or any other string that `nvm` understands; see `nvm --help` for details) in the project root directory (or any parent directory).\nAfterwards, `nvm use`, `nvm install`, `nvm exec`, `nvm run`, and `nvm which` will use the version specified in the `.nvmrc` file if no version is supplied on the command line.\n\nFor example, to make nvm default to the latest 5.9 release, the latest LTS version, or the latest node version for the current directory:\n\n```sh\n$ echo \"5.9\" > .nvmrc\n\n$ echo \"lts/*\" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest LTS version\n\n$ echo \"node\" > .nvmrc # to default to the latest version\n```\n\n[NB these examples assume a POSIX-compliant shell version of `echo`. If you use a Windows `cmd` development environment, eg the `.nvmrc` file is used to configure a remote Linux deployment, then keep in mind the `\"`s will be copied leading to an invalid file. Remove them.]\n\nThen when you run nvm use:\n\n```sh\n$ nvm use\nFound '/path/to/project/.nvmrc' with version <5.9>\nNow using node v5.9.1 (npm v3.7.3)\n```\n\nRunning nvm install will also switch over to the correct version, but if the correct node version isn't already installed, it will install it for you.\n\n```sh\n$ nvm install\nFound '/path/to/project/.nvmrc' with version <5.9>\nDownloading and installing node v5.9.1...\nDownloading https://nodejs.org/dist/v5.9.1/node-v5.9.1-linux-x64.tar.xz...\n#################################################################################### 100.0%\nComputing checksum with sha256sum\nChecksums matched!\nNow using node v5.9.1 (npm v3.7.3)\n```\n\n`nvm use` et. al. will traverse directory structure upwards from the current directory looking for the `.nvmrc` file. In other words, running `nvm use` et. al. in any subdirectory of a directory with an `.nvmrc` will result in that `.nvmrc` being utilized.\n\nThe contents of a `.nvmrc` file **must** contain precisely one `<version>` (as described by `nvm --help`) followed by a newline. `.nvmrc` files may also have comments. The comment delimiter is `#`, and it and any text after it, as well as blank lines, and leading and trailing white space, will be ignored when parsing.\n\nKey/value pairs using `=` are also allowed and ignored, but are reserved for future use, and may cause validation errors in the future.\n\nRun [`npx nvmrc`](https://npmjs.com/nvmrc) to validate an `.nvmrc` file. If that tool’s results do not agree with nvm, one or the other has a bug - please file an issue.\n\n### Deeper Shell Integration\n\nYou can use [`avn`](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn) to deeply integrate into your shell and automatically invoke `nvm` when changing directories. `avn` is **not** supported by the `nvm` maintainers. Please [report issues to the `avn` team](https://github.com/wbyoung/avn/issues/new).\n\nYou can also use [`nvshim`](https://github.com/iamogbz/nvshim) to shim the `node`, `npm`, and `npx` bins to automatically use the `nvm` config in the current directory. `nvshim` is **not** supported by the `nvm` maintainers. Please [report issues to the `nvshim` team](https://github.com/iamogbz/nvshim/issues/new).\n\nIf you prefer a lighter-weight solution, the recipes below have been contributed by `nvm` users. They are **not** supported by the `nvm` maintainers. We are, however, accepting pull requests for more examples.\n\n#### Calling `nvm use` automatically in a directory with a `.nvmrc` file\n\nIn your profile (`~/.bash_profile`, `~/.zshrc`, `~/.profile`, or `~/.bashrc`), add the following to `nvm use` whenever you enter a new directory:\n\n##### bash\n\nPut the following at the end of your `$HOME/.bashrc`:\n\n```bash\ncdnvm() {\n    command cd \"$@\" || return $?\n    nvm_path=\"$(nvm_find_up .nvmrc | command tr -d '\\n')\"\n\n    # If there are no .nvmrc file, use the default nvm version\n    if [[ ! $nvm_path = *[^[:space:]]* ]]; then\n\n        declare default_version\n        default_version=\"$(nvm version default)\"\n\n        # If there is no default version, set it to `node`\n        # This will use the latest version on your machine\n        if [ $default_version = 'N/A' ]; then\n            nvm alias default node\n            default_version=$(nvm version default)\n        fi\n\n        # If the current version is not the default version, set it to use the default version\n        if [ \"$(nvm current)\" != \"${default_version}\" ]; then\n            nvm use default\n        fi\n    elif [[ -s \"${nvm_path}/.nvmrc\" && -r \"${nvm_path}/.nvmrc\" ]]; then\n        declare nvm_version\n        nvm_version=$(<\"${nvm_path}\"/.nvmrc)\n\n        declare locally_resolved_nvm_version\n        # `nvm ls` will check all locally-available versions\n        # If there are multiple matching versions, take the latest one\n        # Remove the `->` and `*` characters and spaces\n        # `locally_resolved_nvm_version` will be `N/A` if no local versions are found\n        locally_resolved_nvm_version=$(nvm ls --no-colors \"${nvm_version}\" | command tail -1 | command tr -d '\\->*' | command tr -d '[:space:]')\n\n        # If it is not already installed, install it\n        # `nvm install` will implicitly use the newly-installed version\n        if [ \"${locally_resolved_nvm_version}\" = 'N/A' ]; then\n            nvm install \"${nvm_version}\";\n        elif [ \"$(nvm current)\" != \"${locally_resolved_nvm_version}\" ]; then\n            nvm use \"${nvm_version}\";\n        fi\n    fi\n}\n\nalias cd='cdnvm'\ncdnvm \"$PWD\" || exit\n```\n\nThis alias would search 'up' from your current directory in order to detect a `.nvmrc` file. If it finds it, it will switch to that version; if not, it will use the default version.\n\n##### zsh\n\nThis shell function will install (if needed) and `nvm use` the specified Node version when an `.nvmrc` is found, and `nvm use default` otherwise.\n\nPut this into your `$HOME/.zshrc` to call `nvm use` automatically whenever you enter a directory that contains an\n`.nvmrc` file with a string telling nvm which node to `use`:\n\n```zsh\n# place this after nvm initialization!\nautoload -U add-zsh-hook\n\nload-nvmrc() {\n  local nvmrc_path\n  nvmrc_path=\"$(nvm_find_nvmrc)\"\n\n  if [ -n \"$nvmrc_path\" ]; then\n    local nvmrc_node_version\n    nvmrc_node_version=$(nvm version \"$(cat \"${nvmrc_path}\")\")\n\n    if [ \"$nvmrc_node_version\" = \"N/A\" ]; then\n      nvm install\n    elif [ \"$nvmrc_node_version\" != \"$(nvm version)\" ]; then\n      nvm use\n    fi\n  elif [ -n \"$(PWD=$OLDPWD nvm_find_nvmrc)\" ] && [ \"$(nvm version)\" != \"$(nvm version default)\" ]; then\n    echo \"Reverting to nvm default version\"\n    nvm use default\n  fi\n}\n\nadd-zsh-hook chpwd load-nvmrc\nload-nvmrc\n```\n\n##### fish\n\nThis requires that you have [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) installed.\n```fish\n# ~/.config/fish/functions/nvm.fish\nfunction nvm\n  bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm $argv\nend\n\n# ~/.config/fish/functions/nvm_find_nvmrc.fish\nfunction nvm_find_nvmrc\n  bass source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh --no-use ';' nvm_find_nvmrc\nend\n\n# ~/.config/fish/functions/load_nvm.fish\nfunction load_nvm --on-variable=\"PWD\"\n  set -l default_node_version (nvm version default)\n  set -l node_version (nvm version)\n  set -l nvmrc_path (nvm_find_nvmrc)\n  if test -n \"$nvmrc_path\"\n    set -l nvmrc_node_version (nvm version (cat $nvmrc_path))\n    if test \"$nvmrc_node_version\" = \"N/A\"\n      nvm install (cat $nvmrc_path)\n    else if test \"$nvmrc_node_version\" != \"$node_version\"\n      nvm use $nvmrc_node_version\n    end\n  else if test \"$node_version\" != \"$default_node_version\"\n    echo \"Reverting to default Node version\"\n    nvm use default\n  end\nend\n\n# ~/.config/fish/config.fish\n# You must call it on initialization or listening to directory switching won't work\nload_nvm > /dev/stderr\n```\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTests are written in [Urchin]. Install Urchin (and other dependencies) like so:\n\n    npm install\n\nThere are slow tests and fast tests. The slow tests do things like install node\nand check that the right versions are used. The fast tests fake this to test\nthings like aliases and uninstalling. From the root of the nvm git repository,\nrun the fast tests like this:\n\n    npm run test/fast\n\nRun the slow tests like this:\n\n    npm run test/slow\n\nRun all of the tests like this:\n\n    npm test\n\nNota bene: Avoid running nvm while the tests are running.\n\n## Environment variables\n\nnvm exposes the following environment variables:\n\n- `NVM_DIR` - nvm's installation directory.\n- `NVM_BIN` - where node, npm, and global packages for the active version of node are installed.\n- `NVM_INC` - node's include file directory (useful for building C/C++ addons for node).\n- `NVM_CD_FLAGS` - used to maintain compatibility with zsh.\n- `NVM_RC_VERSION` - version from .nvmrc file if being used.\n\nAdditionally, nvm modifies `PATH`, and, if present, `MANPATH` and `NODE_PATH` when changing versions.\n\n\n## Bash Completion\n\nTo activate, you need to source `bash_completion`:\n\n```sh\n[[ -r $NVM_DIR/bash_completion ]] && \\. $NVM_DIR/bash_completion\n```\n\nPut the above sourcing line just below the sourcing line for nvm in your profile (`.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`).\n\n### Usage\n\nnvm:\n\n> `$ nvm` <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n```sh\nalias               deactivate          install             list-remote         reinstall-packages  uninstall           version\ncache               exec                install-latest-npm  ls                  run                 unload              version-remote\ncurrent             help                list                ls-remote           unalias             use                 which\n```\n\nnvm alias:\n\n> `$ nvm alias` <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n```sh\ndefault      iojs         lts/*        lts/argon    lts/boron    lts/carbon   lts/dubnium  lts/erbium   node         stable       unstable\n```\n\n\n> `$ nvm alias my_alias` <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n```sh\nv10.22.0       v12.18.3      v14.8.0\n```\n\nnvm use:\n> `$ nvm use` <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n\n```\nmy_alias        default        v10.22.0       v12.18.3      v14.8.0\n```\n\nnvm uninstall:\n> `$ nvm uninstall` <kbd>Tab</kbd>\n\n```\nmy_alias        default        v10.22.0       v12.18.3      v14.8.0\n```\n\n## Compatibility Issues\n\n`nvm` will encounter some issues if you have some non-default settings set. (see [#606](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/issues/606))\nThe following are known to cause issues:\n\nInside `~/.npmrc`:\n\n```sh\nprefix='some/path'\n```\n\nEnvironment Variables:\n\n```sh\n$NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX\n$PREFIX\n```\n\nShell settings:\n\n```sh\nset -e\n```\n\n## Installing nvm on Alpine Linux\n\nIn order to provide the best performance (and other optimizations), nvm will download and install pre-compiled binaries for Node (and npm) when you run `nvm install X`. The Node project compiles, tests and hosts/provides these pre-compiled binaries which are built for mainstream/traditional Linux distributions (such as Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RedHat et al).\n\nAlpine Linux, unlike mainstream/traditional Linux distributions, is based on [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), a very compact (~5MB) Linux distribution. BusyBox (and thus Alpine Linux) uses a different C/C++ stack to most mainstream/traditional Linux distributions - [musl](https://www.musl-libc.org/). This makes binary programs built for such mainstream/traditional incompatible with Alpine Linux, thus we cannot simply `nvm install X` on Alpine Linux and expect the downloaded binary to run correctly - you'll likely see \"...does not exist\" errors if you try that.\n\nThere is a `-s` flag for `nvm install` which requests nvm download Node source and compile it locally.\n\nIf installing nvm on Alpine Linux *is* still what you want or need to do, you should be able to achieve this by running the following from you Alpine Linux shell, depending on which version you are using:\n\n### Alpine Linux 3.13+\n```sh\napk add -U curl bash ca-certificates openssl ncurses coreutils python3 make gcc g++ libgcc linux-headers grep util-linux binutils findutils\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n### Alpine Linux 3.5 - 3.12\n```sh\napk add -U curl bash ca-certificates openssl ncurses coreutils python2 make gcc g++ libgcc linux-headers grep util-linux binutils findutils\ncurl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n_Note: Alpine 3.5 can only install NodeJS versions up to v6.9.5, Alpine 3.6 can only install versions up to v6.10.3, Alpine 3.7 installs versions up to v8.9.3, Alpine 3.8 installs versions up to v8.14.0, Alpine 3.9 installs versions up to v10.19.0, Alpine 3.10 installs versions up to v10.24.1, Alpine 3.11 installs versions up to v12.22.6, Alpine 3.12 installs versions up to v12.22.12, Alpine 3.13 & 3.14 install versions up to v14.20.0, Alpine 3.15 & 3.16 install versions up to v16.16.0 (**These are all versions on the main branch**). Alpine 3.5 - 3.12 required the package `python2` to build NodeJS, as they are older versions to build. Alpine 3.13+ requires `python3` to successfully build newer NodeJS versions, but you can use `python2` with Alpine 3.13+ if you need to build versions of node supported in Alpine 3.5 - 3.15, you just need to specify what version of NodeJS you need to install in the package install script._\n\nThe Node project has some desire but no concrete plans (due to the overheads of building, testing and support) to offer Alpine-compatible binaries.\n\nAs a potential alternative, @mhart (a Node contributor) has some [Docker images for Alpine Linux with Node and optionally, npm, pre-installed](https://github.com/mhart/alpine-node).\n\n<a id=\"removal\"></a>\n## Uninstalling / Removal\n\n### Manual Uninstall\n\nTo remove `nvm` manually, execute the following:\n\nFirst, use `nvm unload` to remove the nvm command from your terminal session and delete the installation directory:\n\n```sh\n$ nvm_dir=\"${NVM_DIR:-~/.nvm}\"\n$ nvm unload\n$ rm -rf \"$nvm_dir\"\n```\n\nEdit `~/.bashrc` (or other shell resource config) and remove the lines below:\n\n```sh\nexport NVM_DIR=\"$HOME/.nvm\"\n[ -s \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" ] && \\. \"$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh\" # This loads nvm\n[[ -r $NVM_DIR/bash_completion ]] && \\. $NVM_DIR/bash_completion\n```\n\n## Docker For Development Environment\n\nTo make the development and testing work easier, we have a Dockerfile for development usage, which is based on Ubuntu 18.04 base image, prepared with essential and useful tools for `nvm` development, to build the docker image of the environment, run the docker command at the root of `nvm` repository:\n\n```sh\n$ docker build -t nvm-dev .\n```\n\nThis will package your current nvm repository with our pre-defined development environment into a docker image named `nvm-dev`, once it's built with success, validate your image via `docker images`:\n\n```sh\n$ docker images\n\nREPOSITORY         TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\nnvm-dev            latest              9ca4c57a97d8        7 days ago          650 MB\n```\n\nIf you got no error message, now you can easily involve in:\n\n```sh\n$ docker run -h nvm-dev -it nvm-dev\n\nnvm@nvm-dev:~/.nvm$\n```\n\nPlease note that it'll take about 8 minutes to build the image and the image size would be about 650MB, so it's not suitable for production usage.\n\nFor more information and documentation about docker, please refer to its official website:\n\n  - https://www.docker.com/\n  - https://docs.docker.com/\n\n## Problems\n\n  - If you try to install a node version and the installation fails, be sure to run `nvm cache clear` to delete cached node downloads, or you might get an error like the following:\n\n    curl: (33) HTTP server doesn't seem to support byte ranges. Cannot resume.\n\n  - Where's my `sudo node`? Check out [#43](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/43)\n\n  - After the v0.8.6 release of node, nvm tries to install from binary packages. But in some systems, the official binary packages don't work due to incompatibility of shared libs. In such cases, use `-s` option to force install from source:\n\n```sh\nnvm install -s 0.8.6\n```\n\n  - If setting the `default` alias does not establish the node version in new shells (i.e. `nvm current` yields `system`), ensure that the system's node `PATH` is set before the `nvm.sh` source line in your shell profile (see [#658](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/658))\n\n## macOS Troubleshooting\n\n**nvm node version not found in vim shell**\n\nIf you set node version to a version other than your system node version `nvm use 6.2.1` and open vim and run `:!node -v` you should see `v6.2.1` if you see your system version `v0.12.7`. You need to run:\n\n```shell\nsudo chmod ugo-x /usr/libexec/path_helper\n```\n\nMore on this issue in [dotphiles/dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh#mac-os-x).\n\n**nvm is not compatible with the npm config \"prefix\" option**\n\nSome solutions for this issue can be found [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/1245)\n\nThere is one more edge case causing this issue, and that's a **mismatch between the `$HOME` path and the user's home directory's actual name**.\n\nYou have to make sure that the user directory name in `$HOME` and the user directory name you'd see from running `ls /Users/` **are capitalized the same way** ([See this issue](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/2261)).\n\nTo change the user directory and/or account name follow the instructions [here](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201548)\n\n[1]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm.git\n[2]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/v0.40.1/install.sh\n[3]: https://app.travis-ci.com/nvm-sh/nvm\n[4]: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/releases/tag/v0.40.1\n[Urchin]: https://git.sdf.org/tlevine/urchin\n[Fish]: https://fishshell.com\n\n**Homebrew makes zsh directories unsecure**\n\n```shell\nzsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.\nIgnore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]? y\n```\n\nHomebrew causes insecure directories like `/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions` and `/usr/local/share/zsh`. This is **not** an `nvm` problem - it is a homebrew problem. Refer [here](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/issues/680) for some solutions related to the issue.\n\n**Macs with Apple Silicon chips**\n\nExperimental support for the Apple Silicon chip architecture was added in node.js v15.3 and full support was added in v16.0.\nBecause of this, if you try to install older versions of node as usual, you will probably experience either compilation errors when installing node or out-of-memory errors while running your code.\n\nSo, if you want to run a version prior to v16.0 on an Apple Silicon Mac, it may be best to compile node targeting the `x86_64` Intel architecture so that Rosetta 2 can translate the `x86_64` processor instructions to ARM-based Apple Silicon instructions.\nHere's what you will need to do:\n\n- Install Rosetta, if you haven't already done so\n\n  ```sh\n  $ softwareupdate --install-rosetta\n  ```\n\n  You might wonder, \"how will my Apple Silicon Mac know to use Rosetta for a version of node compiled for an Intel chip?\".\n  If an executable contains only Intel instructions, macOS will automatically use Rosetta to translate the instructions.\n\n- Open a shell that's running using Rosetta\n\n  ```sh\n  $ arch -x86_64 zsh\n  ```\n\n  Note: This same thing can also be accomplished by finding the Terminal or iTerm App in Finder, right clicking, selecting \"Get Info\", and then checking the box labeled \"Open using Rosetta\".\n\n  Note: This terminal session is now running in `zsh`.\n  If `zsh` is not the shell you typically use, `nvm` may not be `source`'d automatically like it probably is for your usual shell through your dotfiles.\n  If that's the case, make sure to source `nvm`.\n\n  ```sh\n  $ source \"${NVM_DIR}/nvm.sh\"\n  ```\n\n- Install whatever older version of node you are interested in. Let's use 12.22.1 as an example.\n  This will fetch the node source code and compile it, which will take several minutes.\n\n  ```sh\n  $ nvm install v12.22.1 --shared-zlib\n  ```\n\n  Note: You're probably curious why `--shared-zlib` is included.\n  There's a bug in recent versions of Apple's system `clang` compiler.\n  If one of these broken versions is installed on your system, the above step will likely still succeed even if you didn't include the `--shared-zlib` flag.\n  However, later, when you attempt to `npm install` something using your old version of node.js, you will see `incorrect data check` errors.\n  If you want to avoid the possible hassle of dealing with this, include that flag.\n  For more details, see [this issue](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/39313) and [this comment](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/39313#issuecomment-90.40.176)\n\n- Exit back to your native shell.\n\n  ```sh\n  $ exit\n  $ arch\n  arm64\n  ```\n\n  Note: If you selected the box labeled \"Open using Rosetta\" rather than running the CLI command in the second step, you will see `i386` here.\n  Unless you have another reason to have that box selected, you can deselect it now.\n\n- Check to make sure the architecture is correct. `x64` is the abbreviation for `x86_64`, which is what you want to see.\n\n  ```sh\n  $ node -p process.arch\n  x64\n  ```\n\nNow you should be able to use node as usual.\n\n## WSL Troubleshooting\n\nIf you've encountered this error on WSL-2:\n\n  ```sh\n  curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.1/install.sh | bash\n  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\n                                  Dload  Upload  Total   Spent    Left  Speed\n  0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:--  0:00:09 --:--:--     0curl: (6) Could not resolve host: raw.githubusercontent.com\n  ```\n\nIt may be due to your antivirus, VPN, or other reasons.\n\nWhere you can `ping 8.8.8.8` while you can't `ping google.com`\n\n\nThis could simply be solved by running this in your root directory:\n\n  ```sh\n  sudo rm /etc/resolv.conf\n  sudo bash -c 'echo \"nameserver 8.8.8.8\" > /etc/resolv.conf'\n  sudo bash -c 'echo \"[network]\" > /etc/wsl.conf'\n  sudo bash -c 'echo \"generateResolvConf = false\" >> /etc/wsl.conf'\n  sudo chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf\n  ```\n\nThis deletes your `resolv.conf` file that is automatically generated when you run WSL, creates a new file and puts `nameserver 8.8.8.8`, then creates a `wsl.conf` file and adds `[network]` and `generateResolveConf = false` to prevent auto-generation of that file.\n\nYou can check the contents of the file by running:\n\n  ```sh\n  cat /etc/resolv.conf\n  ```\n\n## Maintainers\n\nCurrently, the sole maintainer is [@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb) - more maintainers are quite welcome, and we hope to add folks to the team over time. [Governance](./GOVERNANCE.md) will be re-evaluated as the project evolves.\n\n## Project Support\n\nOnly the latest version (v0.40.1 at this time) is supported.\n\n## Enterprise Support\n\nIf you are unable to update to the latest version of `nvm`, our [partners](https://openjsf.org/ecosystem-sustainability-program) provide commercial security fixes for all unsupported versions:\n\n  - [HeroDevs Never-Ending Support](https://www.herodevs.com/support?utm_source=OpenJS&utm_medium=Link&utm_campaign=nvm_openjs)\n\n## License\n\nSee [LICENSE.md](./LICENSE.md).\n\n## Copyright notice\n\nCopyright [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) and `nvm` contributors.

It can be configured with\n# multiple users to run tasks in parallel. No sudo permission is required.\n#\n# https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/persistent-workers/\n#\n# Generally, a persistent worker must run Ubuntu 23.04+ or Debian 12+.\n#\n# The following specific types should exist, with the following requirements:\n# - small: For an x86_64 machine, with at least 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of memory.\n# - medium: For an x86_64 machine, with at least 4 vCPUs and 16 GB of memory.\n# - arm64: For an aarch64 machine, with at least 2 vCPUs and 8 GB of memory.\n#\n# CI jobs for the latter configuration can be run on x86_64 hardware\n# by installing qemu-user-static, which works out of the box with\n# podman or docker. Background: https://stackoverflow.com/a/72890225/313633\n#\n# The above machine types are matched to each task by their label. Refer to the\n# Cirrus CI docs for more details.\n#\n# When a contributor maintains a fork of the repo, any pull request they make\n# to their own fork, or to the main repository, will trigger two CI runs:\n# one for the branch push and one for the pull request.\n# This can be avoided by setting SKIP_BRANCH_PUSH=true as a custom env variable\n# in Cirrus repository settings, accessible from\n# https://cirrus-ci.com/github/my-organization/my-repository\n#\n# On machines that are persisted between CI jobs, RESTART_CI_DOCKER_BEFORE_RUN=1\n# ensures that previous containers and artifacts are cleared before each run.\n# This requires installing Podman instead of Docker.\n#\n# Futhermore:\n# - podman-docker-4.1+ is required due to the bugfix in 4.1\n#   (https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/21652#issuecomment-1657098200)\n# - The ./ci/ dependencies (with cirrus-cli) should be installed. One-liner example\n#   for a single user setup with sudo permission:\n#\n#   ```\n#   apt update && apt install git screen python3 bash podman-docker uidmap slirp4netns curl -y && curl -L -o cirrus \"https://github.com/cirruslabs/cirrus-cli/releases/latest/download/cirrus-linux-$(dpkg --print-architecture)\" && mv cirrus /usr/local/bin/cirrus && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/cirrus\n#   ```\n#\n# - There are no strict requirements on the hardware. Having fewer CPU threads\n#   than recommended merely causes the CI script to run slower.\n#   To avoid rare and intermittent OOM due to short memory usage spikes,\n#   it is recommended to add (and persist) swap:\n#\n#   ```\n#   fallocate -l 16G /swapfile_ci && chmod 600 /swapfile_ci && mkswap /swapfile_ci && swapon /swapfile_ci && ( echo '/swapfile_ci none swap sw 0 0' | tee -a /etc/fstab )\n#   ```\n#\n# - To register the persistent worker, open a `screen` session and run:\n#\n#   ```\n#   RESTART_CI_DOCKER_BEFORE_RUN=1 screen cirrus worker run --labels type=todo_fill_in_type --token todo_fill_in_token\n#   ```\n\n# https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/tips-and-tricks/#sharing-configuration-between-tasks\nfilter_template: &FILTER_TEMPLATE\n  # Allow forks to specify SKIP_BRANCH_PUSH=true and skip CI runs when a branch is pushed,\n  # but still run CI when a PR is created.\n  # https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#conditional-task-execution\n  skip: $SKIP_BRANCH_PUSH == \"true\" && $CIRRUS_PR == \"\"\n  stateful: false  # https://cirrus-ci.org/guide/writing-tasks/#stateful-tasks\n\nbase_template: &BASE_TEMPLATE\n  << : *FILTER_TEMPLATE\n  merge_base_script:\n    # Require git (used in fingerprint_script).\n    - git --version || ( apt-get update && apt-get install -y git )\n    - if [ \"$CIRRUS_PR\" = \"\" ];

          "content": "Contributing to Bitcoin Core\n============================\n\nThe Bitcoin Core project operates an open contributor model where anyone is\nwelcome to contribute towards development in the form of peer review, testing\nand patches. This document explains the practical process and guidelines for\ncontributing.\n\nFirst, in terms of structure, there is no particular concept of \"Bitcoin Core\ndevelopers\" in the sense of privileged people. Open source often naturally\nrevolves around a meritocracy where contributors earn trust from the developer\ncommunity over time. Nevertheless, some hierarchy is necessary for practical\npurposes. As such, there are repository maintainers who are responsible for\nmerging pull requests, the [release cycle](/doc/release-process.md), and\nmoderation.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nNew contributors are very welcome and needed.\n\nReviewing and testing is highly valued and the most effective way you can contribute\nas a new contributor. It also will teach you much more about the code and\nprocess than opening pull requests. Please refer to the [peer review](#peer-review)\nsection below.\n\nBefore you start contributing, familiarize yourself with the Bitcoin Core build\nsystem and tests. Refer to the documentation in the repository on how to build\nBitcoin Core and how to run the unit tests, functional tests, and fuzz tests.\n\nThere are many open issues of varying difficulty waiting to be fixed.\nIf you're looking for somewhere to start contributing, check out the\n[good first issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)\nlist or changes that are\n[up for grabs](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Up+for+grabs%22).\nSome of them might no longer be applicable. So if you are interested, but\nunsure, you might want to leave a comment on the issue first.\n\nYou may also participate in the [Bitcoin Core PR Review Club](https://bitcoincore.reviews/).\n\n### Good First Issue Label\n\nThe purpose of the `good first issue` label is to highlight which issues are\nsuitable for a new contributor without a deep understanding of the codebase.\n\nHowever, good first issues can be solved by anyone. If they remain unsolved\nfor a longer time, a frequent contributor might address them.\n\nYou do not need to request permission to start working on an issue. However,\nyou are encouraged to leave a comment if you are planning to work on it. This\nwill help other contributors monitor which issues are actively being addressed\nand is also an effective way to request assistance if and when you need it.\n\nCommunication Channels\n----------------------\n\nMost communication about Bitcoin Core development happens on IRC, in the\n`#bitcoin-core-dev` channel on Libera Chat. The easiest way to participate on IRC is\nwith the web client, [web.libera.chat](https://web.libera.chat/#bitcoin-core-dev). Chat\nhistory logs can be found\non [https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/](https://www.erisian.com.au/bitcoin-core-dev/)\nand [https://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/](https://gnusha.org/bitcoin-core-dev/).\n\nDiscussion about codebase improvements happens in GitHub issues and pull\nrequests.\n\nThe developer\n[mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/bitcoindev)\nshould be used to discuss complicated or controversial consensus or P2P protocol changes before working on\na patch set.\nArchives can be found on [https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/](https://gnusha.org/pi/bitcoindev/).\n\n\nContributor Workflow\n--------------------\n\nThe codebase is maintained using the \"contributor workflow\" where everyone\nwithout exception contributes patch proposals using \"pull requests\" (PRs). This\nfacilitates social contribution, easy testing and peer review.\n\nTo contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:\n\n  1. Fork repository ([only for the first time](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo))\n  1. Create topic branch\n  1. Commit patches\n\nFor GUI-related issues or pull requests, the https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository should be used.\nFor all other issues and pull requests, the https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin node repository should be used.\n\nThe master branch for all monotree repositories is identical.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, everything that only modifies `src/qt` is a GUI-only pull\nrequest. However:\n\n* For global refactoring or other transversal changes the node repository\n  should be used.\n* For GUI-related build system changes, the node repository should be used\n  because the change needs review by the build systems reviewers.\n* Changes in `src/interfaces` need to go to the node repository because they\n  might affect other components like the wallet.\n\nFor large GUI changes that include build system and interface changes, it is\nrecommended to first open a pull request against the GUI repository. When there\nis agreement to proceed with the changes, a pull request with the build system\nand interfaces changes can be submitted to the node repository.\n\nThe project coding conventions in the [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md)\nmust be followed.\n\n### Committing Patches\n\nIn general, [commits should be atomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_commit#Atomic_commit_convention)\nand diffs should be easy to read. For this reason, do not mix any formatting\nfixes or code moves with actual code changes.\n\nMake sure each individual commit is hygienic: that it builds successfully on its\nown without warnings, errors, regressions, or test failures.\n\nCommit messages should be verbose by default consisting of a short subject line\n(50 chars max), a blank line and detailed explanatory text as separate\nparagraph(s), unless the title alone is self-explanatory (like \"Correct typo\nin init.cpp\") in which case a single title line is sufficient. Commit messages should be\nhelpful to people reading your code in the future, so explain the reasoning for\nyour decisions. Further explanation [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\n\nIf a particular commit references another issue, please add the reference. For\nexample: `refs #1234` or `fixes #4321`. Using the `fixes` or `closes` keywords\nwill cause the corresponding issue to be closed when the pull request is merged.\n\nCommit messages should never contain any `@` mentions (usernames prefixed with \"@\").\n\nPlease refer to the [Git manual](https://git-scm.com/doc) for more information\nabout Git.\n\n  - Push changes to your fork\n  - Create pull request\n\n### Creating the Pull Request\n\nThe title of the pull request should be prefixed by the component or area that\nthe pull request affects. Valid areas as:\n\n  - `consensus` for changes to consensus critical code\n  - `doc` for changes to the documentation\n  - `qt` or `gui` for changes to bitcoin-qt\n  - `log` for changes to log messages\n  - `mining` for changes to the mining code\n  - `net` or `p2p` for changes to the peer-to-peer network code\n  - `refactor` for structural changes that do not change behavior\n  - `rpc`, `rest` or `zmq` for changes to the RPC, REST or ZMQ APIs\n  - `contrib` or `cli` for changes to the scripts and tools\n  - `test`, `qa` or `ci` for changes to the unit tests, QA tests or CI code\n  - `util` or `lib` for changes to the utils or libraries\n  - `wallet` for changes to the wallet code\n  - `build` for changes to CMake\n  - `guix` for changes to the GUIX reproducible builds\n\nExamples:\n\n    consensus: Add new opcode for BIP-XXXX OP_CHECKAWESOMESIG\n    net: Automatically create onion service, listen on Tor\n    qt: Add feed bump button\n    log: Fix typo in log message\n\nThe body of the pull request should contain sufficient description of *what* the\npatch does, and even more importantly, *why*, with justification and reasoning.\nYou should include references to any discussions (for example, other issues or\nmailing list discussions).\n\nThe description for a new pull request should not contain any `@` mentions. The\nPR description will be included in the commit message when the PR is merged and\nany users mentioned in the description will be annoyingly notified each time a\nfork of Bitcoin Core copies the merge. Instead, make any username mentions in a\nsubsequent comment to the PR.\n\n### Translation changes\n\nNote that translations should not be submitted as pull requests. Please see\n[Translation Process](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/translation_process.md)\nfor more information on helping with translations.\n\n### Work in Progress Changes and Requests for Comments\n\nIf a pull request is not to be considered for merging (yet), please\nprefix the title with [WIP] or use [Tasks Lists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#task-lists)\nin the body of the pull request to indicate tasks are pending.\n\n### Address Feedback\n\nAt this stage, one should expect comments and review from other contributors. You\ncan add more commits to your pull request by committing them locally and pushing\nto your fork.\n\nYou are expected to reply to any review comments before your pull request is\nmerged. You may update the code or reject the feedback if you do not agree with\nit, but you should express so in a reply. If there is outstanding feedback and\nyou are not actively working on it, your pull request may be closed.\n\nPlease refer to the [peer review](#peer-review) section below for more details.\n\n### Squashing Commits\n\nIf your pull request contains fixup commits (commits that change the same line of code repeatedly) or too fine-grained\ncommits, you may be asked to [squash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase#_interactive_mode) your commits\nbefore it will be reviewed. The basic squashing workflow is shown below.\n\n    git checkout your_branch_name\n    git rebase -i HEAD~n\n    # n is normally the number of commits in the pull request.\n    # Set commits (except the one in the first line) from 'pick' to 'squash', save and quit.\n    # On the next screen, edit/refine commit messages.\n    # Save and quit.\n    git push -f # (force push to GitHub)\n\nPlease update the resulting commit message, if needed. It should read as a\ncoherent message. In most cases, this means not just listing the interim\ncommits.\n\nIf your change contains a merge commit, the above workflow may not work and you\nwill need to remove the merge commit first. See the next section for details on\nhow to rebase.\n\nPlease refrain from creating several pull requests for the same change.\nUse the pull request that is already open (or was created earlier) to amend\nchanges. This preserves the discussion and review that happened earlier for\nthe respective change set.\n\nThe length of time required for peer review is unpredictable and will vary from\npull request to pull request.\n\n### Rebasing Changes\n\nWhen a pull request conflicts with the target branch, you may be asked to rebase it on top of the current target branch.\n\n    git fetch https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin  # Fetch the latest upstream commit\n    git rebase FETCH_HEAD  # Rebuild commits on top of the new base\n\nThis project aims to have a clean git history, where code changes are only made in non-merge commits. This simplifies\nauditability because merge commits can be assumed to not contain arbitrary code changes. Merge commits should be signed,\nand the resulting git tree hash must be deterministic and reproducible. The script in\n[/contrib/verify-commits](/contrib/verify-commits) checks that.\n\nAfter a rebase, reviewers are encouraged to sign off on the force push. This should be relatively straightforward with\nthe `git range-diff` tool explained in the [productivity\nnotes](/doc/productivity.md#diff-the-diffs-with-git-range-diff). To avoid needless review churn, maintainers will\ngenerally merge pull requests that received the most review attention first.\n\nPull Request Philosophy\n-----------------------\n\nPatchsets should always be focused. For example, a pull request could add a\nfeature, fix a bug, or refactor code; but not a mixture. Please also avoid super\npull requests which attempt to do too much, are overly large, or overly complex\nas this makes review difficult.\n\n\n### Features\n\nWhen adding a new feature, thought must be given to the long term technical debt\nand maintenance that feature may require after inclusion. Before proposing a new\nfeature that will require maintenance, please consider if you are willing to\nmaintain it (including bug fixing). If features get orphaned with no maintainer\nin the future, they may be removed by the Repository Maintainer.\n\n\n### Refactoring\n\nRefactoring is a necessary part of any software project's evolution. The\nfollowing guidelines cover refactoring pull requests for the project.\n\nThere are three categories of refactoring: code-only moves, code style fixes, and\ncode refactoring. In general, refactoring pull requests should not mix these\nthree kinds of activities in order to make refactoring pull requests easy to\nreview and uncontroversial. In all cases, refactoring PRs must not change the\nbehaviour of code within the pull request (bugs must be preserved as is).\n\nProject maintainers aim for a quick turnaround on refactoring pull requests, so\nwhere possible keep them short, uncomplex and easy to verify.\n\nPull requests that refactor the code should not be made by new contributors. It\nrequires a certain level of experience to know where the code belongs to and to\nunderstand the full ramification (including rebase effort of open pull requests).\n\nTrivial pull requests or pull requests that refactor the code with no clear\nbenefits may be immediately closed by the maintainers to reduce unnecessary\nworkload on reviewing.\n\n\n\"Decision Making\" Process\n-------------------------\n\nThe following applies to code changes to the Bitcoin Core project (and related\nprojects such as libsecp256k1), and is not to be confused with overall Bitcoin\nNetwork Protocol consensus changes.\n\nWhether a pull request is merged into Bitcoin Core rests with the project merge\nmaintainers.\n\nMaintainers will take into consideration if a patch is in line with the general\nprinciples of the project; meets the minimum standards for inclusion; and will\njudge the general consensus of contributors.\n\nIn general, all pull requests must:\n\n  - Have a clear use case, fix a demonstrable bug or serve the greater good of\n    the project (for example refactoring for modularisation);\n  - Be well peer-reviewed;\n  - Have unit tests, functional tests, and fuzz tests, where appropriate;\n  - Follow code style guidelines ([C++](doc/developer-notes.md), [functional tests](test/functional/README.md));\n  - Not break the existing test suite;\n  - Where bugs are fixed, where possible, there should be unit tests\n    demonstrating the bug and also proving the fix. This helps prevent regression.\n  - Change relevant comments and documentation when behaviour of code changes.\n\nPatches that change Bitcoin consensus rules are considerably more involved than\nnormal because they affect the entire ecosystem and so must be preceded by\nextensive mailing list discussions and have a numbered BIP. While each case will\nbe different, one should be prepared to expend more time and effort than for\nother kinds of patches because of increased peer review and consensus building\nrequirements.\n\n\n### Peer Review\n\nAnyone may participate in peer review which is expressed by comments in the pull\nrequest. Typically reviewers will review the code for obvious errors, as well as\ntest out the patch set and opine on the technical merits of the patch. Project\nmaintainers take into account the peer review when determining if there is\nconsensus to merge a pull request (remember that discussions may have been\nspread out over GitHub, mailing list and IRC discussions).\n\nCode review is a burdensome but important part of the development process, and\nas such, certain types of pull requests are rejected. In general, if the\n**improvements** do not warrant the **review effort** required, the PR has a\nhigh chance of being rejected. It is up to the PR author to convince the\nreviewers that the changes warrant the review effort, and if reviewers are\n\"Concept NACK'ing\" the PR, the author may need to present arguments and/or do\nresearch backing their suggested changes.\n\n#### Conceptual Review\n\nA review can be a conceptual review, where the reviewer leaves a comment\n * `Concept (N)ACK`, meaning \"I do (not) agree with the general goal of this pull\n   request\",\n * `Approach (N)ACK`, meaning `Concept ACK`, but \"I do (not) agree with the\n   approach of this change\".\n\nA `NACK` needs to include a rationale why the change is not worthwhile.\nNACKs without accompanying reasoning may be disregarded.\n\n#### Code Review\n\nAfter conceptual agreement on the change, code review can be provided. A review\nbegins with `ACK BRANCH_COMMIT`, where `BRANCH_COMMIT` is the top of the PR\nbranch, followed by a description of how the reviewer did the review. The\nfollowing language is used within pull request comments:\n\n  - \"I have tested the code\", involving change-specific manual testing in\n    addition to running the unit, functional, or fuzz tests, and in case it is\n    not obvious how the manual testing was done, it should be described;\n  - \"I have not tested the code, but I have reviewed it and it looks\n    OK, I agree it can be merged\";\n  - A \"nit\" refers to a trivial, often non-blocking issue.\n\nProject maintainers reserve the right to weigh the opinions of peer reviewers\nusing common sense judgement and may also weigh based on merit. Reviewers that\nhave demonstrated a deeper commitment and understanding of the project over time\nor who have clear domain expertise may naturally have more weight, as one would\nexpect in all walks of life.\n\nWhere a patch set affects consensus-critical code, the bar will be much\nhigher in terms of discussion and peer review requirements, keeping in mind that\nmistakes could be very costly to the wider community. This includes refactoring\nof consensus-critical code.\n\nWhere a patch set proposes to change the Bitcoin consensus, it must have been\ndiscussed extensively on the mailing list and IRC, be accompanied by a widely\ndiscussed BIP and have a generally widely perceived technical consensus of being\na worthwhile change based on the judgement of the maintainers.\n\n### Finding Reviewers\n\nAs most reviewers are themselves developers with their own projects, the review\nprocess can be quite lengthy, and some amount of patience is required. If you find\nthat you've been waiting for a pull request to be given attention for several\nmonths, there may be a number of reasons for this, some of which you can do something\nabout:\n\n  - It may be because of a feature freeze due to an upcoming release. During this time,\n    only bug fixes are taken into consideration. If your pull request is a new feature,\n    it will not be prioritized until after the release. Wait for the release.\n  - It may be because the changes you are suggesting do not appeal to people. Rather than\n    nits and critique, which require effort and means they care enough to spend time on your\n    contribution, thundering silence is a good sign of widespread (mild) dislike of a given change\n    (because people don't assume *others* won't actually like the proposal). Don't take\n    that personally, though! Instead, take another critical look at what you are suggesting\n    and see if it: changes too much, is too broad, doesn't adhere to the\n    [developer notes](doc/developer-notes.md), is dangerous or insecure, is messily written, etc.\n    Identify and address any of the issues you find. Then ask e.g. on IRC if someone could give\n    their opinion on the concept itself.\n  - It may be because your code is too complex for all but a few people, and those people\n    may not have realized your pull request even exists. A great way to find people who\n    are qualified and care about the code you are touching is the\n    [Git Blame feature](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/managing-files-on-github/tracking-changes-in-a-file). Simply\n    look up who last modified the code you are changing and see if you can find\n    them and give them a nudge. Don't be incessant about the nudging, though.\n  - Finally, if all else fails, ask on IRC or elsewhere for someone to give your pull request\n    a look. If you think you've been waiting for an unreasonably long time (say,\n    more than a month) for no particular reason (a few lines changed, etc.),\n    this is totally fine. Try to return the favor when someone else is asking\n    for feedback on their code, and the universe balances out.\n  - Remember that the best thing you can do while waiting is give review to others!\n\n\nBackporting\n-----------\n\nSecurity and bug fixes can be backported from `master` to release\nbranches.\nMaintainers will do backports in batches and\nuse the proper `Needs backport (...)` labels\nwhen needed (the original author does not need to worry about it).\n\nA backport should contain the following metadata in the commit body:\n\n```\nGithub-Pull: #<PR number>\nRebased-From: <commit hash of the original commit>\n```\n\nHave a look at [an example backport PR](\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/16189).\n\nAlso see the [backport.py script](\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-maintainer-tools#backport).\n\nCopyright\n---------\n\nBy contributing to this repository, you agree to license your work under the\nMIT license unless specified otherwise in `contrib/debian/copyright` or at\nthe top of the file itself.

It also includes a wallet and graphical user\ninterface, which can be optionally built.\n\nFurther information about Bitcoin Core is available in the [doc folder](/doc).\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nBitcoin Core is released under the terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](COPYING) for more\ninformation or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.\n\nDevelopment Process\n-------------------\n\nThe `master` branch is regularly built (see `doc/build-*.md` for instructions) and tested, but it is not guaranteed to be\ncompletely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/tags) are created\nregularly from release branches to indicate new official, stable release versions of Bitcoin Core.\n\nThe https://github.com/bitcoin-core/gui repository is used exclusively for the\ndevelopment of the GUI. Its master branch is identical in all monotree\nrepositories. Release branches and tags do not exist, so please do not fork\nthat repository unless it is for development reasons.\n\nThe contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\nand useful hints for developers can be found in [doc/developer-notes.md](doc/developer-notes.md).\n\nTesting\n-------\n\nTesting and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull\nrequests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing\nother people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people\nlots of money.\n\n### Automated Testing\n\nDevelopers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](src/test/README.md) for new code, and to\nsubmit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run\n(assuming they weren't disabled during the generation of the build system) with: `ctest`. Further details on running\nand extending unit tests can be found in [/src/test/README.md](/src/test/README.md).\n\nThere are also [regression and integration tests](/test), written\nin Python.\nThese tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/test) are installed) with: `build/test/functional/test_runner.py`\n(assuming `build` is your build directory).\n\nThe CI (Continuous Integration) systems make sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and macOS,\nand that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.\n\n### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing\n\nChanges should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the\ncode. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful\nto add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is\nnot straightforward.\n\nTranslations\n------------\n\nChanges to translations as well as new translations can be submitted to\n[Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/).\n\nTranslations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the\n[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.\n\n**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next\npull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.\n"
