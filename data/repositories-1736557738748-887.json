This will be a real life skill you need when employeed. \n\n1. What does the error say? There will often be a description of the error or instructions on what is needed, I have even seen a link to the solution. Does it reference a specific line of your code?\n2. Restart the application or server/pc. \n3. Google it. It is going to be rare that you are the first to have the problem, someone out there has posted the issue and likely the solution. Search using: **technology** **problem statement**. Example: `pgcli error column c.relhasoids does not exist`. \n    * There are often different solutions for the same problem due to variation in environments. \n4. Check the tech’s documentation. Use its search if available or use the browsers search function. \n5. Try uninstall (this may remove the bad actor) and reinstall of application or reimplementation of action. Don’t forget to restart the server/pc for reinstalls.\n    * Sometimes reinstalling fails to resolve the issue but works if you uninstall first.\n6. Ask in Slack\n7. Take a break and come back to it later. You will be amazed at how often you figure out the solution after letting your brain rest. Get some fresh air, workout, play a video game, watch a tv show, whatever allows your brain to not think about it for a little while or even until the next day. \n8. Remember technology issues in real life sometimes take days or even weeks to resolve\n\n### Asking in Slack\n\n* Before asking a question, check the [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19bnYs80DwuUimHM65UV3sylsCn2j1vziPOwzBwQrebw/edit).\n* DO NOT use screenshots, especially don’t take pictures from a phone.\n* DO NOT tag instructors, it may discourage others from helping you.\n* Copy and paste errors; if it’s long, just post it in a reply to your thread. \n* Use ``` for formatting your code.\n* Use the same thread for the conversation (that means replying to your own thread). \n* DO NOT create multiple posts to discuss the issue.\n* You may create a new post if the issue reemerges down the road. Be sure to describe what has changed in the environment.\n* Provide additional information in the same thread of the steps you have taken for resolution.\n  \n\n\n"
