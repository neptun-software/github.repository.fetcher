          "content": "# Contributing guidelines\n\nThese are the guidelines for contributing to OpenFaaS Community Edition (CE) and faasd components.\n\nOpenFaaS Standard and OpenFaaS For Enterprises are commercial software, and maintained solely by employees of OpenFaaS Ltd.\n\nCustomers can provide feedback via the [openfaas/customers](https://github.com/openfaas/customers) repository\n\n## First impressions - introducing yourself and your use-case\n\nOne of the best ways to participate within a new open source community is to introduce yourself and your use-case. This builds goodwill, but also means the community can start to understand your needs and how best to help you.\n\nGiven that the community is made up of volunteers, making a good first impression is important to getting their ear and attention. \n\nHere is a simple introduction you could try:\n\n> \"We at Company Y have an issue with X, and would like some help. What we're trying to achieve is Z\" \n\nThe more context you can give the community, the more the community can be of help to you. If you are using OpenFaaS as a hobbyist or as a student, then please also let us know so that we can decide how to prioritise all the requests we receive from users. \n\nA common example of a poor introduction would be asking for technical support without providing any context, or introduction.\n\n> \"We are running into issue X. Can you fix it?\"\n> \n> \"We also had this issue\"\n\nThese kinds of interactions start with \"we\" and since we is a pronoun, it becomes an anonymous request detached from any context or relationship with the community. The fix is easy, just say who you are and what your interest is, and what your ideal outcome is.\n\nThe primary ways to engage with the community are via GitHub Issues and [Enterprise Support](https://openfaas.com/support/).\n\n* GitHub Issues - for suspected bugs and feature requests, fill out the whole template. Do not use GitHub issues to ask for help with performance/load-testing and/or tuning, this is a professional service which you can get via Enterprise Support.\n* Enterprise Support - you will have an agreed way to contact OpenFaaS Ltd for direct support and help\n\nSee also: [The no-excuses guide to introducing yourself to a new open source project](https://opensource.com/education/13/7/introduce-yourself-open-source-project)\n\n## How can I get involved?\n\nThere are a number of areas where contributions can be accepted:\n\n* Write Golang code for the CLI, Gateway or other providers\n* Write features for the front-end UI (JS, HTML, CSS)\n* Write sample functions in any language\n* Review pull requests\n* Test out new features or work-in-progress\n* Get involved in design reviews and technical proof-of-concepts (PoCs)\n* Help release and package OpenFaaS including the helm chart, compose files, `kubectl` YAML, marketplaces and stores\n* Manage, triage and research Issues and Pull Requests\n* Engage with the growing community by providing technical support on GitHub\n* Create docs, guides and write blogs\n* Speak at meet-ups, conferences or by asking where you can be of help\n\nThis is just a short list of ideas, if you have other ideas for contributing please make a suggestion.\n\nIf you'd like help getting involved, [join our weekly community call on Zoom](https://docs.openfaas.com/community).\n\n## I want to contribute on GitHub\n\n### I've found a security issue\n\nPlease follow [responsible disclosure practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) and send an email to support@openfaas.com. Bear in mind that instructions on how to reproduce the issue are key to proving an issue exists, and getting it resolved.\n\n### I've found a typo\n\n* A Pull Request is not necessary. Raise an [Issue](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/issues) and we'll fix it as soon as we can. \n\n### I have a (great) idea\n\nThe OpenFaaS maintainers would like to make OpenFaaS the best it can be and welcome new contributions that align with the project's goals. Our time is limited so we'd like to make sure we agree on the proposed work before you spend time doing it. Saying \"no\" is hard which is why we'd rather say \"yes\" ahead of time. You need to raise a proposal.\n\nEvery feature carries a cost - a cost if developed wrong, a cost to carry and maintain it and if it wasn't needed in the first place then this is an unnecessary burden. See [Yagni from Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html). The best proposals are defensible with real data and are more than a hypothesis.\n\n**Please do not raise a proposal after doing the work - this is counter to the spirit of the project. It is hard to be objective about something which has already been done**\n\nWhat makes a good proposal?\n\n* Brief summary including motivation/context\n* Any design changes\n* Pros + Cons\n* Effort required up front\n* Effort required for CI/CD, release, ongoing maintenance\n* Migration strategy / backwards-compatibility\n* Mock-up screenshots or examples of how the CLI would work\n* Clear examples of how to reproduce any issue the proposal is addressing\n\nOnce your proposal receives a `design/approved` label you may go ahead and start work on your Pull Request.\n\nIf you are proposing a new tool or service please do due diligence. Does this tool already exist in a 3rd party project or library? Can we reuse it? For example: a timer / CRON-type scheduler for invoking functions is a well-solved problem, do we need to reinvent the wheel?\n\nEvery effort will be made to work with contributors who do not follow the process. Your PR may be closed or marked as `invalid` if it is left inactive, or the proposal cannot move into a `design/approved` status.\n\n### Paperwork for Pull Requests\n\nPlease read this whole guide and make sure you agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) agreement (included below):\n\n* See guidelines on commit messages (below)\n* Sign-off your commits (`git commit --signoff` or `-s`)\n* Complete the whole template for issues and pull requests\n* [Reference addressed issues](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/) in the PR description & commit messages - use 'Fixes #IssueNo' \n* Always give instructions for testing\n * Provide us CLI commands and output or screenshots where you can\n\n#### Commit messages\n\nThe first line of the commit message is the *subject*, this should be followed by a blank line and then a message describing the intent and purpose of the commit. These guidelines are based upon a [post by Chris Beams](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).\n\n* When you run `git commit` make sure you sign-off the commit by typing `git commit --signoff` or `git commit -s`\n* The commit subject-line should start with an uppercase letter\n* The commit subject-line should not exceed 72 characters in length\n* The commit subject-line should not end with punctuation (., etc)\n\n> Note: please do not use the GitHub suggestions feature, since it will not allow your commits to be signed-off.\n\nWhen giving a commit body:\n* Leave a blank line after the subject-line\n* Make sure all lines are wrapped to 72 characters\n\nHere's an example that would be accepted:\n\n```\nAdd alexellis to the .DEREK.yml file\n\nWe need to add alexellis to the .DEREK.yml file for project maintainer\nduties.\n\nSigned-off-by: Alex Ellis <alex@openfaas.com>\n```\n\nSome invalid examples:\n\n```\n(feat) Add page about X to documentation\n```\n\n> This example does not follow the convention by adding a custom scheme of `(feat)`\n\n```\nUpdate the documentation for page X so including fixing A, B, C and D and F.\n```\n\n> This example will be truncated in the GitHub UI and via `git log --oneline`\n\n\nIf you would like to ammend your commit follow this guide: [Git: Rewriting History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)\n\n#### Unit testing with Golang\n\nPlease follow style guide on [this blog post](https://blog.alexellis.io/golang-writing-unit-tests/) from [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440)\n\nSpecifically, the style means using Golang code to evaluate whether a tested method produced the correct result, for instance:\n\n```golang\nfunc TestSum(t *testing.T) {\n    want := 10\n    got := Sum(5, 5)\n    if want != got {\n       t.Fatal(\"want: %d, but got: %d, want, got)\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMaking use of test tables, additional comparison libraries or helper functions is acceptable.\n\nThis kind of usage will not be merged into the codebase:\n\n```golang\nfunc TestSomething(t *testing.T) {\n  assert := assert.New(t)\n\n  // assert equality\n  assert.Equal(Sum(5, 5), 10, \"they should be equal\")\n```\n\nPlease do not introduce .NET/Java-style assertion libararies such as [stretchr/testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify).\n\n**A note on go-routines**\n\nIf you are making changes to code that use goroutines, consider adding `goleak` to your test to help ensure that we are not leaking any goroutines. Simply add\n\n```go\ndefer goleak.VerifyNoLeaks(t)\n```\n\nat the very beginning of the test, and it will fail the test if it detects goroutines that were opened but never cleaned up at the end of the test.\n\n#### I need to add a dependency\n\nAll projects use [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and vendoring. The concept of `vendoring` is still broadly used in projects written in Go. This means that a copy of the source-code of dependencies is stored within each repository in the `vendor` folder. It allows for a repeatable build and isolates change.\n\nComponents must be licensed with an MIT, BSD, or Apache 2.0 license. We may ask you to write your own code when dependencies are trivial, or unmaintained by their authors.\n\n### I have a question, a suggestion or need help\n\nIf you have a deeply technical request or need help debugging your application then you should prepare a simple, public GitHub repository with the minimum amount of code required to reproduce the issue. \n\n#### Setting expectations, support and SLAs\n\n* What kind of support can I expect?\n\n    OpenFaaS Standard customers have self-service support, and can directly contact the OpenFaaS Ltd team via the [openfaas/customers](https://github.com/openfaas/customers) repository using Discussions.\n\n    Support is only offered to free users to fix bugs and issues in the codebase, where the full Issue Template is filled out with sufficient instructions to reproduce the issue. We will not debug your application, or comment on your architecture on GitHub.\n\n* Can we talk to you in person?\n\n    There is a weekly Zoom call for any free user or customer to attend, topics are taken at the beginning of the call, and we will strive to give everyone time to talk.\n\n* What is the SLA for my Issue?\n\n    Issues are examined, triaged and answered on a best effort basis by volunteers and community contributors. This means that you may receive an initial response within any time period such as: 1 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, or 1 week. There is no implicit meaning to the time between you raising an issue and it being answered or resolved.\n\n    If you see an issue which does not have a response or does not have a resolution, it does not mean that it is not important, or that it is being ignored. It simply means it has not been worked on yet, or may have been missed.\n\n    Please take responsibility for following up on your Issues if you feel further action is required.\n\n    If you're an OpenFaaS customer, then you will have a direct line of communication with the OpenFaaS Ltd team, feel free to reach out for an update.\n\n* What is the SLA for my Pull Request?\n\n    In a similar way to Issues, Pull Requests are triaged, reviewed, and considered by a team of volunteers - the Core Team,  Members Team and the Project Lead. There are dozens of components that make up the OpenFaaS project and a limited amount of people. Sometimes PRs may become blocked or require further action.\n    \n    Please take responsibility for following up on your Pull Requests if you feel further action is required.\n\n* Why may your PR be delayed?\n\n    * The contributing guide was not followed in some way\n\n    * The commits are not signed-off (the Derek bot will try to help you)\n\n    * The commits need to be rebased\n\n    * Changes have been requested\n\n    * The PR is low priority or low impact\n\n    In addition, more information, a use-case, or context may be required for the change to be accepted.\n\n* What if I am a GitHub Sponsor?\n\n    If you [sponsor OpenFaaS on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/openfaas), then you will show up as a Sponsor on your issues and PRs which is one way to show your support for the community and project. Thank you for your contribution.\n \n    Most sponsors are individuals, not corporations. But if your organisation can also take up a GitHub Sponsorship using their GitHub organisation's existing billing relationship.\n\n* What if I need more?\n\n    [Check out the options for self-service and enterprise support](https://openfaas.com/pricing/).\n\n### How are releases made?\n\nReleases are made by the *Project Lead* on a regular basis and when deemed necessary. If you want to request a new release then mention this on your PR or Issue.\n\nReleases are cut with `git` tags and a successful Travis build results in new binary artifacts and Docker images being published to the Docker Hub and Quay.io. See the \"Build\" badge on each GitHub README file for more.\n\nHow are credentials managed for quay.io and the Docker Hub? These credentials are maintained by the *Project Lead*.\n\n## Governance\n\nOpenFaaS is an independent open-source project which was created by the Project Lead Alex Ellis in 2016. OpenFaaS is now hosted by OpenFaaS Ltd. The project is maintained and developed by a number of regular volunteers and a wider community of open-source developers.\n\nOpenFaaS Ltd (company no. 11076587) hosts and sponsors the development and maintenance of OpenFaaS. OpenFaaS Ltd provides professional services, consultation and support. Email: [sales@openfaas.com](mailto:sales@openfaas.com) to find out more.\n\nOpenFaaS &reg; is a registered trademark in England and Wales.\n\n#### Project Lead\n\nResponsibility for the project starts with the *Project Lead*, who delegates specific responsibilities and the corresponding authority to the Core and Members team.\n\nSome duties include:\n\n* Setting overall technical & community leadership\n* Engaging end-user community to advocate needs of end-users and to capture case-studies\n* Defining and curating roadmap for OpenFaaS & OpenFaaS Cloud\n* Building a community and team of contributors\n* Community & media briefings, out-bound communications, partnerships, relationship management and events\n\n### How do I become a maintainer?\n\nIn the OpenFaaS community there are four levels of structure or maintainership:\n\n* Core Team (GitHub org)\n* Members Team (GitHub org)\n* Those with Derek access\n* The rest of the community.\n\n#### Core Team\n\nThe Core Team have the ear of the Project Lead. They help with strategy, project maintenance, community management, and make a regular commitment of time to the project on a weekly basis.\n\nEach member will be responsible for, or be a subject-matter-expert (SME) for a sub-system of OpenFaaS and will be granted write (push) access to the related repositories.\n\nThe Core Team have the same responsibilities and perks of the Membership Team, in addition will need to keep in close contact with the rest of the Core Team and the Project Lead.\n\n* Members are listed on the project homepage as being part of the Core group and are shown first.\n* Members are expected to attend 1:1 Zoom calls with the Project Lead up to once per month\n* Members will notify the Project Lead and Core Team of any leave of a week or more and set a status in Slack of \"away\".\n\nCore Team attend all project meetings and calls. Allowances will be made for timezones and other commitments.\n\nThe Core Team includes:\n\n- Alex Ellis (@alexellis) - Founder, OpenFaaS Ltd\n- Han Verstraete (@welteki) - Junior Software Developer, OpenFaaS Ltd\n- Lucas Roesler (@LucasRoesler) - SME for logs, provider model and secrets. Lead Developer @ Contiamo\n- Nitishkumar Singh (@nitishkumar71) - Senior Engineer, CTO.ai\n\n#### Members Team\n\nThe Members Team are contributors who are well-known to the community with a track record of:\n\n* fixing, testing and triaging issues and PRs\n* offering support to the project\n* providing feedback and being available to help where needed\n* testing and reviewing pull requests\n* joining contributor meetings and supporting new contributors\n\n> Note: An essential skill for being in a team is communication. If it is not possible to communicate on a regular basis then, then membership may not be for you. You are welcome to contribute as part of the wider community.\n\nVarying levels of write access are made available via the project bot [Derek](https://github.com/alexellis/derek) to help regular contributors transition to the Members Team.\n\nMembers Team Perks:\n* access to a private Slack channel\n* profile posted on the Team page of the OpenFaaS website\n* membership of the GitHub organisations openfaas/openfaas-incubator\n\nUpon request and subject to availability:\n* 1:1 coaching & mentorship\n* help with speaking opportunities and CfP submissions\n* help with CV, resume and LinkedIn profile\n* review, and promotion of blogs and tutorials on social media\n\nThe Members Team are expected to:\n\n* participate in the members channel and engage with the topics\n* participate in community Zoom calls (when possible within your timezone)\n* make regular contributions to the project codebase\n* take an active role in the public channels: #contributors and #openfaas\n* comment on and engage with project proposals\n* attend occasional 1:1 meetings with members of the Core Team or the Project Lead\n\nThis group is intended to be an active team that shares the load and collaborates together. This means engaging in topics on Slack, working with other teammates, sharing ideas, helping the users and raising issues with the Core Team.\n\nThe Members Team will notify their team in the *members* channel about any planned leave of a week or more and set a status in Slack of \"away\".\n\n#### Changing teams\n\nEvery contributor to OpenFaaS is a volunteer, including the *Project Lead* and nobody is paid to work on OpenFaaS.\n\nMotivations and life-circumstances can change over time. If this is expected to be a short-term change, then speak to the *Project Lead* about a sabbatical arrangement with perks and membership retained for that time.\n\nYou may move from the Core Team to the Members Team. Please notify the *Project Lead*.\n\nIf you can no-longer commit to being part of a team, then you may move to Community Contributor status and retain your access to Derek for as long as it is useful to you.\n\n#### Stepping-down and emeritus status\n\n> emeritus: (of the former holder of an office, especially a university professor) having retired but allowed to retain their title as an honour.\n\nSome guidelines on stepping down:\n\n> When somebody leaves or disengages from the project, we ask that they do so in a way that minimises disruption to the project. They should tell [*The Project Lead*, that] they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off.\n\nQuoted from the [Ubuntu community guidelines](https://ubuntu.com/community/code-of-conduct).\n\nIt's reasonable to expect that some people may no longer be able to continue their Open Source contributions actively, but would like to remain a part of the project and to continue to be recognised.\n\n#### Access to Derek\n\nIf you have been added to the `.DEREK.yml` file in the root of an OpenFaaS repository then you can help us manage the community and contributions by issuing comments on Issues and Pull Requests. See [Derek](https://github.com/alexellis/derek) for available commands.\n\nIf you are a contributor then you are welcome to request access.\n\n## Branding guidelines\n\nFor press, branding, logos and marks see the [OpenFaaS media repository](https://github.com/openfaas/media).\n\n## Community\n\nThis project is written in Golang but many of the community contributions so far have been through blogging, speaking engagements, helping to test and drive the backlog of OpenFaaS. If you'd like to help in any way then that would be more than welcome whatever your level of experience.\n\n### Community file\n\nThe [community.md](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/community.md) file highlights blogs, talks and code repos with example FaaS functions and usages. Please send a Pull Request if you are doing something cool with OpenFaaS.\n\n### Roadmap\n\nSee also: [OpenFaaS Pro](https://docs.openfaas.com/openfaas-pro/introduction/)\n\n## License\n\nAll third-party contributions are licensed under the MIT license, all OpenFaaS Ltd contributions are licensed under the [OpenFaaS CE EULA](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/EULA.md).\n\nOpenFaaS Standard and OpenFaaS for Enterprises are proprietary and binaries are licensed under the commercial [OpenFaaS Pro EULA](https://github.com/openfaas/faas/blob/master/pro/EULA.md).\n\n### Copyright notice\n\nIt is important to state that you retain copyright for your contributions, but agree to license them for usage by the project and author(s) under the MIT license.

Your\nsignature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass\nit on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify\nthe below (from [developercertificate.org](http://developercertificate.org/)):\n\n```\nDeveloper Certificate of Origin\nVersion 1.1\n\nCopyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.\n1 Letterman Drive\nSuite D4700\nSan Francisco, CA, 94129\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this\nlicense document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nDeveloper's Certificate of Origin 1.1\n\nBy making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n\n(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I\n    have the right to submit it under the open source license\n    indicated in the file; or\n\n(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best\n    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source\n    license and I have the right under that license to submit that\n    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part\n    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am\n    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated\n    in the file; or\n\n(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other\n    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified\n    it.\n\n(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution\n    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all\n    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is\n    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with\n    this project or the open source license(s) involved.\n```\n\nThen you just add a line to every git commit message:\n\n    Signed-off-by: Joe Smith <joe.smith@email.com>\n\nUse your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)\n\nIf you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your\ncommit automatically with `git commit -s`.\n\nPlease sign your commits with `git commit -s` so that commits are traceable.\n\nThis is different from digital signing using GPG, GPG is not required for \nmaking contributions to the project. \n\nIf you forgot to sign your work and want to fix that, see the following \nguide: [Git: Rewriting History](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)\n\n"
