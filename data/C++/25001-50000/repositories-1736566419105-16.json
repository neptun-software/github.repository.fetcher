The OpenPose runtime is constant, while the runtime of Alpha-Pose and Mask R-CNN grow linearly with the number of people. More details [**here**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08008).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\".github/media/openpose_vs_competition.png\" width=\"360\">\n</p>\n\n\n\n## Features\n**Main Functionality**:\n- **2D real-time multi-person keypoint detection**:\n    - 15, 18 or **25-keypoint body/foot keypoint estimation**, including **6 foot keypoints**. **Runtime invariant to number of detected people**.\n    - **2x21-keypoint hand keypoint estimation**. **Runtime depends on number of detected people**. See [**OpenPose Training**](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train) for a runtime invariant alternative.\n    - **70-keypoint face keypoint estimation**. **Runtime depends on number of detected people**. See [**OpenPose Training**](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train) for a runtime invariant alternative.\n- [**3D real-time single-person keypoint detection**](doc/advanced/3d_reconstruction_module.md):\n    - 3D triangulation from multiple single views.\n    - Synchronization of Flir cameras handled.\n    - Compatible with Flir/Point Grey cameras.\n- [**Calibration toolbox**](doc/advanced/calibration_module.md): Estimation of distortion, intrinsic, and extrinsic camera parameters.\n- **Single-person tracking** for further speedup or visual smoothing.\n\n**Input**: Image, video, webcam, Flir/Point Grey, IP camera, and support to add your own custom input source (e.g., depth camera).\n\n**Output**: Basic image + keypoint display/saving (PNG, JPG, AVI, ...), keypoint saving (JSON, XML, YML, ...), keypoints as array class, and support to add your own custom output code (e.g., some fancy UI).\n\n**OS**: Ubuntu (20, 18, 16, 14), Windows (10, 8), Mac OSX, Nvidia TX2.\n\n**Hardware compatibility**: CUDA (Nvidia GPU), OpenCL (AMD GPU), and non-GPU (CPU-only) versions.\n\n**Usage Alternatives**:\n- [**Command-line demo**](doc/01_demo.md) for built-in functionality.\n- [**C++ API**](doc/04_cpp_api.md/) and [**Python API**](doc/03_python_api.md) for custom functionality. E.g., adding your custom inputs, pre-processing, post-posprocessing, and output steps.\n\nFor further details, check the [major released features](doc/07_major_released_features.md) and [release notes](doc/08_release_notes.md) docs.\n\n\n\n## Related Work\n- [**OpenPose training code**](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_train)\n- [**OpenPose foot dataset**](https://cmu-perceptual-computing-lab.github.io/foot_keypoint_dataset/)\n- [**OpenPose Unity Plugin**](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose_unity_plugin)\n- OpenPose papers published in **IEEE TPAMI and CVPR**. Cite them in your publications if OpenPose helps your research! (Links and more details in the [Citation](#citation) section below).\n\n\n\n## Installation\nIf you want to use OpenPose without installing or writing any code, simply [download and use the latest Windows portable version of OpenPose](doc/installation/0_index.md#windows-portable-demo)!\n\nOtherwise, you could [build OpenPose from source](doc/installation/0_index.md#compiling-and-running-openpose-from-source). See the [installation doc](doc/installation/0_index.md) for all the alternatives.\n\n\n\n## Quick Start Overview\nSimply use the OpenPose Demo from your favorite command-line tool (e.g., Windows PowerShell or Ubuntu Terminal). E.g., this example runs OpenPose on your webcam and displays the body keypoints:\n```\n# Ubuntu\n./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin\n```\n```\n:: Windows - Portable Demo\nbin\\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\\media\\video.avi\n```\n\nYou can also add any of the available flags in any order. E.g., the following example runs on a video (`--video {PATH}`), enables face (`--face`) and hands (`--hand`), and saves the output keypoints on JSON files on disk (`--write_json {PATH}`).\n```\n# Ubuntu\n./build/examples/openpose/openpose.bin --video examples/media/video.avi --face --hand --write_json output_json_folder/\n```\n```\n:: Windows - Portable Demo\nbin\\OpenPoseDemo.exe --video examples\\media\\video.avi --face --hand --write_json output_json_folder/\n```\n\nOptionally, you can also extend OpenPose's functionality from its Python and C++ APIs. After [installing](doc/installation/0_index.md) OpenPose, check its [official doc](doc/00_index.md) for a quick overview of all the alternatives and tutorials.\n\n\n\n## Send Us Feedback!\nOur library is open source for research purposes, and we want to improve it! So let us know (create a new GitHub issue or pull request, email us, etc.) if you...\n1. Find/fix any bug (in functionality or speed) or know how to speed up or improve any part of OpenPose.\n2. Want to add/show some cool functionality/demo/project made on top of OpenPose. We can add your project link to our [Community-based Projects](doc/10_community_projects.md) section or even integrate it with OpenPose!\n\n\n\n## Citation\nPlease cite these papers in your publications if OpenPose helps your research. All of OpenPose is based on [OpenPose: Realtime Multi-Person 2D Pose Estimation using Part Affinity Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.08008), while the hand and face detectors also use [Hand Keypoint Detection in Single Images using Multiview Bootstrapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07809) (the face detector was trained using the same procedure as the hand detector).\n\n    @article{8765346,\n      author = {Z. {Cao} and G. {Hidalgo Martinez} and T. {Simon} and S. {Wei} and Y.
