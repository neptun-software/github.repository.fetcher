          "content": "# Contribution guide\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document is a guide for developers who want to contribute to ImHex in any way. It contains information about the codebase, the build process and the general workflow.\n\n## Making Changes\n\n### Adding new features\n\nIf you'd like to add new features, the best way to start is by joining our Discord and telling us about your idea. We can then discuss the best way to implement it and how it should be integrated into ImHex or if it should be done in a separate plugin.\n\nThere are standalone plugin templates that use ImHex as a submodule. You can find them here:\n- https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Cpp-Plugin-Template\n- https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Rust-Plugin-Template\n\n### Adding a new language\n\nIf you'd like to support a new language in ImHex, the best way is by using the `dist/langtool.py` tool. It will create the necessary file for you and help you fill them out.\nFirst, run the tool with `python3 dist/langtool.py create plugins/builtin/romfs/lang <iso_code>` where `<iso_code>` is the ISO 639-1 code of your language. This will create a new file in the language directory.\nAfterwards follow the prompts of the program to populate the entire file. Once you're done, rerun cmake and rebuild ImHex. Your language should now be available in the settings.\n\n### Updating an existing language\n\nIf you'd like to add missing keys to an existing language, you can also use the `dist/langtool.py` tool. Run it with `python3 dist/langtool.py translate plugins/builtin/romfs/lang <iso_code>` where `<iso_code>` is the ISO 639-1 code of the language.\nThis will one by one list all the missing translation keys that are present in the default translation file, and you can fill them in with the correct translation for your language.\n\n## Codebase\n\nImHex is written in C++ and usually uses the latest compiler and standard library features available in gcc on all supported OSes. At the time of writing this is C++23.\n\n### Structure\n\n- `main`: Contains the main application code\n    - Important to understand here is that the main ImHex application is basically just an empty shell. \n    - All it does is create a Window and a OpenGL context using GLFW, load all available plugins, properly configure ImGui and render it to the screen.\n    - Everything else is done inside of plugins. ImHex comes with a few plugins by default, most notably the `builtin` plugin which contains the majority of the application code.\n    - In most cases, this code doesn't need to be modified. Most features should be self-contained inside a plugin.\n- `lib`\n    - `libimhex`: Contains all helper utilities as well as various APIs for plugins to interact with ImHex.\n        - The library's main purpose is for Dependency Inversion. The ImHex main application as well as libimhex do not know about the existence of plugins at build time. Plugins and the main application instead link against libimhex and use it as a common API to interact with each other.\n        - Since libimhex is a doesn't know about the existence of plugins, it cannot depend on any of them. This includes localizations and things that get registered by plugins after launch.\n        - Even if the builtin plugin is technically always available, it is still a plugin and should be treated that way.\n        - All important APIs can be found in the `hex/api` include directory and are documented in the respective header file.\n    - `external`: All libraries that need custom patches or aren't typically available in package managers go into here.\n        - If you'd like to add new features to the Pattern language, please make a PR to https://github.com/WerWolv/PatternLanguage instead. ImHex usually depends on the latest commit of the master branch of this repo. \n- `plugins`\n    - `builtin`: The builtin plugin. Contains the majority of the application code.\n        - It's the heart of ImHex's functionality. It contains most of the default views, providers, etc. so if you want to add new functionality to ImHex, this is the place to start.\n- `tests`: Contains all unit tests for ImHex. These are run automatically by the CI and should be kept up to date, especially when adding new helper functions to libimhex.\n\n### RomFS\n\nImHex uses a custom library called [libromfs](https://github.com/WerWolv/libromfs). It's a simple static library which uses CMake's code generation feature to embed files into the binary at compile time so they can be accessed at runtime.\nAll plugins have a `romfs` folder which contains all files that should be embedded into the binary. Resources that need to be embedded into the main application (this is usually not necessary), go into the `resources/romfs` folder.\nWhen adding, changing files or removing files, make sure to re-run CMake to update the generated code. Otherwise, the changes might not be reflected in the binary.\n\n## Development Environment\n\nI personally use CLion for development since it makes configuring and building the project very easy on all platforms.\n\n### Windows\n- Install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org/ and use the `dist/get_deps_msys2.sh` script to install all dependencies.\n### Linux\n- Install all dependencies using one of the `dist/get_deps_*.sh` scripts depending on your distribution or install them manually with your package manager.\n### macOS\n- Install all dependencies using brew and the `dist/Brewfile` script.\n\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

**Windows**: Windows 7 or higher (Windows 10/11 recommended)\n  - **macOS**: macOS 13 (Ventura) or higher, \n    - Lower versions should still work too, but you'll need to compile ImHex yourself. The release binaries will NOT work.\n    - The macOS build is not signed and will require you to manually allow them in the Security & Privacy settings.\n  - **Linux**: \"Modern\" Linux. The following distributions have official releases available. Other distros are supported through the AppImage and Flatpak releases.\n    - Ubuntu and Debian\n    - Fedora\n    - RHEL/AlmaLinux\n    - Arch Linux\n    - Basically any other distro will work as well when compiling ImHex from sources.\n- **CPU**: Officially supported are x86_64 and ARM64, though any Little Endian 64 bit CPU should work.\n- **GPU**: OpenGL 3.0 or higher \n  - Integrated Intel HD iGPUs are supported, however certain drivers are known to cause various graphical artifacts, especially on Windows. Use at your own risk.\n  - In case you don't have a GPU available, there are software rendered releases available for Windows and macOS\n- **RAM**: ~150MiB, more is required for more complex analysis\n- **Storage**: 150MiB\n\n## Installing\n\nInformation on how to install ImHex can be found in the [Install](/INSTALL.md) guide\n\n## Compiling\n\nTo compile ImHex on any platform, GCC (or Clang) is required with a version that supports C++23 or higher. \nWindows and Linux releases are being built using latest available GCC.\nMacOS releases are being built using latest available LLVM Clang.\n\nImportant to note is, the MSVC and AppleClang compilers are both **NOT** supported since they're both generally severely outdated and lack features GCC and LLVM Clang have.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Many dependencies are bundled into the repository using submodules so make sure to clone it using the `--recurse-submodules` option.\n> All dependencies that aren't bundled, can be installed using the dependency installer scripts found in the `/dist` folder.\n\nFor more information, check out the [Compiling](/dist/compiling) guide.\n\n## Contributing\nSee [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Plugin development\n\nTo develop plugins for ImHex, use the following template project to get started. You then have access to the entirety of libimhex as well as the ImHex API and the Content Registry to interact with ImHex or to add new content.\n- [ImHex Plugin Template](https://github.com/WerWolv/ImHex-Plugin-Template)\n\n\n## Credits\n\n### Contributors\n\n- [iTrooz](https://github.com/iTrooz) for getting ImHex onto the Web as well as hundreds of contributions in every part of the project\n- [jumanji144](https://github.com/jumanji144) for huge contributions to the Pattern Language and ImHex's infrastructure\n- [Mary](https://github.com/marysaka) for her immense help porting ImHex to MacOS and help during development\n- [Roblabla](https://github.com/Roblabla) for adding MSI Installer support to ImHex\n- [Mailaender](https://github.com/Mailaender) for getting ImHex onto Flathub\n- Everybody else who has reported issues on Discord or GitHub that I had great conversations with :)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Thanks a lot to ocornut for their amazing [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) which is used for building the entire interface\n  - Thanks to epezent for [ImPlot](https://github.com/epezent/implot) used to plot data in various places\n  - Thanks to Nelarius for [ImNodes](https://github.com/Nelarius/imnodes) used as base for the data processor \n  - Thanks to BalazsJako for [ImGuiColorTextEdit](https://github.com/BalazsJako/ImGuiColorTextEdit) used for the pattern language syntax highlighting\n- Thanks to nlohmann for their [json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) library used for configuration files\n- Thanks to vitaut for their [libfmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) library which makes formatting and logging so much better\n- Thanks to btzy for [nativefiledialog-extended](https://github.com/btzy/nativefiledialog-extended) and their great support, used for handling file dialogs on all platforms\n- Thanks to danyspin97 for [xdgpp](https://sr.ht/~danyspin97/xdgpp) used to handle folder paths on Linux\n- Thanks to aquynh for [capstone](https://github.com/aquynh/capstone) which is the base of the disassembly window\n- Thanks to rxi for [microtar](https://github.com/rxi/microtar) used for extracting downloaded store assets \n- Thanks to VirusTotal for [Yara](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara) used by the Yara plugin\n- Thanks to Martinsos for [edlib](https://github.com/Martinsos/edlib) used for sequence searching in the diffing view\n- Thanks to ron4fun for [HashLibPlus](https://github.com/ron4fun/HashLibPlus) which implements every hashing algorithm under the sun\n- Thanks to mackron for [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio) used to play audio files\n- Thanks to all other groups and organizations whose libraries are used in ImHex\n\n### License\n\nThe biggest part of ImHex is under the GPLv2-only license. \nNotable exceptions to this are the following parts which are under the LGPLv2.1 license:\n- **/lib/libimhex**: The library that allows Plugins to interact with ImHex.\n- **/plugins/ui**: The UI plugin library that contains some common UI elements that can be used by other plugins\n\nThe reason for this is to allow for proprietary plugins to be developed for ImHex.\n"
