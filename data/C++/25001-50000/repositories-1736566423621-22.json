However, most probably the request will be delayed until you fix your coding style. \\\n**Note 2:** You can use the `uncrustify` program/tool to clean up any source file. Use it with the `uncrustify.cfg` configuration file found in the root folder. \\\n**Note 3:** There is also a style for QtCreator but it doesn't cover all cases. In QtCreator `Tools->Options...->C++->Code Style->Import...` and choose the `codingStyleQtCreator.xml` file found in the root folder.\n\n## Table Of Contents\n\n* [1.

New lines & curly braces\n\n### a. Function blocks, class/struct definitions, namespaces\n\n```c++\nint myFunction(int a)\n{\n    // code\n}\n\nvoid myFunction() {} // empty body\n\nMyClass::MyClass(int *parent)\n    : m_parent {parent}\n{\n    // initialize\n}\n\nint MyClass::myMethod(int a)\n{\n    // code\n}\n\nclass MyOtherClass\n{\npublic:\n    // code\n\nprotected:\n    // code\n\nprivate:\n    // code\n};\n\nnamespace Name\n{\n    // code\n}\n\n// Lambdas\n[](int arg1, int arg2) -> bool { return arg1 < arg2; }\n\n[this](int arg)\n{\n    this->acc += arg;\n}\n```\n\n### b. Other code blocks\n\n```c++\nif (condition)\n{\n    // code\n}\n\nfor (int a = 0; a < b; ++b)\n{\n    // code\n}\n\nswitch (a)\n{\ncase 1:\n    // blah\ncase 2:\n    // blah\ndefault:\n    // blah\n}\n\n{\n    // code\n}\n```\n\n### c. Blocks in switch's case labels\n\n```c++\nswitch (var)\n{\ncase 1:\n    {\n        // declare local variables\n        // code\n    }\n    break;\ncase 2:\n    {\n        // declare local variables\n        // code\n    }\n    break;\ndefault:\n    // code\n}\n```\n\n### d. If-else statements\n\nThe `else if`/`else` must be on their own lines:\n\n```c++\nif (condition)\n{\n    // code\n}\nelse if (condition)\n{\n    // code\n}\nelse\n{\n    // code\n}\n```\n\n### e. Single statement if blocks\n\nMost single statement if blocks should look like this:\n\n```c++\nif (condition)\n    a = a + b;\n```\n\nOne acceptable exception to this can be `return`, `break` or `continue` statements,\nprovided that the test condition isn't very long and its body statement occupies only one line.\nHowever you can still choose to use the first rule.\n\n```c++\nif (a > 0) return;\n\nwhile (p)\n{\n    // ...\n    if (!b) continue;\n}\n```\n\n### f. Acceptable conditions to omit braces\n\nWhen the conditional statement in `if`/`else` has only one line and its body occupy only one line,\nthis also applies to loops statements. \\\nNotice that for a series of `if - else` branches, if one branch needs braces then all branches must add braces.\n\n```c++\nif (a < b)  // conditional statement\n    do(a);  // body\n\nif (a < b)\n    do(a);\nelse if (a > b)\n    do(b);\nelse\n    do(c);\n\nif (a < b)\n{\n    do(a);\n}\nelse if (a > b)\n{\n    // curly braces required here, then all branches should also add them\n    do(b);\n    do(d);\n}\nelse\n{\n    do(c);\n}\n```\n\n### g. Brace enclosed initializers\n\nUnlike single-line functions, you must not insert spaces between the brackets and concluded expressions. \\\nBut you must insert a space between the variable name and initializer.\n\n```c++\nClass obj {}; // empty\nClass obj {expr};\nClass obj {expr1, /*...,*/ exprN};\nQVariantMap map {{\"key1\", 5}, {\"key2\", 10}};\n```\n\n## 2. Indentation\n\n4 spaces.\n\n## 3. File encoding and line endings\n\nUTF-8 and Unix-like line ending (LF). Unless some platform specific files need other encodings/line endings.\n\n## 4. Initialization lists\n\nInitialization lists should be vertical. This will allow for more easily readable diffs. The initialization colon should be indented and in its own line along with first argument. The rest of the arguments should be indented too and have the comma prepended.\n\n```c++\nmyClass::myClass(int a, int b, int c, int d)\n    : m_a {a}\n    , m_b {b}\n    , m_c {c}\n    , m_d {d}\n{\n    // code\n}\n```\n\n## 5. Enums\n\nEnums should be vertical. This will allow for more easily readable diffs. The members should be indented.\n\n```c++\nenum Days\n{\n    Monday,\n    Tuesday,\n    Wednesday,\n    Thursday,\n    Friday,\n    Saturday,\n    Sunday\n};\n```\n\n## 6. Names\n\nAll names should be camelCased.\n\n### a. Type names and namespaces\n\nType names and namespaces start with Upper case letter (except POD types).\n\n```c++\nclass ClassName {};\n\nstruct StructName {};\n\nenum EnumName {};\n\nusing SomeList = QList<ClassName>;\n\nnamespace NamespaceName\n{\n}\n```\n\n### b. Variable names\n\nVariable names start with lower case letter.\n\n```c++\nint myVar;\n```\n\n### c. Private member variable names\n\nPrivate member variable names start with lower case letter and should have ```m_``` prefix.\n\n```c++\nclass MyClass\n{\n    int m_myVar;\n}\n```\n\n## 7. Header inclusion order\n\nThe headers should be placed in the following group order:\n\n1. Module header (in .cpp)\n2. C++ Standard Library headers\n3. System headers\n4. Boost library headers\n5. Libtorrent headers\n6. Qt headers\n7. qBittorrent's own headers, starting from the *base* headers.\n\nThe headers should be ordered alphabetically within each group. \\\nIf there are conditionals for the same header group, then put them at the bottom of the respective group. \\\nIf there are conditionals that contain headers from several different header groups, then put them above the \"qBittorrent's own headers\" group.\n\nOne exception is the header containing the library version (for example, QtVersionChecks), this particular header isn't constrained by the aforementioned order.\n\nExample:\n\n```c++\n// file: examplewidget.cpp\n\n// Module header\n#include \"examplewidget.h\"\n\n// exceptions, headers containing version number\n#include <boost/version.hpp>\n#include <libtorrent/version.hpp>\n#include <QtVersionChecks>\n\n// C++ Standard Library headers\n#include <cstdio>\n\n#ifdef Q_OS_WIN  // conditional\n#include <cmath>\n#endif\n\n// System headers\n#ifdef Q_OS_WIN\n#include <windows.h>\n#endif\n\n// Boost library headers\n#include <boost/circular_buffer.hpp>\n\n// Libtorrent headers\n#include <libtorrent/session.hpp>\n\n// Qt headers\n#include <QString>\n#include <QUrl>\n\n#ifdef Q_OS_MACOS  // conditional\n#include <QFont>\n#endif\n\n// conditional that contains headers from several different header groups\n#if LIBTORRENT_VERSION_NUM >= 10100\n#include <memory>\n#include <QElapsedTimer>\n#endif\n\n// qBittorrent's own headers\n#include \"base/bittorrent/infohash.h\"\n#include \"anothermodule.h\"\n#include \"ui_examplewidget.h\"\n```\n\n## 8. Include guard\n\n`#pragma once` must be used instead of a \"classic include guard\":\n\n```c++\n// examplewidget.h\n\n#pragma once\n\n#include <QWidget>\n\nclass ExampleWidget : public QWidget\n{\n    // (some code omitted)\n};\n\n```\n\n## 9. Misc\n\n* Line breaks for long lines with operation:\n\n  ```c++\n  a += \"b\"\n    + \"c\"\n    + \"d\";\n  ```\n\n* **auto** keyword\n\n  We allow the use of the **auto** keyword only where it is strictly necessary (for example, to declare a lambda object, etc.), or where it **enhances** the readability of the code. \\\n  Declarations for which one can gather enough information about the object interface (type) from its name or the usage pattern (an iterator or a loop variable are good examples of clear patterns) or the right part of the expression nicely fit here.\n\n  When weighing whether to use an auto-typed variable please think about potential reviewers of your code, who will read it as a plain diff (on github.com, for instance). \\\n  Please make sure that such reviewers can understand the code completely and without excessive effort.\n\n  Some valid use cases:\n\n  * Container iteration and casts:\n\n    ```c++\n    template <typename List>\n    void doSomethingWithList(const List &list)\n    {\n        foreach (const auto &item, list)\n        {\n            // we don't know item type here so we use 'auto' keyword\n            // do something with item\n        }\n    }\n\n    for (auto it = container.begin(), end = container.end(); it != end; ++it)\n    {\n        // we don't need to know the exact iterator type,\n        // because all iterators have the same interface\n    }\n\n    auto spinBox = static_cast<QSpinBox*>(sender());\n    // we know the variable type based on the right-hand expression\n    ```\n\n  * Notice the spaces in the following specific situations:\n\n    ```c++\n    // Before and after the assignment and other binary (and ternary) operators there should be a space\n    // There should not be a space between increment/decrement and its operand\n    a += 20;\n    a = (b <= MAX_B ? b : MAX_B);\n    ++a;\n    --b;\n    for (int a = 0; a < b; ++b)\n    {\n    }\n    // Range-based for loop, spaces before and after the colon\n    for (auto i : container)\n    {\n    }\n    // Derived class, spaces before and after the colon\n    class Derived : public Base\n    {\n    };\n    ```\n\n* Prefer pre-increment, pre-decrement operators\n\n  ```c++\n  ++i, --j;  // yes\n  i++, j--;  // no\n  ```\n\n* private/public/protected must not be indented\n\n* Preprocessor commands must go at line start\n\n* Method definitions aren't allowed in header files\n\n## 10. Git commit message\n\n1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters. Subject should contain only the very essence of the changes (you should avoid extra details and internals)\n2. Separate subject from body with a blank line\n3. Capitalize the subject line\n4. Do not end the subject line with a period\n5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (it's like you're ordering the program to do something (e.g. \"Don't create temporary substrings\")\n6. Wrap the body at 72 characters\n7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how\n8. If commit fixes a reported issue, mention it in the message body (e.g. `Closes #4134.`)\n\n## 11. Not covered above\n\nIf something isn't covered above, just follow the same style the file you are editing has. \\\n*This guide is not exhaustive and the style for a particular piece of code not specified here will be determined by project members on code review.*\n"

Your complaint will (very likely) be **ignored.** :fearful:\n\n# Submitting an issue/bug report\n\nThis section guides you through submitting an issue/bug report for qBittorrent.\n\nFollowing these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.\n\nMake sure to follow these rules carefully when submitting a bug report. Failure to do so will result in the issue being closed.\n\n## What is an actual bug report?\n\nDevelopers and contributors are not supposed to deal with issues for which little to no investigation to find the actual cause of a purported issue was made by the reporter.\n\nPositive contributions are those which are reported with efforts to find the actual cause of an issue, or at the very least efforts were made to narrow it as much as possible.\n\nRequiring people to investigate as much as possible before opening an issue avoids burdening the project with invalid issues or issues unrelated to qBittorrent.\n\nThe following are _not_ bug reports. **Check the [wiki][wiki-url], [forum][forum-url] or other places for help and support for issues like these**:\n\n-   Explanation of qBittorrent options (see [wiki][wiki-url]).\n-   Help with WebUI setup.\n-   Help with embedded tracker setup.\n-   Help about BitTorrent in general.\n-   Issues with specific search plugins.\n-   Asking for specific builds of qBittorrent other than the current one. You can install older releases at your own risk or for regression testing purposes. Previous Windows and macOS builds are available [here][builds-url].\n    -   If you want older Linux builds, you will have to compile them yourself from the corresponding commits, or ask someone on the [forum][forum-url] to do it for you.\n-   Possibly others. Read on and use common sense.\n\nThe issue tracker is for provable issues only: You will have to make the case that the issue is really with qBittorrent and not something else on your side.\n\nTo make a case means to provide detailed steps so that anybody can reproduce the issue.\nBe sure to rule out that the issue is not caused by something specific on your side.\n\nIssue reports for bugs that apparently aren't easily reproducible or that you can't figure out what triggers it even though you tried are OK.\n\nAny issue opened without effort to provide the required details for developers, contributors or anybody else to reproduce the problem will be closed as invalid.\nFor example:\n-   Crash reports with just a stack trace.\n-   Speculated performance issues that do not come with actual profiling data + analysis supporting the claim.\n\n## Before submitting a bug report\n\n-   **Do some basic troubleshooting (examples)**:\n    -   Restart qBittorrent.\n    -   Restart your PC.\n    -   Update your OS (e.g. Windows updates).\n    -   Update your network card drivers.\n    -   Fully reinstall qBittorrent.\n    -   etc...\n-   Make sure the problem is not caused by anti-virus or other program messing with your files.\n-   Check if you can reproduce the problem in the latest version of qBittorrent.\n-   **Check [forum][forum-url] and [wiki][wiki-url].** You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself.\n-   **Check if the issue exists already in the issue tracker.**\n    -   If it does and the issue is still open, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n    -   If you find a Closed issue that seems like it is the same thing that you're experiencing, open a new issue and include a link to the original issue in the body of your new one.\n-   If the issue is with the search functionality:\n    -   **Make sure you have [`python`][python-url] installed correctly (remember the search functionality requires a working python installation).**\n    -   Make sure it is in fact a problem with the search functionality itself, and not a problem with the plugins. If something does not work properly with the search functionality, the first step is to rule out search plugin-related issues.\n        -   For search plugin issues, report on the respective search plugin support page, or at [qbittorrent/search-plugins][search-plugins-url].\n\n## Steps to ensure a good bug report\n\n**Follow these guidelines** in order to provide as much useful information as possible right away. Not all of them are applicable to all issues, but you are expected to follow most of these steps (use common sense).\nOtherwise, we've noticed that a lot of your time (and the developers') gets thrown away on exchanging back and forth to get this information.\n\n*   Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.\n\n*   Post only **one specific issue per submission.**\n\n*   **Fill out the issue template properly.**\n\n-   **Make sure you are using qBittorrent on a supported platform.** Do not submit issues which can only be reproduced on beta/unsupported releases of supported operating systems (e.g. Windows 10 Insider, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, etc).\nThese are unstable/unsupported platforms, and in all likelihood, whatever the issue is, it is not related to qBittorrent.\n\n*   **Specify the OS you're using, its version and architecture.**\n    *   Examples: Windows 8.1 32-bit, Linux Mint 17.1 64-bit, Windows 10 Fall creators Update 64-bit, etc.\n\n\n*   **Report only if you run into the issue with an official stable release, a beta release, or with the most recent upstream changes (in this last case specify the specific commit you are on).** (beta testing is encouraged :smile:). We do not provide support for bugs on unofficial Windows builds.\n\n*   **Specify the version of qBittorrent** you are using, as well as its **architecture** (x86 or x64) and its **libraries' versions** (Help -> About -> Libraries).\n\n*   Specify **how you installed**:\n    -   Linux: either from the PPA, your distribution's repositories, or compiled from source, or even possibly third-party repositories.\n    -   Windows: either from the installer, or compiled from source, or even possibly third-party repositories.\n    -   macOS: either from the installer, or compiled from source, or even possibly third-party repositories.\n\n\n*   **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.**\n    -   For example, start by explaining how you started qBittorrent, e.g. was it via the terminal? Desktop icon? Did you start it as root or normal user?\n    -   **When listing steps, don't just say what you did, but explain how you did it.**\n        -   For example, if you added a torrent for download, did you do so via a `.torrent` file or via a magnet link? If it was with a torrent file did you do so by dragging the torrent file from the file manager to the transfer list, or did you use the \"Add Torrent File\" in the Top Bar?\n    -   Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior; this is what we'll be looking for after executing the steps.\n\n\n*   **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why.\n\n*   Use **screenshots/animated GIFs to help describe the issue** whenever appropriate [(How?)][attachments-howto-url].\n\n*   If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.\n\n*   **If you are reporting that qBittorrent crashes**, include the stack trace in the report; include it in a code block, a file attachment, or put it in a gist and provide link to that gist.\n\n*   **For performance-related issues**, include as much profiling data as you can (resource usage graphs, etc).\n\n*   Paste the **qBittorrent log** (or put the contents of the log in a gist and provide a link to the gist). The log can be viewed in the GUI (View -> Log -> tick all boxes). If you can't do that, the file is at:\n    -   Linux: `~/.local/share/qBittorrent/logs/qBittorrent.log`\n    -   Windows: `%LocalAppData%\\qBittorrent\\logs`\n    -   macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.log`\n\n\n*   **Do NOT post comments like \"+1\" or \"me too!\"** without providing new relevant info on the issue. Using the built-in reactions is OK though. Remember that you can use the \"subscribe\" button to receive notifications of that report without having to comment first.\n\n*   If there seems to be an **issue with specific torrent files/magnet links**:\n    -   Don't post private `.torrent` files/magnet links, or ones that point to copyrighted content. If you are willing, offer to email a link or the `.torrent` file itself to whoever developer is debugging it and requests it.\n    -   Make sure you can't reproduce the problem with another client, to rule out the possibility that the issue is with the `.torrent` file/magnet link itself.\n\n\n*   A screenshot, transcription or file upload of any of **qBittorrent's preferences that differ from the defaults.** Please include everything different from the defaults whether or not it seems relevant to your issue.\n\n*   **Attachment rules**:\n    -   Short logs and error messages can be pasted as quotes/code whenever small enough; otherwise make a gist with the contents and post the link to the gist.\n    -   Avoid linking/attaching impractical file formats such as PDFs/Word documents with images. If you want to post an image, just post the image.\n\n### Provide more context by answering these questions (if applicable):\n\n-   Can you **reliably reproduce the issue?** If not, provide details about how often the problem happens and under which conditions it normally happens (e.g. only happens with extremely large torrents/only happens after qBittorrent is open for more than 2 days/etc...)\n\n-   Did the problem start happening recently (e.g. after updating to a new version of qBittorrent) or was this always a problem?\n\n-   If the problem started happening recently, can you reproduce the problem in an older version of qBittorrent?\n\n-   Are you saving files locally (in a disk in your machine), or are you saving them remotely (e.g. network drives)?\n\n-   Are you using qBittorrent with multiple monitors? If so, can you reproduce the problem when you use a single monitor?\n\nGood read: [How to Report Bugs Effectively][howto-report-bugs-url]\n\n# Suggesting enhancements/feature requests\n\nThis section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for qBittorrent, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality.\n\nFollowing these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\n\n## Before submitting an enhancement/feature request\n\n*   Check the [wiki][wiki-url] and [forum][forum-url] for tips — you might discover that the enhancement is already available.\n*   Most importantly, check if you're using the latest version of qBittorrent and if you can get the desired behavior by changing qBittorrent's settings.\n*   Check in the [releases][releases-url] page or on the [forum][forum-url], see if there's already a alpha/beta version with that enhancement.\n*   Perform a cursory search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\n\n## Steps to ensure a good enhancement/feature suggestion\n\n-   Specify which version of qBittorrent you're using.\n-   Specify the name and version of the OS you're using.\n-   Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.\n-   Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.\n-   Include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part of qBittorrent which the suggestion is related to.\n-   If this enhancement exists in other BitTorrent clients, list those clients.\n\n# Opening a pull request\n\n*   Consult [coding guidelines][coding-guidelines-url] first. If you are working on translation/i18n, read [\"How to translate qBittorrent\"][how-to-translate-url].\n*   Keep your git commit history clean.\n    * Refer to the section about [\"Git commit messages\"][coding-guidelines-git-commit-message-url] in the coding guidelines.\n    * When merge conflicts arise, do `git rebase <target_branch_name>` and fix the conflicts, don't do `git pull`. Here is a good explanation: [merging-vs-rebasing][merging-vs-rebasing-url].\n*   Keep pull request title concise and provide motivation and \"what it does\" in the pull request description area. Make it easy to read and understand.\n*   Provide screenshots for UI related changes.\n*   If your commit addresses a reported issue (for example issue #8454), append the following text to the commit body `Closes #8454.`. Example [commit][commit-message-fix-issue-example-url].\n*   Search [pull request list][pull-request-list-url] first. Others might have already implemented your idea (or got rejected already).\n\n[attachments-howto-url]: https://help.github.com/articles/file-attachments-on-issues-and-pull-requests\n[builds-url]: https://sourceforge.net/projects/qbittorrent/files/\n[coding-guidelines-url]: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/master/CODING_GUIDELINES.md\n[coding-guidelines-git-commit-message-url]: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/blob/master/CODING_GUIDELINES.md#10-git-commit-message\n[commit-message-fix-issue-example-url]: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/commit/c07cd440cd46345297debb47cb260f8688975f50\n[forum-url]: https://forum.qbittorrent.org/\n[howto-report-bugs-url]: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html\n[how-to-translate-url]: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/How-to-translate-qBittorrent\n[merging-vs-rebasing-url]: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing\n[pull-request-list-url]: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/pulls\n[python-url]: https://www.python.org/\n[releases-url]: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/releases\n[search-plugins-url]: https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins\n[wiki-url]: https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Moe Ghoul>, 1 April 1989\n  Moe Ghoul, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"
