If you are not sure about this, open an issue first, so we can discuss it.\n\n**For your first couple of PRs, start with something small to get familiar with the project and its development processes. Please do not start by adding a large component.**\n\nRead [the Ladybird documentation](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), including the documents in the **Development** section of the `Documentation/README.md` file.\n\nEveryone is welcome to work on the project, and while we have lots of fun, it's a serious kind of fun. :^)\n\n## Communication\n\nJoin [our Discord server](https://discord.gg/nvfjVJ4Svh) to participate in development discussion.\n\n## Issue policy\n\nPlease file any bugs you find, keeping the following in mind:\n\n* One issue per bug. Putting multiple things in the same issue makes both discussion and completion unnecessarily complicated.\n* Follow the [detailed issue-reporting guidelines](ISSUES.md).\n* No build issues (or other support requests). If the GitHub Actions CI build succeeds, the build problem is most likely on your side. Work it out locally, or ask in the `#build-problems` channel on Discord.\n* Don't comment on issues just to add a joke or irrelevant commentary. Hundreds of people get notified about comments so let's keep them relevant.\n\n## Project governance\n\nThe Ladybird project is driven by the [Ladybird Browser Initiative](https://ladybird.org/), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.\n\nPull requests are approved and merged by a group of maintainers. The current group of maintainers are (in alphabetical order):\n\n- [Ali Mohammad Pur (@alimpfard)](https://github.com/alimpfard)\n- [Aliaksandr Kalenik (@kalenikaliaksandr)](https://github.com/kalenikaliaksandr)\n- [Andreas Kling (@awesomekling)](https://github.com/awesomekling)\n- [Andrew Kaster (@ADKaster)](https://github.com/ADKaster)\n- [D√°niel Bertalan (@BertalanD)](https://github.com/BertalanD)\n- [Jelle Raaijmakers (@GMTA)](https://github.com/gmta)\n- [Luke Wilde (@Lubrsi)](https://github.com/Lubrsi)\n- [Sam Atkins (@AtkinsSJ)](https://github.com/AtkinsSJ)\n- [Tim Flynn (@trflynn89)](https://github.com/trflynn89)\n- [Tim Ledbetter (@tcl3)](https://github.com/tcl3)\n\n## Human language policy\n\nIn Ladybird, we treat human language as seriously as we do programming language.\n\nThe following applies to all user-facing strings, code, comments, and commit messages:\n\n* The official project language is American English with ISO 8601 dates and metric units.\n* Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation.\n* Write in an authoritative and technical tone.\n* Avoid contractions, slang, and idioms.\n* Avoid humor, sarcasm, and other forms of non-literal language.\n* Use gender-neutral pronouns, except when referring to a specific person.\n\nNote that this also applies to debug logging and other internal strings, as they may be exposed to users in the future.\n\n## Testing policy\n\nWhen possible, please include tests when fixing bugs or adding new features.\n\nIf changes you‚Äôre making have relevant [Web Platform Tests (WPT)](https://wpt.fyi/) tests¬†‚Äî especially if the changes cause Ladybird to pass any WPT tests it hadn‚Äôt yet been passing¬†‚Äî you should consider [importing those tests into your Ladybird clone](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/Documentation/Testing.md#importing-web-platform-tests), and then commit the imported tests along with your code changes.\n\n## Code submission policy\n\nNobody is perfect, and sometimes we mess things up. That said, here are some good do's & don'ts to try and stick to:\n\n**Do:**\n\n* Write in idiomatic project-style C++23, using the `AK` containers in all code.\n* Conform to the project coding style found in [CodingStyle.md](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/Documentation/CodingStyle.md). Use `clang-format` (version 19) to automatically format C++ files. See [AdvancedBuildInstructions.md](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/blob/master/Documentation/AdvancedBuildInstructions.md#clang-format-updates) for instructions on how to get an up-to-date version if your OS distribution does not ship clang-format-19.\n* Choose expressive variable, function and class names. Make it as obvious as possible what the code is doing.\n* Split your changes into separate, atomic commits (i.e. A commit per feature or fix, where the build, tests and the system are all functioning).\n* Make sure your commits are rebased on the master branch.\n* Wrap your commit messages at 72 characters.\n* The first line of the commit message is the subject line, and must have the format \"Category: Brief description of what's being changed\". The category should be the name of a library, application, service, utility, etc.\n  * Examples: `LibMedia`, `WebContent`, `CI`, `AK`, `RequestServer`, `js`\n  * Don't use a category like \"`Libraries`\" or \"`Utilities`\", except for generic changes that affect a large portion of code within these directories.\n  * Don't use specific component names, e.g. C++ class names, as the category either - mention them in the summary instead. E.g. `LibGUI: Brief description of what's being changed in FooWidget` rather than `FooWidget: Brief description of what's being changed`\n  * Several categories may be combined with `+`, e.g. `LibJS+LibWeb+Browser: ...`\n* Write the commit message subject line in the imperative mood (\"Foo: Change the way dates work\", not \"Foo: Changed the way dates work\").\n* Write your commit messages in proper English, with care and punctuation.\n* Amend your existing commits when adding changes after a review, where relevant.\n* Mark each review comment as \"resolved\" after pushing a fix with the requested changes.\n* Add your personal copyright line to files when making substantive changes. (Optional but encouraged!)\n* Check the spelling of your code, comments and commit messages.\n* If you have images that go along with your code, run `optipng -strip all` on them to optimize and strip away useless metadata - this can reduce file size from multiple kilobytes to a couple hundred bytes.\n\n**Don't:**\n\n* Submit changes that are incompatible with the project licence (2-clause BSD.)\n* Touch anything outside the stated scope of the PR.\n* Iterate excessively on your design across multiple commits.\n* Use weasel-words like \"refactor\" or \"fix\" to avoid explaining what's being changed.\n* End commit message subject lines with a period.\n* Include commented-out code.\n* Write in C. (Instead, take advantage of C++'s amenities, and don't limit yourself to the standard C library.)\n* Attempt large architectural changes until you are familiar with the system and have worked on it for a while.\n* Engage in excessive \"feng shui programming\" by moving code around without quantifiable benefit.\n* Add jokes or other \"funny\" things to user-facing parts of the system.\n\n## On usage of AI and LLMs\n\nUsage of AI assistance is usually fine, but you are responsible for making sure the quality of the output is up to the\nstandards of the project. Currently, AI-generated output is often too verbose and its quality is subpar compared to what\nmost human contributors produce.\n\nDo not use an AI or LLM to generate changes, respond to issues or interact with PRs without holding the output to the\nsame standards as human-written content.\n\n## Pull Request Q&A\n\n### I've submitted a PR and it passes CI. When can I expect to get some review feedback?\n\nWhile unadvertised PRs may get randomly merged by curious maintainers, you will have a much smoother time if you engage with the community on Discord.\n\n### If my PR isn't getting attention, how long should I wait before pinging one of the project maintainers?\n\nPing them right away if it's something urgent! If it's less urgent, advertise your PR on Discord (`#code-review`) and ask if someone could review it.\n\n### Is there a policy for branches/PRs that haven't been touched in X days? Should they be closed?\n\nYes, we have a \"stalebot\" that will mark untouched PRs as \"stale\" after 21 days, and close them after another 7 days if nothing happens.\n\n### Are there specific people to reach out to for different subsystems (e.g. Networking, GUI, CSS, etc)?\n\nIn theory, the best person to speak with is whoever wrote most code adjacent to what you're working on. In practice, asking in one of the development channels on Discord is usually easier/better, since that allows many people to join the discussion.\n\n### Is Discord the place to ask for review help, or is GitHub preferred?\n\nIt's definitely better to ask on Discord. Due to the volume of GitHub notifications, many of us turn them off and rely on Discord for learning about review requests.\n\n## Commit Hooks\n\nThe repository contains a file called `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that defines several 'commit hooks' that can be run automatically just before and after creating a new commit. These hooks lint your commit message, and the changes it contains to ensure they will pass the automated CI for pull requests.\nTo enable these hooks firstly follow the installation instructions available at https://pre-commit.com/#install and then enable one or both of the following hooks:\n - pre-commit hook - Runs Meta/lint-ci.sh and Meta/lint-ports.py to ensure changes to the code will pass linting:\n   ```console\n   pre-commit install\n   ```\n - post-commit hook - Lints the commit message to ensure it will pass the commit linting:\n   ```console\n   pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg\n   ```\n\n## Git Notes\n\nThe GitHub project contains [git notes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes) for each commit that includes e.g. a link to\nthe pull request from which the commit originated and reviewer information. These are updated automatically, but require\nan additional step locally to be able to see the notes in `git log`:\n\n```bash\ngit config --add remote.upstream.fetch '+refs/notes/*:refs/notes/*'\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The `upstream` remote in this command should be replaced with whatever you've named the LadybirdBrowser/ladybird.git\n> remote in your local clone. Use `git remote -v` to find that name.\n\nNow, any time you `git fetch`, the latest notes will be fetched as well. You will see information like the following when\nyou run `git log`:\n\n```\ncommit c1b0e180ba64d2ea7e815e2c2e93087ae9a26500\nAuthor: Timothy Flynn <trflynn89@pm.me>\nDate:   Mon Jul 29 10:18:25 2024 -0400\n\n    LibWebView: Insert line numbers before each line in about:srcdoc\n\n    The behavior chosen here (fixed-width counters, alignment, etc.) matches\n    Firefox.\n\nNotes:\n    Author: https://github.com/trflynn89\n    Commit: https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/commit/c1b0e180ba6\n    Pull-request: https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/892\n    Reviewed-by: https://github.com/AtkinsSJ ‚úÖ\n```\n\n## On abandoned pull requests\n\nSometimes good PRs get abandoned by the author for one reason or another. If the PR is fundamentally good, but the author is not responding to requests, the PR may be manually integrated with minor changes to code and commit messages.\n\nTo make this easier, we do appreciate it if folks enable the \"Allow edits from maintainers\" flag on their pull requests.\n\n## On neutrality\n\nOur goal is to build a browser for everyone, irrespective of their specific opinions and worldviews.\nTo achieve this, we strive to set our differences aside and focus on the shared goal of building the browser.\n\nThis means:\n- We welcome contributions from anyone who is committed to the project's goals and respects the collaborative environment.\n- Our discussions and work will remain strictly related to browser development and web standards. We do not take positions on issues outside this scope.\n- The project will not be used as a platform to advertise or promote causes unrelated to browser development or web standards.\n- To maintain a focused and productive environment, discussions on societal politics and other divisive topics are discouraged in project spaces.\n\nWe encourage everyone to share their personal views and opinions outside project spaces. However, please keep project spaces focused on project goals.\n\n## On bad-faith contributions and brigading\n\nWe reserve the right to reject issues and pull requests that appear to be motivated by bad faith.\n\nAdditionally, anyone found participating in social media brigading of Ladybird will be permanently banned from the project.\n"

          "content": "# Issue-reporting guidelines\n\nReport problems using our detailed [bug-reporting\nform](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml), which helps to ensure that, for us to reproduce and investigate the problem, your bug report includes the information needed¬†‚Äî including a reduced test case.\n\n## How you can write a reduced test case\n\nWhen raising an issue, the single-most important thing you can provide is a reduced test others can use to reproduce the problem.\n\nYou can create a reduced test case for a problem by starting from the HTML/JS/CSS source for a particular website/page which causes the problem, and removing as much content as possible while still having a document that reproduces the problem.\n\nHere‚Äôs how you can do that:\n\n1. Create a local `REDUCTION.html` (or whatever name) copy of the page¬†‚Äî ideally by using something like the [SingleFile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/) extension for Firefox or Chrome to save a canned copy of the page as it currently exists (post-JS-execution).\n\n   That also allows you to use Firefox/Chrome devtools to quickly strip out irrelevant elements from the page before saving a copy.\n\n2. If you‚Äôre *not* using something like SingleFile, then: To ensure any images,external style sheets, or external scripts that use a relative path will get loaded by your local `REDUCTION.html` document, put a `base` element into the document¬†‚Äî like this:\n\n   ```html\n   <base href=\"https://ladybird.org/\">\n   ```\n\n    However, if the problem appears to be caused not by anything in the source of the document itself, but instead by something in an external script or external stylesheet, then you‚Äôll also need to create a local copy of the problem script or problem stylesheet.\n\n3. Open/load the `REDUCTION.html` file in Ladybird, and verify that the same problem occurs with it as occurs with the original website/page you copied it from.\n\n4. **Script-related problems:** Especially if you believe the problem is related to any JavaScript that the document is executing, then temporarily disable scripting by unchecking **Enable Scripting** option in the **Debug** menu in Ladybird, and then reload the `REDUCTION.html` file in Ladybird.\n\n   * If the problem still happens after you‚Äôve disabled scripting, then you can remove any and all `script` elements from the document, and you can continue on from there.\n\n   * If the problem does not happen any longer after you‚Äôve disabled scripting, then that tells you the cause is related to the contents from one or more of the `script` elements, and you can check the **Enable Scripting** option to turn scripting back on, and you can continue on from there.\n\n5. **CSS-related problems**: Especially if you believe that the problem is related to any CSS stylesheets the document is using, then:\n\n   1. [If you‚Äôve not used something like the [SingleFile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/) extension for Firefox or Chrome] Add a `style` element in the `REDUCTION.html` file, and then for each external style sheet the document has, paste the contents from that external stylesheet into that `style` element.\n\n   2. Start removing CSS rules from any and all `style` elements in the document, and reload the `REDUCTION.html` file in Ladybird.\n\n      * If the problem does not happen any longer after you‚Äôve removed a particular CSS rule, then you may have isolated the cause. Re-add that CSS rule to the document, and continue on from there.\n\n      * If the problem does continue to happen after you‚Äôve removed a CSS rule, then you‚Äôve successfully reduced the test case by one CSS rule, and you can continue on from there.\n\n   Either way, keep repeating the two steps above, removing CSS rules one by one, and with each removal, checking whether the problem still happens¬†‚Äî and if it does, putting the CSS rule you removed back into the document, or otherwise, leaving the CSS rule out and moving on.\n\n6. **HTML-related problems:** Begin removing one *element* at time from the `REDUCTION.html` file, starting with the elements in the document `head`.\n\n7. Reload the `REDUCTION.html` file in Ladybird, and verify whether the problem is still happening.\n\n   * If the problem does not happen any longer after you‚Äôve removed a particular element, then you may have isolated the cause. Re-add that element to the document, and continue on from there.\n\n   * If the problem does continue to happen after you‚Äôve removed a particular element, then you‚Äôve successfully reduced the test case by one element, and you can continue on from there.\n\n   Either way, keep repeating the steps: removing elements one by one, and with each removal, checking whether the problem still happens¬†‚Äî and if it does, putting the element you removed back into the document, or otherwise, leaving the element out and moving on.\n\nIn the end, after following the steps above and removing elements and CSS rules, you‚Äôll have a reduced test case that you can include when you raise an issue for the problem.\n\n## How to share/publish your reduced test case at a URL\n\nYou can take your reduced test case and post it online at a site such as the following:\n\n* https://codepen.io/pen/\n* https://jsbin.com\n* https://jsfiddle.net\n\nThat will give you a URL which you can then include in the issue you raise for the problem.\n\n*[Credits: The ‚ÄúHow you can write a reduced test case‚Äù details above are largely taken from https://webkit.org/test-case-reduction/.]*\n"

          "content": "# Security Policy\n\nLadybird is unreleased software still in early development, and so bugs and vulnerabilities in its code can be safely\ndisclosed publicly. The preference is to report security issues as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).\n\nHowever, private vulnerability reporting is also enabled on the repository. If you find a security issue in Ladybird,\nor in another web browser that you believe affects Ladybird, you may report it privately to the maintainers\nusing the [process outlined in GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/working-with-repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory).\n\nIssues reported and accepted through the private reporting process will be disclosed publicly once they are resolved,\nand given a security advisory identifier. The maintainers may include regular contributors in the disposition and resolution\nprocess as their expertise requires. Researchers who report security issues privately will be credited in the advisory.\n\nThe maintainers reserve the right to reject reports that are not security issues, or that are not in the scope of Ladybird.\nFor issues that are determined to not be security issues, please report them as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)\ninstead. If you choose not to re-report the issue as a generic issue, the maintainers may do so themselves.\n\nLadybird does not offer bug bounties for security issues at this time.\n\nIf your issue was found using a fuzzer, please check [oss-fuzz](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/list?q=label:Proj-serenity) first to see if it has already been recorded.\n\n## Scope of Security Issues\n\nMany security features of the web platform are not yet implemented in Ladybird. Security reports regarding\nincomplete features may be redirected to regular issues. The following are examples of issues that are not in scope\nat this time:\n\n- Cross-site request forgery\n- Cross-site scripting\n- Content Security Policy violations\n- Cross-origin iframe sandboxing\n\nThe maintainers reserve the right to modify this list as the project matures and as security issues are reported.\n\nSignificant portions of the browser depend on third party libraries. Examples include image decoding, video decoding,\ninternationalization, and 2D graphics. Security issues in these libraries should be reported to the maintainers of the\nrespective libraries. The maintainers of Ladybird will work with the maintainers of these libraries to resolve the issue.\nIf a security issue relates more to the integration of the library into Ladybird, it should be reported via the same\nmethods as other security issues.\n\n## Responsible Disclosure\n\nThe maintainers of Ladybird will work with security researchers to resolve security issues in a timely manner. A default\n30-day disclosure timeline is in place for all security issues, but this may be extended if the maintainers and the reporter\nagree that more time is needed to resolve the issue. The maintainers will keep the reporter informed of progress and\nresolution steps throughout the process.\n\nIn the case that a security issue is also reported to other browser vendors or OSS projects, the maintainers will work\nwith the longest disclosure timeline to ensure that all parties have sufficient time to resolve the issue.\n"
