          "content": "# Contributing to Calculator\nThe Calculator team encourages community feedback and contributions. Thank you for your interest in\nmaking Calculator better! There are several ways you can get involved.\n\n## Reporting issues and suggesting new features\nIf Calculator is not working properly, please file a report in the \n[Feedback Hub](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/fb/?contextid=130&newFeedback=True).\nFeedback Hub reports automatically include diagnostic data, such as the version of Calculator\nyou're using.\n\nWe are happy to hear your ideas for the future of Calculator. Check the\n[Feedback Hub](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/fb/?contextid=130) and see if others have\nsubmitted similar feedback. You can upvote existing feedback or submit a new suggestion.\n\nWe always look at upvoted items in Feedback Hub when we decide what to work on next. We read the\ncomments in both Feedback Hub and GitHub, and we look forward to hearing your input. Remember that\nall community interactions must abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Finding issues you can help with\nLooking for something to work on?\nIssues marked [``good first issue``](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/labels/good%20first%20issue)\nare a good place to start.\n\nYou can also check the [``help wanted``](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/labels/help%20wanted) tag to find \nother issues to help with. If you're interested in working on a fix, leave a comment to let everyone know and to help\navoid duplicated effort from others.\n\n## Contributions we accept\nWe welcome your contributions to the Calculator project, especially to fix bugs and to make\nimprovements which address the top issues reported by Calculator users. Some general guidelines:\n\n* **DO** create one pull request per Issue, and ensure that the Issue is linked in the pull request.\n* **DO** follow our [Coding and Style](#style-guidelines) guidelines, and keep code changes as small as possible.\n* **DO** include corresponding tests whenever possible.\n* **DO** check for additional occurrences of the same problem in other parts of the codebase before submitting your PR.\n* **DO** [link the issue](https://github.com/blog/957-introducing-issue-mentions) you are addressing in the \n   pull request.\n* **DO** write a good description for your pull request. More detail is better. Describe *why* the change is being \n   made and *why* you have chosen a particular solution. Describe any manual testing you performed to validate your change.\n* **DO NOT** submit a PR unless it is linked to an Issue marked \n   [`triage approved`](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Triage%3A+Approved%22). \n   This enables us to have a discussion on the idea before anyone invests time in an implementation.\n* **DO NOT** merge multiple changes into one PR unless they have the same root cause.\n* **DO NOT** submit pure formatting/typo changes to code that has not been modified otherwise.\n\nWe follow a [user-centered process for developing features](docs/NewFeatureProcess.md). New features\nneed sponsorship from the Calculator team, but we welcome community contributions at many stages of\nthe process.\n\n> Submitting a pull request for an approved Issue is not a guarantee it will be approved.\n> The change must meet our high bar for code quality, architecture, and performance, as well as\n> [other requirements](#docs/NewFeatureProcess.md#technical-review).\n\n## Making changes to the code\n\n### Preparing your development environment\nTo learn how to build the code and run tests, follow the instructions in the [README](README.md).\n\n### Style guidelines\nThe code in this project uses several different coding styles, depending on the age and history of\nthe code. Please attempt to match the style of surrounding code as much as possible. In new\ncomponents, prefer the patterns described in the \n[C++ core guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)\nand the [modern C++/WinRT language projections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/cpp-and-winrt-apis/).\n\n### Testing\nYour change should include tests to verify new functionality wherever possible. Code should be\nstructured so that it can be unit tested independently of the UI. [Manual test cases](docs/ManualTests.md)\nshould be used where automated testing is not feasible.\n\n### Git workflow\nCalculator uses the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) where most\ndevelopment happens directly on the `main` branch. The `main` branch should always be in a\nhealthy state which is ready for release.\n\nIf your change is complex, please clean up the branch history before submitting a pull request.\nYou can use [git rebase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/rebase#squash-local-commits)\nto group your changes into a small number of commits which we can review one at a time.\n\nWhen completing a pull request, we will generally squash your changes into a single commit. Please\nlet us know if your pull request needs to be merged as separate commits.\n\n## Review Process\nAfter submitting a pull request, members of the calculator team will review your code. We will\nassign the request to an appropriate reviewer. Any member of the community may\nparticipate in the review, but at least one member of the Calculator team will ultimately approve\nthe request.\n\nOften, multiple iterations will be needed to responding to feedback from reviewers. Try looking at\n[past pull requests](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) to see\nwhat the experience might be like.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\nBefore we can review and accept a pull request from you, you'll need to sign a Contributor License\nAgreement (CLA). The CLA ensures that the community is free to use your contributions. More\ninformation about the agreement is available on the [Microsoft web site](https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com/).\nSigning the CLA is an automated process, and you only need to do it once for Microsoft projects on\nGitHub.\n\nYou don't need to sign a CLA until you're ready to create a pull request. When your pull request is\ncreated, it is classified by a bot. If the change is trivial (i.e. you just fixed a typo) then the\nbot will label the PR `cla-not-required`. Otherwise, it's classified as `cla-required`. In that\ncase, the system will also tell you how you can sign the CLA. Once you have signed a CLA, the\ncurrent and all future pull requests will be labeled as `cla-signed`.\n"

          "content": "# Calculator\nThe Windows Calculator app is a modern Windows app written in C++ and C# that ships pre-installed with Windows.\nThe app provides standard, scientific, and programmer calculator functionality, as well as a set of converters between various units of measurement and currencies.\n\nCalculator ships regularly with new features and bug fixes. You can get the latest version of Calculator in the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFHVN5).\n\n[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/actions/workflows/action-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator/actions/workflows/action-ci.yml)\n\n<img src=\"docs/Images/CalculatorScreenshot.png\" alt=\"Calculator Screenshot\" width=\"450px\" />\n\n## Features\n- Standard Calculator functionality which offers basic operations and evaluates commands immediately as they are entered.\n- Scientific Calculator functionality which offers expanded operations and evaluates commands using order of operations.\n- Programmer Calculator functionality which offers common mathematical operations for developers including conversion between common bases.\n- Date Calculation functionality which offers the difference between two dates, as well as the ability to add/subtract years, months and/or days to/from a given input date.\n- Calculation history and memory capabilities.\n- Conversion between many units of measurement.\n- Currency conversion based on data retrieved from [Bing](https://www.bing.com).\n- [Infinite precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic) for basic\n  arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) so that calculations\n  never lose precision.\n\n## Getting started\nPrerequisites:\n- Your computer must be running Windows 11, build 22000 or newer.\n- Install the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads) (the free community edition is sufficient).\n  - Install the \"Universal Windows Platform Development\" workload.\n  - Install the optional \"C++ Universal Windows Platform tools\" component.\n  - Install the latest Windows 11 SDK.\n\n  ![Visual Studio Installation Screenshot](docs/Images/VSInstallationScreenshot.png)\n- Install the [XAML Styler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamXavalon.XAMLStyler) Visual Studio extension.\n\n- Get the code:\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator.git\n    ```\n\n- Open [src\\Calculator.sln](/src/Calculator.sln) in Visual Studio to build and run the Calculator app.\n- For a general description of the Calculator project architecture see [ApplicationArchitecture.md](docs/ApplicationArchitecture.md).\n- To run the UI Tests, you need to make sure that\n  [Windows Application Driver (WinAppDriver)](https://github.com/microsoft/WinAppDriver/releases/latest)\n  is installed.\n\n## Contributing\nWant to contribute? The team encourages community feedback and contributions. Please follow our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf Calculator is not working properly, please file a report in the [Feedback Hub](https://insider.windows.com/en-us/fb/?contextid=130).\nWe also welcome [issues submitted on GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues).\n\n## Roadmap\nFor information regarding Windows Calculator plans and release schedule, please see the [Windows Calculator Roadmap](docs/Roadmap.md).\n\n### Graphing Mode\nAdding graphing calculator functionality [is on the project roadmap](https://github.com/Microsoft/calculator/issues/338) and we hope that this project can create a great end-user experience around graphing. To that end, the UI from the official in-box Windows Calculator is currently part of this repository, although the proprietary Microsoft-built graphing engine, which also drives graphing in Microsoft Mathematics and OneNote, is not. Community members can still be involved in the creation of the UI, however developer builds will not have graphing functionality due to the use of a [mock implementation of the engine](/src/GraphingImpl/Mocks) built on top of a\n[common graphing API](/src/GraphingInterfaces).\n\n## Diagnostic Data\nThis project collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services.\nRead our [privacy statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839) to learn more.\nDiagnostic data is disabled in development builds by default, and can be enabled with the `SEND_DIAGNOSTICS`\nbuild flag.\n\n## Currency Converter\nWindows Calculator includes a currency converter feature that uses mock data in developer builds. The data that\nMicrosoft uses for the currency converter feature (e.g., in the retail version of the application) is not licensed\nfor your use. The mock data will be clearly identifiable as it references planets instead of countries,\nand remains static regardless of selected inputs.\n\n## Reporting Security Issues\nPlease refer to [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
