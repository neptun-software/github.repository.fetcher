even though it was possible to work around them, users were\n  still getting confused.\n* added an initial PipeWire output plugin; included by default on Ubuntu 21.04\n  and Feodra 34.\n* fixed some build issues where opting out of bundled TagLib didn't work\n  properly.\n* updated CMake build scripts to fail fast if required libraries are not found.\n* updated error logging to exclude ffmpeg end-of-file warning, it was just\n  polluting things.\n* ongoing warning cleanups against more modern compilers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.96.5\n\n* ensure we statically link against the brew version of ncurses on macOS when\n  building pre-compiled artifacts\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.96.4\n\n* added mouse wheel support to non-Windows platforms.\n* fixed some difficult-to-reproduce issues that could corrupt layout.\n* optimized app resize logic so its simpler and more performant.\n* fixed issues with terminal emulators on macOS that support REP (e.g. kitty)\n  by linking against the less buggy, homebrew-provided version of ncurses.\n* upgraded to the most recent version of Android Studio tooling for the\n  musikdroid app.\n* fixed a bug where track numbers would not be correct after loading a session\n  where the last viewed content was a playlist.\n* ongoing warning cleanups against more modern compilers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.96.3\n\n* fixed a bug that could cause terminal output to get corrupted when switching\n  songs (@the-eater)\n* fixed a bug that was preventing the update check from displaying a dialog on\n  completion.\n* fixed now playing readout ellipsizing.\n* fixed a bug where `last.fm` scrobbles may get posted twice per track.\n* added a hotkey to clear the play queue; press `shift+x` in the play queue\n  window.\n* fixed `HttpClient` user agent to distinguish between `win32` and `win64`\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.96.2\n\n* fixed a crash in HttpClient that was only manifesting on some architectures\n  and compilers.\n* fixed a bug where UI may be updated from a background thread, leading to\n  undefined behavior.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.96.1\n\n* additional fixes for older versions of libcurl (< 7.2.0)\n* relax client/server version matching to exclude patch version (e.g. versions\n  0.96.0 and 0.96.1 are considered compatible, but 0.96 and 0.97 are not)\n* upgraded libmicrohttpd to 0.9.71 on macOS and fixed static build\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.96.0\n\n* improved input latency, especially related to mouse events.\n* updated zh_CN localization (Siheyuan98)\n* added support for older versions of libcurl (< 7.2.0)\n* added an advanced setting to ignore client/server version mismatches when\n  connecting to remote libraries\n* added the server version to the user facing error that is displayed on\n  remote library version mismatch.\n* added the app version to the bottom of the settings screen.\n* fixed milkdrop plugin build\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.95.0\n\n* added support for searching by regex; press `M-m` in track or filter views to\n  toggle between regex and legacy searching. while regex is enabled, the search\n  box will have a blue (instead of red) border.\n* relaxed search to ignore accents. for example: 'À', 'Á`, 'Â`, etc are all\n  considered equivalent to the english 'A', and vice versa.\n* fixed a bug where remote library ports greater than 32767 caused the app to\n  crash.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.94.0\n\n* added support for remote libraries (i.e connecting to a musikcube app or\n  daemon running on a different machine) to the terminal client:\n  - updated nearly all queries against the database in the app to be\n    asynchronous. this was not necessary before because most local DB queries\n    are extremely fast; however, when queries are sent over the network that may\n    not be the case. there are still a small handful of queries made on the UI\n    thread, but all of the really egregious ones have been fixed.\n  - added a new `ISerializableQuery` interface that defines how a query can be\n    serialized and deserialized. all queries now implement this interface.\n  - defined a new `SendRawQuery` method to `IMetadataProxy` that is used by the\n    server to send serialized queries to `musikcore`, and then respond with\n    serialized results to the calling client.\n  - added `WebSocketClient` that is used to connect to a `musikcube` server and\n    authenticate. it takes serialized queries from the client and sends them to\n    the server, then parses responses and unpacks the serialized result.\n  - added a new `RemoteLibrary` implementation of `ILibrary`. it serializes\n    queries and sends them to the server via `WebSocketClient`. once complete,\n    `WebSocketClient` hands the serialized result back to `RemoteLibrary`, which\n    then deserializes the result into the original query and notifies the caller.\n  - added `MasterLibrary` in the same vein as `MasterTransport`. it's more a\n    less a `pimpl` that allows us to switch the selected library under the hood\n    without a majority of the app knowing or caring.\n  - revamped the settings screen to allow selecting between local and remote\n    libraries.\n  - added a new screen that is displayed when a remote library is disconnected,\n    and shows some diagnostic information.\n  - added a new banner on the top of the app when connected to a remote library.\n  - added buffering states to Stream/Transport/PlaybackService and friends.\n  - updated the transport window to display buffering status when appropriate.\n* fixed a number of bugs in `cursespp` related to nested layout focusing.\n* fixed buggy visibility change events in `cursespp::Window` and removed old\n  hacked-up code that was working around the problems in the app layer.\n* fixed a handful of `KeyPress()` propagation bugs across the app.\n* found and fixed a handful of bugs in `HttpDataStream` that have been laying\n  dormant, waiting to be exercised.\n* fixed bugs related to `LruDiskCache` parsing and pruning.\n* fixed potential memory leaks in GmeDataStream and OpenMptDataStream\n* fixed some weird edge-casey command bar focus issues.\n* finally renamed `src/core` to `src/musikcore`\n* added a ja_JP locale (trackiss)\n* updated ru_RU locale (adem4ik)\n* fixed a bug where on-demand mp3 transcoding wasn't working properly. (other\n  formats were fine)\n* rearranged the settings window to ensure everything fits properly in an 80x24\n  terminal\n* fixed some bugs in `MessageQueue` by now requiring explicit `IMessageTarget`\n  registration and unregistration for all messages. there was a small time\n  window (read: race condition) where it was possible to attempt to dispatch\n  messages to a destroyed target.\n* fixed a handful of components that were running their initial queries twice\n  or more as they were being initialized.\n* updated copyright date across all source files\n* upgraded a number of tools and dependencies:\n  - migrated to VS2019 for Windows musikcube builds\n  - migrated to Android Studio 4.1 for musikdroid builds\n  - upgraded `websocketpp` and `json.hpp` and moved them out of `src/plugins`\n    and into `src/3rdparty` so they can be used by the main app.\n  - upgraded to boost 1.74.0\n  - upgraded to openssl 1.1.1h\n* fixed a bug in the indexer that could prevent custom sources from getting\n  interrupted correctly.\n* fixed a bug in libmicrothttpd version detection.\n* fixed a bug where switching to a different output device while paused would\n  cause playback to resume.\n* moved all shell scripts to their own subdirectory so they don't pollute the\n  root.\n* fixed an old bug in `LocalLibrary` that could cause query result callbacks\n  to fire twice.\n* added the ability to limit the number of simultaneous audio transcoders in\n  the server.\n* added support for Ubuntu Groovy\n* various other minor fixes that were exposed by making queries asynchronous by\n  default.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.93.1\n\nserver:\n* fixed compile error on some platforms caused by updated libmicrohttpd APIs\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.93.0\n\nmusikcube:\n* added a new decoder based on `libopenmpt` to support playing mod/tracker\n  files.\n* fixed a bug when browsing directories that contain entries from custom\n  `IndexerSource` plugins.\n* fixed directory scanning bugs related to NFS (and potentially other\n  filesystem) volumes.\n* fixed a nasty race condition in the MPRIS plugin that could cause the app to\n  crash on certain events.\n* compile against the source version of taglib to get a number of important\n  bug fixes that haven't been released yet.\n* fixed a memory leak in the GME plugin when aborting a directory scan\n* fixed a bug that could cause advanced setting integer values to not save\n  properly.\n* reduced Indexer log spew.\n* removed more unnecessary boost cruft in the Indexer\n* fixed an Indexer bug that could result in tracks not getting added to the\n  library.\n* fixed a bug where the Indexer couldn't always be interrupted while scanning.\n* upgraded snap from core18 to core20.\n\nmusikdroid:\n* upgrade to Android Studio 4.0 and related tooling\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.92.1\n\nserver:\n* fixed a bug where HTTP authentication was not functioning properly and could\n  allow unauthenticated clients to download tracks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.92.0\n\nmusikcube:\n* fixed bug in the ffmpeg decoder where\n* added three new hotkeys:\n  - `M-P`: start playback from the top of the current list of tracks\n  - `]`: jump to the next group in the current track list\n  - `[`: jump to the previous group in the current track list\n* added the ability to disable terminal title upgrades in `advanced settings`\n* updated ru_RU localization (adem4ik)\n* optimized png files (adem4ik)\n* added zn_CN localization (Siheyuan98)\n* fixed a bug where binary stripping was broken for out of tree builds\n* added the ability to disable binary stripping via DISABLE_STRIP=true flag\n* fixed `archive-win.sh`

dependencies\n\nserver:\n* added new `X-musikcube-File-Extension` HTTP response header that clients can\n  use as a hint when naming downloaded files.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.90.1\n\n(windows-only release)\n\nmusikcube:\n* fixed crash in win32 server caused by an incorrectly-compiled zlib\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.90.0\n\nmusikcube:\n* included a new `musikcube-cmd.exe` binary that can be run from

`track_num` field to track resources in `websocket_remote`\n* fixed local cache filename generation in `musikdroid`\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.16.0\n\nuser-facing:\n* added a toggle in the `musikdroid` toolbar for quickly switching between\n  remote and streaming mode\n* removed volume and seek buttons; replaced with a seekbar, current and\n  total time indicators.\n* revamped loading indicators to be less jarring\n\nlow-level:\n\n* integrated with a customized version of the `AndroidVideoCache` library to\n  (hopefully) improve caching reliability.\n* improved battery usage in `musikdroid`'s `SystemService`\n* fixed bug where `websocket_remote` was not letting clients know when seeking\n  has occurred.\n* deliberately under-estimate calculated `Content-Length` header when doing\n  on-demand transcoding. http clients seem to be more ok with this, as compared\n  to over-estimating.\n* fixed a bug where `websocket_remote` audio server would incorrectly return a\n  216 status instead of a 200, confusing clients\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.15.0\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* added `server settings` configuration panel to the settings screen\n* added `minimize to tray` and `start minimized` options to the windows build\n* a handful of small `musikdroid` bug fixes, mostly related to audio focus\n  and ducking.\n* documented the `websocket_remote` api on the wiki\n\nlow-level:\n\n* added authentication support to the the `websocket_remote` audio server\n* found and fixed a handful of missing `websocket_remote` metadata responses\n* added the ability to hot-reload plugins\n* modified `IPlugin` -- every plugin must now supply a unique `guid`\n* fixed a bug in Transcoder if the number of cache files was set to 0\n* fixed a number of bugs that could result in undefined behavior or crashes if\n  views are drawn outside of their parents (or screen) bounds\n* fixed a bug where input fields may stop drawing properly if the value entered\n  by the user exceeds the window bounds\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.14.0\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* `musikdroid` enhancements:\n  - `pause` when headphones are disconnected\n  - `double tap` headset button to go to next track\n  - `triple tap` headset button to go to prev track\n  - added album art to lock screen controls\n  - added the ability to control streaming disk cache size\n* `websocket_remote` plugin:\n  - added Cache-Control headers to responses\n* `core`:\n  - found a really bad bug in the way we handle tracks in playlists. the fix\n    requires a rebuild of the tracks metadata, which will clear playlists, but\n    ensures this will never happen again in the future.\n\nlow-level:\n\n* cleaned up more SDK interfaces, removed support for uint64 and uint32 types,\n  only support int64 and int32.\n* fixed bugs in playlist track handling; playlist contents can now survive track\n  table rebuilds!\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.13.0\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* added on-demand audio transcoding (downsampling) to the http server. users\n  can configure transcoding in the `musikdroid` client.\n* fixed a bug in album id handling to properly support multiple albums with the\n  same name by different artists (this was only half working before).\n* added ssl support to the `musikdroid` client, and instructions on the wiki\n  for enabling ssl on the server-side.\n* added `buffering` indicators to `musikdroid`.\n\nlow-level:\n\n* added missing IBuffer::Destroy method, and added IEnvironment::GetBuffer so\n  plugins can decode audio data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.12.1\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* huge update to `musikdroid` -- it is now able to stream music  from any\n  `musikbox` installation! see settings > playback mode.\n* added cddb (actually, freedb) lookup for audio CDs\n* added new \"add to beginning of play queue\" and \"play album\" context menu\n  options\n\nlow-level:\n\n* fixed database upsert logic to be faster and more reliable\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.12.0\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* fixed bug where \"sync on startup\" was not working properly\n* fixed musikdroid bug where ui may get drawn in a weird state if the playing\n  track has an empty album name.\n* fixed a bug in CddaIndexerSource that may cause tracks to linger in the\n  library longer than they should if the drive letter changed.\n* added an http server to the `websocket_remote` plugin to serve audio data.\n  this completes most work required to support external, thin clients.\n  metadata can be queried via websocket, audio streamed over http. powered by\n  libmicrohttpd.\n\nlow-level:\n\n* added HttpDataStream! finally! uses libcurl and libressl. audio data can now\n  be played over http/https!\n* performance optimizations to metadata indexing -- drop indexes before a full\n  resync, then re-add them after.\n* playlist tracks are now stored by external ids! this means tracks added from\n  third party indexer sources can be added to playlists and persisted across\n  rescans.\n* IIndexerSources can be interrupted, and failed sources can have their changes\n  rolled back.\n* upgraded to Windows 10 SDK and VS141 tooling\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.11.0\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* added a new cd playback plugin based on new infrastructure. audio cds will\n  be detected and added to the library as [audio cd] and can be played like\n  any other tracks. (note: win32 only for now)\n* added the ability to toggle between seek and scrub playback modes\n* fixed a couple localized strings\n* fixed a bug that could cause the currently selected item in the play queue\n  to jump around or be incorrect.\n\nlow-level:\n\n* added IIndexerSource interface: plugins will be able to implement this\n  interface to add tracks to the library that will be indexed and\n  maintained like all other tracks\n* added IIndexerWriter interface: IIndexerSource plugins will use this\n  interface to add/remove/update track info with the main app\n* added IIndexerNotifier: interface used to notify the app that it needs\n  to be re-indexed.\n* added \"source_id\" , \"external_id\", and \"visible\" column to the tracks\n  table, with appropriate indexes.\n* fixed a really old indexer bug where the reported number of file scanned\n  was not accurate. Strange this wasn't noticed before.\n* added \"SetIndexerNotifier\" injection method\n* fixed a bug in TrackMetadataQuery -- it was unnecessarily relying upon\n  the paths table, which was causing query errors when the table was\n  empty.\n* use a cache for local file paths instead of requiring an async round\n  trip when adding/removing\n* remove use of manual \"ANALYZE\", it was causing strange performance\n  degradation issues. Instead, move to a set of PRAGMAs that instructs\n  sqlite to run these optimizations when necessary.\n* updated ::GetInt32 and ::GetUint32 return types to be explicit as to play\n  more nicely with clang -- may as well, we're updating the SDK version\n  anyway.\n* added a simple capabilities model to the playback infrastructure. This\n  is used to detect whether or not streams can be prefetched. For example,\n  CDDA cannot because of seek times while playing tracks.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.10.2\n\n* fixed clang 7.3 compile error (macOS mavericks should work again)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.10.1\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* added the ability to select album name headers in track lists. doing so will\n  bring up a context menu with the ability to jump to the album or enqueue the\n  album's tracks for playback. this also had a nice side effect of making\n  scrolling more fluid!\n* added jumping to album/artist/genre to the selected track context menu\n* fixed a really old bug that could cause lists to automatically scroll to weird\n  places if the window or view is resized\n* directory browser now remembers which directories were previously selected,\n  making up navigation in the settings view smoother\n* added a \"list_header_highlighted_background\" and\n  \"list_header_highlighted_foreground\" color theme variables\n* tweaked the win32 icon so it looks a bit better on the taskbar\n\nlow-level:\n\n* added \"broadcast\" message support to IMessageQueue and implementers. allows\n  for pub/sub like functionality\n* added some new SDK interface methods to ITrack and IMetadataMap for retrieving\n  values other than strings (uint64, int64, uint32, int32, double)\n* added localization support for \"dimensions\". this allows for per-locale sizing\n  of ui components\n* fixed some old bugs in Window.cpp that could cause visibility changed\n  notifications to be raised unnecessarily\n* added a custom PDCurses/win32a patch to further reduce CPU load and context\n  switching while draining the message pump\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.10.0\n\n* added GeekShadow's fr_FR locale\n* fixed a bug in locale loading\n* fixed a bug in nomad decoder if file load fails\n* updated `Player` <-> `Stream` interaction so it's possible to interrupt long,\n  blocking reads (e.g. if an http stream loader existed)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.9.5\n\n* added localization support\n* added support for user-defined themes (solarized dark and light included as\n  examples)\n* patched PDCurses/win32a to support the standard *nix 256 color palette\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.9.4\n\n* added a \"syncing metadata\" banner that is displayed while the indexer is\n  scanning metadata\n* added a \"sync metadata on startup\" option to the settings view\n* moved the hotkey tester to its own dedicated dialog to free up some valuable\n  screen real estate in the settings view\n* fixed `PulseOut` plugin volume adjustment to work better across a wider\n  range of audio cards. this should also improve crossfade quality\n* fixed a very old bug that was sometimes causing delayed redraws or flickering\n  during layout in complex views\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.9.3\n\nwin32 only release:\n\n* updated `WASAPI` output plugin to disable endpoint routing by default. it\n  causes a crash in some rare cases that i don't seem to be able to work\n  around. i see similar crashes in firefox and some other apps that use this\n  feature.\n* updated `DirectSound` output volume adjustment to be as close to the `WASAPI`\n  `WaveOut` plugins as possible\n* changed compiler optimizations to favor fast code, instead of small code,\n  plus a few other small tweaks to (hopefully) improve performance.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.9.2\n\n* added an icon to the windows and android builds (not great, but better than\n  nothing!)\n* fixed a bug in the `nomad` (mp3) plugin where sample rate wasn't being\n  handled appropriately. songs were sometimes playing too fast or slow.\n* fixed a bug in the websockets plugin for certain metadata in locales that\n  use commas instead of periods for decimal points\n* added compression support to the `websocket_remote` plugin and the\n  `musikdroid` android app\n* fixed a crash when trying to manipulate an empty play queue in specific\n  contexts\n* fixed the win32 global volume up / volume down hotkeys to be consistent with\n  the main app and `websocket_remote` behavior.\n* changed data directory from \"~/.mC2\" to \"~/.musikcube\". the app will\n  automatically perform this rename on startup.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.9.1\n\n* added an app icon on win32 and android builds\n* added proper support for using and switching between different audio sample\n  formats. 24/192k works across all platforms now.\n* fixed `DirectSoundOut` pause to work properly again\n* added support for statically linking dependencies. for now we can supply\n  macOS binaries that don't require homebrew! let's try to keep it that way.\n* updated some defaults -- rescan metadata on startup by default, and restrict\n  to two processing threads.\n* fixed a crash when trying to change tracks in an empty playlist queue\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.9.0\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* added new `musikdroid` android remote control! super useful with a Raspberry\n  Pi. run musikbox in the background and control it from your phone.\n* added a new `websocket_remote` plugin that allows any client capable of\n  communciating with websockets the ability to control playback and query\n  metadata!\n* added settings UI for enabling/disabling plugins within the app!\n* added more granular volume control when adjusting below 10%\n* fixed a crash on shutdown while in track search view\n\nlow-level:\n\n* added new sdk interfaces:\n  - `ISimpleDataProvider`: can be used to query tracks, albums, artists, genres\n  - `IMetadataValue` and `IMetadataValueList`: lists of metadata values and ids\n  - `IMetadataMap` and `IMetadataMapList`: maps of values for resource ids\n  - `IPreferences` for reading and writing preferences\n* updated sdk interfaces:\n  - `ITrack`: added `getId()`\n  - `IPlaybackService`: the ability to modify or replace the play queue\n  - `ITrackList`: added const correctness\n  - renamed `IMetadataWriter` to `ITrackWriter`\n* added the ability for plugins to register to receive `IPreferences` and\n  `ISimpleDataProvider` interfaces via `SetPreferences()` and\n  `SetSimpleDataProvider`, respectively. see `websocket_remote` for an example\n* fixed up `PluginFactory` to store and provide more metadata about plugins\n  when querying them.\n* fixed a deadlock in `PlaybackService` when changing tracks from\n  `IPlaybackRemote` plugins.\n* fixed another WASAPI audio endpoint routing bug\n* fixed some win32 project settings to allow profile guided optimizations (was\n  broken for some plugins)\n* fixed 'deprecated' compiler warnings on macOS\n* seed the random number generator at startup\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.8.0\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* added support for Raspberry Pi running Raspbian!\n* added preliminary support for playlist editing. all editing is currently\n  in the play queue view.\n    - `ALT+s`: save the current play queue to a named playlist\n    - `ALT+l`: load a previously saved playlist\n    - `ALT+x`: delete a playlist\n    - `ALT+r`: rename a playlist\n* added the ability to delete (BACKSPACE on mac, DEL on win32/linux) and reorder\n  (ALT+UP/ALT+DOWN win32/mac, CTRL+UP/CTRL+DOWN linux ) selected items in the\n  play queue.\n* added better color fallback for non-mutable 256 termianl color palettes\n* added the ability to enqueue selected tracks, albums, artists, or other\n  resources to the play queue by pressing ALT+ENTER.\n* fixed a crash when trying to play a track that has been removed from the\n  database\n* fixed (maybe) an impossible-to-reproduce bug in PulseAudio where the output\n  volume was not getting properly initialized\n* removed \"esc focuses shortcut bar\" setting. no longer useful.\n\nlow-level:\n\n* fixed cursespp child view coordinates to be relative to their parents\n* cleaned up global focus model in cursespp\n* added IPlaybackService::GetPlayingTrack() to get an IRetainedTrack pointer\n  to the currently playing track; bumped SdkVersion to 2.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.7.3\n\nreduce CPU usage during playback in macOS CoreAudioOut\ninclude the null output plugin in macOS and Linux builds.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.7.2\n\nmostly performance and architecture changes:\n\n* created new 'src/glue' package that contains code that can be optionally\n  included and reused by other applications, but is too high-level for\n  src/core\n* cpu reduction and code simplification in 'Stream' and 'Player'\n* cpu reduction in 'MessageQueue'\n* reduced locking in 'Player' and 'MessageQueue'\n* tweaked music library interface to optionally deliver results to a specified\n  'IMessageQueue'\n* moved 'PlaybackService' and 'TrackList' into 'core'\n* optimized floating point sample scaling in the 'nomad' mp3 decoder\n* reduced cpu overhead when redrawing the transport view\n* added bare-bones, 'proof of concept' win32 application that includes 'core'\n  and 'glue' to present a very basic music player in just a few lines of code.\n* added a NullOut, an output plugin that doesn't write to the sound card. useful\n  for development and testing purposes.\n\nbug fixes:\n\n* fixed default output plugin selection logic\n* fixed a crash in WASAPI stream routing\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.7.1\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* fixed the flac decoder. oops.\n* changed focus behavior in search view -- pressing return in the edit field\n  will now focus the tracklist after starting playback\n* added sdk and plugin versioning. the plugin loader will only load plugins\n  with a supported version.\n\nlow-level\n\n* removed pre-buffering code from Player, let Stream worry about that\n* moved from boost to std for most threading (boost still used in the indexer)\n* removed some unused boost dependencies from CMakeLists.txt\n* various small optimizations to help reduce CPU overhead in MessageQueue and\n  Player.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.7.0\n\na big release with lots of changes to low-level machinery.\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* added a new \"crossfade\" playback mode that can be used instead of \"gapless\".\n  users can change this functionality in the settings view.\n* fixed audio artifacts in WasapiOut and DirectSoundOut when pausing and\n  resuming playback multiple times very quickly.\n* fixed a really bad bug where dialogs could not be easily dismissed in some\n  cases. this included the first-run dialog! yikes.\n\nlow-level:\n\n* added Latency() and Drain() methods to the IOutput interface\n* reduced CPU load in some output plugins by being less aggressive about keeping\n  the output buffers 100% full all the time. 75%+ fill rate should be\n  sufficient.\n* generalized MessageQueue and moved it out of app, and into core so it can be\n  reused for other functionality (e.g. crossfading)\n* added support for \"mix points\" in Player -- get a callback as soon as a\n  specific playback position is hit!\n* fixed DirectSoundOut to fall back to software mixing if hardware mixing is\n  unavailable\n* fixed DirectSoundOut to start playback immediately, instead of sometimes\n  requiring the buffer to be completely full\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.6.2\n\n* added a DirectSound output plugin for the win32 build.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.6.1\n\n* replaced mpg123 decoder with MAD. gapless playback for a much wider variety of\n  mp3s!\n* optimized indexing process by maintaining an in-memory database id cache. uses\n  a bit more memory (temporarily, during indexing) but improves indexing speed.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.6.0\n\n* added the ability to have multiple output plugins, and the ability switch\n  between them in settings\n* added a new default output plugin for win32 (WASAPI) and linux (PulseAudio)\n* changed a bunch of low-level ui code to substantially reduce layout passes and\n  redraws\n* made a few small changes to the main ui, including basic listview headers if\n  the window grows large enough\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.5.0\n\nuser-facing:\n\n* remember volume and repeat settings across app launches\n* improved visualizer quality\n* reduced download size by a couple megabytes\n\nlow-level:\n\n* optimized Stream and Player communication. more direct, less locking. no more\n  weird deferred cleanup\n* removed fftw3 dependency in favor of kiss_fft. much smaller download now\n* added a proper windowing algorithm to audio samples before they are handed to\n  the fft process\n* fixed audio de-interleaving issue which lead to funky fft results in some\n  cases\n* included a new spectrum visualizer sample called GdiVis (win32 only for now)\n* overhauled some parts of the audio engine to ensure buffer size is consistent\n  during playback. this makes visualization quality better, and should make it\n  easier to integrate with things like JACK and PulseAudio.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.4.1\n\n* fixed the transport readout to be more legible\n* fixed a crash in NowPlayingLayout when the window became too small\n* improved the IPlaybackService and IPlaybackRemote interfaces, and introduced a\n  new IRetainedTrack type.\n* upgraded build environment to visual studio 2017\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.4.0\n\n* updated transport focus behavior to be less confusing -- it was previously too\n  easy to accidentally focus the transport.\n* added mute functionality. focus the volume control and press enter or just\n  press m while browsing your library.\n* added new IPlaybackRemote and IPlaybackService sdk interfaces to support\n  writing plugins that can control playback and be notified of playback events.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.3.5\n\n* various small visualizer-related fixes.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.3.4\n\n* visualizer support! press v to show the picker! a couple samples (Milkdrop2\n  and projectM) are included below. unzip these to your musikbox\\plugins\n  directory.\n* fixed a nasty unicode conversion bug.\n* various other small fixes\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.2.2\n\n* small improvements to the transport view, including the display of the volume\n  percentage next to the volume slider.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n0.2.1\n\n* initial \"public\" release\n"

          "content": "# musikcube\n\na cross-platform, terminal-based audio engine, library, player and server written in c++.\n\nmusikcube compiles and runs easily on windows, macos and linux. it also runs well on a raspberry pi with raspbian, and can be setup as a streaming audio server.\n\ncheck out the [installation guide](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/installing) to get up and running.\n\nbe sure to also read through a [the user guide](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/user-guide), which describes app's navigation paradigm and lists all the default keyboard shortcuts.\n\nif you want to build it from source, [the instructions are here](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/building).\n\n# screenshots\n\nit looks something like this on windows:\n\n![windows screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clangen/clangen-projects-static/master/musikcube/screenshots/windows.png)\n\nand this on macos:\n\n![osx screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clangen/clangen-projects-static/master/musikcube/screenshots/osx.png)\n\nand on linux:\n\n![linux screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clangen/clangen-projects-static/master/musikcube/screenshots/linux.png)\n\nhere's a demo (made with asciinema):\n\n[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/129748.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/129748)\n\nwhile the main musikcube app runs in the console, you can also stream audio from (and even remote control) musikcube using the `musikdroid` android app, which can be downloaded in the `releases` section above. it looks like this:\n\n![android screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clangen/clangen-projects-static/master/musikcube/screenshots/android.png)\n\n# installation\n\nbinaries are available in the [releases](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/releases) page.\n\nwhile macos binaries are provided, you can also install via homebrew as follows:\n\n- `brew install musikcube`\n\non freebsd musikcube can be installed as follows:\n\n- `pkg install musikcube`\n\non openbsd musikcube can be installed as follows:\n\n- `pkg_add install musikcube`\n\non windows, you can install via chocolatey:\n\n- `choco install musikcube`\n\nthen run using shell, Win+R dialog or by typing in Start Menu `musikcube` or `mcube`.\n\n# raspberry pi\n\nmusikcube runs well on a raspberry pi, connected to your home stereo. [see here for detailed setup instructions](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/raspberry-pi).\n\n# compiling\n\nif you'd like to compile the project yourself, you can check out the [build instructions](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/building).\n\n# keyboard shortcuts\n\na list of all keyboard shortcuts can be found in the [user guide](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/user-guide)\n\n# streaming server\n\nmusikcube ships with a streaming audio server enabled by default. it runs a websocket server on port 7905, used for metadata retrieval. an http server runs on port 7906, and is used to serve (optionally transcoded) audio data to clients.\n\n**it's important to understand that, out of the box, the server (and remote api) should NOT be considered safe for use outside of a local network**. the websockets service only supports a simple password challenge, and the audio http server just handles Basic authorization. it does not provide ssl or tls. the server also stores the password in plain text in a settings file on the local machine.\n\nyou can fix some of this using a reverse proxy to provide ssl termination. details in the [ssl-server-setup section](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/ssl-server-setup). while this improves things, you should exercise caution exposing these services over the internet.\n\nif you're interested in writing your own frontend, [api documentation is available here](https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/wiki/remote-api-documentation).\n\n# sdk\n\nthe musikcube sdk is a set of small, pure-virtual c++ classes and a handful of enums and constants. they're still in the process of being slimmed down. you can see what they currently look like here: https://github.com/clangen/musikcube/tree/master/src/musikcore/sdk\n\n# dependencies\n\nmusikcube would not be possible without the following excellent free, open source, and (in the case of some macos and win32 APIs) non-free projects and libraries:\n\n| core                                                      | decoders                                                        | outputs
