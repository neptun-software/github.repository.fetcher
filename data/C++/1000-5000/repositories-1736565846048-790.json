The plan is to expand Walnut to include common utilities to make immediate-mode desktop apps and simple Vulkan applications.\n\nCurrently supports Windows - with macOS and Linux support planned. Setup scripts support Visual Studio 2022 by default.\n\n![WalnutExample](https://hazelengine.com/images/ForestLauncherScreenshot.jpg)\n_<center>Forest Launcher - an application made with Walnut</center>_\n\n## Requirements\n- [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) (not strictly required, however included setup scripts only support this)\n- [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) (preferably a recent version)\n\n## Getting Started\nOnce you've cloned, run `scripts/Setup.bat` to generate Visual Studio 2022 solution/project files. Once you've opened the solution, you can run the WalnutApp project to see a basic example (code in `WalnutApp.cpp`). I recommend modifying that WalnutApp project to create your own application, as everything should be setup and ready to go.\n\n### 3rd party libaries\n- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)\n- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)\n- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb)\n- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) (included for convenience)\n\n### Additional\n- Walnut uses the [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) font ([Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0))"
