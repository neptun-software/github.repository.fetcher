          "content": "## Building YTsaurus from sources\n\n#### Build Requirements\n We have tested YTsaurus builds using Ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04. Other Linux distributions are likely to work, but additional effort may be needed. Only x86_64 Linux is currently supported.\n\n Below is a list of packages that need to be installed before building YTsaurus. 'How to Build' section contains step by step instructions to obtain these packages.\n\n - cmake 3.22+\n - clang-16\n - lld-16\n - lldb-16\n - conan 2.4.1\n - git 2.20+\n - python 3.8+\n - pip3\n - ninja 1.10+\n - m4\n - libidn11-dev\n - protoc\n - unzip\n\n#### How to Build\n\n 1. Add repositories for dependencies.\n\n    Note: the following repositories are required for the most of Linux distributions. You may skip this step if your GNU/Linux distribution has all required packages in their default repository.\n    For more information please read your distribution documentation and https://apt.llvm.org as well as https://apt.kitware.com/\n    ```\n    curl -s https://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key | sudo apt-key add\n    curl -s https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc | gpg --dearmor - | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg >/dev/null\n    echo \"deb http://apt.llvm.org/$(lsb_release -cs)/ llvm-toolchain-$(lsb_release -cs)-16 main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/llvm.list >/dev/null\n    echo \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/kitware-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ $(lsb_release -cs) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kitware.list >/dev/null\n    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test\n\n    sudo apt-get update\n    ```\n\n 1. Install python of version >= 3.8 \n\n    Note: this example is taken from https://www.build-python-from-source.com/ and checked on Ubuntu 18.04\n\n    ```\n    cd /tmp/\n    wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.4/Python-3.11.4.tgz\n    tar xzf Python-3.11.4.tgz\n    cd Python-3.11.4\n    \n    sudo ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-optimizations --with-lto --with-computed-gotos --with-system-ffi\n    sudo make -j \"$(nproc)\"\n    sudo make altinstall\n    sudo rm /tmp/Python-3.11.4.tgz\n    ```\n\n 1. Install dependencies.\n\n    ```\n    sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip ninja-build libidn11-dev m4 clang-16 lld-16 cmake unzip\n    sudo python3 -m pip install PyYAML==6.0.1 conan==2.4.1 dacite\n    ```\n 1. Install protoc.\n\n    ```\n    curl -sL -o protoc.zip https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/download/v3.20.1/protoc-3.20.1-linux-x86_64.zip\n    sudo unzip protoc.zip -d /usr/local\n    rm protoc.zip\n    ```\n\n 1. Create the work directory. Please make sure you have at least 80Gb of free space. We also recommend placing this directory on SSD to reduce build times.\n    ```\n    mkdir ~/ytsaurus && cd ~/ytsaurus\n    mkdir build\n    ```\n\n 1. Clone the YTsaurus repository.\n    ```\n    git clone https://github.com/ytsaurus/ytsaurus.git\n    ```\n\n 1. Build YTsaurus.\n\n    Run cmake to generate build configuration:\n\n    ```\n    cd build\n    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../ytsaurus/clang.toolchain -DCMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES=../ytsaurus/cmake/conan_provider.cmake ../ytsaurus\n    ```\n\n    To build just run:\n    ```\n    ninja\n    ```\n\n    If you need to build concrete target you can run:\n    ```\n    ninja <target>\n    ```\n\n    A YTsaurus server binary can be found at:\n    ```\n    yt/yt/server/all/ytserver-all\n    ```\n"

It may be that somebody is already working on it,\nor that there are some complex obstacles that you should know about before starting the implementation.\nUsually there are several ways to fix a problem and it is important to find the right approach before spending time on a PR\nthat cannot be merged.  We add the `help wanted` label to existing GitHub issues for which community\ncontributions are particularly welcome, and we use the `good first issue` label to mark issues that we think will be suitable for new contributors.\n\n## Provide a contribution\n\nTo make a contribution you should submit a pull request. There will probably be discussion about the pull request and,\nif any changes are needed, we would love to work with you to get your pull request merged.\n\n## Other questions\n\nIf you have any questions, please mail us at info@ytsaurus.tech.\n"

We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a mitigation is available for YTsaurus users. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it's already publicly known) to 90 days. For a vulnerability with a straightforward mitigation, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days.\n"

If your /bin/sh is\n#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or\n#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole\n#       command line, like:\n#\n#           ksh Gradle\n#\n#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script\n#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:\n#         * functions;\n#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,\n#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;\n#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;\n#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».\n#\n#   Important for patching:\n#\n#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided\n#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.\n#\n#       The \"traditional\" practice of packing multiple parameters into a\n#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security\n#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating\n#       options in \"$@\", and eventually passing that to Java.\n#\n#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,\n#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;\n#       see the in-line comments for details.\n#\n#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,\n#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.\n#\n#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template\n#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt\n#       within the Gradle project.\n#\n#       You can find Gradle at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/.\n#\n##############################################################################\n\n# Attempt to set APP_HOME\n\n# Resolve links: $0 may be a link\napp_path=$0\n\n# Need this for daisy-chained symlinks.\nwhile\n    APP_HOME=${app_path%\"${app_path##*/}\"}  # leaves a trailing /; empty if no leading path\n    [ -h \"$app_path\" ]\ndo\n    ls=$( ls -ld \"$app_path\" )\n    link=${ls#*' -> '}\n    case $link in             #(\n      /*)   app_path=$link ;; #(\n      *)    app_path=$APP_HOME$link ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n# This is normally unused\n# shellcheck disable=SC2034\nAPP_BASE_NAME=${0##*/}\nAPP_HOME=$( cd \"${APP_HOME:-./}\" && pwd -P ) || exit\n\n# Add default JVM options here.
