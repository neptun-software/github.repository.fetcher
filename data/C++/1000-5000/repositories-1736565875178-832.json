This is a finger tracking glove that allows you to use your hands in VR. Follow along with Lucas_VRTech's developments on his Tiktok page:\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@lucas_vrtech\n\n# Building your own gloves\n**Start here at the wiki! https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki**\n\n# Support\nJoin the LucidVR discord server for assistance:\nhttps://discord.gg/lucidvr\n\n\n# Firmware\nOpen the firmware files located in the firmware/lucidgloves-firmware folder.\nBy default the firmware is configured for an arduino nano using serial.\nTo configure the firmware, change the defines in the lucidgloves-firmware.ino file.\n\n**Configuration instructions are here: [Configuration Instructions](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Firmware-Setup-and-Customization-Tutorial).**\\\n**Firmware Troubleshooting Guide is here: [Firmware Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Firmware-Troubleshooting-Guide).** \n\n## Tested boards:\n* Arduino Nano\n* ESP-WROOM-32\n\n## Supported Communication Methods:\n* USB Serial\n* Bluetooth Serial (On ESP32 boards)\n* BLE (Soon, not up yet)\n\n# Hardware\nSTL files for 3D printing are located in the hardware folder. \n*Prototype 4 models are currently experimental.*\n\nThe assembly **for each hand** is as follows:\n\nFor Prototypes 3 and 3.1 - \n* Spool (5x)\n* Tensioner (5x)\n* Cover (5x)\n* Holder (5x)\n* GuideRing(Will need to be resized) OR GuideNode(3.1) (2+ per finger, 1+ for thumb)\n* EndCap (1x per finger, will need to be resized to fit) \n\nFor Prototypes 4 and 4.1 - \n* HapticSpool (5x)\n* Tensioner_GreenPot (5x) OR Tensioner_WLPot (5x)\n* SpoolCover (5x)\n* RigidMount (1x) (Left or right hand)\n* WLPotSlideHolder OR WLPotElasticHolder OR GreenPotSlideHolder (5x)\n* Quest2_MountSlider OR Vive3.0_MountSlider (1x)\n* GuideRing (Proto 3) (Will need to be resized) OR GuideNode (Proto 3.1) (2+ per finger, 1+ for thumb)\n* EndCap (Proto 3) (1x per finger, will need to be resized to fit)\n\n\n\nGuide for printing parts: [Printing guide](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Parts-Printing-Guides)\n\n\n**Required parts for each hand: [Parts Lists](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/wiki/Parts-Lists)**  \nOptional:  \n* Joysticks for locomotion \n  - Will be making a DIY treadmill eventually as well for those who would prefer that  \n* Buttons (Most can be replaced with gestures) (One is required for autocalibration)\n\nMore information will be available on the [LucidVR site](http://lucidvrtech.com/) very soon.  \n*  [Prototype 3/3.1 Building Tutorial](https://youtu.be/Qj4hqRKiy8g)\n*  [Prototype 4/4.1 Building Tutorial](https://youtu.be/2yF-SJcg3zQ)\n\n# SteamVR Compatibility (OpenGloves)\nThis project uses the OpenGloves OpenVR driver for compatibility with SteamVR, which is downloadable on Steam:  \nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/1574050/OpenGloves/\n\nSource code available on GitHub:  \nhttps://github.com/LucidVR/opengloves-driver\n\n# Other Languages\n**[English](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/blob/main/README.md) | [简体中文](https://github.com/LucidVR/lucidgloves/blob/main/Readme_Languages/README_CN.md)**\n"
