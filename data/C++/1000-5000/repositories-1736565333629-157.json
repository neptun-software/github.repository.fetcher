Useful information\n\tcan also be found in the JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article.  See\n\tARCHIVE LOCATIONS below to find out where to obtain the FAQ article.\n\n\tIf you want to understand how the JPEG code works, we suggest reading one or\n\tmore of the REFERENCES, then looking at the documentation files (in roughly\n\tthe order listed) before diving into the code.\n\n\n\tOVERVIEW\n\t========\n\n\tThis package contains C software to implement JPEG image compression and\n\tdecompression.  JPEG (pronounced \"jay-peg\") is a standardized compression\n\tmethod for full-color and gray-scale images.  JPEG is intended for compressing\n\t\"real-world\" scenes; line drawings, cartoons and other non-realistic images\n\tare not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not\n\texactly identical to the input image.  Hence you must not use JPEG if you\n\thave to have identical output bits.  However, on typical photographic images,\n\tvery good compression levels can be obtained with no visible change, and\n\tremarkably high compression levels are possible if you can tolerate a\n\tlow-quality image.  For more details, see the references, or just experiment\n\twith various compression settings.\n\n\tThis software implements JPEG baseline, extended-sequential, and progressive\n\tcompression processes.  Provision is made for supporting all variants of these\n\tprocesses, although some uncommon parameter settings aren't implemented yet.\n\tFor legal reasons, we are not distributing code for the arithmetic-coding\n\tvariants of JPEG; see LEGAL ISSUES.  We have made no provision for supporting\n\tthe hierarchical or lossless processes defined in the standard.\n\n\tWe provide a set of library routines for reading and writing JPEG image files,\n\tplus two sample applications \"cjpeg\" and \"djpeg\", which use the library to\n\tperform conversion between JPEG and some other popular image file formats.\n\tThe library is intended to be reused in other applications.\n\n\tIn order to support file conversion and viewing software, we have included\n\tconsiderable functionality beyond the bare JPEG coding/decoding capability;\n\tfor example, the color quantization modules are not strictly part of JPEG\n\tdecoding, but they are essential for output to colormapped file formats or\n\tcolormapped displays.  These extra functions can be compiled out of the\n\tlibrary if not required for a particular application.  We have also included\n\t\"jpegtran\", a utility for lossless transcoding between different JPEG\n\tprocesses, and \"rdjpgcom\" and \"wrjpgcom\", two simple applications for\n\tinserting and extracting textual comments in JFIF files.\n\n\tThe emphasis in designing this software has been on achieving portability and\n\tflexibility, while also making it fast enough to be useful.  In particular,\n\tthe software is not intended to be read as a tutorial on JPEG.  (See the\n\tREFERENCES section for introductory material.)  Rather, it is intended to\n\tbe reliable, portable, industrial-strength code.  We do not claim to have\n\tachieved that goal in every aspect of the software, but we strive for it.\n\n\tWe welcome the use of this software as a component of commercial products.\n\tNo royalty is required, but we do ask for an acknowledgement in product\n\tdocumentation, as described under LEGAL ISSUES.\n\n\n\tLEGAL ISSUES\n\t============\n\n\tIn plain English:\n\n\t1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,\n\t   please let us know!)\n\t2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.\n\t3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a\n\t   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that\n\t   you've used the IJG code.\n\n\tIn legalese:\n\n\tThe authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,\n\twith respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or\n\tfitness for a particular purpose.

Lane.\n\tAll Rights Reserved except as specified below.\n\n\tPermission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this\n\tsoftware (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these\n\tconditions:\n\t(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this\n\tREADME file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice\n\tunaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files\n\tmust be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.\n\t(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying\n\tdocumentation must state that \"this software is based in part on the work of\n\tthe Independent JPEG Group\".\n\t(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts\n\tfull responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept\n\tNO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.\n\n\tThese conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,\n\tnot just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to\n\tacknowledge us.\n\n\tPermission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name\n\tin advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from\n\tit.  This software may be referred to only as \"the Independent JPEG Group's\n\tsoftware\".\n\n\tWe specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of\n\tcommercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are\n\tassumed by the product vendor.\n\n\n\tansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,\n\tsole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.\n\tansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead\n\tby the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,\n\tthat you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file\n\tansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part\n\tof any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than\n\tthe foregoing paragraphs do.\n\n\tThe Unix configuration script \"configure\" was produced with GNU Autoconf.\n\tIt is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.\n\tThe same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,\n\tltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright\n\tby M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.\n\n\tIt appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by\n\tpatents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot\n\tlegally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,\n\tsupport for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.\n\t(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented\n\tHuffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)\n\tSo far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining\n\tcode.\n\n\tThe IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.\n\tTo avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has\n\tbeen removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce\n\t\"uncompressed GIFs\".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the\n\tresulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard\n\tGIF decoders.\n\n\tWe are required to state that\n\t\t\"The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of\n\t\tCompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of\n\t\tCompuServe Incorporated.\"\n\n\n\tREFERENCES\n\t==========\n\n\tWe highly recommend reading one or more of these references before trying to\n\tunderstand the innards of the JPEG software.\n\n\tThe best short technical introduction to the JPEG compression algorithm is\n\t\tWallace, Gregory K.  \"The JPEG Still Picture Compression Standard\",\n\t\tCommunications of the ACM, April 1991 (vol. 34 no. 4), pp. 30-44.\n\t(Adjacent articles in that issue discuss MPEG motion picture compression,\n\tapplications of JPEG, and related topics.)  If you don't have the CACM issue\n\thandy, a PostScript file containing a revised version of Wallace's article is\n\tavailable at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/wallace.ps.gz.  The file (actually\n\ta preprint for an article that appeared in IEEE Trans. Consumer Electronics)\n\tomits the sample images that appeared in CACM, but it includes corrections\n\tand some added material.  Note: the Wallace article is copyright ACM and IEEE,\n\tand it may not be used for commercial purposes.\n\n\tA somewhat less technical, more leisurely introduction to JPEG can be found in\n\t\"The Data Compression Book\" by Mark Nelson and Jean-loup Gailly, published by\n\tM&T Books (New York), 2nd ed. 1996, ISBN 1-55851-434-1.  This book provides\n\tgood explanations and example C code for a multitude of compression methods\n\tincluding JPEG.  It is an excellent source if you are comfortable reading C\n\tcode but don't know much about data compression in general.  The book's JPEG\n\tsample code is far from industrial-strength, but when you are ready to look\n\tat a full implementation, you've got one here...\n\n\tThe best full description of JPEG is the textbook \"JPEG Still Image Data\n\tCompression Standard\" by William B. Pennebaker and Joan L. Mitchell, published\n\tby Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993, ISBN 0-442-01272-1.  Price US$59.95, 638 pp.\n\tThe book includes the complete text of the ISO JPEG standards (DIS 10918-1\n\tand draft DIS 10918-2).  This is by far the most complete exposition of JPEG\n\tin existence, and we highly recommend it.\n\n\tThe JPEG standard itself is not available electronically; you must order a\n\tpaper copy through ISO or ITU.  (Unless you feel a need to own a certified\n\tofficial copy, we recommend buying the Pennebaker and Mitchell book instead;\n\tit's much cheaper and includes a great deal of useful explanatory material.)\n\tIn the USA, copies of the standard may be ordered from ANSI Sales at (212)\n\t642-4900, or from Global Engineering Documents at (800) 854-7179.  (ANSI\n\tdoesn't take credit card orders, but Global does.)  It's not cheap: as of\n\t1992, ANSI was charging $95 for Part 1 and $47 for Part 2, plus 7%\n\tshipping/handling.  The standard is divided into two parts, Part 1 being the\n\tactual specification, while Part 2 covers compliance testing methods.  Part 1\n\tis titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of Continuous-tone Still Images,\n\tPart 1: Requirements and guidelines\" and has document numbers ISO/IEC IS\n\t10918-1, ITU-T T.81.  Part 2 is titled \"Digital Compression and Coding of\n\tContinuous-tone Still Images, Part 2: Compliance testing\" and has document\n\tnumbers ISO/IEC IS 10918-2, ITU-T T.83.\n\n\tSome extensions to the original JPEG standard are defined in JPEG Part 3,\n\ta newer ISO standard numbered ISO/IEC IS 10918-3 and ITU-T T.84.  IJG\n\tcurrently does not support any Part 3 extensions.\n\n\tThe JPEG standard does not specify all details of an interchangeable file\n\tformat.  For the omitted details we follow the \"JFIF\" conventions, revision\n\t1.02.  A copy of the JFIF spec is available from:\n\t\tLiterature Department\n\t\tC-Cube Microsystems, Inc.\n\t\t1778 McCarthy Blvd.\n\t\tMilpitas, CA 95035\n\t\tphone (408) 944-6300,  fax (408) 944-6314\n\tA PostScript version of this document is available by FTP at\n\tftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.ps.gz.  There is also a plain text\n\tversion at ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jfif.txt.gz, but it is missing\n\tthe figures.\n\n\tThe TIFF 6.0 file format specification can be obtained by FTP from\n\tftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/TIFF6.ps.gz.  The JPEG incorporation scheme\n\tfound in the TIFF 6.0 spec of 3-June-92 has a number of serious problems.\n\tIJG does not recommend use of the TIFF 6.0 design (TIFF Compression tag 6).\n\tInstead, we recommend the JPEG design proposed by TIFF Technical Note #2\n\t(Compression tag 7).  Copies of this Note can be obtained from ftp.sgi.com or\n\tfrom ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/.  It is expected that the next revision\n\tof the TIFF spec will replace the 6.0 JPEG design with the Note's design.\n\tAlthough IJG's own code does not support TIFF/JPEG, the free libtiff library\n\tuses our library to implement TIFF/JPEG per the Note.  libtiff is available\n\tfrom ftp://ftp.sgi.com/graphics/tiff/.\n\n\n\tARCHIVE LOCATIONS\n\t=================\n\n\tThe \"official\" archive site for this software is ftp.uu.net (Internet\n\taddress 192.48.96.9).  The most recent released version can always be found\n\tthere in directory graphics/jpeg.  This particular version will be archived\n\tas ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz.  If you don't have\n\tdirect Internet access, UUNET's archives are also available via UUCP; contact\n\thelp@uunet.uu.net for information on retrieving files that way.\n\n\tNumerous Internet sites maintain copies of the UUNET files.  However, only\n\tftp.uu.net is guaranteed to have the latest official version.\n\n\tYou can also obtain this software in DOS-compatible \"zip\" archive format from\n\tthe SimTel archives (ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/graphics/), or\n\ton CompuServe in the Graphics Support forum (GO CIS:GRAPHSUP), library 12\n\t\"JPEG Tools\".  Again, these versions may sometimes lag behind the ftp.uu.net\n\trelease.\n\n\tThe JPEG FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) article is a useful source of\n\tgeneral information about JPEG.  It is updated constantly and therefore is\n\tnot included in this distribution.  The FAQ is posted every two weeks to\n\tUsenet newsgroups comp.graphics.misc, news.answers, and other groups.\n\tIt is available on the World Wide Web at http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/\n\tand other news.answers archive sites, including the official news.answers\n\tarchive at rtfm.mit.edu: ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/.\n\tIf you don't have Web or FTP access, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu\n\twith body\n\t\tsend usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part1\n\t\tsend usenet/news.answers/jpeg-faq/part2\n\n\n\tRELATED SOFTWARE\n\t================\n\n\tNumerous viewing and image manipulation programs now support JPEG.  (Quite a\n\tfew of them use this library to do so.)  The JPEG FAQ described above lists\n\tsome of the more popular free and shareware viewers, and tells where to\n\tobtain them on Internet.\n\n\tIf you are on a Unix machine, we highly recommend Jef Poskanzer's free\n\tPBMPLUS software, which provides many useful operations on PPM-format image\n\tfiles.  In particular, it can convert PPM images to and from a wide range of\n\tother formats, thus making cjpeg/djpeg considerably more useful.  The latest\n\tversion is distributed by the NetPBM group, and is available from numerous\n\tsites, notably ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/graphics/graphics/packages/NetPBM/.\n\tUnfortunately PBMPLUS/NETPBM is not nearly as portable as the IJG software is;\n\tyou are likely to have difficulty making it work on any non-Unix machine.\n\n\tA different free JPEG implementation, written by the PVRG group at Stanford,\n\tis available from ftp://havefun.stanford.edu/pub/jpeg/.  This program\n\tis designed for research and experimentation rather than production use;\n\tit is slower, harder to use, and less portable than the IJG code, but it\n\tis easier to read and modify.  Also, the PVRG code supports lossless JPEG,\n\twhich we do not.  (On the other hand, it doesn't do progressive JPEG.)\n\n\n\tFILE FORMAT WARS\n\t================\n\n\tSome JPEG programs produce files that are not compatible with our library.\n\tThe root of the problem is that the ISO JPEG committee failed to specify a\n\tconcrete file format.  Some vendors \"filled in the blanks\" on their own,\n\tcreating proprietary formats that no one else could read.  (For example, none\n\tof the early commercial JPEG implementations for the Macintosh were able to\n\texchange compressed files.)\n\n\tThe file format we have adopted is called JFIF (see REFERENCES).  This format\n\thas been agreed to by a number of major commercial JPEG vendors, and it has\n\tbecome the de facto standard.  JFIF is a minimal or \"low end\" representation.\n\tWe recommend the use of TIFF/JPEG (TIFF revision 6.0 as modified by TIFF\n\tTechnical Note #2) for \"high end\" applications that need to record a lot of\n\tadditional data about an image.  TIFF/JPEG is fairly new and not yet widely\n\tsupported, unfortunately.\n\n\tThe upcoming JPEG Part 3 standard defines a file format called SPIFF.\n\tSPIFF is interoperable with JFIF, in the sense that most JFIF decoders should\n\tbe able to read the most common variant of SPIFF.  SPIFF has some technical\n\tadvantages over JFIF, but its major claim to fame is simply that it is an\n\tofficial standard rather than an informal one.  At this point it is unclear\n\twhether SPIFF will supersede JFIF or whether JFIF will remain the de-facto\n\tstandard.  IJG intends to support SPIFF once the standard is frozen, but we\n\thave not decided whether it should become our default output format or not.\n\t(In any case, our decoder will remain capable of reading JFIF indefinitely.)\n\n\tVarious proprietary file formats incorporating JPEG compression also exist.\n\tWe have little or no sympathy for the existence of these formats.  Indeed,\n\tone of the original reasons for developing this free software was to help\n\tforce convergence on common, open format standards for JPEG files.  Don't\n\tuse a proprietary file format!\n\n\n\tTO DO\n\t=====\n\n\tThe major thrust for v7 will probably be improvement of visual quality.\n\tThe current method for scaling the quantization tables is known not to be\n\tvery good at low Q values.  We also intend to investigate block boundary\n\tsmoothing, \"poor man's variable quantization\", and other means of improving\n\tquality-vs-file-size performance without sacrificing compatibility.\n\n\tIn future versions, we are considering supporting some of the upcoming JPEG\n\tPart 3 extensions --- principally, variable quantization and the SPIFF file\n\tformat.\n\n\tAs always, speeding things up is of great interest.\n\n\tPlease send bug reports, offers of help, etc. to jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\n\n************************************************************************************\nCelt Codec:\n************************************************************************************\n\n\tCopyright 2001-2009 Jean-Marc Valin, Timothy B.
