To that aim, the Kurento Testing Framework (KTF) has been created. KTF is a part of the Kurento project aimed to carry out end-to-end (E2E) tests for Kurento. KTF has been implemented on the top of two well-known open-source testing frameworks: JUnit and Selenium.\n\nIf you want to know more about the Kurento Testing Framework and how to run all the available tests for Kurento you will find more information in [Kurento developers documentation > Testing]\n\n[Kurento developers documentation > Testing]: https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/testing.html\n\n\n\nLicensing and distribution\n--------------------------\n\nCopyright 2019 Kurento\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n"

There should be no assumption\nof a commitment to deliver these features on specific dates or in the order\ngiven. The development team will be doing their best to follow the proposed\ndates and priorities, but please bear in mind that plans to work on a given\nfeature or task may be revised. All information is provided as a general\nguidelines only, and this section may be revised to provide newer information at\nany time.\n\n## Short term\n\nThe following list of features are planned to be addressed in the short term,\nand incorporated in the next release of the product planned for TBD:\n\n-   Review the documentation. Unify and merge all bits of information that have been\nscattered over time.\n\n- Review and clean up open issues in the bug tracker.\n\n- QA / tests review, rework.\n\n## Medium term\n\nThe following list of features are planned to be addressed in the medium term,\ntypically within the subsequent release(s) generated in the next **9 months**\nafter next planned release:\n\n- Update to OpenCV3.\n\n- Update GStreamer. \n\n- Unified plan support\n\n- Support Microsoft Edge browser.\n\n\n## Long term\n\nThe following list of features are proposals regarding the longer-term evolution\nof the product even though development of these features has not yet been\nscheduled for a release in the near future. Please feel free to contact us if\nyou wish to get involved in the implementation or influence the roadmap\n\n\n- Stability and Performance improvements.\n"
