Navigate to the repository using a command prompt.\n2. Check out the correct branch/tag if you're not working against master\n3. Run `git submodule update --init` to pull in vendored dependencies\n4. Run `xmake -y` (add `-v` for verbose output)\n\n\n### Visual Studio\n\nIf you want visual studio projects execute `xmake project -k vsxmake` and you will find the sln in the newly created `vsxmake` folder.\n\n\n### Additional configuration / troubleshooting\n\n- You can specify the VS version with `xmake f --vs=2019|2022` in case it's not detected right\n- Use Visual Studio Installer to install any missing components in the toolset if needed\n\n### Install\n\n1. Configure the install path, run: `xmake f --installpath=<cyberpunk install path>\\bin\\x64\\plugins` (not the base dir!)\n2. `xmake install` (or `xmake i` for short.)\n\n\n#### ASI Loader\n\n1. Download  Ultimate-ASI-Loader_x64.zip from [ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/latest)\n2. Put the dinput8.dll in `<cyberpunk install path>\\bin\\x64\\`\n3. Rename `dinput8.dll` as `version.dll`, you should have `<cyberpunk install path>\\bin\\x64\\version.dll`\n4. Create a `global.ini` file in `<cyberpunk install path>\\bin\\x64\\`\n5. Paste the following lines in `global.ini`, save and you are all set!\n\n```\n[GlobalSets]\nLoadPlugins=1\nLoadFromScriptsOnly=1\nDontLoadFromDllMain=0\nFindModule=0\nUseD3D8to9=0\nDisableCrashDumps=0\nDirect3D8DisableMaximizedWindowedModeShim=0\n```\n\n"
