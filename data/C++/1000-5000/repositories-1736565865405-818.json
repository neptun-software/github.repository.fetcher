By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"

Such files are now skipped.\n\nSat Aug 20 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* add support for static build\n\t  In static builds, the linker skips objects from the libencfs library\n\t  which are never directly referenced.  This breaks all encoding and\n\t  encryption modules, because they are dynamically registered.  The\n\t  workaround is to explicitly add references in the library in the\n\t  static build case.\n\nWed Aug 17 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* bump version to 1.2.4\n\t* refactor small amount of error code\n\t* add environment override for config file location\n\t  If the environment variable 'ENCFS5_CONFIG' is set, then it will be\n\t  used as the location for the encfs configuration file.  Otherwise,\n\t  the normal search will be done, by searching the specified root\n\t  directory for an appropriate config file.\n\nFri Aug 5 2005 jjhellst@gmail.com\n\t* Remove duplicate initFS and checkDir calls\n\t  Remove duplicated calls to initFS by refactoring call to initFS into\n\t  initRootInfo function that calls checkDir and initFS.  This removes\n\t  some of the redundancy in cmd_* handlers.\n\t  The creation of destDir in cmd_export is also moved to a later stage,\n\t  so that if encfs volume couldn't be initialized, the destination\n\t  directory is not created.\n\nFri Jul 29 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* replace reconfig.sh commands with simpler set\n\t* try and simplify devel code build\n\nWed Jul 27 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* fix up export patch and refactor output code\n\nSun Jul 24 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* encfsctl export command patch from Janne Hellsten\n\t  This command will export the entire filesystem.\n\n\t* move userAllowCreate to userAllowMkdir and make public\n\t* cleanup configure to get rid of warnings\n\nWed Jul 13 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* add recent changelog entries\n\t* bump shared object version to 1:2:0\n\t  forgot to do this for the v1.2.3 release\n\nMon Jul 11 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\ttagged v1.2.3\n\t* bump version to 1.2.3\n\t* remove lock removal comment\n\t* add debugging output\n\nThu Jul 7 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* add way to get filename in FileIO\n\twanted to know filename for displaying error message, but there was no\n\tway to get it.\n\t* minor cleanup with locking of DirNode & FileNode\n\tdoesn't change lock regions or behavior, but cleans it up a bit.\n\tLocks added in constructors even though they aren't necessary in order\n\tto try and get valgrind's helgrind to not report a race there.. but\n\tdidn't work\n\t* always warn of MAC comparison failure\n\tif warnonly mode is not turned enabled, then an error will also be\n\tthrown\n\nMon Jul 4 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* register nullname io\n\tOnce had a request for unencrypted filenames (only data encrypted).\n\tEasy enough by having NullNameIO registered as an option.\n\t* synchronize read path\n\tAfter fixing the paranoia mode problem in the earlier patch, that seems\n\tto introduce (or exacerbate?) a race condition in the read path.  Until\n\tI have time to track it down, the safest action seems to be to\n\tsynchronize reads..\n\t* add 'cat' command to encfsctl\n\tAllows printing out the contents of a file without having to mount the\n\tfilesystem.\n\nSun Jul 3 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* another fix to allow symbolic links to /\n\tBug report by neuron.\n\t* allow symbolic link to root directory\n\nSat Jul 2 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* don't call setIV on symbolic links\n\tOnly call setIV for regular file types and non-existant files.\n\tThis is a fix for a problem with symbolic links which was reported to\n\tdebian bug tracking system: bug #315624 Affects paranoia mode (IV\n\tchaining + file headers + external IV chaining)\n\nMon Jun 20 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* update libtool\n\nThu Jun 16 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* initialize OpenSSL hardware engine support\n\tFound out about these calls from LinuxJournal, May 2005 issue\n\nSat May 21 2005 Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* disable idle monitoring option with fuse 2.2\n\t* fix build error on rh7.3\n\t* bump version to 1.2.2\n\t* tagged v1.2.2\n\nTue May 17 2005  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* fix idle monitor thread\n\t  Idle monitor wasn't working in encfs 1.2.x - reported by Patrick\n\t  Skerrett on encfs-users mailing list.

FUSE passes the plaintext names to EncFS for\n\t  processing, so rather then having to encrypt them each time, use the\n\t  plaintext name for lookup in the cache.

Found an easy way to add per-file\n\t  initialization vectors.  I thought I was going to have to store\n\t  per-directory IV data somewhere (or like CVS, store IV data in\n\t  strange parts of file headers), but I found I could do much better\n\t  more simply by chaining the initialization vectors during a path\n\t  encode/decode since EncFS always knows the full path of the file\n\t  being accessed.  This adds 64 bits of path-dependent initialization\n\t  vector data without any storage overhead.\n\n2004-04-28  Valient Gough <vgough@pobox.com>\n\t* Thanks to Anthony Iano-Fletcher for helping test the 1.1 beta.

          "content": "For notes about internationalization, see [README-NLS](README-NLS).\n\nEncFS is a program which provides an encrypted virtual filesystem for Linux\nusing the FUSE kernel module ( see http://sourceforge.net/projects/avf to\ndownload the latest version of FUSE ).  FUSE provides a loadable kernel module\nwhich exports a filesystem interface to user-mode.  EncFS runs entirely in\nuser-mode and acts as a transparent encrypted filesystem.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n - To see command line options, see the man page for [encfs](encfs/encfs.pod)\n   and [encfsctl](encfs/encfsctl.pod), or for\n   brief usage message, run the programs without an argument (or `-h`):\n\n     encfs -h\n     man encfs\n\n - To create a new encrypted filesystem:\n   \n     encfs [source dir] [destination mount point]\n\n   eg.: `encfs ~/.crypt ~/crypt`.  Both directories should already exist,\n   although Encfs will ask if it can create them if they do not.  If the\n   `~/.crypt` directory does not already contain encrypted filesystem data,\n   then the user is prompted for a password for the new encryption directory.\n   The encrypted files will be stored in `~/.crypt`, and plaintext access will be\n   through `~/crypt`\n\n - To mount an existing filesystem:\n\n     encfs [source dir] [destination mount point]\n\n   This works just like creating a new filesystem.  If the Encfs control file\n   is found in the directory, then an attempt is made to mount an existing\n   filesystem.  If the control file is not found, then the filesystem is\n   created.\n\n\nTechnology\n----------\n\n - Encfs uses algorithms from third-party libraries (OpenSSL is the default) to\n   encrypt data and filenames.\n\n - A user supplied password is used to decrypt a volume key, and the volume key\n   is used for encrypting all file names and contents.  This makes it possible\n   to change the password without needing to re-encrypt all files.\n\n - EncFS has two encryption modes, which are used in different places:\n    - Stream encryption:\n\tUsed for filenames and partial blocks at the end of files.\n\tThe cipher is run in CFB stream mode in multiple passes over the data,\n\twith data order reversal between passes to make data more\n\tinterdependent.\n    - Block encryption:\n\tFixed size filesystem blocks are encrypted using the cipher in CBC\n\tmode.  The filesystem block size is a multiple of the cipher block\n\tsize, and is configurable on filesystem creation and can be up to 4096\n\tbytes in size.  Each block has a deterministic initialization vector\n\twhich allows for simple random access to blocks within a file.\n\n - Filename encryption:\n\n   Filenames are encrypted using either a stream mode or a block mode, in both\n   cases with an initialization vector based on the HMAC checksum of the\n   filename.\n \n   Using a deterministic initial vector allows fast directory lookups, as no\n   salt value needs to be looked up when converting from plaintext name to\n   encrypted name.  It also means very similar filenames (such as \"foo1\" and\n   \"foo2\") will encrypt to very different values, to frustrate any attempt to\n   see how closely related two files are based on their encrypted names.\n\n - Data blocks are handled in fixed size blocks (64 byte blocks for Encfs\n   versions 0.2 - 0.6, and user specified sizes in newer versions of Encfs,\n   defaulting to 512 byte block).  The block size is set during creation of the\n   filesystem and is constant thereafter.\n   Full filesystem blocks are encrypted in the cipher's block mode as described\n   above.  Partial filesystem blocks are encrypted using the cipher's stream\n   mode, which involves multiple passes over the data along with data\n   reordering to make the data in the partial block highly interdependent.\n    \n   For both modes this means that a change to a byte in the encrypted stream\n   may affecting several bytes in the deciphered stream.  This makes it hard\n   for any change at all to go unnoticed. \n\n   An additional option is to store Message Authentication Codes with each\n   filesystem block.  This adds about 8 bytes of overhead per block and a\n   large performance penalty, but makes it possible detect any modification\n   within a block.\n\n   Also during filesystem creation, one can enable per-file initialization\n   vectors.  This causes a header with a random initialization vector to be\n   maintained with each file.  Each file then has its own 64 bit initialization\n   vector which is augmented by the block number - so that each block within a\n   file has a unique initialization vector.  This makes it infeasible to copy a\n   whole block from one file to another. \n\nBackward Compatibility\n----------------------\n\n   At the top level of the raw (encrypted) storage for an EncFS filesystem is a\n   configuration file, created automatically by EncFS when a new filesystem is\n   made.\n\n   In Encfs versions 0.2 to 0.6, the file was called \".encfs3\" - meaning\n   version 3 of the Encfs configuration file format (earlier versions 1 and 2\n   were prior to the encfs public release).  EncFS 1.0.x used \".encfs4\", and\n   the Encfs 1.1.x uses yet another format (\".encfs5\").  The encfsctl program\n   can be used to show information about a filesystem.\n  \n   Encfs 1.1 can read and write to existing filesystems, but older versions\n   will not be able to mount a filesystem created by a newer version, as the\n   newer versions use algorithms and/or new options which were not previously\n   available.\n\nUtility\n-------\n\n   In addition to the `encfs` main program, a utility `encfsctl` has been\n   provided which can perform some operations on encfs filesystems.  Encfsctl\n   can display information about the filesystem for the curious (the encryption\n   algorithm used, key length, block size), and more importantly it can also\n   change the user-supplied password used to encrypt the volume key.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\n   Encfs uses the OpenSSL toolkit (http://www.openssl.org) by default.\n   OpenSSL is not covered by the GPL, and some people are concerned about the\n   licenses being incompatible.  Although I believe it should be clear that I\n   intended to allow linking encfs with OpenSSL, I will make it more explicit:\n\n   As a special exception to encfs's GPL license, the copyright holders give\n   permission to link the code or portions of this program with the OpenSSL\n   library, and distribute linked combinations including the two.  This\n   exception should be construed as narrowly as possible to allow OpenSSL to be\n   used and distributed as part of encfs.\n\n"

At the shell\nprompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),\n`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').\nThis can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for\nall.\n\n   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.\nBut in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For\nexample, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The\ncountry code serves to distinguish the dialects.\n\n   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the\nlanguage and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based\non GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are\nused, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of\nlocales supported by your system for your country by running the command\n`locale -a | grep '^LL''.\n\n   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an\nEnglish message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you\nunderstand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.\nThis is done through a different environment variable, called\n`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'\nfor the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'\nset to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the\nsystem libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather\nread translations in German than English for when Swedish is not\navailable, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.\n\n   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian\nbokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the\ntransition period, while some message catalogs for this language are\ninstalled under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended\nfor Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and\nolder translations are used.\n\n   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'\nenvironment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'\nto denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent\nto `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'\n(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.\n\nTranslating\n===========\n\nEncFS is registered with Launchpad Translations - an online interface\nfor supplying translations.\nSee https://translations.launchpad.net/encfs/main/+pots/encfs\n\nIf your language is not included in this distribution, you may want\nto check if translated text is already available online in Launchpad.\nIf not, consider translating some of the strings, which will then be\nincluded in the next EncFS release.\n\n\n"

          "content": "# EncFS - an Encrypted Filesystem\n\n**This project is NOT maintained.  For details, see the [Status](#status) section.**\n\n## About\n\nEncFS provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. It runs in userspace,\nusing the [FUSE library](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) for the filesystem interface. EncFS is open source\nsoftware, licensed under the LGPL.\n\nEncFS was first released in 2003, making it one of the earlier FUSE filesystems!\nI wrote it because I needed to encrypt my data while traveling, and the existing NFS and\nkernel-based encrypted filesystems such as CFS had not kept pace with Linux\ndevelopment.  When FUSE became available, I wrote a CFS replacement for my own\nuse and later released it to Open Source when it seemed stable.\n\nEncFS encrypts individual files, by translating all requests for the virtual\nEncFS filesystem into the equivalent encrypted operations on the raw\nfilesystem.\n\nFor more info, see:\n\n - The [encfs manpage](encfs/encfs.pod)\n - The technical overview in [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)\n\n## Status\n\nIn the time since EncFS was written, a lot has changed in the security,\nprivacy, and computing landscapes. Computing power has increased enormously over\nwhat a circa-2003 laptop can provide, and so it is no longer a performance burden\nto encrypt the entire filesystem of a personal device. Software encryption has also\nspread widely - data encryption is built into most systems and programs, so there is\nfar less of a need to have a separate encryption system.\n\nEncFS has been dormant for a long time now. I haven't used or worked on EncFS in\nmany years. I've left the repository here because I don't want to prevent anyone\nfrom using it if they have a need that can't be met otherwise. I'm sure that I have\nsome very old backups that would still require EncFS to access, so I expect that I\nmight have to compile it again someday.\n\nDon't expect any updates on this project. You're free to fork it, of course, but\nremember that this is a 20+yr old codebase which was only funded by personal\ninterest, so I wouldn't expect it to live up to modern-day coding standards.\n\nIf you're considering setting up a new encrypted filesystem wrapper, I'd recommend\nlooking into newer alternatives, such as the excellent [GoCryptFS](https://github.com/rfjakob/gocryptfs).\n\nThank you all for the early support, especially the FUSE author Miklos Szeredi,\nand all the interesting discussions at Open Source and Linux meetups over the years.\nValient Gough\nMay 2024\n\n## Unique Features\n\nEncFS has a few features still not found anywhere else (as of Dec 2014)\nthat may be interesting to you:\n\n### Reverse mode\n\n`encfs --reverse` provides an encrypted view of an unencrypted folder.\nThis enables encrypted remote backups using standard tools like rsync.\n\n### Fast on classical HDDs\n\nEncFS is typically *much* faster than ecryptfs for stat()-heavy workloads\nwhen the backing device is a classical hard disk.\nThis is because ecryptfs has to to read each file header to determine\nthe file size - EncFS does not. This is one additional seek for each\nstat.\nSee [PERFORMANCE.md](PERFORMANCE.md) for detailed benchmarks on\nHDD, SSD and ramdisk.\n\n### Works on top of network filesystems\n\nEncFS works on network file systems (NFS, CIFS...), while ecryptfs\nis known to still have [problems][1].\n\n[1]: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ecryptfs/+bug/277578\n\n## Development\n\nThe master branch contains the latest stable codebase.  This is where bug fixes\nand improvments should go.\n\nThe [dev](https://github.com/vgough/encfs/tree/dev) branch contains experimental\nwork, some of which may be back-ported to the master branch when it is stable. The\ndev branch is not stable, and there is no guarantee of backward compatibility\nbetween changes.\n\n## Windows\n\nEncFS works on Cygwin, there are also some Windows ports.\n\nSee [the wiki](https://github.com/vgough/encfs/wiki)\nfor additional info.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What settings should I use for Dropbox?\n\nUse **standard mode**. There [have](https://github.com/vgough/encfs/issues/141)\nbeen [reports](https://github.com/vgough/encfs/issues/388)\nof a pathological interaction of paranoia mode with Dropbox' rename\ndetection. The problem seems to be with `External IV chaining`, which is\nnot active in standard mode.\n"
