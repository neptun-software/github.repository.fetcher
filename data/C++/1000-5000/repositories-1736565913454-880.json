E:\\Data\\aa.b3dm -o E:\\Data\\aa.glb\n```\n\n## ③ 参数说明\n\n- `-c, --config <JSON>` 在命令行传入 json 配置的字符串，json 内容为选配，可部分实现\n\n  json 示例：\n\n  ``` json\n  {\n    \"x\": 120,\n    \"y\": 30,\n    \"offset\": 0,\n    \"max_lvl\" : 20\n  }\n  ```\n\n\n- `-f, --format <FORMAT>` 输入数据格式。\n\n  `FORMAT` 可选：osgb, shape, gltf, b3dm\n\n  `osgb` 为倾斜摄影格式数据, `shape` 为 Shapefile 面数据, `gltf` 为单一通用模型转gltf, `b3dm` 为单个3dtile二进制数据转gltf\n\n- `-i, --input <PATH>` 输入数据的目录，osgb数据截止到 `<DIR>/Data` 目录的上一级，其他格式具体到文件名。\n\n- `-o, --output <DIR>` 输出目录。输出的数据文件位于 `<DIR>/Data` 目录。\n\n- `--height` 高度字段。指定shapefile中的高度属性字段，此项为转换 shp 时的必须参数。\n\n\n\n# 数据要求及说明\n\n### ① 倾斜摄影数据\n\n倾斜摄影数据仅支持 smart3d 格式的 osgb 组织方式：\n\n- 数据目录必须有一个 `“Data”` 目录的总入口；\n- `“Data”` 目录同级放置一个 `metadata.xml` 文件用来记录模型的位置信息；\n- 每个瓦片目录下，必须有个和目录名同名的 osgb 文件，否则无法识别根节点；\n\n正确的目录结构示意：\n\n```\n- Your-data-folder\n  ├ metadata.xml\n  └ Data\\Tile_000_000\\Tile_000_000.osgb\n```\n\n### ② Shapefile\n\n目前仅支持 Shapefile 的面数据，可用于建筑物轮廓批量生成 3D-Tiles.\n\nShapefile 中需要有字段来表示高度信息。\n\n### ③ 通用模型转 glTF：\n\n支持 osg、osgb、obj、fbx、3ds 等单一通用模型数据转为 gltf、glb 格式。\n\n转出格式为 2.0 的gltf，可在以下网址验证查看： https://pissang.github.io/clay-viewer/editor/\n\n### ④ B3dm 单文件转 glb\n\n支持将 b3dm 单个文件转成 glb 格式，便于调试程序和测试数据\n"
