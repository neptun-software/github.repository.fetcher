Precise calibrations are vital for further processing steps, such as sensor fusion and implementation of algorithms for obstacle detection, localization and mapping, and control. Further, sensor fusion is one of the essential tasks in autonomous driving applications that fuses information obtained from multiple sensors to reduce the uncertainties compared to when sensors are used individually. To solve the problem of sensor calibration for autonomous vehicles, we provide a sensors calibration toolbox. The calibration toolbox can be used to calibrate sensors such as **IMU, LiDAR, Camera, and Radar**.\n\n## Environment(Quick Start)\n```shell\n# pull docker image\nsudo docker pull scllovewkf/opencalib:v1\n# After the image is pulled down, start the docker image.  /home/sz3/ailab/ =  code root path on your host\ndocker run -it -v /home/sz3/ailab/:/share scllovewkf/opencalib:v1 /bin/bash\n# or\nsudo ./run_docker.sh\n``` \n\n### Sensors calibration\nThis calibration toolbox provides some calibration tools based on road scenes.
