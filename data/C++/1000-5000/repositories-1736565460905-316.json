We encourage all new projects to start on the new release.\n\n## Introduction\n\nWelcome to the NVIDIA PhysX SDK source code repository. This depot includes the PhysX SDK and the Kapla Demo application.\n\nThe NVIDIA PhysX SDK is a scalable multi-platform physics solution supporting a wide range of devices, from smartphones to high-end multicore CPUs and GPUs. PhysX is already integrated into some of the most popular game engines, including Unreal Engine, and Unity3D. [PhysX SDK on developer.nvidia.com](https://developer.nvidia.com/physx-sdk).\n\n## Documentation\n\nPlease see [Release Notes](http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/PhysX/4.1/release_notes.html) for updates pertaining to the latest version.\n\nThe full set of documentation can also be found in the repository under physx/documentation or online at http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/simulation.html \n\nPlatform specific information can be found here:\n* [Microsoft Windows](http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/PhysX/4.1/documentation/platformreadme/windows/readme_windows.html)\n* [Linux](http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/PhysX/4.1/documentation/platformreadme/linux/readme_linux.html)\n* [Google Android ARM](http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/PhysX/4.1/documentation/platformreadme/android/readme_android.html)\n* [Apple macOS](http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/PhysX/4.1/documentation/platformreadme/mac/readme_mac.html)\n* [Apple iOS](http://gameworksdocs.nvidia.com/PhysX/4.1/documentation/platformreadme/ios/readme_ios.html)\n \n\n## Quick Start Instructions\n\nRequirements:\n* Python 2.7.6 or later\n* CMake 3.12 or later\n\nTo begin, clone this repository onto your local drive.  Then change directory to physx/, run ./generate_projects.[bat|sh] and follow on-screen prompts.  This will let you select a platform specific solution to build.  You can then open the generated solution file with your IDE and kick off one or more configuration builds.\n\nTo build and run the Kapla Demo see [kaplademo/README.md](kaplademo/README.md).\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis depot contains external third party open source software copyright their respective owners.
