Addressing them will, therefore, help accelerate queries.\n\n`sqlcheck` targets **all major SQL dialects**.\n\nFor development updates on `sqlcheck` and general news on <a href=\"https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~jarulraj/\">next generation  database systems</a>, follow me at <a class=\"twitter-follow-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/joy_arulraj\">@joy_arulraj</a>.\n\n## What it can do\n\nRight now SQLCheck can detect the following anti-patterns:\n\n### Logical Database Design Anti-Patterns\n\n  * [Multi-Valued Attribute](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/logical/1001.md)\n  * [Recursive Dependency](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/logical/1002.md)\n  * [Primary Key Does Not Exist](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/logical/1003.md)\n  * [Generic Primary Key](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/logical/1004.md)\n  * [Foreign Key Does Not Exist](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/logical/1005.md)\n  * [Entity-Attribute-Value Pattern](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/logical/1006.md)\n  * [Metadata Tribbles](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/logical/1007.md)\n\n### Physical Database Design Anti-Patterns\n\n  * [Imprecise Data Type](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/physical/2001.md)\n  * [Values In Definition](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/physical/2002.md)\n  * [Files Are Not SQL Data Types](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/physical/2003.md)\n  * [Too Many Indexes](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/physical/2004.md)\n  * [Index Attribute Order](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/physical/2005.md)\n\n### Query Anti-Patterns\n\n  * [SELECT *](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3001.md)\n  * [NULL Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3002.md)\n  * [NOT NULL Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3003.md)\n  * [String Concatenation](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3004.md)\n  * [GROUP BY Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3005.md)\n  * [ORDER BY RAND Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3006.md)\n  * [Pattern Matching Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3007.md)\n  * [Spaghetti Query Alert](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3008.md)\n  * [Reduce Number of JOINs](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3009.md)\n  * [Eliminate Unnecessary DISTINCT Conditions](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3010.md)\n  * [Implicit Column Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3011.md)\n  * [HAVING Clause Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3012.md)\n  * [Nested sub queries](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3013.md)\n  * [OR Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3014.md)\n  * [UNION Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3015.md)\n  * [DISTINCT & JOIN Usage](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/query/3016.md)\n\n### Application Development Anti-Patterns\n\n  * [Readable Passwords](https://github.com/jarulraj/sqlcheck/blob/master/docs/application/4001.md)\n\n## Installation\n\n###UBUNTU/MINT (DEBIAN)\n\n1.

This causes more data to move from\nthe database server to the client, slowing access and increasing load on your\nmachines, as well as taking more time to travel across the network. This is\nespecially true when someone adds new columns to underlying tables that didn't\nexist and weren't needed when the original consumers coded their data access.   \n\n\n● Indexing issues:\n\nConsider a scenario where you want to tune a query to a high level of\nperformance. If you were to use *, and it returned more columns than you\nactually needed, the server would often have to perform more expensive methods\nto retrieve your data than it otherwise might. For example, you wouldn't be able\nto create an index which simply covered the columns in your SELECT list, and\neven if you did (including all columns [shudder]), the next developer who came around\nand added a column to the underlying table would cause the optimizer to ignore\nyour optimized covering index, and you'd likely find that the performance of\nyour query would drop substantially for no readily apparent reason.    \n[Matching Expression: select *]\n\n[examples/top_mutexes.sql]: (LOW RISK) (QUERY ANTI-PATTERN) Spaghetti Query Alert   \n\n● Split up a complex spaghetti query into several simpler queries:\n\nSQL is a very expressive language—you can accomplish a lot in a single query\nor statement. But that doesn't mean it's mandatory or even a good idea to\napproach every task with the assumption it has to be done in one line of code.\nOne common unintended consequence of producing all your results in one query is\na Cartesian product. This happens when two of the tables in the query have no\ncondition restricting their relationship. Without such a restriction, the join\nof two tables pairs each row in the first table to every row in the other table.\nEach such pairing becomes a row of the result set, and you end up with many more\nrows than you expect. \n\nIt's important to consider that these queries are simply\nhard to write, hard to modify, and hard to debug. You should expect to get\nregular requests for incremental enhancements to your database applications.\nManagers want more complex reports and more fields in a user interface. If you\ndesign intricate, monolithic SQL queries, it's more costly and time-consuming to\nmake enhancements to them. Your time is worth something, both to you and to your\nproject. Split up a complex spaghetti query into several simpler queries. When\nyou split up a complex SQL query, the result may be many similar queries,\nperhaps varying slightly depending on data values. Writing these queries is a\nchore, so it's a good application of SQL code generation. Although SQL makes it\nseem possible to solve a complex problem in a single line of code, don't be\ntempted to build a house of cards.   \n\n==================== Summary ===================   \nAll Anti-Patterns  :: 2   \n>  High Risk   :: 1   \n>  Medium Risk :: 0   \n>  Low Risk    :: 1   \n\n```\n\n## References\n\n(1) SQL Anti-patterns: Avoiding the Pitfalls of Database Programming, Bill Karwin  \n(2) [Common SQL Anti-patterns](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/346659/what-are-the-most-common-sql-anti-patterns), StackOverflow\n\n## Contributions\n\nContributions to SQLCheck are always welcome.
