          "content": "# CDC File Transfer\n\nBorn from the ashes of Stadia, this repository contains tools for syncing and\nstreaming files from Windows to Windows or Linux. The tools are based on Content\nDefined Chunking (CDC), in particular\n[FastCDC](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc16/technical-sessions/presentation/xia),\nto split up files into chunks.\n\n## History\n\nAt Stadia, game developers had access to Linux cloud instances to run games.\nMost developers wrote their games on Windows, though. Therefore, they needed a\nway to make them available on the remote Linux instance.\n\nAs developers had SSH access to those instances, they could use `scp` to copy\nthe game content. However, this was impractical, especially with the shift to\nworking from home during the pandemic with sub-par internet connections. `scp`\nalways copies full files, there is no \"delta mode\" to copy only the things that\nchanged, it is slow for many small files, and there is no fast compression.\n\nTo help this situation, we developed two tools, `cdc_rsync` and `cdc_stream`,\nwhich enable developers to quickly iterate on their games without repeatedly\nincurring the cost of transmitting dozens of GBs.\n\n## CDC RSync\n\n`cdc_rsync` is a tool to sync files from a Windows machine to a Linux device,\nsimilar to the standard Linux [rsync](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync). It is\nbasically a copy tool, but optimized for the case where there is already an old\nversion of the files available in the target directory.\n* It quickly skips files if timestamp and file size match.\n* It uses fast compression for all data transfer.\n* If a file changed, it determines which parts changed and only transfers the\n  differences.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/cdc_rsync_recursive_upload_demo.gif\" alt=\"cdc_rsync demo\" width=\"688\" />\n</p>\n\nThe remote diffing algorithm is based on CDC. In our tests, it is up to 30x\nfaster than the one used in `rsync` (1500 MB/s vs 50 MB/s).\n\nThe following chart shows a comparison of `cdc_rsync` and Linux `rsync` running\nunder Cygwin on Windows. The test data consists of 58 development builds\nof some game provided to us for evaluation purposes. The builds are 40-45 GB\nlarge. For this experiment, we uploaded the first build, then synced the second\nbuild with each of the two tools and measured the time. For example, syncing\nfrom build 1 to build 2 took 210 seconds with the Cygwin `rsync`, but only 75\nseconds with `cdc_rsync`. The three outliers are probably feature drops from\nanother development branch, where the delta was much higher. Overall,\n`cdc_rsync` syncs files about **3 times faster** than Cygwin `rsync`.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/cdc_rsync_vs_cygwin_rsync.png\" alt=\"Comparison of cdc_rsync and Linux rsync running in Cygwin\" width=\"753\" />\n</p>\n\nWe also ran the experiment with the native Linux `rsync`, i.e syncing Linux to\nLinux, to rule out issues with Cygwin. Linux `rsync` performed on average 35%\nworse than Cygwin `rsync`, which can be attributed to CPU differences. We did\nnot include it in the figure because of this, but you can find it\n[here](docs/cdc_rsync_vs_cygwin_rsync_vs_linux_rsync.png).\n\n### How does it work and why is it faster?\n\nThe standard Linux `rsync` splits a file into fixed-size chunks of typically\nseveral KB.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/fixed_size_chunks.png\" alt=\"Linux rsync uses fixed size chunks\" width=\"258\" />\n</p>\n\nIf the file is modified in the middle, e.g. by inserting `xxxx` after `567`,\nthis usually means that <span style=\"color: red\">the modified chunks as well as\nall subsequent chunks</span> change.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/fixed_size_chunks_inserted.png\" alt=\"Fixed size chunks after inserting data\" width=\"301\" />\n</p>\n\nThe standard `rsync` algorithm hashes the chunks of the remote \"old\" file\nand sends the hashes to the local device. The local device then figures out \nwhich parts of the \"new\" file matches known chunks.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/linux_rsync_animation.gif\" alt=\"Syncing a file with the standard Linux rsync\" width=\"855\" />\n  <br>\n  Standard rsync algorithm\n</p>\n\nThis is a simplification. The actual algorithm is more complicated and uses\ntwo hashes, a weak rolling hash and a strong hash, see\n[here](https://rsync.samba.org/tech_report/) for a great overview. What makes\n`rsync` relatively slow is the \"no match\" situation where the rolling hash does\nnot match any remote hash, and the algorithm has to roll the hash forward and\nperform a hash map lookup for each byte. `rsync` goes to\n[great lengths](https://github.com/librsync/librsync/blob/master/src/hashtable.h)\noptimizing lookups.\n\n`cdc_rsync` does not use fixed-size chunks, but instead variable-size,\ncontent-defined chunks. That means, chunk boundaries are determined by the\n*local content* of the file, in practice a 64 byte sliding window. For more\ndetails, see\n[the FastCDC paper](https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc16/technical-sessions/presentation/xia)\nor take a look at [our implementation](fastcdc/fastcdc.h).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/variable_size_chunks.png\" alt=\"cdc_rsync uses variable, content-defined size chunks\" width=\"260\" />\n</p>\n\nIf the file is modified in the middle, only <span style=\"color: red\">the modified\nchunks</span>, but not <span style=\"color: #38761d\">subsequent chunks</span>\nchange (unless they are less than 64 bytes away from the modifications).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/variable_size_chunks_inserted.png\" alt=\"Content-defined chunks after inserting data\" width=\"314\" />\n</p>\n\nComputing the chunk boundaries is cheap and involves only a left-shift, a memory\nlookup, an `add` and an `and` operation for each input byte. This is cheaper\nthan the hash map lookup for the standard `rsync` algorithm.\n\nBecause of this, the `cdc_rsync` algorithm is faster than the standard\n`rsync`. It is also simpler. Since chunk boundaries move along with insertions\nor deletions, the task to match local and remote hashes is a trivial set\ndifference operation. It does not involve a per-byte hash map lookup.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/cdc_rsync_animation.gif\" alt=\"Syncing a file with cdc_rsync\" width=\"857\" />\n  <br>\n  cdc_rsync algorithm\n</p>\n\n## CDC Stream\n\n`cdc_stream` is a tool to stream files and directories from a Windows machine to\na Linux device. Conceptually, it is similar to\n[sshfs](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs), but it is optimized for read speed.\n* It caches streamed data on the Linux device.\n* If a file is re-read on Linux after it changed on Windows, only the\n  differences are streamed again. The rest is read from the cache.\n* Stat operations are very fast since the directory metadata (filenames,\n  permissions etc.) is provided in a streaming-friendly way.\n\nTo efficiently determine which parts of a file changed, the tool uses the same\nCDC-based diffing algorithm as `cdc_rsync`. Changes to Windows files are almost\nimmediately reflected on Linux, with a delay of roughly (0.5s + 0.7s x total\nsize of changed files in GB).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/cdc_stream_demo.gif\" alt=\"cdc_stream demo\" width=\"688\" />\n</p>\n\nThe tool does not support writing files back from Linux to Windows; the Linux\ndirectory is readonly.\n\nThe following chart compares times from starting a game to reaching the menu.\nIn one case, the game is streamed via `sshfs`, in the other case we use\n`cdc_stream`. Overall, we see a **2x to 5x speedup**.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"docs/cdc_stream_vs_sshfs.png\" alt=\"Comparison of cdc_stream and sshfs\" width=\"752\" />\n</p>\n\n# Supported Platforms\n\n| `cdc_rsync`                  | From                 | To                   |\n|:-----------------------------|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|\n| Windows x86_64               | &check;              | &check; <sup>1</sup> |\n| Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64          | &cross; <sup>2</sup> | &check;              |\n| Ubuntu 22.04 aarch64         | &cross;              | &cross;              |\n| macOS 13 x86_64 <sup>3</sup> | &cross;              | &cross;              |\n| macOS 13 aarch64 <sup>3</sup>| &cross;              | &cross;              |\n\n| `cdc_stream`                 | From                 | To                   |\n|:-----------------------------|:--------------------:|:--------------------:|\n| Windows x86_64               | &check;              | &cross;              |\n| Ubuntu 22.04 x86_64          | &cross;              | &check;              |\n| Ubuntu 22.04 aarch64         | &cross;              | &cross;              |\n| macOS 13 x86_64 <sup>3</sup> | &cross;              | &cross;              |\n| macOS 13 aarch64 <sup>3</sup>| &cross;              | &cross;              |\n\n<span style=\"font-size: 0.8rem\">\n\n<sup>1</sup> Only local syncs, e.g. `cdc_rsync C:\\src\\* C:\\dst`.

The Linux binaries are automatically deployed\nto `~/.cache/cdc-file-transfer` by the Windows tools. There is no need to manually\ndeploy them. We currently provide Linux binaries compiled on\n[Github's latest Ubuntu](https://github.com/actions/runner-images) version.\nIf the binaries work for you, you can skip the following two sections.\n\nAlternatively, the project can be built from source. Some binaries have to be\nbuilt on Windows, some on Linux.\n\n## Prerequisites for Building\n\nTo build the tools from source, the following steps have to be executed on\n**both Windows and Linux**.\n\n* Download and install Bazel from [here](https://bazel.build/install). See\n  [workflow logs](https://github.com/google/cdc-file-transfer/actions) for the\n  currently used version.\n* Clone the repository.\n  ```\n  git clone https://github.com/google/cdc-file-transfer\n  ```\n* Initialize submodules.\n  ```\n  cd cdc-file-transfer\n  git submodule update --init --recursive\n  ```\n\nFinally, install an SSH client on the Windows machine if not present.\nThe file transfer tools require `ssh.exe` and `sftp.exe`.\n\n## Building\n\nThe two tools CDC RSync and CDC Stream can be built and used independently.\n\n### CDC RSync\n\n* On a Linux device, build the Linux components\n  ```\n  bazel build --config linux --compilation_mode=opt --linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all --copt=-fdata-sections --copt=-ffunction-sections --linkopt=-Wl,--gc-sections //cdc_rsync_server\n  ```\n* On a Windows device, build the Windows components\n  ```\n  bazel build --config windows --compilation_mode=opt --copt=/GL //cdc_rsync\n  ```\n* Copy the Linux build output file `cdc_rsync_server` from \n  `bazel-bin/cdc_rsync_server` to `bazel-bin\\cdc_rsync` on the Windows machine.\n\n### CDC Stream\n\n* On a Linux device, build the Linux components\n  ```\n  bazel build --config linux --compilation_mode=opt --linkopt=-Wl,--strip-all --copt=-fdata-sections --copt=-ffunction-sections --linkopt=-Wl,--gc-sections //cdc_fuse_fs\n  ```\n* On a Windows device, build the Windows components\n  ```\n  bazel build --config windows --compilation_mode=opt --copt=/GL //cdc_stream\n  ```\n* Copy the Linux build output files `cdc_fuse_fs` and `libfuse.so` from \n  `bazel-bin/cdc_fuse_fs` to `bazel-bin\\cdc_stream` on the Windows machine.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe tools require a setup where you can use SSH and SFTP from the Windows\nmachine to the Linux device without entering a password, e.g. by using key-based\nauthentication.\n\n### Configuring SSH and SFTP\n\nBy default, the tools search `ssh.exe` and `sftp.exe` from the path environment\nvariable. If you can run the following commands in a Windows cmd without\nentering your password, you are all set:\n```\nssh user@linux.device.com\nsftp user@linux.device.com\n```\nHere, `user` is the Linux user and `linux.device.com` is the Linux host to\nSSH into or copy the file to.\n\nIf additional arguments are required, it is recommended to provide an SSH config\nfile. By default, both `ssh.exe` and `sftp.exe` use the file at\n`%USERPROFILE%\\.ssh\\config` on Windows, if it exists. A possible config file\nthat sets a username, a port, an identity file and a known host file could look\nas follows:\n```\nHost linux_device\n\tHostName linux.device.com\n\tUser user\n\tPort 12345\n\tIdentityFile C:\\path\\to\\id_rsa\n\tUserKnownHostsFile C:\\path\\to\\known_hosts\n```\nIf `ssh.exe` or `sftp.exe` cannot be found, you can specify the full paths via\nthe command line arguments `--ssh-command` and `--sftp-command` for `cdc_rsync`\nand `cdc_stream start` (see below), or set the environment variables\n`CDC_SSH_COMMAND` and `CDC_SFTP_COMMAND`, e.g.\n```\nset CDC_SSH_COMMAND=\"C:\\path with space\\to\\ssh.exe\"\nset CDC_SFTP_COMMAND=\"C:\\path with space\\to\\sftp.exe\"\n```\nNote that you can also specify SSH configuration via the environment variables\ninstead of using a config file:\n```\nset CDC_SSH_COMMAND=C:\\path\\to\\ssh.exe -p 12345 -i C:\\path\\to\\id_rsa -oUserKnownHostsFile=C:\\path\\to\\known_hosts\nset CDC_SFTP_COMMAND=C:\\path\\to\\sftp.exe -P 12345 -i C:\\path\\to\\id_rsa -oUserKnownHostsFile=C:\\path\\to\\known_hosts\n```\nNote the small `-p` for `ssh.exe` and the capital `-P` for `sftp.exe`.\n\n#### Google Specific\n\nFor Google internal usage, set the following environment variables to enable SSH\nauthentication using a Google security key:\n```\nset CDC_SSH_COMMAND=C:\\gnubby\\bin\\ssh.exe\nset CDC_SFTP_COMMAND=C:\\gnubby\\bin\\sftp.exe\n```\nNote that you will have to touch the security key multiple times during the\nfirst run. Subsequent runs only require a single touch.\n\n### CDC RSync\n\n`cdc_rsync` is used similar to `scp` or the Linux `rsync` command. To sync a\nsingle Windows file `C:\\path\\to\\file.txt` to the home directory `~` on the Linux\ndevice `linux.device.com`, run\n```\ncdc_rsync C:\\path\\to\\file.txt user@linux.device.com:~\n```\n`cdc_rsync` understands the usual Windows wildcards `*` and `?`.\n```\ncdc_rsync C:\\path\\to\\*.txt user@linux.device.com:~\n```\nTo sync the contents of the Windows directory `C:\\path\\to\\assets` recursively to\n`~/assets` on the Linux device, run\n```\ncdc_rsync C:\\path\\to\\assets\\* user@linux.device.com:~/assets -r\n```\nTo get per file progress, add `-v`:\n```\ncdc_rsync C:\\path\\to\\assets\\* user@linux.device.com:~/assets -vr\n```\nThe tool also supports local syncs:\n```\ncdc_rsync C:\\path\\to\\assets\\* C:\\path\\to\\destination -vr\n```\n\n### CDC Stream\n\nTo stream the Windows directory `C:\\path\\to\\assets` to `~/assets` on the Linux\ndevice, run\n```\ncdc_stream start C:\\path\\to\\assets user@linux.device.com:~/assets\n```\nThis makes all files and directories in `C:\\path\\to\\assets` available on\n`~/assets` immediately, as if it were a local copy. However, data is streamed\nfrom Windows to Linux as files are accessed.\n\nTo stop the streaming session, enter\n```\ncdc_stream stop user@linux.device.com:~/assets\n```\nThe command also accepts wildcards. For instance, \n```\ncdc_stream stop user@*:*\n```\nstops all existing streaming sessions for the given user.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nOn first run, `cdc_stream` starts a background service, which does all the work.\nThe `cdc_stream start` and `cdc_stream stop` commands are just RPC clients that\ntalk to the service.\n\nThe service logs to `%APPDATA%\\cdc-file-transfer\\logs` by default. The logs are\nuseful to investigate issues with asset streaming. To pass custom arguments, or\nto debug the service, create a JSON config file at\n`%APPDATA%\\cdc-file-transfer\\cdc_stream.json` with command line flags.\nFor instance,\n```\n{ \"verbosity\":3 }\n```\ninstructs the service to log debug messages. Try `cdc_stream start-service -h`\nfor a list of available flags. Alternatively, run the service manually with\n```\ncdc_stream start-service\n```\nand pass the flags as command line arguments. When you run the service manually,\nthe flag `--log-to-stdout` is particularly useful as it logs to the console\ninstead of to the file.\n\n`cdc_rsync` always logs to the console. To increase log verbosity, pass `-vvv`\nfor debug logs or `-vvvv` for verbose logs.\n\nFor both sync and stream, the debug logs contain all SSH and SFTP commands that\nare attempted to run, which is very useful for troubleshooting. If a command\nfails unexpectedly, copy it and run it in isolation. Pass `-vv` or `-vvv` for\nadditional debug output.\n"
