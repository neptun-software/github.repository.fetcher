          "content": "# SuperTux Coding Standards\n\n## Language\n\nC++17 is the main langauge used for this project. GCC, Clang and MSVC are supported.\n\nFor better backward compatibilty with older compiler, namely gcc5,\nsome C++17 features are restricted:\n\n* generic lambda functions are not allowed, e.g. `[](auto foo){}`\n* tuple constructors have to be explicit, e.g. `std::tuple<int, int>{5, 6}`, not `{5, 6}`\n\n## Repository Structure\n\nProperly separate between generic engine code and game specific code whenever\nfeasible.\n\nThird party libraries are not allowed in `src/`, they go to `external/`.\n\nThird party libraries that are imported into `external/` as git\nsubmodule have to be forked and included into the SuperTux\norganisation on Github, not directly included from upstream.\n\n## File Formating\n\nDo not have spaces at the end of lines.\n\nFiles should always end with `/* EOF */` and a newline or a similar\nmarker approprimate for the given language. This marker can be left\nout for fileformats that have an end tag, e.g. `</html>`.\n\nAim for one file per class, small helper classes in the same file are ok.\n\n## Includes\n\nThe path in `#include` directives must not contain `..`.\n\nAll paths for includes from SuperTux must be relative to the `src/`\ndirectory and use `#include \"...\"`.\n\nUse the `#include <>` syntax for libraries in `external/`, use `cmake`\nto set the include path properly.\n\nThe order of includes shall be as follows, each of those subgroups\nshall be ordered alphabetically:\n\n* include of header file when in a .cpp file\n* include of the base class in a header file of a derived class\n* system includes\n* external includes\n* local includes\n\nConditional includes should be indented.\n\n```c++\n#ifdef FOOBAR\n#  include \"foobar.hpp\"\n#endif\n```\n\nInclude guards are of the form:\n\n```c++\n#ifndef HEADER_SUPERTUX_{PATH}_{FILE}_HPP\n#define HEADER_SUPERTUX_{PATH}_{FILE}_HPP\n```\n\n`tools/fix_include_guards.sh` is a little script that will help to fix\ninclude guards on file renames.\n\n## Variables\n\nPrefix member variable names with `m_`, global variables with `g_`, and static\nvariables with `s_`. DynamicScopeRefs are prefixed with `d_`.\n\n## Classes\n\nMark all classes as `final` unless they are specifically designed\nwith polymorphism in mind.\n\nMark all functions that override a virtual function in a base class with `override`.\n\nWrite simple getters/setters inside a header file on a single line. Mark them as `inline`.\n\nProperly separate data members and member functions. Do not mix them in the same\n`public`/`protected`/`private` section.\n\nList virtual functions before non-virtual functions.\n\nThe order of declarations in a class shall be as follows:\n\n```c++\nclass Foo final\n{\npublic:\nprotected:\nprivate:\n   // type declarations, needs to come first as later stuff might depend on them\n\npublic:\nprotected:\nprivate:\n   // static stuff\n\npublic:\nprotected:\nprivate:\n   // constructors\n   // destructor\n\npublic:\nprotected:\nprivate:\n   // virtual member functions\n   // non-virtual member functions\n\npublic:\nprotected:\nprivate:\n   // member variables with an m_ prefix\n\nprivate:\n  // non-copyable footer\n  Foo(const Foo&) = delete;\n  Foo& operator=(const Foo&) = delete;\n};\n```\n\n## Pointers\n\nDo not use raw pointers and `new`/`delete`, use\n`std::unique_ptr<>`/`std::make_unique<>` instead.\n\nOnly use `std::smart_ptr<>` when sharing of data is required, prefer\n`std::unique_ptr<>` when possible.\n\nPass and return values as value, `&` or `const&`, only use `*` when\nthe value is expected to be `nullptr`.\n\nDo not pass values as `const std::unique_ptr<T>&` or `const\nstd::shared_ptr<T>&`, dereference the pointer and pass as `const&`.\n\nTo check for nullptr, use an `if` statements with initializer when possible:\n\n```c++\nif (auto* ptr = get_ptr()) {\n  // code here\n}\n```\n\n## auto\n\nDon't use `auto` for basic types (`int`, `float`, `std::string`, ...)\n\nOnly use `auto` when the exact type is unnecessary to know (e.g.\niterators) or obvious from the context, (e.g. `auto foo =\nFoo::create()`)\n\nCapture pointers as `auto*`, not just `auto`.\n\nUse `const auto&` for loops to avoid copies.\n\n## Namespaces\n\nNamespaces should be written in the form:\n\n```c++\nnamespace my_namespace {\n...\n} // namespace my_namespace\n```\n\nWith no newline before the `{`. Do not indent the content inside the\nnamespace. The namespace itself should be all lowercase.\n\n## Compiler Warnings and Errors\n\nCompile with a maximum warning level and with `-Werror`. This can be accomplished with:\n\n```console\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  -DWARNINGS=ON -DWERROR=ON\n```\n\nThis requires, among other things:\n\n* use of `final` and `override` keywords\n\n* use of `static_cast` and `reinterpret_cast`, not old style C casts\n\n* all member variables have to be initialized in the constructor\n\n* all `int`/`float` conversion has to be explicit\n\n## Comments\n\nAvoid comments unless they explain something important and\nnon-obvious. Document *why* the code does something, not *what* it\ndoes.\n\nPrefer to use good function and variable names to create\nself-documenting code.\n\nUse the `//` syntax for regular comments, even multiline, don't use `/* */`.\n\nFor Doxygen (code documentation), use the `/** */` syntax, don't use\n`/**<` and other styles of comments.\n\nFor translator information, use the `// l10n:` syntax.\n\nDon't do `*` prefix decorations in comments, keep things simple and\ncompact:\n\n```c++\n/*\n *  Don't do this\n */\n```\n\nInstead:\n\n```c++\n// Do this\n```\n\nor:\n\n```c++\n/** Also ok when it's a Doxygen comment */\n```\n\n## Spaces\n\nUse a space after `if`/`while`/`switch`/`for`:\n\n`for (int i = 0; i < len; ++i) ...`\n\n`if (a > b) ...`\n\n`while (a > b) ...`\n\n`switch (myenum) ...`\n\nBut don't use a space after a function name:\n\n`myfunc ()` // don't do this\n\n`myfunc()` // do this\n\n## Line breaks\n\nWrite simple getters/setters inside a header file on a single line:\n\n```c++\nVector get_pos() const { return m_pos; }\n```\n\nDon't include more complex functions inside a header file, unless it's\nnecessary (template, performance).\n\nDeclare functions like:\n\n```c++\nReturnType\nClassName::function_name()\n{\n...\n}\n```\n\nWe don't have any hard rules on linebreaks before `{` inside\nfunctions, but generally prefer the no-linebreak version when doing\nsimple one-liners and the other one when doing more complex stuff:\n\n```c++\nif (foo) {\n  one_line_function_call()\n}\n```\n\n```c++\nif (foo)\n{\n  long();\n  complex();\n  series();\n  of();\n  calls();\n}\n```\n\n## Other Information\n\nMore general info on good practices can be found in [Google's C++\nStyle Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) and in\nthe [C++ Core Guidelines](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines),\nnote however that we do not strictly follow either of them and divert from\nthem in some points, so just take them as general guidelines, not hard rules.\n"

IRC support might be possible in other languages,\n  however English is generally preferred so everyone can understand what's happening.\n- Please check for duplicate issues on GitHub, as they're wasting the developers'\n  time.\n- Check if your issue has been resolved in the latest development version.\n- Separate issues and feature requests. Don't put all in the same issue.\n- If you made a mistake in your bug report, please use GitHub's edit feature\n  to correct the wrong detail, instead of closing the old issue and opening a\n  new one.\n\n\n### Required information\n\nPlease include the following details in your issue report so that we can investigate:\n\n- The SuperTux version you're using, as printed in the bottom left corner of the\n  menu or in `supertux2 -v`.\n- Details about your kernel, operating system and distribution, including name\n  and version details.\n- If possible, provide steps to reproduce your issue.\n- If available, it's a great help for the developers to include a backtrace from\n  `gdb` or a core dump. If you're on GNU/Linux and your distro is using systemd, it's\n  highly likely that a core dump is available using `coredumpctl(1)`.\n\n### Add-on related issues\n\nIssues regarding add-ons found in the official SuperTux Add-on repository\nshould be filed at [SuperTux/addons](https://github.com/SuperTux/addons/issues).\n\nNo support is provided for third-party add-ons (that doesn't include official\nadd-ons or language packs). However, a pull request against the [SuperTux/addons](https://github.com/SuperTux/addons)\nrepository, containing a fix, is always welcome!\n\n### Translation issues\n\nPlease use [Transifex](https://explore.transifex.com/arctic-games/supertux/) to fix or report translation related issues.\n\n## Pull requests\n\n- No duplicate pull requests, please.\n- Please test your code to see if it works correctly. If the pull request\n  is untested or work-in-progress, please mention that.\n- Pull requests importing translation updates from Transifex are, unless requested\n  by a contributor, not very welcome.\n- Commit messages should follow this style:\n  - First line: Short summary, up to 72 characters\n  - An empty line, separating message subject and body\n  - Detailed explanatory text for the change which can include multiple paragraphs,\n    or bullet points. Maximum of 72 characters per line.\n  - If the commit fixes an issue reported on GitHub, please add another empty\n    line, followed by a line containing `Closes #xyz`, where `#xyz` is the issue\n    to close. See <https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/>\n    for a more detailed description of this feature.\n  - If the commit doesn't include any changes that need CI testing (code or\n    build system changes should always be CI tested, other things not), yet another\n    empty line, followed by a line containing `[ci skip]`. This makes the CI\n    ignore that commit.\n- Please [squash](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/) commits that belong together.\n  If you forget initially, it's okay to force push to your own fork to fix it.\n- No merge commits inside pull requests.

You should check <https://supertux.org/download.html>\nfor the packages and instructions on how to install them. If there are\nno prebuilt binaries for your platform, then you might still be able\nto compile the source code yourself. In this case read the next\nsections.\n\n### Nightlies\n\nWe also provide binaries automatically generated as code is added to the\nrepository. These are built using GitHub Actions and are generally used to\nvalidate code quality, but as they produce binaries, those can be downloaded\nand installed like any release. You may find the nightlies at\n<https://download.supertux.org/>.\n\nAlternatively, if you have a GitHub account, you may find nightlies directly on\nGitHub either\n[here](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/actions/workflows/main.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\nfor common platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux) or\n[here](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/actions/workflows/other.yml?query=branch%3Amaster)\nfor the rest (FreeBSD, WASM, Ubuntu Touch); click on any entry in the list on\nthe right (topmost = most recent), then scroll down to the Artifacts section.\nNote that this only works if you are logged in to GitHub.\n\nCompiling\n---------\n\n<sub>Tip: You may take inspiration from the [workflow files](.github/workflows).</sub>\n\n### Requirements\n\nTo build SuperTux from source, you need to have a number of tools and\nlibraries installed. Note that most of these things should already be\navailable prepackaged and optimized for your distribution, it is\nrecommended that you check your distribution first before downloading\nfrom the websites. You can also check\n<https://github.com/SuperTux/wiki/blob/master/Building-SuperTux.md> for up-to-date\nbuild instructions for a variety of different platforms and\ndistributions.\n\n* General development tools:\n  - C++ compiler (choose one of the two options below):\n    + [gcc compiler suite](http://gcc.gnu.org) version 3.2 or newer (including g++)\n    + [LLVM compiler](http://llvm.org/) (you probably want the clang frontend too)\n  - [GNU Binutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/binutils) (or the BSD/OS X equivalent)\n  - a shell and common POSIX command line tools\n  - **Note:** To get these tools, you can install `build-essential` on Debian-based distros,\n    `base-devel` on Arch-based distros and the Xcode Command Line tools on OS X.\n* [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 3.1 or later: most package managers ship this as `cmake`\n* OpenGL headers and libraries: OpenGL libraries and headers are\n  specific to your graphics card. Make sure that you have hardware\n  accelerated OpenGL drivers installed. Software renderers like Mesa\n  will make SuperTux unplayable slow.\n* [SDL2](http://www.libsdl.org) (2.0.1 or later)\n* [SDL2_image](http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image) (2.0.0 or later)\n* [OpenAL](http://www.openal.org): (1.0 or later)\n* C++ OpenGL library (choose one of the two options below):\n  - [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) or\n  - [glbinding](https://github.com/hpicgs/glbinding)\n* [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/): for Add-on downloads\n* [libogg and libvorbis](https://www.xiph.org/)\n* [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/)\n* [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)\n* [ZLib](https://www.zlib.net/)\n* [libraqm](https://github.com/HOST-Oman/libraqm): optional, but needed\n  to display Arabic\n\n**Note I:** for any of the above listed libraries (OpenGL, SDL2, SDL2_image,\nOpenAL, GLEW/glbinding, cURL, libogg and libvorbis), you should\nalso have development headers installed. Debian-based distributions have `-devel`\npackages containing the mentioned headers, on Arch Linux these should be included\nin the library package.\n\n**Note II:** We tried to write our code clean, portable and platform neutral,\nso it should be possible to compile it on a wide range of platforms and also\nwith other compilers than gcc or clang. We use GitHub Actions\nto test commits and pull requests in our repository, but unfortunately it's not\nalways possible to test the code in very exotic setups. However, feel free to\nreport issues to our bug tracker on GitHub.\n\n**Note III (regarding glbinding):** To use glbinding instead of GLEW, call `cmake`\nwith the flag -DGLBINDING_ENABLED=ON\n\nFor ease of use, here are some installation lines for some Linux distributions:\n\n- Ubuntu 18.04/20.04:\n  ```\n  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y cmake build-essential libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libfreetype6-dev libraqm-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libglew-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libglm-dev zlib1g-dev\n  ```\n\n- ArchLinux (using sudo, as of August 28th 2024)\n  ```\n  sudo pacman -S cmake base-devel libogg libvorbis openal sdl2 sdl2_image freetype2 libraqm curl openssl glew harfbuzz fribidi glm zlib\n  ```\n\n### Linux/UNIX using CMake\n\nSuperTux uses CMake to generate a set of Makefiles for the build\nprocess. To generate these Makefiles and build SuperTux, perform the\nfollowing steps:\n\n1. `cd` to the directory where you unpacked the SuperTux source\n   archive, i.e. to the directory containing `src` and `data`.\n\n2. If you cloned this Supertux repo using git run `git submodule\n   update --init --recursive` to fetch/update squirrel, tinygettext,\n   physfs, and some other modules.\n   (If you got this version of Supertux from a tarball (.tar), squirrel\n   and tinygettext are already in the tarball.)\n\n3. Create and change to a new, empty build directory by running `mkdir\n   build`, `cd build`.\n\n4. Run `cmake ..` to create the Makefiles needed to build SuperTux\n   with standard options. If you are missing any libraries needed to\n   build SuperTux, install those first, then try running CMake again.\n   See below for instructions on how to change to standard options.\n\n5. Type `make` to start the build process.\n\n6. Type `make install` to install the programs and any data files and\n   documentation. (You should be a root user on Linux systems. You can\n   become a root user with the `su` command or by using `sudo make\n   install`) Note that there is no uninstall target, so you might wish\n   to create a package or other system-specific installation instead.\n\n7. The game should work now and you can remove the source directory.\n\nYou can customize the build process by setting additional options for\nCMake. The easiest way to do this is to use run `ccmake ..` instead of\n`cmake ..` to bring up the curses-based user interface of CMake.\nSelect an option using the arrow keys, change the selected option by\npressing the Enter key, then hit the `c` (repeatedly, if necessary) to\napply your changes and bring up new options resulting from your newly\nset ones. When you are done, press the `g` key to generate a new set\nof Makefiles and exit.\n\nAlternatively, you can pass options to `cmake ..` via the command\nline. Some common command line switches are:\n\n- `-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=ON`\n  : Generates Makefiles that print all commands prior to executing them.\n\n- `-Dxxx_LIBRARY=/path/to/library.so -Dxxx_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/headerfiles`\n  : Manually specify the installation directory of a library.\n\n- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG`\n  : Enables debug mode and compiles extra debug symbols into the SuperTux\n  executable. This is useful when sending in bug reports to the\n  developers.\n\n- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE`\n  : Enables release mode and compiles some sanity checks out of the build.\n\n- `-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=cc`, `-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=cpp`\n  : Changes which compiler to use. Options are also available for the linker,\n    but using this option is less common.\n\n- `-DENABLE_OPENGL=ON`, `-DENABLE_OPENGLES2=ON`\n  : The former controls whether to compile in OpenGL support (else the game\n  will use the SDL renderer), the latter controls supporting OpenGL ES 2.\n\n- `-DBUILD_TESTS=ON`\n  : Enables compiling the test suite. To run the test suite, run\n  \"test_supertux2\" after compiling SuperTux. Requires installing\n  [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest) as an additional\n  dependency.\n\n- `-DBUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON`\n  : Enables building documentation. Requires downloading and installing\n  [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) as an additional dependency.\n  You may build documentation after building SuperTux by running\n  \"doxygen docs/Doxyfile\" from the build directory, and by opening\n  \"docs/doxygen/html/index.html\".\n\n- `-DENABLE_DISCORD=ON`\n  : Enables compiling the Discord integration in SuperTux. You may re-disable\n  the integration later by replacing \"ON\" with \"OFF\".\n\n- `-DVCPKG_BUILD=ON`\n  : Used if using vcpkg for dependencies. If you are using this, don't forget\n  `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` and\n  `-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=your-triplet` if necessary.\n\n- `-DWARNINGS=ON`\n  : Enable all warnings. The CI enables this option, so it might be useful to\n  keep this option activated during development.\n\n- `-DWERROR=ON`\n  : Treat all warnings as errors. The CI enables this option, so it might be\n  useful to enable this option and to recompile before opening a pull request.\n\n\n#### Notes for GIT users\n\nSuperTux does not need to be installed on the system;\nyou can run it from its own directory.\n\nIf `ccache` is installed and working,\nit can help to significantly reduce the (re)compilation time,\ne.g. when doing a git bisect with many checkouts.\nFurthermore, it is possible to reduce the optimization level to O1,\nwhich may reduce compilation times:\n```\ncmake .. -DWARNINGS=ON -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=\"-O1\"\n```\n\nA general way to reduce compilation time is running `make` with multiple\nthreads:\n```\nmake -j $(nproc || sysctl -n hw.ncpu || echo 2)\n```\n\n\n### Windows using CMake and Visual Studio\n\n**Note: SuperTux is currently not compilable with MinGW.**\n\nTo build SuperTux on Windows with Visual Studio, you will need:\n- An IDE of your choice (Optional, but Git will need you to select one when installing)\n- Visual Studio Community (or any edition). SuperTux is tested with Visual Studio 16 (2019).\n- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)\n- [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg)\n- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)\n\nOnce all of these are installed; you may install dependencies with vcpkg. In any CLI, from the vcpkg folder, run:\n```\n./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat -disableMetrics\n./vcpkg integrate install\n./vcpkg install --triplet=x64-windows gtest curl freetype glew libogg libraqm libvorbis openal-soft sdl2 sdl2-image[libjpeg-turbo] glm zlib\n```\n\n**Note:** If you wish to produce 32-bit builds, replace `--triplet=x64-windows` with `--triplet=x86-windows`.\n\nOnce dependencies are installed:\n\n1. Unpack the SuperTux source pack or get the source with git (`git clone --recursive https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux.git`).\n\n2. Create a new, empty `build` folder.\n\n3. Open a console window and navigate to the `build` directory.\n\n5. Run `cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DVCPKG_BUILD=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/PATH/TO/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows`.\n\n    **Make sure to change the path to vcpkg to the actual path to vcpkg on your system!**\n\n    Options:\n    - `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` creates a Release build, which does not contain debug information and runs faster. You may also produce `Debug` builds, but these run significantly slower. Other options may be available, such as `RelWithDebInfo` and `MinSizeRel`, but they are not tested. [More info](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html)\n    - `-DVCPKG_BUILD=ON` tells SuperTux to use vcpkg to find dependencies.\n    - `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:/PATH/TO/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake` tells CMake to use the vcpkg toolchain to load dependencies. **Make sure to change the path to the actual path to vcpkg on your system!**\n    - `-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows` tells vcpkg to use 64-bit dependencies for Windows. If you are compiling 32-bit executables, replace \"x64\" with \"x86\".\n    - Optionally, you may add `-G \"Visual Studio 16 2019\"` to force a certain version of Visual Studio if multiple are installed on your system.\n\n    For more CMake options, look at end of the Linux/UNIX build section.\n\n5. You may now build SuperTux either by opening the new Visual Studio solution \"SUPERTUX.sln\" in the \"build\" directory, or by running `cmake --build . --config Release` instead. (If you prefer building a debug build, change \"Release\" to \"Debug\". Make sure you use the same option as when calling CMake!)\n\n6. Move the file \"run_supertux.bat\" from the \"build\" folder to the \"build/Release\" (or \"build/Debug\") folder.\n\n7. Now you can run SuperTux using the \"run_supertux.bat\" file. If you run this file from the command line, note that you need to `cd` in the Release/Debug folder beforehand.\n\n### Android using SDL2\n\nThis port exists thanks to **[Pelya](https://github.com/pelya)**!\n\nYou will need to install Android Studio with the command-line tools and with\nNDK **version 23** (other versions won't work). You will also need git.\n\nIt is recommended to run these commands on Ubuntu 20.04.\n\nNote that the commands which require a certain wordking directory will have the\nassumed initial directory at the top of hte code block; if you follow these\ninstructions step by step, you should have the assumed Current Working\nDirectory at each step.\n\n1. Unpack the source archive or clone the repository recursively using git.\n\n```\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/supertux/supertux\n```\n\n2. Inside the repository, unpack\n[Pelya's cross-compilation suite](https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius) on\ncommit `532acc9192`. Rename the folder \"build.android\" and place it at the root\nof the SuperTux repository.\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = root of the SuperTux source folder\n# Use `cd supertux` if you ran the commands from the preceeding step verbatim\n\ngit clone --depth=100 https://github.com/pelya/commandergenius.git build.android\ngit -C build.android checkout 532acc9192\n\n# You can also download it from GitHub, but make sure you download it from\n# commit 532acc9192!\n```\n\n3. Clone the submodules that SuperTux needs: Iconv, SDL2, SDL2_image,\nSDL2_mixer and SDL2_ttf.\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = root of the SuperTux source folder\ncd build.android\n\ngit submodule update --init --recursive --depth=1 \\\n          project/jni/iconv/src                   \\\n          project/jni/sdl2 project/jni/sdl2_image \\\n          project/jni/sdl2_mixer project/jni/sdl2_ttf\n```\n\n4. Symlink the project inside the build directory.\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = build.android\ncd ..\n\nrm -rf build.android/project/jni/application/supertux/supertux\nln -s `pwd` build.android/project/jni/application/supertux/supertux\nln -s supertux build.android/project/jni/application/src\n```\n\n5. Optionally, limit the build to a certain set of architectures.\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = root of the SuperTux source folder\n\n# Possible options: armeabi-v7a arm64-v8a x86 x86_64\n# You may specify multiple; if so, separate each architecture with a space.\nsed -i \"s/MultiABI=.*/MultiABI='armeabi-v7a arm64-v8a x86 x86_64'/g\" \\\n          build.android/project/jni/application/supertux/AndroidAppSettings.cfg\n\n# You can also edit that file manually using any text editor.\n```\n\n6. Add your $ANDROID_NDK_HOME to your PATH, then configure SuperTux.\n(Tip: Your NDK home is probably `$HOME/Android/Sdk/ndk/[version 23]`, if it is\nnot already set.)\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = root of the SuperTux source folder\n\nexport PATH=$ANDROID_NDK_LATEST_HOME:$PATH\ncd build.android\n./changeAppSettings.sh\n```\n\n7. Accept the Android Studio Licenses. You may either open the\n`build.android/project` folder in Android Studio, although it might get laggy;\nyou can also accept licenses from the CLI.\n\n```\n# It is recommended to read the licenses, but if you've already read them, you\n# can execute `sudo -v` to enable sudo priviledges and add `yes | ` in front of\n# the next line.\nsudo $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses\n```\n\n8. Assemble a release build. <sub>TODO: Check for debug builds</sub>\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = build.android\ncd project\n\n./gradlew assembleRelease\n```\n\n9. Accept the licenses again, but this time by specifying the project as root.\n\n```\n# Similarly as step #7, you can prepend `yes | ` to accept all licenses\nsudo $ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/cmdline-tools/latest/bin/sdkmanager --licenses \\\n          --sdk_root=`pwd`\n```\n\n10. Generate a debug key, if you don't have one already.\n\n```\nmkdir -p ~/.android\nkeytool -genkey -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android \\\n          -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 \\\n          -validity 10000 \\\n          -dname \"CN=Debug, OU=Debug, O=Debug, L=Debug, ST=Debug, C=Debug\"\n```\n\n11. Setup the project properties. <sub>TODO: What do these do and what value can\nthey take?</sub>\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = build.android/project\n\necho \"sdk.dir=$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT\" > local.properties\necho \"proguard.config=proguard.cfg;proguard-local.cfg\" >> local.properties\n```\n\n12. Build SuperTux by running the `build.sh` script in the build.android folder.\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = build.android/project\ncd ..\n\nexport PATH=$ANDROID_NDK_HOME:$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/build-tools/31.0.0:$PATH\n./build.sh\n```\n\n13. To generate a .aab, run `./gradlew bundleReleaseWithDebugInfo` from the\nproject folder. The file will be located, from `build.android/project`, at\n`app/build/outputs/bundle/releaseWithDebugInfo/app-releaseWithDebugInfo.aab`.\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = build.android\n\ncd project\n./gradlew bundleReleaseWithDebugInfo\n```\n\n14. To generate a .apk, run `./create-apk-with-data.sh` from the\n`build.android/project/jni/application/supertux` folder. The file will be\nlocated at `build.android/SuperTux-with-data.apk`.\n\n```\n# Assuming CWD = build.android/project\n\ncd jni/application/supertux\n./create-apk-with-data.sh\n```\n\n### WASM using Emscripten\n\nTo compile SuperTux to host on the web, you will need [the Emscripten\nSDK](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) and\n[vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg), in addition to the\n[general development tools](#requirements). Note that you only need the\n*General development tools*; you do not need any library, as those are managed\nwith Vcpkg.\n\nNote that you must install and activate the version **1.40.1** of the Emscripten\ntoolchain; newer versions are known not to work properly.\n\n0. Make sure you have all the submodules if you are using Git:\n```\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\n1. Install [Emscripten](emscripten.org):\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git\ncd emsdk\n./emsdk install latest\n./emsdk activate latest\nsource ./emsdk_env.sh\n```\n\n2. Run CMake using Emscripten's wrapper:\n```\n# Make sure you ran `source /path/to/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh` if you opened a new terminal since last step!\nemcmake cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\n```\n\n3. Copy data files to the build folder, as Emscripten will package them to make\nthem usable from WASM:\n```\nrsync -aP ../data/ data/\n```\n\n4. Build SuperTux:\n```\nemmake make -j$(nproc || sysctl -n hw.ncpu || echo 2)\n```\n\n5. Replace the Emscripten HTML template with SuperTux's custom container:\n```\ncp template.html supertux2.html\n```\nYou may skip the step above you intend to directly open the `template.html` file;\nnote that SuperTux won't work if it is not located in the custom template, as it\nrequires some custom JavaScript functions to work properly.\n\n6. Run the Emscripten webserver:\n```\nemrun supertux2.html\n```\n\nYou can now play SuperTux by opening `http://localhost:6931/supertux2.html` in\nyour browser.\n\nNote that if you intend to run SuperTux on a public web server, you must set\n[two headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements)\nas a web security requirement.\n\n### Ubuntu Touch using Clickable\n\nTo compile for Ubuntu Touch phones, you will need an Ubuntu desktop, as well as\n[Clickable](https://clickable-ut.dev/en/latest/install.html). You will not\nneed any other development library, as those are already managed by Clickable.\n\nFirst, make sure you have all the submodules:\n```\ngit submodule update --init --recursive\n```\n\nThen, enable developer mode on your phone, if it isn't enabled already.\n\nThen:\n- To install SuperTux on your phone, plug your phone to your computer and run:\n  ```\n  clickable\n  ```\n  This will by default build with the SDL renderer only; if you wish to use the\n  OpenGL renderer, you may specify a different build file with `--config` to\n  build with one of the files located at `mk/clickable/build-with-*.json`:\n  ```\n  clickable --config mk/clickable/build-with-glew.json\n  ```\n\n- To run SuperTux directly on your computer:\n  ```\n  clickable desktop --config mk/clickable/clickable.json\n  ```\n\n- To build SuperTux without running it:\n  ```\n  clickable build --config mk/clickable/clickable.json\n  ```\n  You may specify an architecture using the `--arch ARCH` flag. Clickable\n  currently supports `amd64`, `arm64` and `armhf`.\n"

          "content": "                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14.

Suddenly, a creature jumped from behind an ice bush, there\nwas a flash, and Tux fell asleep!\n\nWhen Tux wakes up, he finds that Penny is missing. Where she lay\nbefore now lies a letter:\n>Tux, my arch enemy! I have captured your beautiful Penny and have\n>taken her to my fortress. The path to my fortress is littered with my\n>minions. Give up on the thought of trying to reclaim her, you haven't\n>got a chance!\n>\n>-Nolok\n\nTux looks and sees Nolok's fortress in the distance. Determined to\nsave his beloved Penny, he begins his journey.\n\n## Installation\n\nFor major platforms, stable releases are built and available for download from\n[supertux.org](https://www.supertux.org/download.html) or alternatively directly\nfrom [GitHub](https://github.com/SuperTux/supertux/releases). You should be able\nto install these using default tools provided by your platform. On macOS, when\nGatekeeper is enabled (default) it will refuse to open SuperTux. This is due to\nthe lack of a signature on the application. If you wish to open SuperTux anyway\nwithout disabling the Gatekeeper feature entirely, you can open the application\nfrom the context menu (control click on the icon). macOS will then remember your\nchoice the next time.\n\n## Documentation\n\nImportant documentation for SuperTux is contained in multiple files.\nPlease see them:\n\n* `INSTALL.md` - Requirements, compiling and installing.\n* `README.md` - This file\n* `NEWS.md` - Changes since the previous versions of SuperTux.\n* `LICENSE.txt` - The GNU General Public License, under whose terms SuperTux is\nlicensed. (Most of the data subdirectory is also licensed under\nCC-by-SA)\n* `data/credits.stxt` - Credits for people that contributed to the creation of\nSuperTux. (You can view these in the game menu as well.)\n\n\n## Playing the game\n\nBoth keyboards and joysticks/gamepads are supported. You can change\nthe controls via the Options menu. Basically, the only keys you will\nneed to use in-game are to do the following actions: jump, duck,\nright, left, action and 'P' to pause/unpause the game. There isn't much\nto tell about the first few, but the \"action\" key allows you to pick\nup objects and use any powerup you got. For instance, with the fire\nflower, you can shoot fireballs, or with the ice flower fire ice pellets.\n\nOther useful keys include the Esc key, which is used to go to the menu\nor to go up a level in the menu. The menu can be navigated using the\narrow keys or the mouse.\n\nIn the worldmap, the arrow keys are used to navigate and Enter to\nenter the current level.\n\n## Community\n\nIn case you need help, feel free to reach out using the following means:\n\n* **IRC:** [#supertux](ircs://irc.libera.chat/#supertux) on\n  [Libera Chat](https://libera.chat) hosts most of the discussions between\n  developers. Also, real-time support can be provided here. If you don't know\n  how to use an IRC client, you access the channel using a web-based\n  [client](https://kiwiirc.com/nextclient/irc.libera.chat:+6697/?nick=Guest?#supertux).\n  Please stay around after asking questions, otherwise you will be disconnected\n  and might miss potential answers.\n* **Matrix:** [#supertux:matrix.org](https://matrix.to/#/#supertux:matrix.org)\n  is bridged to our IRC room.\n* **[Forum](https://groups.f-hub.org/g/8AKEaTgZ):** The SuperTux\n  community is also active on the forum, the discussions range from feature\n  proposals to support questions. In particular, most community-contributed\n  add-ons are published there, so this is worth checking.\n* **Mailing Lists:** The\n  [supertux-devel](http://lists.lethargik.org/listinfo.cgi/supertux-devel-lethargik.org)\n  mailing list is dead. Here is the [archive](https://github.com/supertux-community/supertux-devel-maillist).\n* **Social Media:** Mostly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/supertux_team) at\n  the moment.\n* **Discord:** Also, you can join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/AcvtHWz) to get in touch with us.\n\n## Development status\n\nAs of now, with the release of SuperTux 0.6.3 (December 2021), the Forest World is almost\nfinished, since the ghost forest section has been included. However, some levels, especially\nthe Ghostree Level, are considered to be placeholders, because for the next version (0.7.0) a\ngreat overhaul is planned with new features like reworked boss fights, graphics, and worlds.\nIf you have some Constructive Feedback, Contributions or ideas to share, don't hesitate\nto contact us with one of the possibilities given above.\n"
