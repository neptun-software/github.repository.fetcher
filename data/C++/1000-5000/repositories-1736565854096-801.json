          "content": "This program allows one to \"record\" your desktop, or even stream it!\r\n\r\nIt includes some helper \"record your screen capture/stream it\" and setup utilities.\r\nIt also includes a helper (virtual-audio-capturer) to record \"what you hear/see on your desktop\" for vista+ system.\r\n\r\n  In order to use those you'll want/need the java JRE installed on your system first.  Install from java.com if you don't have it installed.\r\n\r\nIt also includes a free, general purpose, open source directshow desktop/screen source capture filter.\r\n\r\nYou can use this with any (directshow compatible) program to capture or stream, like VLC, etc.\r\n\r\nSee also the ChangeLog.txt file for a list of changes in latest versions.\r\n\r\n== Installation ==\r\n\r\nDownload installer and run, from \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free/releases\r\n  \t\r\n== Audio capture ==\r\n\r\nIt also includes a directshow source capture filter device for recording \"what you hear\" in windows 7/vista--any sound card!\r\n  see https://github.com/rdp/virtual-audio-capture-grabber-device for info/troubleshooting of that audio capture device.\r\n\r\n== Usage ==\r\n\r\nUse some helper programs provided in \r\n Start menu -> Programs -> Screen Capture Recorder -> record desktp[/broadcast/XXX\r\n\r\nOr use any 3rd party program that can read from a Directshow Capture Device (ex: VLC/FFmpeg).\r\n\r\nVLC example: http://betterlogic.com/roger/2010/07/how-to-use-vlc-as-a-free-open-source-alternative-to-playon-tv\r\n\r\nffmpeg example:\r\n\r\n  $ ffplay -f dshow -i video=\"screen-capture-recorder\"\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  $ ffmpeg -f dshow  -i video=\"screen-capture-recorder\"  -r 20 -t 10 screen-capture.mp4 # -t 10 for 10 seconds recording\r\n\r\nor combine it with recording \"what you hear\" audio [vista/windows 7] (using ffmpeg in this example):\r\n\r\n  $ ffmpeg -f dshow -i audio=\"virtual-audio-capturer\":video=\"screen-capture-recorder\" yo.mp4\r\n  \r\nNote also that ffmpeg has a built in \"gdigrab\" input option you could use instead of screen capture recorder, as well.\r\n\r\nThe audio device name can be any other dshow audio devices, as well.\r\n\r\nAvisynth also works with it.  Add it to a filter graph using graphedit, then use DirectShowSource as your \r\ninput source with that graphedit filename specified.\r\n\r\ngstreamer works, as well, ex:\r\n\r\n  $ gst-launch.exe dshowvideosrc device-name=screen-capture-recorder ! ffmpegcolorspace ! directdrawsink\r\n\r\nI've even had Skype accidentally use it, thinking it was my webcam.\r\nLet me know if you want an easier way made for it for anything.\r\n\r\n== Configuration ==\r\n\r\nBy default, it captures the \"full screen\" of the main desktop monitor (all windows, overlapping, from there, with aero if vista+, without transparent windows if non aero).\r\n\r\nTo configure it differently, run the provided \"configuration setup utilities/shortcuts\" or \r\nadjust registry settings before starting a run (advanced users only):\r\n\r\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\screen-capture-recorder\r\n\r\nwith DWORD keys respected of start_XXX etc ... \r\n(see the included file {installdir}\\configuration_setup_utility\\setup_screen_tracker_params.rb for the full list of registry key values\r\navailable, or see https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free/blob/master/configuration_setup_utility/setup_screen_tracker_params.rb#L9 )\r\n  \r\nex: see configuration_setup_utility\\incoming.reg file (though NB that those values are in hex, so editing that file is a bit tedious--\r\nI always just use regedit or the accompanying script utilities and don't edit it by hand).  \r\n\r\nTo \"reset\" a value delete its key.\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\ncreate a file named this: %APPDATA%\\ScreenCaptureRecorder.ini\r\n\r\nwith contents like this, all go under a section \"all_settings\"\r\n\r\n[all_settings]\r\nyour_first_setting=1\r\nyour_second_setting=100\r\n...\r\n\r\nBy default it reads the registry first, if it doesn't find something set there, it'll look in the .ini file.\r\n\r\n== Trouble shooting ==\r\n\r\n=== It's too slow! (ex: 15 fps)\r\n\r\nRun the \"benchmark your capture speed\" utility to see how slow your system can capture.\r\n\r\nIf you're on vista+, turn off aero display manager (esp. if you have dual monitors, this can help).\r\n    http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/disable-aero-on-windows-vista\r\n    \r\nIt captures much more quickly if aero is turned off (as in with aero, capturing a 650x976 window takes 50ms, without aero, 3ms.\r\n\r\nThe rest of a single screenshot capture takes about 7ms (sum 10ms without aero), so you can see the relative cost it adds [!].\r\n\r\nThere's also a registry setting to have it turned off \"automatically\".\r\n\r\nI have only been able to get max 15 fps when capturing aero [ping me if you want me to look into improving this somewhat, I have some ideas...].\r\n\r\n=== It's too slow! (ex: 50 fps)\r\n\r\nDisabling or enabling \"hardware acceleration\" for the desktop might help, too, or setting it to one stop above none\r\n  \r\nTry switching from 32 to 24 bit or 16 bit input (from this), and/or switching your desktop depth itself--or both! fastest is 16 bit display with capture in 16 bit mode--400 fps whoa!).  \r\n\r\n=== It starts making the computer sluggish after awhile.\r\n\r\nMake sure you have enough RAM available (virtualbox is known to hog some without telling you).  Also disable aero if possible.\r\n\r\nNote that if your output is, say, going to be 10 fps \"actually used\" in the end, ex:\r\n$ ffmpeg -f dshow -i video=video-capture-recorder -r 10 yo.mp4 -r 10 # output file is only 10 fps\r\n\r\nThen to save cpu, a \"good\" application will also instruct the \"source fps\" to be 10 fps\r\n$ ffmpeg -framerate 10 -f dshow -i video=video-capture-recorder -r 10 yo.mp4 # input and output are set to 10\r\n\r\nfor an exaplantion of why \"framerate\" and not \"-r\" here, see https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/DirectShow#Specifyinginputframerate\r\n\r\nthat they pass on to this filter, and everybody's in 10 fps and hopefully happy, and cpu is saved.\r\nex: vlc.exe dshow:// ... :dshow-fps=10\r\nvlc then passes this in to SetFormat after negotiation, and the device accepts it, and feeds you at 10 fps.\r\n\r\nSome \"bad\" directshow applications don't pass this parameter in.  Most can.\r\nSo there may be a case where it is wasting cpu somehow, by capturing too many or the like.\r\nSo for those programs, you'll want to set the max fps parameter, which will limit its\r\ncapture frequency.\r\n\r\nSetting max fps to greater than 30 also allows you to get fps greater than 30 (the default max).  It \"enables\" them,\r\nby giving it a higher max default.  I didn't think people would normally care/want them so there you have.\r\n\r\n==== Skype users\r\n\r\nNB that to use it as an input camera skype, you need to specify that it is a reasonably small capture, see\r\nhttp://betterlogic.com/roger/2012/04/skype-directshow-device-just-shows-circles-for-the-preview-capture/\r\n\r\n=== I can't capture full screen [like starcraft type windows].\r\n\r\nKnown limitation, try this thread: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/roger-projects/uxmGV_vW4iY [or pay me a bit of money and I'll create a front end to the excellent OBS project to provide this functionality]\r\n\r\n== Feedback/Question ==\r\n\r\nOther feedback/problems/questions ping me roger-projects@googlegroups.com or browse the mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/roger-projects\r\nOr submit to our uservoice: http://rdp.uservoice.com\r\n\r\n==  Redistribution ==\r\n\r\nYou can redistribute this.  See file LICENSE.TXT.\r\nIf you do, you may just need to distribute for instance the file PushDesktop.dll\r\nIf you do, you have to register this device, via registering its dll \r\n(like $ regsvr32 PushDesktop.dll--may require administrator rights) as part of your install.\r\nAlso note that end users also need the MSVC 2010 redistributable previously installed (or you have to make it available \r\nin the same dir as your exe) for the dll to work/install, in case end users don't have it installed).\r\nIf you change it and redistribute it, you may want to change the GUID's, so that it won't clash if\r\nsomebody also installs this software.\r\nSee also https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free/issues/17\r\n\r\n== Code/Future work/Attributions ==\r\n\r\nThe code is gently based on/lifted from (\"inspired by\") this from the Windows 7.1 SDK\r\n  ....\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.1\\Samples\\multimedia\\directshow\\filters\\pushsource as well as some other dshow demos around the 'net (tmhare virtual capture).\r\n  so you'll probably want to install the Windows SDK before messing around with the source code.\r\n  To hack on the code, build the windows SDK directshow baseclasses, then open source_code/*.vcxproj in visual studio 2010\r\n  express.  This is meant to provide a \"directshow filter\" you can use in your graph, not a demo of how to do graphs.\r\n  It outputs a .dll file that you \"register\" via (in administrator console) \r\n  $ regsvr32 XXX.dll (and unregister when you're done with regsvr32 /u XXX.dll)\r\n  there are also some scripts to set the registry values (written in ruby/jruby currently for the GUI) but you don't\r\n  have to adjust those to mess with the filter itself.\r\n\r\nI can add features upon reasonable demand.\r\n\r\nBasically you want a feature, ping me, you got it.\r\n\r\nTo build it locally, install VS Express 2010, install Microsoft SDK, open up your equivalent of \r\n\\Program Files\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows\\v7.1\\Samples\\multimedia\\directshow\\baseclasses\\baseclasses.sln\r\nbuild it (debug)\r\nnow add to your local build (project properties, from the source_code\\pushdesktop.sln) adjust the VC++ Directories (Include/Library) \r\nto point to your various baseclass directories.\r\n\r\n== More Attributions ==\r\n\r\nThe included speed test utility was originally from http://stereopsis.com/blttest\r\n(bitblt is quite hardware dependent, so I'm told, so it's good to be able to test its speed).\r\n\r\nFFmpeg binaries are also included, see their site for licensing details/source: http://ffmpeg.org\r\n\r\n== Related ==\r\n\r\nhttp://obsproject.com is open source, doesn't use FFmpeg but might work for you.  May even capture DirectX woot.\r\nhttp://www.ffsplit.com is not open source, but does capture/stream desktop using FFmpeg.\r\nhttp://camstudio.org is open source and free, but requires you to just use your local codecs installed in your windows\r\n  system, and has some usability issues, which is why I even started this project in the first place :)\r\n"
