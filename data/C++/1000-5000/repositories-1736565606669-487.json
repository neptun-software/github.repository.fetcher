Define flags for packed and deprecated fields. (Issue #138.)\n\n  [ Dave Benson ]\n  * Treat a \"length-prefixed\" wire-type message for a repeated field as\n    packed-repeated whenever it makes sense (for all types other than\n    messages, strings, and bytes).\n\n  * Switch to New BSD license.\n\n  * Add protobuf_c_message_check().\n\n  * Compile error in packing 64-bit versions on some platforms\n    (srobbins99: Issue #68 Comment 1).\n\n  * Fix for memory error if the required-field check fails. See Issue #63\n    for demo (w/ nice test case by dror.harari).\n\n  * Add PROTOBUF_C_{MAJOR,MINOR} for compile-time checks and\n    protobuf_c_{major,minor} for checks about the running library\n    (Issue #53).\n\n  * Use a small constant-size hash-table instead of alloca() for detecting\n    required fields, and it also prevents us from using too much stack, etc.\n    (Related to Issue #60, #79).\n\n  * Add a macro to ensure enums are the size of ints (Issue #69).\n\n  [ Ilya Lipnitskiy ]\n  * Travis-CI integration.\n\n  * Add source .proto filename to generated files.\n\n  * Add protobuf-c version to protoc-c --version output (Issue #52).\n\n  * For embedded submessage fields, merge multiple instances of the same\n    field, per the protobuf documentation (Issue #91).\n\n  * Don't print unpack errors by default.\n\n  * Optionally allow running the test suite under valgrind with ./configure\n    --enable-valgrind-tests. (Based on valgrind-tests.m4 from gnulib.)\n\n  [ Kevin Lyda ]\n  * Autoconf portability fixes.\n\n  * Add doxygen detection and make targets to the build system.\n\n  * Doxygen documentation for the libprotobuf-c public API (Issue #132).\n\n  [ Nick Galbreath ]\n  * Prevent possible overflow on 64-bit systems (Issue #106).\n\n  [ Robert Edmonds ]\n  * Remove CMake (Issue #87).\n\n  * Modernize the build system.\n    - Don't generate any diagnostics when building the build system with\n      modern autotools (Issue #89).\n\n    - Use the PKG_CHECK_MODULES macro to locate protobuf.\n\n    - Use the AC_C_BIGENDIAN macro to detect endianness, rather than custom\n      code.\n\n    - Use the automake silent-rules option so the build output is actually\n      readable.\n\n    - Generate our own pkg-config .pc files.\n\n  * Reorganize the source tree. This affects the public protobuf-c header\n    path, which is now <protobuf-c/protobuf-c.h>. A compatibility symlink from\n    <google/protobuf-c/> to <protobuf-c/> has been installed so that existing\n    code will continue to compile. New code should at some point begin using\n    the new include path, i.e., \"#include <protobuf-c/protobuf-c.h>\" rather\n    than \"#include <google/protobuf-c/protobuf-c.h>\".\n\n  * The RPC code has been split out into a separate project, protobuf-c-rpc.\n\n  * Fix a potential use of an unitialized value in protobuf_c_message_unpack()\n    and several memory leaks in protoc-c, discovered by a commercial static code\n    analysis tool.\n\n  * Bump the libprotobuf-c SONAME.\n\n  * Begin versioning the library's symbols. (Based on ld-version-script.m4\n    from gnulib.)\n\n  * Preserve case in enum value names generated by protoc-c (Issue #129).\n    Reported by Oleg Efimov.\n\n  * Add library functions protobuf_c_version() and protobuf_c_version_string()\n    for retrieving the version of the compiled library, and header macros\n    PROTOBUF_C_VERSION and PROTOBUF_C_VERSION_STRING for retrieving the\n    version of the header file. This replaces the interfaces for retrieving\n    the protobuf-c version numbers in Issue #53.\n\n  * Add a version guard that ensures that the output of protoc-c is only\n    compiled against a protobuf-c header file from the exact same protobuf-c\n    release.\n\n  * Add a --enable-code-coverage option to configure, which enables a\n    \"make check-code-coverage\" build target. This generates a code coverage\n    report and requires the lcov tool to be installed.\n\n  * Remove the old DocBook documentation in doc/c-code-generator.{html,xml}.\n    Relevant material has been updated and incorporated into the Doxygen\n    documentation in the protobuf-c header file.\n\n  * Remove the protobuf_c_default_allocator and protobuf_c_system_allocator\n    global variables from the exported library interface. All exported library\n    functions that need to perform dynamic memory allocation receive a\n    user-provided ProtobufCAllocator* parameter. If this parameter is NULL,\n    the system's default memory allocator will be used.\n\n    Client code that previously passed \"&protobuf_c_system_allocator\" to\n    protobuf-c library functions taking a ProtobufCAllocator* argument should\n    be updated to pass \"NULL\" instead.\n\n    Client code that previously overrode protobuf_c_default_allocator with\n    custom allocation functions and passed NULL as the ProtobufCAllocator*\n    argument to protobuf-c library functions should be updated to instead\n    enclose the custom allocation functions in a ProtobufCAllocator struct and\n    pass this object to protobuf-c library functions taking a\n    ProtobufCAllocator* parameter.\n\n  * Update copyright and license statements throughout. The original\n    protobuf code released by Google was relicensed from Apache-2.0 to\n    BSD-3-Clause. Dave Benson also converted his license from BSD-3-Clause\n    to BSD-2-Clause.\n\n  [ Tomasz Wasilczyk ]\n  * Don't export protobuf_c_message_init_generic() as an external symbol.\n\n  * Don't use C++ style comments in C code.\n\n  * Fix -Wcast-align warnings when compiled with clang.\n\nprotobuf-c (0.15)\n      - make protobuf_c_message_init() into a function (Issue #49, daveb)\n      - Fix for freeing memory after unpacking bytes w/o a default-value.\n        (Andrei Nigmatulin)\n      - minor windows portability issues (use ProtobufC_FD) (Pop Stelian)\n      - --with-endianness={little,big} (Pop Stelian)\n      - bug setting up values of has_idle in public dispatch,\n        make protobuf_c_dispatch_run() use only public members (daveb)\n      - provide cmake support and some Windows compatibility (Nikita Manovich)\n\nprotobuf-c (0.14)\n      - build fix (missing dependency in test directory)\n      - add generation / installation of pkg-config files.

(Andrei Nigmatulin)\n      - hackery to try to avoid touching inttypes.h on windows (Issue #41)\n      - fix for protobuf_c_message_unpack() to issue error if any\n        \"required\" field is missing in input stream.

          "content": "[![Build Status](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/actions) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/badge.png)](https://coveralls.io/r/protobuf-c/protobuf-c)\n\n## Overview\n\nThis is `protobuf-c`, a C implementation of the [Google Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) data serialization format. It includes `libprotobuf-c`, a pure C library that implements protobuf encoding and decoding, and `protoc-c`, a code generator that converts Protocol Buffer `.proto` files to C descriptor code, based on the original `protoc`. `protobuf-c` formerly included an RPC implementation; that code has been split out into the [protobuf-c-rpc](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c-rpc) project.\n\n`protobuf-c` was originally written by Dave Benson and maintained by him through version 0.15 but is now being maintained by a new team. Thanks, Dave!\n\n## Mailing list\n\n`protobuf-c`'s mailing list is hosted on a [Google Groups forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/protobuf-c). Subscribe by sending an email to [protobuf-c+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:protobuf-c+subscribe@googlegroups.com).\n\n## Building\n\n`protobuf-c` requires a C compiler, a C++ compiler, [protobuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf), and `pkg-config` to be installed.\n\n    ./configure && make && make install\n\nIf building from a git checkout, the `autotools` (`autoconf`, `automake`, `libtool`) must also be installed, and the build system must be generated by running the `autogen.sh` script.\n\n    ./autogen.sh && ./configure && make && make install\n\n## Test\n\nIf you want to execute test cases individually, please run the following command after running `./configure` once:\n\n     make check\n\t \n## Documentation\n\nSee the [online Doxygen documentation here](https://protobuf-c.github.io/protobuf-c) or [the Wiki](https://github.com/protobuf-c/protobuf-c/wiki) for a detailed reference. The Doxygen documentation can be built from the source tree by running:\n\n    make html\n\n## Synopsis\n\nUse the `protoc` command to generate `.pb-c.c` and `.pb-c.h` output files from your `.proto` input file. The `--c_out` options instructs `protoc` to use the protobuf-c plugin.\n\n    protoc --c_out=. example.proto\n\nInclude the `.pb-c.h` file from your C source code.\n\n    #include \"example.pb-c.h\"\n\nCompile your C source code together with the `.pb-c.c` file. Add the output of the following command to your compile flags.\n\n    pkg-config --cflags 'libprotobuf-c >= 1.0.0'\n\nLink against the `libprotobuf-c` support library. Add the output of the following command to your link flags.\n\n    pkg-config --libs 'libprotobuf-c >= 1.0.0'\n\nIf using autotools, the `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` macro can be used to detect the presence of `libprotobuf-c`. Add the following line to your `configure.ac` file:\n\n    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([PROTOBUF_C], [libprotobuf-c >= 1.0.0])\n\nThis will place compiler flags in the `PROTOBUF_C_CFLAGS` variable and linker flags in the `PROTOBUF_C_LDFLAGS` variable. Read [more information here](https://autotools.io/pkgconfig/pkg_check_modules.html) about the `PKG_CHECK_MODULES` macro.\n\n## Versioning\n\n`protobuf-c` follows the [Semantic Versioning Specification](http://semver.org/) as of version 1.0.0.\n\nNote that as of version of 1.0.0, the header files generated by the `protoc-c` compiler contain version guards to prevent incompatibilities due to version skew between the `.pb-c.h` files generated by `protoc-c` and the public `protobuf-c.h` include file supplied by the `libprotobuf-c` support library. While we will try not to make changes to `protobuf-c` that will require triggering the version guard often, such as releasing a new major version of `protobuf-c`, this cannot be guaranteed. Thus, it's a good idea to recompile your `.pb-c.c` and `.pb-c.h` files from their source `.proto` files with `protoc-c` as part of your build system, with proper source file dependency tracking, rather than shipping potentially stale `.pb-c.c` and `.pb-c.h` files that may not be compatible with the `libprotobuf-c` headers installed on the system in project artifacts like repositories and release tarballs. (Note that the output of the `protoc-c` code generator is not standalone, as the output of some other tools that generate C code is, such as `flex` and `bison`.)\n\nMajor API/ABI changes may occur between major version releases, by definition. It is not recommended to export the symbols in the code generated by `protoc-c` in a stable library interface, as this will embed the `protobuf-c` ABI into your library's ABI. Nor is it recommended to install generated `.pb-c.h` files into a public header file include path as part of a library API, as this will tie clients of your library's API to particular versions of `libprotobuf-c`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease send patches to the [protobuf-c mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/protobuf-c) or by opening a GitHub pull request.\n\nThe most recently released `protobuf-c` version is kept on the `master` branch, while the `next` branch is used for commits targeted at the next release. Please base patches and pull requests against the `next` branch, not the `master` branch.\n\nCopyright to all contributions are retained by the original author, but must be licensed under the terms of the [BSD-2-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause) license.
