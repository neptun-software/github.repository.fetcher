It has been optimized to achieve high bandwidth on platforms using PCIe, NVLink, NVswitch, as well as networking using InfiniBand Verbs or TCP/IP sockets. NCCL supports an arbitrary number of GPUs installed in a single node or across multiple nodes, and can be used in either single- or multi-process (e.g., MPI) applications.\n\nFor more information on NCCL usage, please refer to the [NCCL documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/sdk/nccl-developer-guide/index.html).\n\n## Build\n\nNote: the official and tested builds of NCCL can be downloaded from: https://developer.nvidia.com/nccl. You can skip the following build steps if you choose to use the official builds.\n\nTo build the library :\n\n```shell\n$ cd nccl\n$ make -j src.build\n```\n\nIf CUDA is not installed in the default /usr/local/cuda path, you can define the CUDA path with :\n\n```shell\n$ make src.build CUDA_HOME=<path to cuda install>\n```\n\nNCCL will be compiled and installed in `build/` unless `BUILDDIR` is set.\n\nBy default, NCCL is compiled for all supported architectures. To accelerate the compilation and reduce the binary size, consider redefining `NVCC_GENCODE` (defined in `makefiles/common.mk`) to only include the architecture of the target platform :\n```shell\n$ make -j src.build NVCC_GENCODE=\"-gencode=arch=compute_70,code=sm_70\"\n```\n\n## Install\n\nTo install NCCL on the system, create a package then install it as root.\n\nDebian/Ubuntu :\n```shell\n$ # Install tools to create debian packages\n$ sudo apt install build-essential devscripts debhelper fakeroot\n$ # Build NCCL deb package\n$ make pkg.debian.build\n$ ls build/pkg/deb/\n```\n\nRedHat/CentOS :\n```shell\n$ # Install tools to create rpm packages\n$ sudo yum install rpm-build rpmdevtools\n$ # Build NCCL rpm package\n$ make pkg.redhat.build\n$ ls build/pkg/rpm/\n```\n\nOS-agnostic tarball :\n```shell\n$ make pkg.txz.build\n$ ls build/pkg/txz/\n```\n\n## Tests\n\nTests for NCCL are maintained separately at https://github.com/nvidia/nccl-tests.\n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl-tests.git\n$ cd nccl-tests\n$ make\n$ ./build/all_reduce_perf -b 8 -e 256M -f 2 -g <ngpus>\n```\n\n## Copyright\n\nAll source code and accompanying documentation is copyright (c) 2015-2020, NVIDIA CORPORATION.
