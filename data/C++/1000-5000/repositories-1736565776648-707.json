This repository will only receive engine compatibility fixes from now.\n\n## Supported Platforms\n- Windows\n- Linux\n\n*Console, Mac and mobile platforms are not tested and supported at the moment. Use the plugin on those platforms with your own risk.*\n\n## Features\n- Fully implemented and optimized in C++. Implementation is based on latest marketplace release (V4) of ALS\n- Complete replication support with low bandwidth usage (Ragdoll replication is in experimental state)\n- Redesigned as plugin\n- Animation blueprint is optimized with new property binding feature\n- Player input is handled with new Enhanced Input Plugin\n- Mantling and debugging features are implemented as separate actor components to reduce total overhead on base character class\n- Improved footstep system with decal & Niagara particle support\n- Lots of additional bug fixes\n\n## Known Issues & Discussion\n- See [Issues](https://github.com/dyanikoglu/ALS-Community/issues) section for list of known issues\n- See [Discussions](https://github.com/dyanikoglu/ALS-Community/discussions) section to discuss anything about the plugin, and ask questions. Please do not open an issue for questions.\n\n## Documentation\nInstructions for setting up the plugin can be found on [Wiki](https://github.com/dyanikoglu/ALS-Community/wiki/Setting-Up-The-Plugin) section.\n\n## License & Contribution\n**Source code** of the plugin is licensed under MIT license, and other developers are encouraged to fork the repository, open issues & pull requests to help the development.\n"
