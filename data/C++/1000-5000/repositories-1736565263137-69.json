A large portion was upgrading to Python 3. A special thanks to all the contributors that made this possible. Additionally, contributed fixes for the different validation and visualization scripts have been merged.\n* **Febuary 3, 2020** - Initial Ubuntu 18.04 support has been merged via PR [#241](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/241). Additionally, support for inputting an initial guess for focal length can be provided from the cmd-line on failure to initialize them.\n* **August 15, 2018** - Double sphere camera models have been contributed to the repository via PR [#210](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/210). If you are interested you can refer to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08957) for a nice overview of the models in the repository.\n* **August 25, 2016** - Rolling shutter camera calibration support was added as a feature via PR [#65](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/pull/65). The [paper](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2013/papers/Oth_Rolling_Shutter_Camera_2013_CVPR_paper.pdf) provides details for those interested.\n* **May 18, 2016** - Support for multiple IMU-to-IMU spacial and IMU intrinsic calibration was released.\n* **June 18, 2014** - Initial public release of the repository.\n\n\n## Authors\n* Paul Furgale\n* Hannes Sommer\n* Jérôme Maye\n* Jörn Rehder\n* Thomas Schneider ([email](thomas.schneider@voliro.com))\n* Luc Oth\n\n\n## References\nThe calibration approaches used in Kalibr are based on the following papers.
