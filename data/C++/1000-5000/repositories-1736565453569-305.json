But then\n`OcclusionQueryNode` wasn't aware of the geometry change and couldn't\ninternally handle it correctly.\n\nThe `computeBound` method never considered a user defined query geometry and\nalways just overrode the vertices of the geometry.\n\nThe member `_validQueryGeometry` wasn't correctly set.\n\nThis change should fix all this issues by introducing a small backward\ncompatibility break. The non const `getQueryGeometry` method is removed\nforcing the user to use the `setQueryGeometry` method. But then `OcclusionQueryNode`\nis aware of the user defined query geometry and can handle it correctly.\n\n\nSun, 18 Aug 2019 20:14:17 +0200\nAuthor : Remo E\nDebugging: Hint to debug LoadLibrary issuesThis helps to debug loading dynamic libraries in an environment without implemented \"dlopen\".

However, the timeout is determined using the variable lastUpdateTS which stores the last time the publishNewFrame function was called, and if the video has been playing and then is paused for longer than 10 seconds, when it is unpaused this timeout will fire and the stream will be closed, stopping the video playing beyond what has been buffered.\r\n\r\nTo stop this timeout from happening before the video starts playing, the timeout checks to see if the lastUpdateTS > 0 (at initialization it is set to 0). In this fix, we simply set the value of lastUpdateTS to 0 when the video is unpaused, this will force the check to skip on unpause, and from then on lastUpdateTS will have the correct value again.\r\n\r\nThe lastUpdateTS variable is private and only used for this one function, so there should be no side effects from the change.\n\nFri, 14 Jun 2019 15:44:00 +0100\nAuthor : OpenSceneGraph

implementations.There are two types of Geometry Shaders in OpenGL. One is provided by `GL_EXT_geometry_shader4` and `GL_ARB_geometry_shader4` and requires that certain parameters are set with calls to `glProgramParameteri` before the program is linked.

The DDS loader will give preference to the DDPF_RGB flag and try to deduce the format from the RGB bit mask values instead of using the more reliable FOURCC flag. This causes some images to not load, even though the FOURCC flag is supported.  I've modified the loader so that it checks for the DDPF_FOURCC flag first, then falls back on deducing the format from the RGB bit masks.\n\nMon, 19 Nov 2018 10:22:59 +0800\nAuthor : Michael X.

There's not a preferred way to go and the choice is really up to the developer but considering that:\n\n1. Currently the generated project defaults the option to YES\n2. There are almost 90 projects targets that should be modified if one wants to disable the bitcode option (which considerably reduces the footprint of the app)\n3. Even though one can select all the 90+ targets and set the option to NO for all of them, the updates could take a few seconds and could be error prone because one could miss to select some targets\n\nI propose to add a CMake setting that is displayed only when building for iOS. By setting this option \"before\" the project generation would speed up things for developers and would avoid errors at compiling time.\n\n\nThu, 8 Mar 2018 16:26:01 +0000\nAuthor : Robert

That is not consistent with other libs and this submission makes it consistent and therefore the OSG configures out of the box.

Mathieu MARACHE\nUnder macOS the glValidateProgram reports too many false negatives (errors) about missing buffers, etc..From the internet https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15335510/opengl-glvalidateprogram-error-on-mac-os-x :\n« […] The purpose of glValidateProgram is not to use it as an added \"check\" step after linking the program, because the GL and application state is hardly ready for actually using that program at this point, probably it's even before we get around to initializing the default framebuffer (its bitdepth, its multisample buffers, etc), and that's what the error hints at.\n\nAn appropriate place to call glValidateProgram would be right before you make a real render call. »\n\nTue, 29 Aug 2017 02:55:40

The \"RotationOrder\" property should only apply to the local rotation value.

Say an intersection visitor or update visitor only needs to traverse the subgraph once, not once for each pass. For these visitors there is no point in traversing the subgraph more than once, since it's exactly the same graph. Another motivation is the performance improvement had when an intersection visitor tests against a multipass Technique.\"\n\n Note about mods by Robert Osfield, \"Changed dyanmic_cast<> and check against getTraversalType() to utilize the new asCullVisitor() instead to improve efficiency.\"\n\n\nTue, 1 Mar 2016 11:45:20 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nWithin the #pragmatic shader composition code added platform specific line endings for WIN32 vs all other platforms to \"\\r\\n\" and \"\\n\" respectively.\n\nTue, 1 Mar 2016 11:06:39 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nFrom Wee See and Robert Osfield, Introduced StatsHandler::collectWhichCamerasToRenderStatsFor(osgViewer::ViewerBase* viewer, osgViewer::ViewerBase::Cameras& cameras) method to make it possible to customize which Cameras the handler renders stats for.\n\nTue, 1 Mar 2016 10:37:41 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nFrom Jannik Heller, \"This submission fixes a stuttering issue that may occur when occlusion query nodes are in view. The problem is that OSG retrieves the occlusion query result without first checking if it's available (GL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE). Thus, the driver has to sync with the GPU i.e. wait for all queued draw calls to complete. This is particularly bad in V-Synced situations where the driver may be using multi frame queueing techniques - coupled with the fact that OSG only runs an occlusion query every 5th frame, results in very unpleasant stuttering in some situations.The change I made is to check GL_QUERY_RESULT_AVAILABLE before retrieving the query, to ensure that there won't be a stall. If the query result is not available yet, we'll leave it alone and try again in the next frame.\n\nHad to make a few more changes than I'd liked, mostly because the TestResult mechanism wasn't designed for holding on to query objects for more than one frame. As well, I'm thinking that RetrieveQueriesCallback and ClearQueriesCallback could be merged together, if we wanted to go for more refactoring. For though now my strategy is to make as little changes as possible. Let me know what you think of the patch.\"\n\n\nTue, 1 Mar 2016 10:21:14 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nFrom Ognjen Kostic, \"Some android phones have no support for OES_element_index_uint extension that is required if glDrawElements is to be called with GL_UNSIGNED_INT for element type.

The later is preferable as it closes a potential threading bug when using paging databases in conjunction with the osgDB::Registry Object Cache.  This threading bug occurs when one thread gets an object from the Cache via an osgDB::read*File() call where only a pointer to the object is passed back, so taking a reference to the object is delayed till it gets reassigned to a ref_ptr<>, but at the same time another thread calls a flush of the Object Cache deleting this object as it's referenceCount is now zero.  Using osgDB::readREf*File() makes sure the a ref_ptr<> is passed back and the referenceCount never goes to zero.To ensure the OSG builds when OSG_PROVIDE_READFILE is to OFF the many cases of osgDB::read*File() usage had to be replaced with a ref_ptr<> osgDB::readRef*File()\nusage.  The avoid this change causing lots of other client code to be rewritten to handle the use of ref_ptr<> in place of C pointer I introduced a serious of\ntemplte methods in various class to adapt ref_ptr<> to the underly C pointer to be passed to old OSG API's, example of this is found in include/osg/Group:\n\n    bool addChild(Node* child); // old method which can only be used with a Node*\n\n    tempalte<class T> bool addChild(const osg::ref_ptr<T>& child) { return addChild(child.get()); } // adapter template method\n\nThese changes together cover 149 modified files, so it's a large submission. This extent of changes are warrent to make use of the Object Cache\nand multi-threaded loaded more robust.\n\n\n\ngit-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@15164 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697\n\n\nFri, 9 Oct 2015 08:44:45 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nupdated ChangeLoggit-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@15151 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697\n\n\nThu, 8 Oct 2015 15:58:24 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nAdded osg::flushAllDeletedGLObjects to clean up of graphics context after the existing osg::deleteAllGLObjects() to catch any cases where delete doesn't flush GL objects.git-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@15150 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697\n\n\nMon, 5 Oct 2015 10:58:32 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nIntroduced usage of OSG_INIT_SINGLETON_PROXY into DatabasePager::prototype() and Registry::instance(), removing the InitRegistry proxy object in src/osgViewer/ViewerBase.cpp.git-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@15147 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697\n\n\nFri, 25 Sep 2015 15:20:25 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nFrom Kristofer Tingdahl, \"we had a minor shadow problem with the osg-3.4 that pollutes our continuous integration\"git-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@15143 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697\n\n\nFri, 25 Sep 2015 11:15:04 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nAdded fix for case when Renderer is assigned to a Camera that has now Viewgit-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@15141 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697\n\n\nFri, 25 Sep 2015 10:11:52 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nFrom Curtis Rubel, \"I would like to submit the attached file for inclusion in future releases of OpenSceneGraph and the OpenThreads library.The changes in the file simply remove a few ifndef's that currently\ndo not allow Linux systems to fully utilize the PThread real-time\nscheduling API.\n\nSince Linux now fully supports the PThread scheduling API it would\nbe beneficial to have it available to use as necessary.

I noticed it when using osg::clone on a Geometry with vertex buffer objects, and the copy flags DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS. To be precise, I add a Geometry to an osgUtil::IncrementalCompileOperation, then osg::clone the Geometry. I was getting reports from users of random crashes happening.I believe the offending lines are in the osg::Geometry copy constructor:\n\n    if ((copyop.getCopyFlags() & osg::CopyOp::DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS))\n    {\n        if (_useVertexBufferObjects)\n        {\n            // copying of arrays doesn't set up buffer objects so we'll need to force\n            // Geometry to assign these, we'll do this by switching off VBO's then renabling them.\n            setUseVertexBufferObjects(false);\n            setUseVertexBufferObjects(true);\n        }\n    }\n\nToggling the vertex buffer objects off then on again actually touches not only the arrays controlled by DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS, but also the PrimitiveSets which are controlled by DEEP_COPY_PRIMITIVES. This means if the user has copyflags of only DEEP_COPY_ARRAYS, we are modifying arrays that belong to the original const Geometry& we are copying from. I believe this shouldn't be allowed to happen because we are using a const& specifier for the original Geometry.\n\nIn my case the osgUtil::IncrementalCompileOperation was trying to compile the geometry, while in the main thread a clone operation toggled the VBO's off and on, a crash ensues.\n\nIn the attached patch, you will find a more efficient handling of VBO's in the osg::Geometry copy constructor, so that only the Arrays that were actually deep copied have their VBO assigned, and no changes are made to Arrays that already had a valid VBO assigned. In addition, the DEEP_COPY_PRIMITIVES flag is now honored so that VBO's are set up correctly should a user copy a Geometry with only that flag.\n\"\n\n\n\ngit-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@15129 16af8721-9629-0410-8352-f15c8da7e697\n\n\nFri, 4 Sep 2015 15:04:58 +0000\nAuthor : Robert Osfield\nFrom Laurens Voerman, \"I found that using an ImageSequence with mode PAGE_AND_DISCARD_USED_IMAGES triggers the (3) imageThreads to run and never stop, even when no more work is to be done.

is run on is different than what Qt considers the “main” thread, which can cause subtle problems. This is because Qt loads native libraries in one thread, and later runs the application in a different thread. They delay running in the second thread as long as possible as they have a nontrivial bootstrapping process. The motivation for Qt having this second thread is to allow them to remain responsive to both Java and native events, and capture events that would otherwise be “missed”.This gives arise to the requirement that a static initialization of a QObject cannot occur for the Android platform, as Qt incorrectly considers that first thread the “main” one before a client application has even begun executing in its second thread.\n\n \n\nThe HeartBeat in GraphicsWindowQt.cpp is a QObject static global initialized at load time, causing the above issue. This changeset changes it to be a singleton that is constructed upon first access to its “instance” method.\n\n \n\nI have:\n\n- added the static method “instance”,\n\n- moved its constructor to be private, and\n\n- changed the one place it is accessed to access it through the “instance” method.\n\n\"\n\nChanges by Robert are to adopt QPointer<HeartBeat> rather than use a C pointer to ensure that the HeartBeat object will be cleaned up automatically rather than leaked.\n\n\n\ngit-svn-id: http://svn.openscenegraph.org/osg/OpenSceneGraph/trunk@14963

I have attached an example 3DS file I used to test the leaks/fixes using osgviewer for trunk at rev [14853] and the tagged version 3.2.1.The first leak is in the lib3ds module (yeah, I know that probably should be corrected at http://code.google.com/p/lib3ds/ but I'm assuming that as no commits have happened there since 2011 that it may be better to fix the copy we have in the OSG of that project) The leak is caused by lib3d's use of realloc(ptr, 0) to free up memory allocations, but realloc, when ptr==NULL returns malloc(0) rather than NULL and thus leaks a zero byte allocation. The solution here was to adjust the 'lib3ds_util_reserve_array' function so that it realloc is not used to release a NULL pointer.\n\nThe second leak is in ReaderWriter3DS.cpp and arises when any of the created StateSet objects added to the StateSetMap don't subsequently get applied to a Node. The solution here was just to simply use the osg::ref_ptr around the raw StateSet pointer that was used in the locally defined StateSetInfo struct.\"\n\n\n\ngit-svn-id:

I am attaching a security check in FFmpegDecoderAudio.cpp.If anybody is curious about the problem, it happens sometimes when decoding an AAC audio stream. It eventually includes a PCE block inside the AAC audio frame and then ffmpeg audio decoding function signals a \"new_frame\" with 1024 samples, but a null pointer instead of the audio data.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

OpenSceneGraph 3.4 written entirely in Standard C++ and built upon OpenGL, offers developers working in the visual simulation, game development, virtual reality, scientific visualization and modelling markets - a real-time visualization tool which eclipses commercial scene graph toolkits in functionality, stability and performance. OpenSceneGraph 3.4 runs on all Microsoft Windows platforms, Apple OS/X, iOS, GNU/Linux, Android, IRIX, Solaris, HP-UX, AIX and FreeBSD operating systems.\nUpdates include:\n\n  * New #pragma(tic) composition shader functionality built into the core OSG that provides a easy to use yet flexible scheme for controlling and composing shaders at runtime levering GLSL support for #define and #pragma.\n  * New osgTerrain::DisplacementMappingTechnique to uses vertex, geometry and fragment shader based displacement mapping technique that dramatically lowers the CPU and GPU memory footprint and bandwidth needs for the same visual quality.  The new scheme enables paged terrain that work robustly on smaller hardware, or with far higher loads without framedrops.  This new technique levels #pragma(tic) shader composition to enable one to toggle on/off features in the shaders at runtime in a way that is as convenient to use as toggle modes in a fixed function pipeline scene graph.\n  * New osgVolume::MultipassTechique that uses multipass rendering and shaders to enable seamless mixing of traditional 3D geometry and volumes, support for geometry hulls that constrain where the volume should be rendered as well as improving the ray tracing shaders so that they are both faster and have higher visual quality than the previous generation of ray traced shaders supported by OSG-3.2 releases and before.\n  * New osgDB::Classiterface  class that provides an easy to use mechanism for introspection of scene graph classes, allowing one to get, set properties and invoke methods in a generic way, making the task of integrating 3rd prarty tools such as scripting languages straight forward.\n  * New Lua scripting support via a plugin that integrates Lua 5.2.3 and the OSG via the OSG's native serialization codes.\n  * New osgUI NodeKit, that enables User Interface elements to be placed directly into 3D scene graph. The classes are fully scriptable so you create create UI and behaviours all within lua scripts.\n  * Improvements to OpenGL ES 1.1, ES 2.0 and ES3.0 support, including platform specific extensions\n  * Improvements to OpenGL 4.x support with a range of new extensions support\n  * Updates to osgQt to support Qt5 and provide better support for Qt4\n\nDownloads and Licensing:\n\nOpenSceneGraph is open-source, so full source code is provided, and can be copied, modified and used free of charge for commercial and non-commercial use.

The toolkit is based on OpenGL and Standard C++ and most portable toolkit of its kind, supporting Windows, Linux, OSX, Irix, Solaris, FreeBSD and HP-UX and Aix, including 64 bit support on Windows, Linux, OSX, Irix and Solaris.  OpenGL version from 1.1 through to 2.0 are all seemlessly supported, including many of the latest extensions.  The OpenSceneGraph is now firmly established as one of the worlds most popular scene graph technologies, and is used and developed by community of over a thousand developers.\n\nThe OpenSceneGraph 0.9.9 release:\n\nThe latest release of the OpenSceneGraph, 0.9.9, is the culmination of 7 years development and is the final milestone before reaching 1.0. All core features for 1.0 are now in place and ready for deployment.  Since the development driven is by technical convergence rather than usual marketing forces, even the beta releases of the OpenSceneGraph are already mature enough for major industry players to have adopted it for their own application development, with many companies already releasing products based on top of the OpenSceneGraph.\n\nThe 0.9.9 release includes many minor API refinements, bug fixes and optimizations, but also major new features including tight integration of OpenGL Shading Language support directly into the core osg library, new reflection/introspection support, new particle effects, movie support and DXF import.  Details follow:\n\nOpenGL Shader Language support:\n\nOpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) support has been moved from the osgGL2 node kit directly into the core osg library.  This move also involved refactoring the handling of state so that it now specifically supports GLSL Program, Shaders and Uniforms in a convenient and flexible way. State sorting and lazy state updating are now applied to both Program and Uniforms to maximize performance throughput.  The work was spearheaded by 3Dlabs engineer Mike Weiblen, collaborating with Robert Osfield with contributions from the community.\n\nIntrospection support:\n\nThe new osgIntrospection and associated library wrappers provides support for full API reflection/introspection.  That facilitates integration of the OpenSceneGraph with other programming languages, development of generic editors of scene graph attributes, general purpose serialization of scene graph objects such as for reading and writing to disk, or across local networks to support systems such as graphics clusters.  The osgIntrospection is designed\nto be non-intrusive, allowing 3rd Party libraries to be wrapped without these libraries needing to have explicit introspection support added into them.  The-non intrusive approach also keeps introspection support a separate module which only needs to be loaded if you require it, this leaves the core libraries light-weight and focused on the their particular tasks.  osgIntrospection is the inspired work of Marco Jez.  Thanks also go to ANU Viz Lab for graciously funding Robert Osfield's contribution to this sub-project.\n\nBetter support for Apple native Windowing:\n\nThanks to new support for AGL and CGL in OpenProducer, all OpenSceneGraph/osgProducer-based examples and application will run straight out of the box under OSX native AGL or CGL Windowing. This allows better integration of OpenSceneGraph applications with OSX, access to faster and up to date OpenGL drivers.\n\nSupport for latest OpenGL extensions:\n\nSupport for the Non power of two texture feature of OpenGL 2.0 has been added\nto all the core texture classes.  Also to facilate high resolution video streaming, OpenGL  Pixel Buffer Objects are now supported.  Support for blend equation and logic op have also been added.\n\nTerrain generation and rendering enhancements:\n\nThe osgTerrain library, for generating whole earth, geospecific paged databases, has been enhanced with support for alpha source textures and multiple texture layers.  The new multiple texture layers support can be controlled at runtime via the new osgFX::osgFX MultiTextureControl node, which provides a convenient means for blending between the different layers at run-time.  Multiple textures layers can be very useful for mixing topographical maps with satellite/aerial photography.\n\nParticle Effects:\n\nTo make it easier to add particle effects to your application a new osgParticle::ParticleEffects node has been written, with five concrete implementations of SmokeEffect, FireEffect, ExplosionEffect and ExplosionDebrisEffect which you can create, adjust and add to your scene graphs.\n\nDXF and Movie plugins:\n\nA new DXF plugin has been added for reading .dxf files.  Movie support has also been enhanced with integration of the OpenSceneGraph with Xine-lib via the xine plugin, this allows you to add movie content into your applications, including DVD's and streamed across the LAN, thanks to Xine-libs inbuilt streaming support.\n\nApplication and examples:\n\nTo facilitate faster builds and a logical division between applications that come with the OpenSceneGraph, the original example directory has now been split into two, with the new applications/ directory now comprising osgviewer, osgconv, osgarchive, osgversion and osgdem.  The Makefiles now build by default only the applications directory, thus avoiding the cost of recompiling the 74 example programs.  Examples can still be compiled by run make COMPILE_EXAMPLES=yes, or setting COMPILE_EXAMPLE=yes as an env var or in a custom dependencies file.\n\nThere are eight new examples, osgblendequation and osglogicop demonstrate the new osg::BlendEquation and osg::LogicOp state attributes,  osgGLUTkeyboardmouse and osgGLUTsimple are GLUT based examples, osgslice does some image reading of rendered slices, osgparticleeffects demonstrates the new osgParticle::ParticleEffects.\n\nosgpbuffer also example now uses Producer's pbuffer support making it portable across platforms and much cleaner.\n\nAPI refinements, bug fixes and performance improvements:\n\nThere have been many bug fixes, a number of performance improvements and API cleanups that have occurred throughout the 0.9.8 - 0.9.9, too many separate items to enumerate here.  Together with the above new features they all go to making the OpenSceneGraph-0.9.9 the most robust, high performance and feature rich version so far, and sets the stage for the upcoming 1.0.\n\nWe would like to thank the following engineers for their contributions in the 0.9.8 - 0.9.9.9 time frame (in alphabetic order):\nAlberto Farre, Bob Kuehne, Brede Johansen, Carlo Camporesi, Chris Hanson, Don Burns, Donn Mielcarek,  Don Tidrow, Farshid Lashkari, Frederic Marmond, Garrett Potts, Igor Kravtchenko, James French, Jan Ciger, John Grant, Joakim Simonsson, Joran Jessurun, Jason Daly, Kevin Moiule, Leandro Motta Barros, Marco Jez, Mason Menninger, Mike Weiblen, Nathan Monteleone, Norman Vine, Olaf Flebbe, Paul Melis, Per Fahlberg, Rainer Oder, Randall Hopper, Reinhard Sainitzer, Robert Osfield, Ruben, Sebastien Grignard, Stephan Huber, Terry Welsh, Thom DeCarlo, Tony Horrobin, Tree, Tugkan Calapoglu, Vivek Rajan, Waltice and Yuzhong Shen\n\n\nRobert Osfield,\nOpenSceneGraph Project Lead,\nMay 23rd 2005.\n\n--\n\nProject Links:\n\nOpenSceneGraph - http://www.openscenegraph.org\nOpenProducer - http://www.andesengineering.com/Producer/index.html\nOpenThreads - http://openthreads.sf.net\nxine-lib - http://xinehq.de/\n\nOpenSceneGraph Commercial Support, Training and Consultancy links:\n\nOpenSceneGraph Professional Services - http://www.openscenegraph.com\nAndes Engineering - http://www.andesengineering.com\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n26th November 2004 - OpenSceneGraph-0.9.8\n\n    >>> Support for database archives, improved pager, 3d compressed textures\n\n    Release 0.9.8 reflects a continuation of the prior commitment to release\n    often, arriving only two short months after 0.9.7.

The documentation is also now completely\n    built with Doxygen.\n\n    New Plugins added or modified this release:\n\n        o STL    - This plugin provides OSG with the capability to import\n                   Stereolithography files, commonly used in the CAD\n                   markets.\n\n        o NET    - This plugin provides OSG with the ability to read data files\n                   from a web site through an http interface.\n\n        o OSGA   - This plugin provides database archival support, including\n                   large file (greater than 2 GB) support.\n\n        o OBJ    - The existing obj plugin has been re-written for clean up.\n\n\n    New support for 3d texture compression using the\n    GL_NV_texture_compression_vtc extension has been added, providing an\n    improvement on the S3TC compression techniques.\n\n    The OSG Spelling Bee is making its mark in this release, with submissions\n    by the community to correct spelling and typo errors throughout the osg,\n    osgDB and osgUtil libraries.\n\n    osgDB::ReaderWriter and osgDB::Registry have been refactored to allow\n    multi-threading of database reading and writing.\n\n    The NodeTrackManipulator has been improved.\n\n    Several general bug fixes have been fixed.\n\n    Producer and osgProducer now provide new Mac OSX CGL support, providing an\n    environment that is independent of X11.\n\n    A few new examples have been added as well:\n\n        o osgplanets    - A simple example that demonstrates an attempt at\n                          accurate depiction of planetary motion.\n        o osgspotlight  - An example demonstrating a spot light using\n                          a projected texture.\n        o osglauncher   - An example which reads a config file and displays other examples\n                          and shows and launches them by clicking on the icons.\n        o osgmotionblur - An example of motion blur using accumulation buffers\n\n18th August 2004 - OpenSceneGraph-0.9.7-2\n\n    Build fixes for VisualStudio6.0.\n    Fixes for osgFX registry support.\n    Fixes to osg::Image::flipVertical() adding support for mipmaps and\n    compressed textures.\n    DDS plugin now can vertically flip images by using \"dds_flip\" Options string.\n    Added support in osgTerrain for reading imagery with color tables.\n\n\n9th August 2004 - OpenSceneGraph-0.9.7\n\n    >>> support for and generation of large scale geospatial databases,\n    >>> support for movies and examples of shadows and volume rendering.\n\n    The 0.9.7 encompasses many improvements, bug fixes, new examples and\n    significant new functionality, the most notable of which is a new\n    osgTerrain library for generation of large scale geospatial databases.\n\n    The new osgTerrain library and associated osgdem utility program\n    allows users to use moziacs of geospatial imagery and digital elevation\n    maps to generate a complete paged database which can be used with\n    standard OSG viewers, and users programs. By utilising GDAL to load the\n    imagery and DEM's a wide range of geospatial formats are supported.\n\n    The TerraPage plugin has also been rewritten ontop of the OSG's\n    osg::PagedLOD and osgDB::DatabasePager which provides support for the\n    tile fallback mechanism to ensure that no holes or cracks appear in the\n    databases being roamed, and to achieve constant frame rate via load\n    balancing mechanisms with osgDB::DatabasePager.\n\n    The osgDB::DatabasePager has been further improved to provide more\n    configurable load balancing which allows application developers to achieve\n    constant frame rates when using paged databases.\n\n    Double Vec & Matrix classes & CoordinateSystemNode/EllipsoidModel class\n    have been introduced to better support browsing of large scale databases,\n    and to provide a mechanism for tracking the local up orientation when\n    roaming whole earth databases.\n\n    osgUtil has been enhanced with:\n     - an improved triangle tipper class (osgUtil::TriStipVisitor),\n     - a new simplifier (osgUtil::Simplifer) for reducing triangle density of\n       osg::Geometry leaves (utilised by osgTerrain to provide simplification\n       of terrain tiles),\n     - improved and more configurable optimizer (osgUtil::Optimizer),\n     - a new utility class for compiling and releasing OpenGL objects\n      (osgUtil::GLObjectVisitor) replaces the previous and more limited\n       DisplayListVisitor.\n\n    All the osgGA::MatrxManipulator's (used for camera manipulator etc) have\n    been revamped with usage of doubles internally, and with tracking of the\n    current CoordinateSystem if one is active, to be better support whole\n    earth databases.  All the MatrixManipulators have been extend to allow\n    the setting of a user defined home position.  Two new manipulators have\n    been introduced osgGA::TerrainManipulator, for roaming whole earth/terrain\n    databases, and osgGA::TrackerManipulator which allows the camera to be\n    attached to a node in the scene graph.\n\n    Movie support under Linux and OSX via libMpeg3 and Quicktime respectively,\n    which extend the new osg::ImageStream base class which allows application\n    developers access to playing, pausing and rewinding movies.\n\n    The conversion utility osgconv has been extended to allow compression of\n    textures and mipmap generation during conversion when writing to the native\n    .ive binary format.  Texture compression and pre computer mipmaps enable\n    faster loading of databases and lower utilisation of memory resources.\n\n    Write support added to JPG plugin.\n\n    Write + 3D texture support added to DDS plugin.\n\n    Pseudo loaders .trans, .rot and .scale have been added.\n\n    Updated LWO, AC3D, BMP, IVE and FLT loaders.\n\n    osg::TexGenNode has been added to provide a mechanism for positioning\n    OpenGL's texture coordinate generation planes.\n\n    Fourteen new examples have been added:\n\n        osgdem            a utility for creating large scale geospatial paged\n                          database\n\n        osgphotoalbum     an example of how to use PagedLOD to dynamic generate\n                          geometry for paged in imagery\n\n        osgbluemarble     an example of how to build PagedLOD database for\n                          paging imagery\n\n        osgtessellate     an example of how to use osgUtil::Tesselate to\n                          tessellate polygonal boundaries\n\n        osgsimulation     an example of how to use various features in osgSim.\n\n        osgdepthshadow    an example of how to implement shadows use depth\n                          shadow textures.\n\n        osgsimplifier     an example of how to use the new osgUtil::Simplifier.\n\n        osgspacewarp      an example of how to create a special effect that\n                          depends upon tracking the modelview matrix.\n\n        osgdistortion     an example of how to use prerendering of a texture to\n                          create a distortion effect.\n\n        osgsimple         a bare bones example of how to create a simple viewer\n                          using a Windowing toolkit, in this example using\n                          Producer, but is written so the example could easily\n                          be modified to work with other Windowing toolkit.\n\n        osgkeyboardmouse  adding to keyboard and mouse functionality on the\n                          osgsimple base.\n\n        osgsimplepager    adding database paging support to the osgsimple\n                          example.\n\n        osgmovie          an example which creates a quad to render a loaded\n                          movie file with - requires the LibMpeg3 (Linux) or\n                          Quicktime (OSX) plugin to work.\n\n        osgvolume         an example that reads a stack of 2d images to create\n                          a 3D texture, and creates a scene graph using\n                          standard OSG components (osg::ClipNode,\n                          osg::TexGenNode, osg::Billboard and\n                          osg::TexEnvCombine) to create a per per lit volume.\n\n\n    Wrapping up the complete 0.9.7 release is a wide range of smaller features\n    enhancement and many bug fixes.\n\n\n2nd October 2003 - OpenSceneGraph-0.9.6-2\n\n    >>> osgFX Special Effects nodekit (for bumping mapping & cartoon effects etc), support for double Matrix traversals,\n    >>> improved build support, thread safety and robustness.\n\n    The new osgFX nodekit, written by Marco Jez, adds a set of decorator\n    nodes that add can be conveniently added above subgraphs in your scene\n    to add special a range of special rendering effects.  Effects include\n    AnisotopicLight, BumpMapping, Scribe, Specular Highlights and Cartoon\n    rendering.\n\n    Support for double Matrices has been added with the new Matrixd class,\n    and complimented by the a Matrixf class.  The original Matrix class is\n    now a typedef which can be set to either Matrixf or Matrixd (which is\n    now the default),  When the Matrix typedef is set to Matrixd and the OSG and\n    dependent apps are recompiled all internal operations such a cull traversals\n    will now be double with double matrices which much improved numerical\n    precision, making it ideal for datasets where a large values are contained\n    with transforms in the scene graph (such as with whole earth databases),\n    and when a transforms are nested which creates requires concatenation of\n    a number of matrices to get the final model view matrices.\n\n    The osgGA::MatrixManipulators (which are used to control the camera\n    position) and osgProducer/OpenProducer have been moved across to using\n    exclusively double Matrices.  This has been done to improve numerical\n    precision when computing camera positions, whilst having little impact\n    on performance since camera operations are only done a small number of\n    times per frame.\n\n    osg::Quat now supports doubles by default, but also allows users to select\n    float version osg::Quat simply by changing the osg::Quat::value_type typedef.\n\n    Work has been on OpenThreads and OpenProducer, in particular to improve\n    thread safety and robustness on the Win32 platform.  Reported crashes\n    on exit from osgProducer::Viewer based apps, and freezes during runtime\n    have been fixed.\n\n    Threading problems which caused crashes in recent updates of the Terrapage\n    loader have also been fixed, and additional internal changes have been made\n    to improve the Terrapage loader's ability to hit constant frame rates.\n    Support has also been added for loading light points directly from the\n    Terrapage database.\n\n    A new .iv/.wrl loader plugin, written by Vivek Rajan, at Magic Earth,\n    has been added to the distribution which uses with OpenInventor or Coin\n    to load model, converting them into OSG equivalents.  Coin has support\n    for VRML97 models, so can be used to import such models into the OSG.\n    Since the new plugin is dependent on OpenInventor or Coin the compilation\n    is optional, but off by default. To compile this plugin under Unix, set\n    the environmental variable USE_INVENTOR or USE_COIN and recompile.\n    Windows .dsp project file does to current exist, but should be\n    possible to add this.\n\n    The .ive plugin has been improved with the addition of support for\n    osgSim light points, and various internal refinements to make it function\n    better on the various platforms supported by the OSG.  Note, these changes\n    mean that the .ive format has has changed and is no longer compatible\n    with previous version of .ive. It is recommend that one recreates .ive\n    for the original source via osgconv or similar to ensure consistency.\n\n    A JPEG2000 image plugin has added, written by Michael Gronager.  The new jp2\n    plugin uses the japser open source project to read and write JPEG2000 files.\n\n    A scalar bar, and sphere segment helper classes have been added to osgSim,\n    the new osgscalarbar and osgspheresegment examples demonstrate how to use\n    these new features.\n\n    To help handle running applications of graphics cards/drivers that exhibit\n    bugs with certain OpenGL extensions, support has been added to the GLextensions\n    code to allow extensions to be disabled via the new\n    osg::setGLExtensionDisableString(std::string) function or by setting an\n    OSG_GL_EXTENSION_DISABLE environmental variables.  Follows is an example of\n    the disable string:\n\n        set OSG_GL_EXTENSION_DISABLE =\n             \"ATI:GL_SGIS_generate_mipmap;Sun:GL_EXT_texture_filter_anisotropic:\"\n\n    New examples include:\n\n        osgforest - an example which demonstrates simple techniques for creating forests\n        osgfxbrowser - an example which demonstrates the various osgFX Effects available\n        osgscalabar - an example of how to set up the osgSim::ScalarBar.\n        osgspheresegment - an example of how to set up the osgSim::SphereSegement\n        osgpagelod - a very simply test program for setting up osg::PagedLOD/osgDB::DatabasePager\n\n23rd July 2003 - OpenSceneGraph-0.9.5\n\n    >>> Support added for OpenGL2.0 shaders, native multi-threaded Database paging,\n    >>> high peformance binary format reading and writing,  .dds compressed image\n    >>> loader and ARB_fragment_program and ARB_vertex_buffer_object extensions,\n    >>> improvements to the Terrex .txp and OpenFlight .flt loaders.\n\n    The key new features of the 0.9.5 release are the new OpenGL2.0 nodekit, constant frame rate\n    database paging support,  classes,  and the new native .ive binary plugin which supports\n    both reading and writing of all core osg nodes, including inlining of compressed\n    and non-compressed imagery.\n\n    The native database paging support, provided by the new osg::PageLOD and osgDB::DatabasePager,\n    achieves constant frame rate through threading of the database reading, and time based\n    incremental compile and delete of display lists, vertex_buffer_objects and texture objects.\n    A new TextureObjectManager class also caches a list of expired texture objects for reuse,\n    and allows new newly loading imagery to reuse expired texture objects, with the imagery\n    automatically subloaded to the reused texture objects.  This reuse happens transparently\n    and benefits other OSG usages such as the OSG's Terrapage loader.\n\n    To provide support multi-thread operation of the OSG, such as multi-thread database paging\n    and multi-threaded, multi-window graphics enabled by OpenProducer, the OpenSceneGraph and\n    OpenProducer have now adopted the OpenThreads threading library, osgDB and osgProducer now\n    depend upon it.  OpenThreads is open source, light weight, cross platform C++ threading\n    which encapsulates the low level, platform specific threading API calls.  Currently pthreads\n    under Unix and Win32 threads under Windows are supported, with Sgi sproc threads to be\n    released very soon.  The OpenThreads project website can be found at http://openthreads.sf.net.\n\n    The new .ive binary plugin was developed by Uni-C's VR-Center, and kindly submitted as\n    open source, adds support for binary reading and writing OSG nodes drawable and state\n    (including compressed/mipmapped) textures.  The .ive format produces a much faster\n    load times and smaller file size then native ASCII .osg format. Load times for .ive\n    files are also 10-20x faster then equivalent OpenFlight .flt and load in an already\n    optimized scene graph form making it much more suitable for paging.  Files can be\n    converted easily using the osgconv utility : osgconv myfile.flt myfile.ive\n\n    The new osgGL2 nodekit library adds support for the OpenGL2.0 vertex ProgramObect and fragment\n    ShaderObject's recently ratified by the OpenGL ARB, . The osgGL2 uses the extension have local\n    prototypes which allow them to be compiled even in the absence of OpenGL headers that don't\n    support the GL2 extension, allowing to port to all platform, and at runtime the extensions are\n    queried for and used if available.  At time of release only 3DLabs WildcatVP series supported\n    this extension at runtime, but other graphics cards and manufactures will be releasing GL2\n    extension very soon and will be automatically supported by osgGL2. The osgGL2 was developed\n    by Mike Weiblen at 3DLabs whom have kindly submitted osgGL2 as open source and for inclusion\n    with the OSG distribution.\n\n    The ARB_fragment_program, ARB_vertex_buffer_object and ARB_vertex_program attributes are\n    also now supported in core osg library.  The new osg::FragmentProgram state attribute\n    encapsulates the ARB_fragment_program which is supported by the recent graphics cards\n    from NVidia, ATI and 3DLabs.  Support for ARB_vertex_buffer_object and ARB_vertex_program\n    attributes have been added to the osg::Geometry class.  The ARB_vertex_buffer_object extension\n    can boost performance by as much as 50% when working on geometry bound data sets.\n\n    Two new image loaders, dds and pnm, and a 3dc point cloud have been added. The .dds plugin\n    adds support for compressed & mipped mapped imagery, making it ideal for applications where\n    large texture sizes or database paging is required. The pnm image loader reads the\n    pnm, pgm and pbm image formats. See http://netghost.narod.ru/gff/vendspec/pbm/ for details.\n\n    The Terrapage .txp plugin  been updated to include support for multi-texturing, layers and billboards\n    and includes improvements to multi-threaded pager, which has also been ported over to use OpenThreads.\n    The OpenFlight .flt plugin has also been improved and now support detail textures via multi-texturing.\n\n    TessellationHints now supported by ShapeDrawable which allow the shape primitives to be rendered\n    are vary levels of detail.\n\n    Supported has been added for auto scaling and rotating text into osgText.\n\n    Five new examples have been included in the distribution:\n\n    \tosgtexturerectangle illustrates how to use the osg::TextureRectangle which encapsulates\n\tthe NV_texture_rectangle extension.\n\n     \tosgprerendercubemap illustrates how to use pre rendering imagery to osg::TextureCubeMap\n\tfor tasks such as building a environmental texture maps.\n\n\tslideshow3D is a presentation tool which use a scene graph to store a render set of slides, each\n\tslide containing layers which can contain bullet points, paragraph, imagery and 3d animated\n\tmodels - and is effectively a 3D power point. The presentations can be built separately and stored in a .osg file or created by\n\tslideshow3D via an xml file, two examples - introduction.xml and models.xml, which are included\n\tin the OpenSceneGraph-Data-0.9.5 data distribution.  slideshow3D depends upon libxml2 for parsing\n\tthe xml files.\n\n\tosgpoints uses the osg::Point state attribute to attenuate and control point size and any points\n\tloaded by the application.  This is a useful way of visualizing point data clouds.\n\n\tosgdemeter is example of how to integrate the Demeter, OSG using osgProducer::Viewer as a viewer\n\tclass.  This example depends upon the demeter terrain engine, which can be download from\n\thttp://www.terrainengine.com.\n\n    Camera style convenience set and get methods to osgUtil::SceneView, consolidating\n    previous functionality that was provided by both osg::SceneView and osg::Camara into one place.\n    This move has made osg::Camera redundant so has it been removed to avoid confusion,\n    usage inconsistencies and bloat of core libraries.\n\n    The long time deprecated osg::GeoSet has been removed, to aid migration of old .osg datasets\n    osgconv has a copy of GeoSet and the .osg support for it so is able to convert any remaining\n    .osg database which contained GeoSet's.\n\n\n\n28th April 2003  - OpenSceneGraph-0.9.4-2\n\n    >>> Multi-threaded, multi-pipe support via integration with OpenProducer,\n    >>> 64bit Linux support for Intel Intanium and AMD Opteron,\n    >>> new osgText library with greater performance, and thread safety,\n    >>> new DDS plug-in for compressed and non-compressed images,\n    >>> new MD2 plug-in adds support for animate Quake character and\n    >>> support added for NV_texture_rectangle.\n\n    The most significant new feature is the osgProducer library that adds\n    tight integration with OpenProducer, providing the OpenSceneGraph with a\n    scalable, configurable and portable framework for developing real-time\n    and interactive graphics applications.  The scalability afforded by\n    OpenProducer allows applications to be developed which run seamlessly\n    on single pipe machines up to multi-pipe machines such as Sgi Onyx\n    IR system, and Sun Zulu systems.\n    The osgProducer/OpenProducer framework automatically handles the\n    multi-threading of cull-draw pairs and GUI events.\n\n    All the example programs have been ported over from being based on\n    GLUT to using osgProducer (osgGLUT can now be found in the bazaar\n    section on the website). The move to osgProducer allows all the examples\n    to scale from running on laptops up to multiple CPU and graphics pipe systems.\n    The configuration of threading and multiple camera views can all be done\n    via ASCII configuration files, no need to recompile.  A number of\n    new examples have also been added or revamped, bringing the total to 42.\n\n    Also in the theme of increasing scalability there is support for 64bit Linux for both\n    IA64 (Intel Itanium) and x86-64 (AMD Opteron) which compliments the existing\n    support for Solaris and IRIX 64 bit compilation.  64 bit supports allows\n    the use of very large data sets, and potential performance improvements.\n\n    To help support development teams working with multiple build configuration,\n    the makefile system has been extended to allow multiple build targets to be\n    built from one source code base.  All makefiles are also now named GNUmakefile\n    which ensures that they are only run by gmake to avoid an confusion on system\n    where gmake isn't the default make tool.\n\n    A completely new osgText implemention has been developed which is simpler\n    to use, faster, and thread safe.  Support for high quality true type fonts\n    has now been moved to a freetype plug-in which is dynamically loaded on demand,\n    with the core osgText library providing a default font when the plug-in is\n    unavailable.  Moving the freetype dependency out of the osgText library makes\n    it just dependent on OpenGL and Standard C++ like the rest of the core libraries,\n    allowing osgText to compile by default on all platforms.\n\n    Improved thread safety has also been achieved in the core osg and osgUtil libraries\n    making work on multiple CPU/multi-pipe systems robust and with improved performance.\n\n    Two new plug-ins have been added, for loading DDS and MD2 data formats. The DDS plug-in\n    is for loading compressed and non-compressed images.  The MD2 plug-in loads Quake\n    animated characters.\n\n    osg::TextureRectangle class has been added, which encapsulates the\n    NV_texture_rectangle and EXT_texture_rectangle extensions.  This is particularly\n    useful for render to texture algorithms, and dynamic paging of images such as for\n    rendering video streams.\n\n    Support for automatic subloading of osg::Texture2D textures has been added\n    so that when image data is updated the corresponding OpenGL texture is\n    automatically updated - no need for callbacks.  Also added to the osg::Texture\n    classes is the option of automatic unref'ing of texture image data once the data has\n    been download to all active OpenGL graphics contexts.\n\n    A new osgUtil::DelaunayTriangulator utility class has been added.  This is ideal for\n    creating optimal triangular meshes from unconnected data points.\n\n    Two new classes, osg::ArgumentParser and osg::ApplicationUsage, have been introduced\n    to convineiently and robustly parse command line arguments and\n    report command line usage, environmental variables and keyboard and mouse bindings\n    used by applications.  Running any of the examples with -h or --help will report\n    full details example usage.  Keyboard and Mouse bindings usage is now also available as\n    a HUD on all examples, simply press 'h' while the app is running to\n    bring up help.\n\n    A database cache in the osgDB library has been added, along with a clean up\n    of memory management in the OpenFlight loader, make development of\n    dynamic paging of databases easier and more robust.\n\n    Support for early abort of rendering has been added, which is useful for\n    interactive applications which occasionally have rendering that takes that long\n    enough (i.e.several seconds) that end users may wish to abort during the drawing.\n\n    There have also been many general API improvements and bug fixes, too many to enumerate,\n    but all go to solidify the quality of the scene graph and its accompanying libraries.\n\n    The combination of new features, robustness and scalability mark this release as a\n    significant step towards 1.0.\n\n\n\n24th January 2003 - OpenSceneGraph-0.9.3.tar.gz\n\n    >>> adds support navigational light points, multi-threaded dynamic\n    >>> paging of Terrapage databases, ARB_vertex_program extension,\n    >>> DirectD .x model loader, and integration with OpenProducer for\n    >>> multi-threaded, multi-window/pipe rendering.\n\n    Added osgProducer library which integrates the OpenSceneGraph seemlessly\n    with OpenProducer to provide runtime configurable management of windows\n    and multipipe graphic systems.  The osgproducer demo illustrate how\n    developers can write applications very simply that harness the power\n    of the OpenProducer and OpenSceneGraph in an extremely flexible way.\n    OpenProducer can be downloaded from:\n    http://www.andesengineering.com/BlueMarbleViewer/producer_install.html\n\n    Support added for dynamic paging of Terrage databases, the required\n    multi-threading is set up by defult.

Inventor/VRML and LWO2 loaders added and the a port HP-UX!\n\n    Despite only 6 weeks passing between 0.9.0 and this latest 0.9.1 release\n    there has been a number of significant new features, API clean ups and\n    bug fixes.  Follows is a quick run through the key improvements.\n\n    Addition of osg::Texture1D, Texture2D & Texture3D classes, Texture2D replaces\n    the original osg::Texture, which has now become a pure virtual base class. All\n    Texture classes, including TextureCubeMap are derived from this base class..\n\n    New osgtexture1D and osgtexture3D demos demonstrate the new texture classes in\n    action.\n\n    The build system has been updated to support HP-UX.  This adds one of the last\n    remaining mainstream platforms supported.\n\n    A new Inventor/VRML1.0 loader was added.  The inventor format has been requested\n    on numerous occasions, so this is a welcome addition.\n\n    Support added to lwo plugin for loading the new lwo2 format.\n\n    osg::TexEnvCombine implemented texture_env_combine and texture_env_crossbar\n    and texture_env_dot3 extensions.\n\n    osg::TexEnv texture_env_add added.\n\n    A osg::Sequence node has finally been implemented.

Check osgbillboard for a new improved demo.\n\n    The osglight example has been improved by utilizing AnimationPath and\n    PositionAttitudeTransform to keep light sources in motion.\n\n    osg::AnimationPath improved, now allowing swing and looping behavior and\n    with two new app callbacks which can update PositionAttitudeTransform\n    and MatrixTransform respectively.\n\n    Support for writing osg::Image's to .rgb format added.\n\n    To keep the overall API clean, and the following items have been\n    renamed and deprecated parts of the API have been removed:\n\n    Renamed classes:\n\n            EarthSky        -> ClearNode\n            Transparency    -> BlendFunc\n            Texture         -> Texture2D  (old style subload parameters removed)\n\n    Method's changed\n\n            Matrix          -> makeRotate(..) euler angles parameters generalized.\n            Quat            -> makeRotate(..) euler angles parameters generalized.\n\n            BoundingBox     -> isValid() renamed valid()\n            BoundingSphere  -> isValid() renamed valid()\n\n            StateAttribute  -> OVERRIDE_OFF & OVERRIDE_ON which were short hand\n                               versions of OVERRIDE | OFF and OVERRIDE | ON\n                               removed, as the meaning of the bitmask was\n                               often confused by the short hand notation.\n\n\n            Transform       -> setMatrix/getMatrix() etc methods removed,\n                               Transform becoming the transform base class,\n                               with MatrixTransform taking over all the original\n                               functionality.\n\n\n19th July 2002 - OpenSceneGraph-0.9.0.tar.gz\n\n    >>> OpenSceneGraph goes beta - Multitexturing, Occlusion Culling, Particles and much more added!\n\n    This release marks the beginning of the beta phase of the OpenSceneGraph\n    development, which means that all the major core features are now\n    in the scene graph, and 1.0 is not far away.  Its performance, features\n    and portability already compares very favorably to other scene graphs,\n    both comerical and open source.\n\n    Multi-texturing support added to osg::StateSet, osg::Geometry, osg::State\n    and txp loader, so multi-texturing can now be done with very little coding\n    from the user - all you need to do is specify the texture unit to use\n    when setting texturing state and texture coordinates and the rest is\n    handled automatically by the scene graph!\n\n    The new osg::Geometry classes which supersedes the old Performer style\n    osg::GeoSet, support multi-texturing, and uses sharable osg::Arrays which\n    utilize std::vector<> for data storage and manipulation.\n\n    Shadow volume occlusion culling adding to the core OSG, developed as a\n    collobaration between Mike Connell and Robert Osfield. Our implementation\n    uses convex planer occluders, with support for holes to allow larger\n    and more effective occluders to be used. The approach is software\n    based so it 100% portable, and by culling during the cull traversal\n    both CPU and GPU loads are significantly reduced, making it an extremely\n    powerful feature for large scale urban and indoor visulisation.\n\n    osgParticle developed by Marco Jez adds support for a range of particle\n    effects such smoke, fires, engine plumes, fountains, fire works, and\n    is fully customizable to produce your own favorite effects. osgParticle\n    is a NodeKit (see below) which can be directly linked to in your\n    application to allow you to create particle effects by hand, or have\n    the library dynamically loaded in when you load a database which contains\n    particle effects.\n\n    osgGA (Gui Abstraction) library written by Neil Salter adds classes for\n    adapting different GUI toolkits to work with a standard set of manipulators for\n    modifying the scene, such as camera and state manipulators.\n\n    Support has been added to the plugin architecture to facilitate the\n    development of NodeKits - add on libraries which can used directly\n    in your code, or loaded indirectly when loading from file.  The\n    later allows you to load a .osg file with text or particle effects\n    in them,the plugin architecture automatically loads the required\n    library which supports these features.\n\n    A range of new demos have been as code examples, and to demonstrate\n    the range of features that OpenSceneGraph delivers:\n\n        osgoccluder  - demonstrates ocllusion culling, and has a mode\n                       which allows the users to interactively create\n                       their own convex planer occluders.\n        osghud       - how to mix head up display with 3d views.\n        osgparticle  - shows the new osgParticle node kit in action.\n        osgprerender - pre renders and scene then textures the result onto\n                       an animated flag.\n        osgcallback  - examples of the full range of callbacks that you\n                       can use to add dynamic behaviors to your scene graph.\n        osglight     - a simple example of how to set up spot and position\n                       lights in the scene.\n        osgclip      - illustrates how to add clip planes to you scene.\n        osggeometry  - examples of the different ways to set up primitives\n                       and vertex/color/normal and texture attributes in\n                       the new osg::Geometry class.\n        osgmultitexture - a simple example which adds a spherical reflection\n                        map to a whole scene using the second texture unit\n                        if one exists.\n\n    osg::Drawable::PrimtiveFunctor has also been added to allow querrying\n    of primitive data with Drawables subclasses without requiring knowledge\n    of the types of Drawable subclasses that exists.  This decoupling makes\n    it a very powerful and flexible utility.\n\n\n26th April 2002 - OpenSceneGraph-0.8.45.tar.gz\n\n    >>> Support added for Solaris, texture cube mapping & muliple projections.\n\n    The OpenSceneGraph now has a new Makefile system which supports all Unix\n    compilation including the new addition to the family - Solaris!\n\n    OpenSceneGraph welcomes Solaris to the list of supported platforms.  This\n    release puts all of the OpenSceneGraph functionality at the fingertips of\n    Sun Microsystem's customers and developers.  Solaris users can now have\n    the benefit of a high performance scene graph for visual simulation,\n    virtual reality, scientific visualization, CAD, and architectural\n    walk-throughs.  Many thanks to Sun for providing resources for the port.\n\n    Additional html documentation has been added to the distribution to\n    make it easier to get an understanding of scene graph technology and\n    the project itself and how to make use of it.\n\n    Support has also been added for OpenGL's texture cube mapping which\n    is ideal for accurate environmental reflections and much more.\n\n    The scene graph has been extended to allow multiple projection (via\n    the new osg::Projection node) and viewports within one scene graphs,\n    this makes it much easier to set up head up displays, and we have\n    an example to demonstrate how easy it is - osghud.\n\n    The osgUtil::CullVisitor and osgUtil::SceneView has been revamped\n    removing the dependency on osg::Camera, which is now simply an\n    option for SceneView rather than a requirement.  This allows users\n    to set the camera entirely with the scene graph or create their own\n    camera classes and use them with SceneView.  The existing osg::Camera\n    has also been simplified as support for setting projection and\n    modelview matrices have been moved out to the cull traversal.\n\n    Several sets of node callbacks have been added, including a Cull\n    NodeCallback on each Node, ComputeTransformCallback on Transform\n    Nodes, EvaluateLODCallback on LOD nodes, ComputeBillboardCallback\n    on Billboard nodes.  These make it my easier to customize the\n    scene graphs behavior at runtime.\n\n    osg::Image::readPixels() and support for writing .bmp files has been\n    added which has made it easy to add screen capture the any OpenSceneGraph\n    application.  This feature is demonstrated in the scene graph viewer\n    which comes with the distribution - just press 'O' to output a screenshot.\n\n    Finally, include/osg/MemoryManager has been added which overrides new\n    and delete for debug builds. The override new and delete track allocations\n    and deallocations, ensure they are matched, checked for memory under and\n    overruns, and outputs a memleaks.log file on the results of executing\n    your applications.  This help track down a number of memory leaks and\n    unmatched new and deletes within the OpenSceneGraph and should make\n    it easier to do with users applications as well.\n\n    All in all, the OpenSceneGraph is now more portable, easier to\n    customize, cleaner and more robust.  Beta release and 1.0 is now not\n    far away!\n\n\n24th February 2002 - osg-0.8.44.tar.gzosg-\n\n    >>> Support added for Mac OSX, Cygwin and MinGW, and new TerraPage loader.\n\n    The major item for this release is the completion of the Mac OSX port,\n    thanks to Phil Atkin and others for making this happen.\n\n    Also added to support for Cygwin and MinGW builds which gives Windows\n    users a free and robust alternative to the Visual C++, which we\n    have Norman Vine to thank.\n\n    Funtionality wise there has been a great deal of work behind the scenes\n    putting in place a flexible and extensible framework for handling\n    transform nodes, users can now extend the osg::Transform node through\n    subclassing or via callbacks.  This work will underpin future work\n    on moving camera setup into the scene graph, and environmental effects\n    such as cloud layers, ground planes, stars and earth sky implementations\n    which are planned for the next release.\n\n    Callbacks and virtual methods have also been added to the osg::LOD &\n    osg::Billboard to allow users to customize their behavior.  Draw\n    callbacks have also been added to allow customization of osg::Drawables\n    at runtime.\n\n    The Open Flight .flt loader has undergone a number of improvements\n    including support for instancing and billboards.\n\n    New TerraPage (.txp) loader and OpenDX writer (.dx) plugins have been added.\n\n    Support for the clone operation on osg::Object's has been expanded\n    to allow cloneType() - a simple clone an blank object of the same type,\n    and clone(CopyOp&) where CopyOp is a functor which allows users to\n    specify the deep copy vs shallow copying of object data.\n\n\n2nd January 2002 - osg-0.8.43.tar.gz\n\n    >>> Support for TrueType text, Stereo out of the box, and much more.\n\n    Since the last release the OSG has moved to CVS based developments so\n    many users will have seen gradual increments in functionality and changes\n    to the API. Whereas a the leap from 0.8.42 to 0.8.43 is actually quite\n    significant is likely to require code changes as several significant parts\n    of the API have evolved to a more mature state.\n\n    The most significant new functionality is the addition of the osgText\n    library which provides support for true type font rendering, as textured,\n    polygonal, pixmap, bitmap and 3D fonts.\n\n    We now have new osg::Matrix implementation which cleans up its interface.\n    Also all angular parameters are now based on radians rather than degrees\n    as before (and as in Performer), this has been done to be more consistent\n    with the basic trignometric functions and standard maths conventions.\n\n    Scene graph optimization has been added which can boost performance\n    on some database by as much as an order of magnititude, this is\n    particularly noticeable in .flt based databases.  Display list performance\n    has also been boosted on NVidia based machines thanks to changing the\n    compilation and execution of display list into two separate operations.\n\n    App callbacks are now supported on all Nodes, and there now a proper\n    app traversal which can be used to animate the scene.\n\n    Stereo support has been added into the osgUtil::SceneView which allows\n    quad buffered/anaglyphic stereo to enabled easily for almost all OSG\n    applications without code modifications - simple set environmental\n    variable or pass in appropriate arguments and your app will render in\n    stereo!\n\n    src/Demos/osgcluster has been added to demonstrate how easy it is\n    to set up a graphics cluster across a standard networked PC's.\n\n    There have been many minor code changes to fix bugs and address\n    performance bottlenecks or to improve extensibility was, representing\n    a significant step towards API maturity and a beta release which is\n    now not far away.\n\n\n9th August 2001 - osg-0.8.42.tar.gz\n\n    >>> New osgWX library for integration of OSG with wxWindows apps.\n\n    This release sees a relatively minor number of enhancements over\n    0.8.41, the most significant being the new osgWX library and wxsgv\n    demo written by Ben Discoe.\n\n    Also from Brede Johansen in this release is the improvements in support for older\n    .flt (Open Flight) files such versions 12 & 13.  Previously only version\n    15.6 files had been tested and developed to.\n\n    Last but by no means least, several bug fixes related to view frustum\n    culling have been made.\n\n\n25th July 2001 - osg-0.8.41.tar.gz\n\n    >>> Support added for multi-pass and multi-stage rendering including Impostors.\n\n    The key feature developed is a highly flexible framework for multi-pass and\n    multi-stage rendering techniques.  Unlike most scene graphs and games\n    engines the OSG has as dynamic framework which automatically configures\n    itself at runtime.\n\n    Building ontop of the new framework's multi-stage rendering capabilities,\n    support for Impostors (hirachical image caching) has been integrated into\n    the core scene graph  library making extremely easy to take advantage of\n    this advanced rendering techinque - normally only seen in research papers.\n    Check out osgimpostor demo to see how easy it is to add osg::Impostor\n    nodes to your own models. Impostors are particularly effective are\n    reducing scene complexity whilest minimizing the visual impact, making it\n    ideal for scenes with large numbers of complex objects such as a city\n    scene, or a dense forest.\n\n    Taking advantage of the new framework's multi-pass rendering capabilities\n    is osgreflect demo which illustrates how to achieve planar relfections\n    using the stencil buffer and multi-pass rendering.\n\n    The cool thing about both the osgreflect and osgimpostor demos is that\n    there is no hardwiring to achieve the results, the scene graph stores\n    all the information necessary to specify the number and type of rendering\n    passes, and the framework handles the rest behind the scenes.  This also\n    makes it very easy to add these advanced rendering techinques to your\n    own applications as everything is cleanly encapsulated with\n    osgUtil::SceneView.\n\n    New loaders have been added to support .lwo (Light Wave), .obj\n    (Alias Wavefront) and .dw (Design Workshop) 3D file formats making it\n    even easier to compose your own worlds from models sourced from the\n    web or your own.\n\n    osg::Camera has been totally revamped and now supports asymetric\n    and othographics projections in addition to the symmetrical perspective\n    projections.\n\n    And finally, support for texture subloading has been added to osg::Texture\n    and osg::Image.  This allows textures to be updated dynamically, and\n    has already been used for mpeg video playback!\n\n\n19th May 2001 - osg-0.8.40.tar.gz\n\n    >>> Project lead, Robert Osfield, makes full-time commitment to OSG.\n\n    This is the first full release since project lead, Robert Osfield, made\n    a move to pursue the OSG's development full-time.  This commitment has\n    been made to bring the API rapidly towards maturity, and to provide\n    high quality support and consultancy services.  Please contact\n    robert@openscenegraph.com if you have any queries.\n\n    This release marks a significant step forward in the maturity of the\n    API, with several major changes to the library in the areas of state\n    handling, database support, and portability.\n\n    To improve the extensibility of the OSG's handling of OpenGL state,\n    new classes have been introduced to replace the previous hardwired\n    state handling classes.  The new classes also allow improved state\n    sorting and lazy state updating which boosts both cull traversal\n    and particularly draw traversal performance.\n\n    To improve the modularity, interopability and conceptual clarity the\n    support classes for database loading have been moved from the core\n    osg library into their own osgDB library.  Support for the .osg\n    ASCII native database format and the .rgb reader has moved into its own\n    osgPlugins library to further the cleanliness of the core library.\n\n    Support has be added for multiple OpenGL context's and hence multi-pipe\n    systems such as sgi's Onyx2, allowing each context to have its own\n    display list and texture objects.\n\n    The culler and rendering support in osgUtil has also been improved, and\n    significantly speeded up for complex models.\n\n    Also just in, thanks to Randall Hopper for adding support for FreeBSD :-)\n\n\n23rd March 2001 - osg-0.8.39.tar.gz\n\n    >>> Port of OSG to MacOS underway\n\n    The first steps towards support of MacOS have been taken by Bryan Woods,\n    adding Metrowerks project files and adding support for MacOS into the\n    core scene graph.  Work still in progress so assistance welcome to\n    complete the task.\n\n    Other major developments have been the addition of two new base classes\n    osg::StateAttribute and osg::Drawable which are designed to allow greater\n    extensibility of OpenGL state management and primitives.\n\n\n17th Feburary 2001 - osg-0.8.38.tar.gz\n\n    >>> New 3DS loader added\n\n    The OpenSceneGraph now supports the 3DS file format. This makes\n    available a huge range of potential models.

This allows more textures to be loaded onto graphics\n    card memory, resulting in happier users and a better world in which\n    to live.\n\n    This release also sees the addition of a simple hang gliding flight sim\n    demo.\n\n25th January 2001 - osg_src-0.8-35.tar.gz\n\n    >>> Anisotropic texturing now supported <i>and</i> loading of gzip compressed files\n\n    Anisotropic texturing provides for the next step in quality texturing\n    filtering above tri-linear and is especially effective when viewing\n    texture surfaces at shallow angles.\n\n    Also added in this release is on-the-fly support for loading gzipped\n    (.osgtgz, .tgz) and zipped (.zip) database files.  This features allows\n    users to store whole databases (models and textures) in a single\n    tar ball and unpack them automatically on running the osg.  This\n    is ideal for browsing the web.\n\n22nd December 2000 - osg_src-0.8-33.tar.gz\n\n    >>> Support added for OpenGL vertex arrays, and several key image loaders.\n\n    Support for OpenGL vertex arrays has been added to improve performance,\n    particularly accelerating PC based graphics.\n\n    Also added is support gif, jpeg, pic, tga, tiff image formats via\n    dynamic plugins.\n\n8th Decemeber 2000 - osg_src-0.8-32.tar.gz\n\n    >>> New high resolution, low latency timer class - osg::Timer.\n\n    Real-time graphics relies upon accurate timers for updating physics\n    simulations and managing constant framerates.

How to build OpenSceneGraph\n\nIf you are using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager you can download and install OpenSceneGraph from source with CMake integration using a single command:\n```\nvcpkg install osg\n```\n\nThe OpenSceneGraph uses the CMake build system to generate a platform-specific build environment.  CMake reads the `CMakeLists.txt` files that you'll find throughout the OpenSceneGraph directories, checks for installed dependencies and then generates files for the selected build system.\n\nIf you don't already have CMake installed on your system you can grab it from http://www.cmake.org, use version 2.8.0 or later.  Details on the OpenSceneGraph's CMake build can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.openscenegraph.org/projects/osg/wiki/Build/CMake\n\nUnder Unix-like systems (i.e. Linux, IRIX, Solaris, Free-BSD, HP-UX, AIX, macOS) use the `cmake` or `ccmake` command-line utils. Note that `cmake .` defaults to building Release to ensure that you get the best performance from your final libraries/applications.\n\n    cd OpenSceneGraph\n    cmake .\n    make\n    sudo make install\n\nAlternatively, you can create an out-of-source build directory and run cmake or ccmake from there. The advantage to this approach is that the temporary files created by CMake won't clutter the OpenSceneGraph source directory, and also makes it possible to have multiple independent build targets by creating multiple build directories. In a directory alongside the OpenSceneGraph use:\n\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake ../OpenSceneGraph\n    make\n    sudo make install\n\nUnder Windows use the GUI tool CMakeSetup to build your VisualStudio files. The following page on our wiki dedicated to the CMake build system should help guide you through the process:\n\nhttp://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/documentation/platform-specifics/windows\n\nUnder macOS you can either use the CMake build system above, or use the Xcode projects that you will find in the OpenSceneGraph/Xcode directory. See release notes on macOS CMake build below.\n\nFor further details on compilation, installation and platform-specific information read \"Getting Started\" guide:\n\nhttp://www.openscenegraph.org/index.php/documentation/10-getting-started\n\n\n## Section 2. Release notes on macOS build, by Eric Sokolowski et al.\n\nThere are two ways to compile OpenSceneGraph under macOS.  The recommended way is to use CMake to generate Xcode project files and then use Xcode to build the library. The default project will be able to build Debug or Release libraries, examples, and sample applications.\n\nThe alternative is to build OpenSceneGraph from the command line using `make` or `ninja` using the instructions for Unix-like systems above.\n\nHere are some key settings to consider when using CMake:\n\n- BUILD_OSG_EXAMPLES - By default this is turned off. Turn this setting on to compile many great example programs.\n- CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES - Xcode can create applications, executables, libraries, and frameworks that can be run on more than one architecture. Use this setting to indicate the architectures on which to build OSG. x86_64 is the only supported value for OS versions > 10.7.\n- OSG_BUILD_APPLICATION_BUNDLES - Normally only executable binaries are created for the examples and sample applications. Turn this option on if you want to create real macOS .app bundles. There are caveats to creating `.app` bundles, see below.\n- OSG_DEFAULT_IMAGE_PLUGIN_FOR_OSX - By default macOS uses the `imageio` plugin instead of the plugins for the individual file types (e.g. `jpg`, `gif`, etc.) to load image file types. The `imageio` plugin can handle all popular file formats through the ImageIO framework.\n- OSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM - You have the choice to use Cocoa, Carbon, or X11 when building applications on macOS. Cocoa is the default for OS versions >= 10.5. Carbon and X11 are no longer actively supported, either by Apple or the OSG community.\n\n\n### APPLICATION BUNDLES (.app bundles)\n\nThe example programs when built as application bundles only contain the executable file. They do not contain the dependent libraries as would a normal bundle, so they are not generally portable to other machines.\nThey also do not know where to find plugins. An environmental variable OSG_LIBRARY_PATH may be set to point to the location where the plugin .so files are located. OSG_FILE_PATH may be set to point to the location where data files are located. Setting OSG_FILE_PATH to the OpenSceneGraph-Data directory is very useful when testing OSG by running the example programs.\n\nMany of the example programs use command-line arguments. When double-clicking on an application (or using the equivalent \"open\" command on the command line) only those examples and applications that do not require command-line arguments will successfully run. The executable file within the .app bundle can be run from the command-line if command-line arguments are needed.\n\n\n## Section 3. Release notes on iOS build, by Thomas Hogarth\n\nWith CMake 3.11, XCode 9.4 and the iOS sdk 11.4 installed you can generate an iOS XCode project using the following command line:\n\n    export THIRDPARTY_PATH=/path/to/3rdParty\n    cmake ./ -G Xcode -DOSG_BUILD_PLATFORM_IPHONE:BOOL=ON \\\n    -DIPHONE_SDKVER=\"11.4\" \\\n    -DIPHONE_VERSION_MIN=\"10.0\" \\\n    -DOPENGL_PROFILE:STRING=GLES3 \\\n    -DOSG_CPP_EXCEPTIONS_AVAILABLE:BOOL=ON \\\n    -DBUILD_OSG_APPLICATIONS:BOOL=OFF \\\n    -DBUILD_OSG_EXAMPLES:BOOL=ON \\\n    -DOSG_WINDOWING_SYSTEM:STRING=IOS \\\n    -DOSG_DEFAULT_IMAGE_PLUGIN_FOR_OSX=\"imageio\" \\\n    -DDYNAMIC_OPENSCENEGRAPH:BOOL=OFF \\\n    -DDYNAMIC_OPENTHREADS:BOOL=OFF \\\n    -DCURL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/curl-ios-device/include\" \\\n    -DCURL_LIBRARY:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/curl-ios-device/lib/libcurl.a\" \\\n    -DFREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIR_freetype2:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/freetype-ios-universal/include/freetype\" \\\n    -DFREETYPE_INCLUDE_DIR_ft2build:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/freetype-ios-universal/include\" \\\n    -DFREETYPE_LIBRARY:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/freetype-ios-universal/lib/libFreetype2.a\" \\\n    -DTIFF_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/tiff-ios-device/include\" \\\n    -DTIFF_LIBRARY:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/tiff-ios-device/lib/libtiff.a\" \\\n    -DGDAL_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/gdal-ios-device/include\" \\\n    -DGDAL_LIBRARY:PATH=\"$THIRDPARTY_PATH/gdal-ios-device/lib/libgdal.a\"\n\n\nBe sure to set the THIRDPARTY_PATH to the path containing your thirdparty dependencies. Set IPHONE_SDKVER to the version of the iOS sdk you have installed, in this instance 11.4. IPHONE_VERSION_MIN controls the deployment sdk used by xcode, and lastly set OPENGL_PROFILE to the version of GLES you want to use.\n\nOnce this completes an XCode project will have been generated in the osg root folder. Open the generated Xcode project, select the example_osgViewerIPhone target. In 'General' tab set a development team.\n\nOnce this is done you should be able to build and deploy the `example_osgViewerIPhone` target on your device.\n"
