Win+R，输入mstsc.exe启动远程桌面程序\n2. 输入127.0.0.1，连接成功基本验证服务启用成功\n3. 或者也可以使用原版的RDPCheck.exe进行验证\n\n**如何升级：**\n\n常规情况下，一般都只需要更新rdpwrap.ini即可，所以：\n\n1. 手工将rdpwarp.ini拷贝到system32目录\n2. 或者运行SuperRDP.exe，先选择2卸载，再选择1安装\n\n# update\n\n如果你发现SuperRDP不支持你的版本，你可以通过[github issues](https://github.com/anhkgg/SuperRDP/issues)上传c:\\windows\\system32\\termsrv.dll，我会尽快更新支持。\n\n[查看更新](update.md)\n\n\nrdpwrap.ini中patch信息在10.0.18362.657(termsrv.dll)之后的版本都是由我加入，经过长时间实战验证，请放心使用。\n\n**应该是兼容大部分老版本的，如果没有相应系统版本信息，可以联系我更新支持。**\n\n**注意**：仅保证对64位系统的支持（毕竟现在很少用32位系统的了吧）\n\n# Support me\n\n如果觉得对你有帮助，请我喝杯咖啡。\n\n![img](pay.png)"
