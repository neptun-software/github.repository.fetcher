Many real world datasets deal with high dimensional sparse feature vectors like a recommendation system where the number of categories and users is on the order of millions. In that case, if you are the user of liblinear, libfm, and libffm, now xLearn is your another better choice.\n\n[Get Started! (English)](http://xlearn-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n\n[Get Started! (中文)](http://xlearn-doc-cn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)\n\n### Performance\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/aksnzhy/xLearn/raw/master/img/speed.png\" width = \"800\"/>\n\nxLearn is developed by high-performance C++ code with careful design and optimizations. Our system is designed to maximize CPU and memory utilization, provide cache-aware computation, and support lock-free learning. By combining these insights, xLearn is 5x-13x faster compared to similar systems.\n\n### Ease-of-use\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/aksnzhy/xLearn/raw/master/img/code.png\" width = \"600\"/>\n\nxLearn does not rely on any third-party library and users can just clone the code and compile it by using cmake. Also, xLearn supports very simple Python and CLI interface for data scientists, and it also offers many useful features that have been widely used in machine learning and data mining competitions, such as cross-validation, early-stop, etc.\n\n### Scalability\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/aksnzhy/xLearn/raw/master/img/scalability.png\" width = \"650\"/>\n\nxLearn can be used for solving large-scale machine learning problems. xLearn supports out-of-core training, which can handle very large data (TB) by just leveraging the disk of a PC.\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nxLearn has been developed and used by many active community members. Your help is very valuable to make it better for everyone.\n\n * Please contribute if you find any bug in xLearn.\n * Contribute new features you want to see in xLearn.\n * Contribute to the tests to make it more reliable.\n * Contribute to the documents to make it clearer for everyone.\n * Contribute to the examples to share your experience with other users.\n * Open issue if you met problems during development.\n\nNote that, please post iusse and contribution in *English* so that everyone can get help from them.\n\n## What's New\n\n - 2019-10-13 [Andrew Kane](https://github.com/ankane) add [Ruby bindings](https://github.com/ankane/xlearn) for xLearn!\n\n - 2019-4-25 xLearn 0.4.4 version release.
