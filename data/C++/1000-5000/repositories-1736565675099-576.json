          "content": "# How To Compile Overgrowth\n\nTo compile and run Overgrowth, you first need to have installed a commercial version of the game. \nIf you're on steam, you'll also want to make sure you're using the internal_testing branch to have the latest set of data-files for the game.\nThe reason for this is that you want the Data/ folder from the game.\n\nThese instructions assume you've already managed to download the project and have it in a local folder. There's no need to try and initialize the submodules unless you are an official developer of Wolfire, as those repos are private and primarily used by the build system for deployment. Make sure that the folder depth isn't too great, as this can cause some issues. From now we'll assume you've downloaded the repo into the following folder on windows ```C:\\overgrowth``` and ```~/overgrowth``` on unix-like systems.\n\n# Dependencies\n\n## Windows\n\nTo compile Overgrowth on windows you'll need the following to be installed before you start:\n* CMake https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.23.0/cmake-3.23.0-windows-x86_64.msi\n* Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/\n\n## MacOSX\n\nOn MacOSX, you'll need to install XCode and CMake before you can compile the project.\n\nAfter that you may need to start XCode once before building the project, to ensure that everything is configured. You may also have to install the command line XCode tools.\n\n## Generic Linux\n\nYou'll need a GCC compiler, OpenGL, CMake, SDL2, SDL2_net, GTK 2, Ogg, Vorbis, FreeImage, OpenAL, libjpeg, bzip2 and FreeType.\n\n## Fedora\n\nThe following command should install all necessary dependencies to build Overgrowth.\n```sudo dnf install gcc-c++ cmake make 'pkgconfig(gl)' 'pkgconfig(glu)' 'pkgconfig(sdl2)' 'pkgconfig(SDL2_net)' 'pkgconfig(gtk+-2.0)' 'pkgconfig(ogg)' 'pkgconfig(vorbis)' 'pkgconfig(openal)' 'pkgconfig(libjpeg)' 'pkgconfig(bzip2)' 'pkgconfig(freetype2)'```\n\n## Ubuntu\n\nThe following command should install all necessary dependencies to build Overgrowth.\n```sudo apt install build-essential cmake mesa-common-dev libsdl2-dev libsdl2-net-dev libgtk2.0-dev libogg-dev libvorbis-dev libopenal-dev libjpeg-dev libbz2-dev libfreetype-dev```\n\n# How To Compile\n\n## Windows\n\n1. Make sure you have an installed copy of Overgrowth and find the path to the install. If you've installed the game via Steam you can get the path by right clicking the game in the Steam games list, press Properties, go to Local Files and press Browse. This will open explorer window with the game path, copy that path into your clipboard. example: ```E:\\SteamLibrary\\steamapps\\common\\Overgrowth```\n\n2. Go to the Overgrowth git repo folder and create a new subfolder named \"Build\" example ```C:\\overgrowth\\Build```\n\n3. Open a windows cmd (alternatively a git bash console) in the build folder you just created.\n\n4. Run the following command ```cmake ../Projects -DAUX_DATA=\"E:/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Overgrowth\"```. Replace the path with your own Overgrowth install, and switch the path separators from ```\\``` to ```/```\n\n5. Open the generated ```Overgrowth.sln``` file using Visual Studio 2022\n\n6. Press the \"Local Windows Debugger\" button to compile and start the game.\n\n## MacOSX\n\n1. Go to the folder of the project\n2. Create a build directory ```% mkdir Build```\n3. Switch the terminal to the directory you just created. ```% cd Build```\n4. Run cmake to generate Makefiles, include the path to an already installed instance of Overgrowth ```% cmake ../Projects -DAUX_DATA=\"/path/to/installed/Overgrowth.app/Contents/MacOS\"```\n5. Run make to build the game ```% make```\n6. Run the game by first moving to the project directory ```% cd ..```\n7. Then start the game ```% ./Build/Overgrowth.app/Contents/MacOS/Overgrowth```\n\n## Linux\n\n1. Go to the folder of the project\n2. Create a build directory ```$ mkdir Build```\n3. Switch the terminal to the directory you just created. ```% cd Build```\n4. Run cmake to generate Makefiles, include the path to an already installed instance of Overgrowth ```$ cmake ../Projects -DAUX_DATA=\"/path/to/installed/Overgrowth\"```\n5. Run make to build the game ```$ make```\n6. Run the game by first moving to the project directory ```$ cd ..```\n7. Then start the game ```$ Build/Release/Overgrowth.x86_64```\n"

          "content": "# Contributing to Overgrowth\n\nHere you can read about how you can help the project and how it's structured.\n\n## How We're Organized\n\nThe project has a group of trusted maintainers who run the project, and together they have the final say in decisions. They are‥\n\n- [@akien-mga]\n- [@Conan-Kudo]\n- [@kavika13]\n- [@autious]\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThe Overgrowth GitHub is for on-topic discussions and development. It's everyone's responsibility to maintain a positive environment, especially during disagreements.\n\nAnything not about Overgrowth is off-topic, and such discussions are removed. People who do not follow the Code of Conduct are warned or removed.\n\n## How You Can Help\n\nHere are some ways you can contribute. If you can add value in another way, you are more than welcome to do so!\n\n### Reporting Issues\n\nAn issue can be either a bug or an idea for improvement, and it is the first step towards change.\n\nTo report an issue, first search among the [issues] to see if someone already reported it. If someone did, give the issue a 👍 reaction to show that you want it solved too, and write a comment if you have something to add. If the issue does not exist, create it.\n\n### Educating and Documenting\n\nThis game engine is big, and as with any software project, some parts can be hard to understand. Documenting the code and how everything works together helps new people get started contributing.\n\nHere are some common ways of documenting:\n\n- Write comments in the code itself and create a pull request. This is useful when documenting specific parts.\n- Write external documentation that we can link to or include in the repository. This is useful when documenting the bigger picture.\n\nLearning materials such as tutorials and articles make it easy for people to get started with the engine. For example, how do you add a new character? How do you create a custom campaign? How do you package your work for others?\n\n### Reviewing Code\n\nEven if you aren't a maintainer, you are encouraged to review pull requests. More eyes on code contributions improve the quality of the code.\n\nGo to the [pull requests] and read an existing pull request to start reviewing. With GitHub, you can comment on specific lines in the code to discuss issues or potential improvements.\n\n### Contributing Code\n\nTo submit your code for inclusion, create a [pull request][pull requests] on GitHub so people can review your code and give feedback. If your changes align with the goals of the project and the quality is good, we will probably merge it!\n\nYou don't need to be a master programmer to submit code. This repository is a place for learning and collaboration, so if your submission isn't ready for merging, maintainers will be happy to give helpful feedback to get it merged eventually.\n\nWhen one maintainer has reviewed and accepted a contribution, it gets merged into the codebase. Maintainers can accept their own contributions.\n\n[@akien-mga]: https://github.com/akien-mga\n[@Conan-Kudo]: https://github.com/Conan-Kudo\n[@kavika13]: https://github.com/kavika13\n[@autious]: https://github.com/autious\n[issues]: https://github.com/WolfireGames/overgrowth/issues\n[pull requests]: https://github.com/WolfireGames/overgrowth/pulls\n"

Only the code is available here; the game data (such as art assets and levels) can only be legally obtained by purchasing Overgrowth from [Wolfire Games].\n\nThis repository lets you‥\n\n- Run the open source code with the commercial data to perform experiments for educational purposes.\n- Propose changes to be merged back into the commercial game.\n- Create modifications for Overgrowth that would otherwise be impossible.\n- Use helpful code snippets in your projects.\n- Create your own commercial \"total conversions\" that use an entirely new set of assets.\n\nIf you would like to distribute any of the original Overgrowth assets, you must obtain explicit written permission from Wolfire Games.\n\n## Compiling\n[COMPILING.md] contains instructions on compiling and running the commercial Overgrowth game using the open source code.\n\n## Contributing\nThis repository is entirely community-operated. This means you can help by submitting bug reports, reviewing other people's code, contributing your own code, and so on.\n\nRead [CONTRIBUTING.md] for more information.\n\n## License\nUnless otherwise noted, the code in this repository is licensed under `Apache-2.0`. Read [LICENSE] for the full license.\n\n`Apache-2.0` is a \"permissive\" open source license, meaning you can use it for more or less whatever you want, including in closed source projects. Licenses are hard to understand, `Apache-2.0` is no exception. Here is a summary of what the license means in practice in most cases. This is not legal advice:\n\nIf you distribute a compiled program using the code, or you distribute the code itself, modified or not, you must do the following:\n\n### Include the entire contents of the `LICENSE` file\n\nThe license can be somewhere in the program itself or in a separate file. The purpose is to clarify under what license you're using the code. For example, you can have a file called `LICENSES`, and there you can have a line saying `This software uses code from Overgrowth under the Apache-2.0 license, read the full license in the file named LICENSE_APACHE.`.\n\n### Mark files you've changed with a notice\n\nIf you distribute the code itself, in each file you modify, write that you have modified it. For instance, the files have a \"boilerplate notice\" at the top, you can write that you have changed it there, so it looks something like this:\n\n```\n//           Name: filename.h\n//      Developer: Wolfire Games LLC\n//    Modified By: Firstname Lastname\n//    Description:\n//        License: Read below\n```\n\n### Do not remove any copyright notices or similar\n\nYou're not allowed to remove things like `Copyright 2022 Company Name` or similar.\n\n[Overgrowth]: https://overgrowth.wolfire.com\n[Wolfire Games]: https://wolfire.com\n[COMPILING.md]: COMPILING.md\n[CONTRIBUTING.md]: CONTRIBUTING.md\n[LICENSE]: LICENSE\n"
