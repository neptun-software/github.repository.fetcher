This was particularly pronounced in DPI-scaled layouts, as that often leads to fractionally sized elements.\n\nThe solution involves rounding the rendered sizes of elements based on their absolute positions to ensure that the bottom/right of one element matches the top/left of the next element. This implies that the rendered size of a fractional element may vary by up to one pixel. This generally matches how web browsers behave. Floating-point precision issues may still cause rare gaps, but the improvements should cover almost all cases. See the [commit message](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/commit/b197f985b328d5493af3190e27d4290bb496ff1d) for details. Resolves #438, thanks to @mwl4 for the extensive initiative and proof of concept.\n\nFixes several situations with single pixel gaps and overlaps:\n\n- Gap of 1px between border or backgrounds of neighboring elements.\n- Overlap of 1px between border or backgrounds of neighboring elements.\n- Table cell backgrounds overlaps the table border by 1px.\n- Clipping area offset by 1px compared to the border area.\n\n![Single pixel gap fix examples - before and after comparisons](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1b29382-4686-4fea-a4dc-ea9628669b80)\n\n### Handle element\n\nThe `<handle>` element has received several major improvements.\n\n- The handle now retains the anchoring that applies to the target element, even after moving or sizing it. #637\n  - If an element has all of its inset (top/right/bottom/left) properties set, this determines the size, and anchors to all edges. Previously, we would break the anchoring and just declare its new position or size. Now, positioning and sizing is performed in a way that retains this anchoring. Similarly, this applies to every combination of anchoring.\n  - Thus, when first sizing and moving the target, and then resizing its container, the element can now still resize itself to match the new dimensions.\n- The `edge_margin` attribute is introduced to constrain the target placement to the edges of its containing block. #631 \n  - Applies to both position and size targets.\n  - This attribute can take any length or percentage, which specifies the minimum distance between the target and the edges of its containing block. Each side can be specified individually, and negative values are allowed. See the [documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rml/controls.html#handle) for details.\n  - Defaults to `0px`, which means that handle targets will now be constrained exactly to the edges of their containing block.\n- Fix several issues where the element jolts some distance at drag start:\n  - When the target's containing block has a border.\n  - When the target is set to relative positioning and offset from the top-left corner.\n\n### New decorator: `text`\n\nAdded a new decorator to render text as a background on elements. This can be particularly helpful when using icon fonts, and even allows using such fonts for generated elements. #348 #655 #679\n\n```\ndecorator: text(\"Hello ð world!\" blue bottom right);\n```\n\nThe font face will be inherited from the element it is being applied to. However, it can be colored independently. Further, the text can be freely aligned within the element using lengths, percentages, or keywords. Unicode numerical references are supported with the HTML syntax, e.g. `&#x1F30E;`.\n\n### Flexbox layout improvements\n\n- Apply automatic minimum size of flex items in column mode with auto size. #658\n- Performance improvement: Skip calculating hypothetical cross size when not needed. Avoids a potentially expensive formatting step in some situations. #658 \n- Fix hypothetical width of replaced elements (such as images) in column direction layout. #666\n- Fix hitting an assertion due to negative flex item size in some situations when edge size is fractional. #657\n\n### Data binding\n\n- Allow custom getter/setter on scoped enum. #693 #699 (thanks @AmaiKinono)\n- Fix an issue where the `FamilyId` would have the same value for different types across shared library boundaries, which could lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior. \n\n### Animations\n\n- Add interpolation of color stop lists, which enables animation of color and position of stops in gradient decorators. #667\n- Improve warning message when trying to animate box shadows. #688\n\n### RCSS Values\n\n- Support `hsl` and `hsla` colors. E.g. `color: hsl(30, 80%, 50%)`. #674 (thanks @AmaiKinono)\n\n### Input elements\n\n- Improve navigation of `<select>` elements when using controller/keyboard navigation. #565 #566 (thanks @Paril)\n  - Scroll to the selected options as one is moving up or down the list.\n  - Scroll to the selected option when opening up the selection box.\n  - Add ability to programmatically [show or hide](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/element_packages/form.html#drop-down-select-box) the selection box.\n- Fix some layout and behavior issues of the `<select>` element. \n  - Fix issues related to specifying the height of the select arrow element. \n  - Fix an issue where the selection box would scroll to the top-left corner when the document layout is updated.\n- Fix an issue where the contents of the `<input type=\"text\">` and `<textarea>` elements could sometimes unintentionally scroll to a new place after a layout update.\n\n### Elements\n\n- Allow `Element::ScrollIntoView` to only scroll in the nearest scroll container, instead of all ancestor scroll containers, by using the new `ScrollParentage::Closest` scroll option.\n- Fix an issue where scrollbars could appear or disappear one frame after they should have changed visibility.\n\n### Documents\n\n- Expose `ElementDocument::FindNextTabElement` publicly.\n\n### Font engine\n\n- Fix rare placement of glyphs appearing below the baseline in some fonts, by using the bitmap bearing instead of the glyph metrics.\n\n### RML Parsing\n\n- Fix RML parsing of extra hyphen in closing comment, i.e. `--->` instead of `-->`. #681\n\n### Rendering\n\n- Fix incorrect clipping when using multiple contexts of different dimensions. #677 #680 (thanks @s1sw)\n\n### Backends\n\n- Update the SFML backend to support SFML 3, in addition to the existing SFML 2 support.\n  - By default, SFML 3 is preferred before SFML 2 during CMake configuration. To override the automatic selection, set the CMake variable `RMLUI_SFML_VERSION_MAJOR` to the desired version (2 or 3).\n- Update all SDL backends to support SDL 3, in addition to the existing SDL 2 support.\n  - By default, SDL 3 is preferred before SDL 2 during CMake configuration. To override the automatic selection, set the CMake variable `RMLUI_SDL_VERSION_MAJOR` to the desired version (2 or 3).\n- SDL 3-specific improvements:\n  - Enable high DPI support.\n  - Enable positioning of the input method editor (IME) to the text cursor.\n- Improvements to both SDL 2 and SDL 3:\n  - Keyboard is activated and deactivated when focusing text input fields.\n  - Text input events are only submitted when text input fields are focused.\n- `SDL_GL2`-specific improvements:\n  - GLEW is no longer required, and no longer linked to.\n  - Use OpenGL directly instead of the SDL renderer, just like the `SDL_GL3` renderer.\n\n### Plugins\n\n- Log warnings when SVG or Lottie files cannot be rendered. #687\n- Support for LunaSVG 3.0 with the SVG plugin.\n\n### Unit testing\n\n- Enable shell renderer with environment variable `RMLUI_TESTS_USE_SHELL=1` instead of compile definition.\n\n### Resource management\n\n- Avoid memory allocations during global initialization. #689\n  - Instead, explicitly start lifetime of globals during the call to `Rml::Initialise`.\n  - Thus, there should no longer be any memory allocations occurring before `main()` when linking to RmlUi.\n  - We now give a warning if there are objects in user space that refer to any RmlUi resources at the end of `Rml::Shutdown`, as this prevents the library from cleaning up memory pools.\n    - We make an exemption for `Rml::EventListener` as those are commonly kept around until after `Rml::Shutdown` which is considered reasonable.\n- Add manual release of render managers, `Rml::ReleaseRenderManagers`, to allow render interface to be destroyed before `Rml::Shutdown`. #703\n\n### Building\n\n- Remove `OpenGL::GL` dependency for GL3 backends. #684 (thanks @std-microblock)\n- Fix missing header in the GL3 renderer, causing a compilation error on Visual Studio 17.12.\n- Fix unit tests and missing sample data when building with Emscripten.\n- Libraries and archives will now be placed in the top-level binary directory, unless overridden by users or parent projects. This matches the existing runtime output directory.\n\n### Documentation\n\n- Improve readme code examples. #683 (thanks @std-microblock)\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- The target of the `<handle>` element will no longer move outside its containing block by default, see above for how to override this behavior.\n- Changed the signature of `MeshUtilities::GenerateBackground` and  `MeshUtilities::GenerateBackgroundBorder`.\n  - They now take the new `RenderBox` class as input. The `Element::GetRenderBox` method can be used to construct it.\n- Changed `ComputedValues::border_radius` to return an array instead of `Vector4f`.\n- `Rml::ReleaseMemoryPools` is no longer exposed publicly. This function is automatically called during shutdown and should not be used manually.\n- SDL backends: The SDL platform's `InputEventHandler` function now takes an additional parameter `window`. \n\n\n## RmlUi 6.0\n\n* [Advanced rendering features](#advanced-rendering-features)\n  * [New features](#new-features)\n  * [Screenshots](#screenshots)\n  * [Major overhaul of the render interface](#major-overhaul-of-the-render-interface)\n  * [Backward compatible render interface adapter](#backward-compatible-render-interface-adapter)\n  * [Render manager and resources](#render-manager-and-resources)\n  * [Limitations](#limitations)\n* [Major layout engine improvements](#major-layout-engine-improvements)\n  * [Detailed layout improvements](#detailed-layout-improvements)\n  * [Layout comparisons](#layout-comparisons)\n  * [General layout improvements](#general-layout-improvements)\n* [CMake modernization](#cmake-modernization)\n  * [New target names](#new-target-names)\n  * [New library filenames](#new-library-filenames)\n  * [New option names](#new-option-names)\n  * [New exported definitions](#new-exported-definitions)\n  * [CMake presets](#cmake-presets)\n* [Spatial navigation](#spatial-navigation)\n* [Text shaping and font engine](#text-shaping-and-font-engine)\n* [Elements](#elements)\n* [Text input widget](#text-input-widget)\n* [Utilities](#utilities)\n* [Data bindings](#data-bindings)\n* [Debugger plugin](#debugger-plugin)\n* [Lua plugin](#lua-plugin)\n* [System interface](#system-interface)\n* [General improvements](#general-improvements)\n* [General fixes](#general-fixes)\n* [Build improvements](#build-improvements)\n* [Backends](#backends)\n* [Breaking changes](#breaking-changes)\n\n### Advanced rendering features\n\nThis one has been a long time in the making, now the time has come for one of the biggest additions to the library. Advanced rendering effects are now available, including filters with blur support, box-shadow, advanced gradients, shaders, masks, and clipping of rounded borders.\n\nThe original issue is found in #307 and the pull request is #594. Thanks to everyone who provided feedback. Resolves #249, #253, #307, #597, and even addresses #1.\n\n#### New features\n\nNew properties:\n\n- `filter`:  Apply a rendering effect to the current element (including its children).\n  - Supported filters: `blur`, `drop-shadow`, `hue-rotate`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `grayscale`, `invert`, `opacity`, `sepia`. That is, all filters supported in CSS.\n- `backdrop-filter`: Apply a filter to anything that is rendered below the current element.\n- `mask-image`: Can be combined with any decorator, including images and gradients, to mask out any part of the current element (and its children) by multiplying their alpha channels.\n- `box-shadow`: With full support for offset, blur, spread, and insets.\n\nNew decorators:\n\n- `shader`: A generic decorator to pass a string to your renderer.\n- `linear-gradient`, `repeating-linear-gradient`\n- `radial-gradient`, `repeating-radial-gradient`\n- `conic-gradient`, `repeating-conic-gradient`\n\nThe gradients support most of the CSS features and syntax, including angle and `to <direction>` syntax for direction, multiple color stops, locations in length or percentage units, and up to two locations per color. Please see the [decorators documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/decorators.html#rmlui-decorators) for details.\n\n- The new rendering interface includes support for shaders, which enable the above decorators. Parsing is done in the library, but the backend renderer is the one implementing the actual shader code.\n\n- All filters and gradient decorators have full support for interpolation, that is, they can be animated. This is not yet implemented for box shadows.\n\n- Decorators can now take an extra keyword `<paint-area>` which is one of `border-box | padding-box | content-box`. The keyword indicates which area of the element the decorator should apply to. All built-in decorators are modified to support this property. For example: `decorator: linear-gradient(to top right, yellow, blue) border-box`.\n\n- [Custom filters](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/filters.html#custom-filters) can be created by users by deriving from `Filter` and `FilterInstancer`, analogous to how custom decorators are created.\n\n- Improved element clipping behavior. Handles more complicated cases, including nested transforms with hidden overflow, and clipping to the curved edge of elements with border-radius. This requires clip mask support in the renderer.\n\nThe [documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/) has been updated to reflect the new features, including the new decorators and properties, with examples and screenshots. The new features are also demonstrated in the new `effects` sample, so please check that out.\n\nFor now, only the OpenGL 3 renderer implements all new rendering features. All other backends have been updated to work with the updated render interface but with their old feature set. For users with custom backends, please see the updated [render interface documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/interfaces/render.html) in particular. Here, you will also find a table detailing exactly which functions must be implemented to support particular RCSS features.\n\nHere are some quick RCSS examples taken from the documentation.\n\n```css\ndecorator: linear-gradient(to bottom, #00f3, #0001, #00f3), linear-gradient(to top right, red, blue);\ndecorator: radial-gradient(circle farthest-side at center, #ff6b6b, #fec84d, #4ecdc4);\ndecorator: repeating-conic-gradient(from 90deg, #ffd700, #f06, #ffd700 180deg);\ndecorator: shader(\"my_shader\") border-box;\n\nfilter: brightness(1.2) hue-rotate(90deg) drop-shadow(#f33f 30px 20px 5px);\nbackdrop-filter: blur(10px);\n\nbox-shadow: #f008 40px 30px 0px 0px, #00f8 -40px -30px 0px 0px;\nmask-image: conic-gradient(from 45deg, black, transparent, black), image(\"star.png\" cover);\n```\n\n#### Screenshots\n\nCollage of advanced effects: \n\n![Advanced effects demonstration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71840d6f-903e-45fe-9e34-a02ed1ddae07)\n\nMasking principles and demonstration:\n\n![Mask imaging and demonstration](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUiDoc/blob/3854487d65b94ddb6e932ae02f5cef85365003f6/assets/images/mask-image.png?raw=true)\n\nImproved clipping behavior of nested and transformed elements (also showing improved layouting of positioned boxes):\n\n![Clipping comparison of nested and transformed elements](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0ce1123-8c9d-4fbf-8bab-41e63cc332c7)\n\nImproved clipping with border-radius:\n\n![Clipping comparison of elements with border-radius](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b944c69a-1b40-4932-9c62-2d4365154d5c)\n\nDemonstration of the `effects` sample: \n\n[Effects sample video](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/assets/5490330/bdc0422d-867d-4090-9d48-e7159e3adc18)\n\n#### Major overhaul of the render interface\n\nThe render interface has been simplified to ease implementation of basic rendering functionality, while extended to enable the new advanced rendering effects. The new effects are fully opt-in, and can be enabled iteratively to support the features that are most desired for your project. See the updated [render interface documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/interfaces/render.html) for how to implement the new functionality. The documentation includes a table detailing which functions must be implemented to support specific RCSS features.\n\nHighlighted changes:\n\n- Now using safer, modern types (like span).\n- A clear separation between required functions for basic functionality, and optional features for advanced rendering effects. The required functions are now pure virtual.\n- All colors are now submitted as 8-bit sRGBA (like before), but with premultiplied alpha (new). Existing renderers should modify their blending modes accordingly. This change is central to correct blending of partially transparent layers.\n- All geometry is now compiled before it can be rendered, which helps to simplify the interface.\n  - Now the pointers to the geometry data (vertices and indices) are guaranteed to be available and immutable until the same geometry is released. Thus, users can simply store the views to this data, and reuse that during rendering, which should help considerably for users migrating from the immediate rendering function.\n- The scissor region should now be applied separately from any active transform. Previously, we would have to manually redirect the scissor to a stencil operation, that is no longer the case. Instead, the clipping with transform is now handled by the library, and directed to the clip mask functionality of the render interface as appropriate.\n- Expanded functionality to enable the new rendering effects, including layered rendering, rendering to texture, rendering with filters and shaders.\n- Textures are no longer part of the compiled geometry, compiled geometry can be rendered with different textures or shaders.\n\n#### Backward compatible render interface adapter\n\nThe render interface changes will require updates for all users writing their own render interface implementation. To smooth the transition, there is a fully backward-compatible adapter for old render interfaces, please see [RenderInterfaceCompatibility.h](Include/RmlUi/Core/RenderInterfaceCompatibility.h).\n\n1. In your legacy RenderInterface implementation, derive from `Rml::RenderInterfaceCompatibility` instead of\n   `Rml::RenderInterface`.\n   ```cpp\n       #include <RmlUi/Core/RenderInterfaceCompatibility.h>\n       class MyRenderInterface : public Rml::RenderInterfaceCompatibility { ... };\n\t```\n2. Use the adapted interface when setting the RmlUi render interface.\n   ```cpp\n       Rml::SetRenderInterface(my_render_interface.GetAdaptedInterface());\n   ```\n\nThat's it, and your old renderer should now still work!\n\nIt can also be useful to take a closer look at the adapter before migrating your own renderer to the new interface, to see which changes are necessary. Naturally, this adapter won't support any of the new rendering features.\n\nFor demonstration purposes, there are two built-in backends implementing the adapter: [`BackwardCompatible_GLFW_GL2`](./Backends/RmlUi_BackwardCompatible/RmlUi_Renderer_BackwardCompatible_GL2.cpp) and [`BackwardCompatible_GLFW_GL3`](./Backends/RmlUi_BackwardCompatible/RmlUi_Renderer_BackwardCompatible_GL3.cpp). Each of the backends use a direct copy of their respective render interface from RmlUi 5.1, only with the above instructions applied. Please take a look if you want to see some examples on how to use this adapter.\n\n#### Render manager and resources\n\nA new RenderManager is introduced to manage resources and other rendering state. Users don't normally have to interact with this, but for contributors, and for more advanced usages, such as custom decorators, this implies several changes.\n\nThe RenderManager can be considered a wrapper around the render interface. All internal calls to the render interface should now go through this class.\n\nResources from the render interface are now wrapped as unique render resources, which are move-only types that automatically clean up after themselves when they go out of scope. This considerably helps resource management. This also implies changes to many central rendering types.\n\n- `Mesh`: A new type holding indices and vertices. Can be constructed directly or from MeshUtilities (previously GeometryUtilities).\n- `Geometry`: Is now a unique resource holding a compiled geometry handle, and constructed from a Mesh, taking ownership of the mesh's data.\n- `Texture`: Now simply a non-owning view and can be freely copied. The underlying file texture is owned by the render manager, and held throughout the manager's lifetime.\n- `CallbackTexture`: In contrast, this is a unique render resource, automatically released when out of scope.\n\nSee [this commit message](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/commit/a452f26951f9450d484496cccdfad9c94b3fd294) for more details.\n\n#### Limitations\n\nFilters will only render based on geometry that is visible on-screen. Thus, some filters may be cut off. As an example, an element that is partly clipped with a drop-shadow may have its drop-shadow also clipped, even if it is fully visible. On the other hand, box shadows should always be rendered properly, as they are rendered off-screen and stored in a texture.\n\n### Major layout engine improvements\n\n- Make layout more conformant to CSS specification.\n  - Rewritten inline layout engine.\n  - Fixed more than a hundred CSS tests, including ACID1.\n- Improve readability and maintainability:\n  - Better separation of classes, reduce available state.\n  - Make classes better conform to CSS terminology.\n  - Improve call-graph, flow from parent to child, avoid mutable calls into ancestors.\n- Fix long-standing issues.\n  - Allow tables and flexboxes to be absolutely positioned or floated.\n  - Allow nested flexboxes: Flex items can now be flex containers themselves. #320\n  - Better handling of block-level boxes in inline formatting contexts. #392\n\n#### Detailed layout improvements\n\nHere is a more detailed change list resulting from the rewritten inline formatting engine, and some related changes.\n\n- Corrected the baseline of fonts, they should now line up better.\n- Inline layout now properly uses font metrics as appropriate, even without any text contents.\n  - In particular, vertical alignment now considers font ascent and descent.\n  - This might make some lines taller. In particular, inline-level boxes that are placed on the baseline will now make space for the font descent below the baseline.\n- Improved baselines for inline-block boxes.\n- Content height of inline boxes no longer depend on their `line-height` property, only font metrics.\n- Block formatting contexts (BFC) now work like in CSS: Floated boxes share space and interact within the same BFC, and never outside of it.\n  - Certain properties cause the element to establish a new BFC, such as overflow != visible, and the new `display: flow-root` value.\n  - Milestone: We now pass ACID1!\n- Relative positioning now works in other formatting contexts and situations. #471\n  - Including for inline, flex, table, and floated elements, in addition to block boxes like before.\n  - Also, nested relative elements are now correctly positioned.\n- Containing blocks are now determined more like in CSS, particularly for absolute elements.\n  - Only elements which are positioned, or with local transform or perspective, establishes an absolute containing block.\n- An overflowing element's scroll region no longer has its padding added to the region.\n  - Elements are checked for overflowing the padding box instead of the content box, before enabling scrollbars.\n  - The border box of floats will now be considered for overflow, instead of their margin box.\n- Fix some replaced elements (e.g. textarea) not rendering correctly in several situations, such as when set to block display, floated, or absolutely positioned.\n- Improve shrink-to-fit width, now includes floating children when determining width.\n- Margins of absolutely positioned elements now better account for inset (top/right/bottom/left) properties.\n- Support for new [`display`](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/visual_formatting_model.html#display) values: `flow-root`, `inline-flex`, `inline-table`.\n- Support for the value [`vertical-align: center`](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#valdef-baseline-shift-center).\n- Stacking contexts are now established in a way that more closely aligns with CSS.\n- Improve the paint order of elements.\n  - Render all stacking context children after the current element's background and decoration. This change is consistent with the CSS paint order. Additionally, it leads to simpler code and less state change, particularly when combined with the advanced rendering effects.\n\nPlease see the list of breaking changes and solutions at the end of the changelog. \n\n#### Layout comparisons\n\nHere are some screenshots demonstrating the layout improvements.\n\n![inline-formatting-01-mix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f27ce0ef-2150-4545-9af2-eca65f1fc02a)\n\nThe above example demonstrates a variety of inline formatting details, with nested elements and borders ([fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/kmouse/etpnu6rb/55/)). We now match nicely with web browsers in such situations. The old behavior has several issues, in particular the elements are not aligned correctly and the border is broken off too early. Note that Firefox in these examples uses a different font, so expect some differences for that reason.\n\n![inline-formatting-04-mix](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f547e44d-9a1b-4053-b2e2-4d2efaf9cd5b)\n\nThe above shows tests for line splits and borders in particular ([fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/kmouse/nvscbmoy/5/)). The old behavior is almost comically broken. The new behavior has for the most part been written from scratch following the CSS specifications, and turns out to nicely match up with Firefox.\n\n![inline-formatting-aligned-subtree](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c275519d-6e9d-4927-8965-b048ccc615f7)\n\nFinally, this example tests vertical alignment of inline boxes, and particularly the concept of aligned subtrees ([fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/kmouse/h3c5muyL/7/)). Again, we now nicely align with Firefox. The old behavior looks like it just gave up in the middle. I included Chrome here too, since I find it interesting how different it behaves compared to Firefox. In fact, I found a lot of these differences while testing various nuances of inline formatting. In this case, I am quite convinced that Firefox (and we) are doing the right thing and Chrome is not following the specifications.\n\n#### General layout improvements\n\n- Scale pixels-per-inch (PPI) units based on the context's dp-ratio. #468 (thanks @Dakror)\n- Make flex containers and tables with fixed width work in shrink-to-fit contexts. #520\n- Compute shrink-to-fit width for flex boxes. #559 #577 (thanks @alml)\n- Add the `space-evenly` value to flex box properties `justify-content` and `align-content`. #585 (thanks @LucidSigma)\n- Implement the [`gap` property](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/flexboxes.html#gap) for flexboxes. #621 (thanks @ChrisFloofyKitsune)\n- Flexbox: Consider intrinsic sizes when determining flex base size, fixes an assertion error. #640\n\n### CMake modernization\n\nThe CMake code has been fully rewritten with modern practices. Special thanks to @hobyst who laid the groundwork for this change, with a solid foundation and great guidelines. #198 #446 #551 #606 (thanks @hobyst)\n\nWhile modernizing our CMake code, it was clear that we also needed to change our naming conventions. This leads to quite significant breaking changes for building and linking, but the result should make the library a lot easier to work with and link to.\n\nWe now try to support all setups including:\n\n1. Adding the library as a subdirectory directly from CMake.\n2. Building the library \"in-source\" without installing.\n3. Building and installing the library.\n4. Using pre-built Windows binaries.\n\nIt should be a lot easier now to simply point to the built library or sources, and have everything link correctly.\n\nAnd naturally, we will continue to support package managers however we can, and that is still considered the default recommendation. However, for the most part we rely on contributors to keep supporting this. Please help out with your favorite package manager if you see missing versions, or room for improvements.\n\nLarge parts of the CI workflows have also been rewritten to accommodate these changes. Most of the Windows building and packaging procedures have been moved from Appveyor to GitHub Actions, which streamlines our testing and also helps speed up the CI builds.\n\nThe [build documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/building_with_cmake.html) has been updated to reflect all the new changes.\n\n#### New target names\n\nWe now export the following targets:\n\n| Target          | Old target  | Description                                                     |\n|-----------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|\n| RmlUi::RmlUi    |             | Includes all sub-libraries of the project, as listed just below |\n| RmlUi::Core     | RmlCore     | The main library                                                |\n| RmlUi::Debugger | RmlDebugger | The debugger library                                            |\n| RmlUi::Lua      | RmlLua      | The Lua plugin (when enabled)                                   |\n\nWhen including RmlUi as a subdirectory, the targets are constructed as aliases. When using pre-built or installed binaries, they are constructed using imported targets, which are available through the exported build targets.\n\nThe internal target names have also been changed, although they are typically only needed when exploring or developing the library. They are all lowercase and contain the prefix `rmlui_` to avoid colliding with names in any parent projects. Some examples are: `rmlui_core`, `rmlui_debugger`, `rmlui_sample_invaders`, `rmlui_tutorial_drag`, `rmlui_unit_tests`, and `rmlui_visual_tests`.\n\n#### New library filenames\n\nThe library binaries have also changed names. These names would be suffixed by e.g. `.dll` on Windows, and so on.\n\n| Library          | Old library   | Description                   |\n|------------------|---------------|-------------------------------|\n| `rmlui`          | `RmlCore`     | The core (main) library       |\n| `rmlui_debugger` | `RmlDebugger` | The debugger library          |\n| `rmlui_lua`      | `RmlLua`      | The Lua plugin (when enabled) |\n\n#### New option names\n\nWe have a new set of CMake naming conventions for the library:\n\n- Use `RMLUI_` prefix to make all options specific to this project easily identifiable, and avoid colliding with any parent project variables.\n- Do not include negations (such as \"not\" and \"disable\"), to avoid situations with double negation.\n- Do not include a verb prefix (such as \"enable\" and \"build\"), as these are often superfluous.\n\nThe following table lists all the new option names.\n\n| Option                             | Default value | Old related option             | Comment                                                                                                                                 |\n|------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| RMLUI_BACKEND                      | auto          | SAMPLES_BACKEND                |                                                                                                                                         |\n| RMLUI_COMPILER_OPTIONS             | ON            |                                | Automatically sets recommended compiler flags                                                                                           |\n| RMLUI_CUSTOM_CONFIGURATION         | OFF           | CUSTOM_CONFIGURATION           |                                                                                                                                         |\n| RMLUI_CUSTOM_CONFIGURATION_FILE    |               | CUSTOM_CONFIGURATION_FILE      |                                                                                                                                         |\n| RMLUI_CUSTOM_INCLUDE_DIRS          |               | CUSTOM_INCLUDE_DIRS            |                                                                                                                                         |\n| RMLUI_CUSTOM_LINK_LIBRARIES        |               | CUSTOM_LINK_LIBRARIES          |                                                                                                                                         |\n| RMLUI_CUSTOM_RTTI                  | OFF           | DISABLE_RTTI_AND_EXCEPTIONS    | No longer modifies compiler flags -

This determines how the focus is moved when pressing one of the navigation direction buttons. #142 #519 #524 (thanks @gleblebedev)\n\n- Add the new properties `nav-up`, `nav-right`, `nav-down`, `nav-left`, and shorthand `nav`.\n- Add [`:focus-visible` pseudo class](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/selectors.html#pseudo-selectors) as a way to style elements that should be highlighted during navigation, like its equivalent CSS selector.\n- The `invaders` sample implements this feature for full keyboard navigation, and uses `:focus-visible` to highlight the focus.\n- Elements in focus are now clicked when pressing space bar.\n\nRCSS example usage:\n\n```css\ninput { nav: auto; nav-right: #ok_button; }\n.menu_item { nav: vertical; border: #000 3px; }\n.menu_item:focus-visible { border-color: #ff3; }\n```\n\n### Text shaping and font engine\n\n- Add `lang` and `dir` RML attributes, along with text shaping support in the font engine interface. #563 (thanks @LucidSigma)\n- Create a sample for text shaping with Harfbuzz, including right-to-left text formatting. #568 #211 #588 (thanks @LucidSigma)\n  - Implement fallback font support for the Harfbuzz sample. #635 (thanks @LucidSigma)\n- Add support for the [`letter-spacing` property](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/text.html#letter-spacing). #429 (thanks @igorsegallafa)\n- Add initialize and shutdown procedures to font engine interface for improved lifetime management. #583\n\nScreenshots of the HarfBuzz sample showing Arabic text properly rendered with the HarfBuzz font engine, and compared to the default font engine:\n\n![HarfBuzz font engine vs default font engine comparison](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67b22875-e504-49c2-b449-3f3e4367d991)\n\n\n### Elements\n\n- Enable removal of properties using shorthand names. #463 (thanks @aimoonchen)\n- Add [`Element::Matches`](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/elements.html#dom-interface), the last missing selector-related function. #573 (thanks @Paril)\n- `Element::GetInnerRML` now includes the local style properties set on the element in the returned RML.\n- Tab set: Allow `ElementTabSet::RemoveTab` to work on tab sets with no panels. #546 (thanks @exjam)\n- Range input: Fix a bug where the bar position was initially placed wrong when using min and max attributes.\n\n### Text input widget\n\nThe following improvements apply to both the textarea and text input elements.\n\n- Add [input method editor (IME)](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/ime.html) support. #541 #630 (thanks @ShawnCZek)\n  - The text input widget implements the new `TextInputContext` interface, backends can interact with this by implementing the [`TextInputHandler` interface](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/interfaces/text_input_handler.html) for IME support. \n  - Add native IME support to Win32 backends (`Win32_GL2` and `Win32_VK`).\n  - Add new sample `rmlui_sample_ime` to demonstrate IME support (only enabled on supported backends).\n- Add support for the `text-align` property in text inputs. #454 #455 (thanks @Dakror)\n- Fix clipboard being pasted when Ctrl + Alt + V key combination is used. #464 #465 (thanks @ShawnCZek)\n- Fix selection index possibly returning an invalid index. #539 (thanks @ShawnCZek)\n- Move the input cursor when the selection range changes. #542 (thanks @ShawnCZek)\n- Ignore selection range update when the element is not focused. #544 (thanks @ShawnCZek)\n- Text area elements now clip to their padding area instead of the content area, text input elements still clip to their content area (see [58581477](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/commit/58581477a7c41cd2d163b306ae8c8fe0a04de9d2) for details).\n- Improve text widget navigation and selection (see [be9a497b](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/commit/be9a497b508bc7598ea22198577e7fb1f0ddf357) for details).\n- The text cursor is no longer drawn when selecting text.\n- Consume key events with modifiers (ctrl, shift) to prevent event propagation and subsequently performing navigation.\n- Fix some cases where the scroll offset would alternate each time the text cursor was moved, causing rendering to flicker.\n- Use rounded line height to make render output more stable when scrolling vertically.\n\nIME sample screenshot:\n\n![IME sample screenshots](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUiDoc/blob/3ec50d400babb58bf4c79f26ac2454a2833bd95d/assets/images/ime_sample.png)\n\n### Utilities\n\n- Improved mesh utilities to construct background geometry for any given box area of the element, including for elements with border-radius, see [`MeshUtilities.h`](./Include/RmlUi/Core/MeshUtilities.h).\n- New [`Rectangle`](./Include/RmlUi/Core/Rectangle.h) type to better represent many operations.\n- Visual tests:\n  - Several new visual tests for the new features.\n  - Highlight differences when comparing to previous capture by holding shift key.\n  - Replace CMake options with [environment variables](./Tests/readme.md).\n\n### Data bindings\n\n- Enable arbitrary expressions in data address lookups. #547 #550 (thanks @Dakror and @exjam)\n- Add enum support to variants and data bindings. #445 (thanks @Dakror)\n- Allow nested data models. #484 (thanks @Dakror)\n- Fix XML parse error if single curly brace encountered at the end of a data binding string literal. #459 (thanks @Dakror)\n- Fix usage of data variables in selected `option`s. #509 #510 (thanks @Dakror)\n\n### Debugger plugin\n\n- Display the axis-aligned bounding box of selected elements, including any transforms and box shadows (white box).\n- List [box model sizes](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/debugger.html#element-info) for the selected element.\n- Log an error message when externally closing documents owned by the debugger plugin.\n- Debugger now works with documents that have modal focus. #642\n\n### Lua plugin\n\n- Add CMake option [`RMLUI_LUA_BINDINGS_LIBRARY`](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/building_with_cmake.html#plugins-and-dependencies) to link to the Lua library compiled as C++, or to LuaJIT. #604 (thanks @LiquidFenrir)\n- Add `StopImmediatePropagation` to Rml::Event. #466 (thanks @ShawnCZek)\n- Return inserted element from `AppendChild` and `InsertBefore`. #478 (thanks @ShawnCZek)\n\n### System interface\n\n- The system interface is now optional. All functions now have a default implementation. Thus, it is no longer necessary to derive from and set this interface unless you want to customize its functionality.\n- The default log output is now used when there is no system interface installed. All print-like calls, including those in backends, are now submitted to the built-in logger.\n- Fix the `JoinPath` method so that it is passed through when using the debugger plugin. #462 #603 (thanks @Dakror)\n\n### General improvements\n\n- Add repeat fit modes to the [image decorator](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/decorators/image.html), e.g. `decorator: image(alien.png repeat)`. #259 #493 (thanks @viseztrance)\n- Implement the ability to release specific textures from memory using `Rml::ReleaseTexture`. #543 (thanks @viseztrance)\n- Add support for the `not` prefix in media queries. #564 (thanks @Paril)\n- Use string parser to allow \"quotes\" in sprite sheet `src` property. #571 #574 (thanks @andreasschultes)\n- Format color types using RCSS hexadecimal notation.\n- `CreateString` and `FormatString` methods no longer take a `max_size` argument, as this is now handled automatically.\n- Allow using `margin` to offset the `scrollbarcorner`.\n- Log a warning when a texture could not be loaded.\n- Improve text culling.\n  - Previously, the text could be culled (that is, not rendered) even if it was visible due to transforms bringing it into view. Now, text culling properly considers the transform of the element. \n  - The text is now culled when the element is outside the viewport even if no scissor region is active.\n\n### General fixes\n\n- Fix wrong logic for assertion of released textures. #589 (thanks @pgruenbacher)\n- Fix in-source documentation in Factory. #646 (thanks @ben-metzger-z)\n- Fix some situations where the scroll offset of an element would reset or change after layout updates. #452\n- Fix some situations where units were not shown in properties, now all invoked types are ensured to define a string converter.\n- In `demo` sample, fix form submit animation not playing smoothly on power saving mode.\n- Fix crash on shutdown in `bitmap_font` sample.\n- Fix being able to drag through the scroll track of a scrollbar.\n- Fix being able to scroll in a direction with hidden overflow.\n\n### Build improvements\n\n- Fix compilation issues on newer Clang and GCC releases due to mixed use of std namespace on standard integer types. #470 #545 #555\n- Fix `UnitTests` compilation error on MSVC by updating doctest. #491 (thanks @mwl4)\n- Fix `Benchmarks` compilation error when using custom string type. #490 (thanks @mwl4)\n- Change `StringUtilities::DecodeRml` to improve compatibility with other string types, like `EASTL::string`. #472 #475 (thanks @gleblebedev)\n- Various CMake fixes for MacOS. #525 (thanks @NaLiJa)\n- Fix include paths. #533 #643 (thanks @gleblebedev and @Paril)\n- Improve integration of the Tracy library in CMake. #516 #518\n  - Added CMake options for enabling (1) a separate configuration in multi-config mode with `RMLUI_TRACY_CONFIGURATION`, and (2) the memory profiler by overriding global operators new/delete using `RMLUI_TRACY_MEMORY_PROFILING`.\n- Make test executables work with Emscripten.\n\n### Backends\n\n- OpenGL 3: Restore all modified state after rendering a frame. #449 (thanks @reworks-org)\n- OpenGL 3: Add depth test to OpenGL state backup. #629 (thanks @ben-metzger-z)\n- OpenGL 3: Set forward compatibility flag to fix running on MacOS. #522 (thanks @NaLiJa)\n- Vulkan: Several fixes for validation errors and flickering behavior. #593 #601 (thanks @wh1t3lord)\n- Vulkan: Update deprecated debug utilities. #579 (thanks @skaarj1989)\n- GLFW: Use new GLFW 3.4 cursors when available.\n- GLFW: Fix mouse position conversion to pixel coordinates, particularly on MacOS retina displays. #521\n- SDL: Use performance counters for increased time precision. \n- Win32: Center window in screen when opening it.\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n#### CMake and linking\n\n- Most options, target names, library filenames, and certain exported definitions, have been changed. Please see the tables above.\n- CMake minimum version raised to 3.10.\n\n#### Layout\n\nExpect some possible layout shifts in existing documents, mainly due to better CSS conformance. Detailed notes are available above. Here are some particular situations where layout output may change, and ways to address them:\n\n- Some lines may become taller, with extra spacing added below its baseline.\n  - Possible solutions: Adjust the `vertical-align` property of any inline block elements on the line. For example, use top/center/bottom or manual vertical alignment. The line height itself can be adjusted with the `line-height` property.\n- Absolutely positioned elements may be placed relative to an element further up in the document tree.\n  - Add `position: relative` on the desired ancestor to establish its containing block.\n- The containing block size may change in some situations, which could affect percentages in (min-/max-) height properties.\n  - To establish a containing block size, make their parent have a definite (non-auto) height.\n- Some floated elements may have moved or now extend below parent boxes.\n  - Set the parent to use overflow != visible to establish a new block formatting context, or use the new `display: flow-root`.\n- Paint order on some elements may have changed.\n  - Change the tree order, or the `z-index` or `clip` properties as appropriate.\n- Size of shrink-to-fit boxes may have changed.\n- Position of documents with margins may have changed.\n- Documents that don't have their size set will now shrink to their contents, previously they would span the entire context.\n  - The size can be set either directly using the `width` and `height` properties, or implicitly by a combination of the\n    `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` properties.\n\n#### Elements\n\n- The text area element now clips to its padding area instead of the content area. You may want to adjust RCSS rules to account for this. If you use decorators to display borders for text areas, you can set the decorator paint area to `border-box` and add a transparent border, e.g. `decorator: image(my-textarea-background) border-box; border: 4px transparent;`.\n\n#### Core types\n\n- Changed `Box` enums and `Property` units as follows, now using strong types:\n  - `Box::Area` -> `BoxArea` (e.g. `Box::BORDER` -> `BoxArea::Border`, values now in pascal case).\n  - `Box::Edge` -> `BoxEdge` (e.g. `Box::TOP` -> `BoxEdge::Top`, values now in pascal case).\n  - `Box::Direction` -> `BoxDirection` (e.g. `Box::VERTICAL` -> `BoxDirection::Vertical`, values now in pascal case).\n  - `Property::Unit` -> `Unit` (e.g. `Property::PX` -> `Unit::PX`).\n\n#### Core functions\n\n- Changed the signature of `LoadFontFace` (from memory) to take a `Span` instead of a raw pointer. \n- Replaced `Element::ResolveNumericProperty` with `Element::ResolveLength` and `Element::ResolveNumericValue`. Can be used together with `Property::GetNumericValue`.\n- Renamed and removed several `Math` functions.\n- Removed the `max_size` argument from `CreateString` and `FormatString` methods, this is no longer needed.\n\n#### RCSS\n\n- The old `gradient` decorator has been deprecated, instead one can now use `horizontal-gradient` and `vertical-gradient`, thereby replacing the keyword to indicate direction. Please also see the new gradient decorators (linear, radial, and conic) above.\n\n#### Render interface\n\nAffects all users with a custom backend renderer.\n\n- Signature changes to several functions, see notes above and the [updated documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/interfaces/render.html).\n- See `RenderInterfaceCompatibility` notes above for an adapter from the old render interface.\n- Texture is no longer part of the CompileGeometry command, instead it is submitted with the Render... command(s).\n- The immediate rendering function has been removed in favor of the compiled geometry version.\n  - However, data pointers to the compile function are now stable, which should ease the transition.\n- Implementing the new clip mask API is required for handling clipping of transformed elements.\n- RmlUi now provides vertex colors and generated texture data in premultiplied alpha.\n  - Set the blend mode to handle them accordingly. It is recommended to convert your own textures to use premultiplied alpha. This ensures correct compositing, especially with layers and effects.\n- Font effect color output now assumes premultiplied alpha. Color channels are initialized to black (previously white).\n\n#### Render manager\n\nAffects users with custom decorators and other more advanced usage with rendering commands.\n\n- RenderManager should now be used for all rendering instead of directly calling into the render interface.\n- Redefine Geometry, introduce Mesh.\n  - Mesh is used to define vertices and indices, before it is submitted to construct a Geometry through the render manager.\n  - Geometry is now a wrapper around the underlying geometry (to be) submitted to a render interface.\n    - Move-only type which automatically releases its underlying resource when out of scope.\n  - GeometryUtilities (class and header file) renamed to MeshUtilities.\n    - Signatures changed to operate safely on a mesh instead of using raw pointers.\n  - Geometry no longer stores a Texture, it must be submitted during rendering.\n- Redefine Texture.\n  - This class is now simply a non-owning view of either a file texture or a callback texture.\n  - CallbackTexture is a uniquely owned wrapper around such a texture.\n  - These are constructed through the render manager.\n  - File textures are owned by and retained by the render manager throughout its lifetime, released during its destruction.\n- Decorator interface: GenerateElementData has a new paint area parameter.\n- Moved DecoratorInstancer into the Decorator files.\n\n#### Font engine interface\n\nThe font engine interface has been reworked to encompass new features, to simplify, and to modernize. \n\n- Font metrics are now collected into a single function.\n- Signature changes due to text shaping and letter-spacing support.\n- The active render manager is now passed into the appropriate functions to generate textures against this one.\n- Now using span and string view types where appropriate.\n\n#### Removed deprecated functionality\n\n- Removed the `<datagrid>` and `<dataselect>` elements, related utilities, and associated tutorials. Users are encouraged to replace this functionality by [tables](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/tables.html), [select boxes](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rml/forms.html#select), and [data bindings](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/data_bindings.html).\n\n\n## RmlUi 5.1\n\n### New scrolling features\n\n#### Autoscroll mode\nAutoscroll mode, or scrolling with the middle mouse button, is now featured in RmlUi. #422 #423 (thanks @igorsegallafa)\n\nThis mode is automatically enabled by the context whenever a middle mouse button press is detected, and there is an element to scroll under the mouse. There is also support for holding the middle mouse button to scroll. \n\nWhen autoscroll mode is active, a cursor name is submitted to clients which indicates the state of the autoscroll, so that clients can display an appropriate cursor to the user. These cursor names all start with `rmlui-scroll-`, and take priority over any active `cursor` property. If desired, autoscroll mode can be disabled entirely by simply not submitting middle mouse button presses, or by using another button index when submitting the button to the context. \n\nSee the new [documentation section on scrolling](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/contexts.html#scrolling) for details.\n\n#### Smooth scrolling\nSmooth scrolling is now supported in RmlUi, and enabled by default. This makes certain scroll actions animate smoothly towards its destination. Smooth scrolling may become active in the following situations:\n\n- During a call to `Context::ProcessMouseWheel()`.\n- When clicking a scrollbar's arrow keys or track.\n- When calling any of the `Element::Scroll...()` methods with the `ScrollBehavior::Smooth` enum value.\n\nSmooth scrolling can be disabled or tweaked on the context, as described below.\n\n#### Context interface\nSmooth scrolling can be disabled, or tweaked, by calling the following method on a given context:\n```cpp\nvoid Context::SetDefaultScrollBehavior(ScrollBehavior scroll_behavior, float speed_factor);\n```\nHere, smooth scrolling can be disabled by submitting the `ScrollBehavior::Instant` enum value. The scrolling speed can also be tweaked by adjusting the speed factor.\n\nThe function signature of `Context::ProcessMouseWheel` has been replaced with the following, to enable scrolling in both dimensions:\n```cpp\nbool Context::ProcessMouseWheel(Vector2f wheel_delta, int key_modifier_state);\n```\nThe old single axis version is still available for backward compatibility, but considered deprecated and may be removed in the future.\n\n#### Element interface\nAdded\n```cpp\nvoid Element::ScrollTo(Vector2f offset, ScrollBehavior behavior = ScrollBehavior::Instant);\n```\nwhich scrolls the element to the given coordinates, with the ability to use smooth scrolling. Similarly, `Element::ScrollIntoView` has been updated with the ability to perform smooth scrolling (instant by default).\n\n#### Scroll events\nThe `mousescroll` event no longer performs scrolling on an element, and no longer requires a default action. Instead, the responsibility for mouse scrolling has been moved to the context and its scroll controller. However, the `mousescroll` event is still submitted during a mouse wheel action, with the option to cancel the scroll by stopping its propagation. The event is now also submitted before initiating autoscroll mode, with the possibility to cancel it.\n\n### New RCSS features\n\n- New [`overscroll-behavior` property](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/user_interface.html#overscroll-behavior). An element's closest scrollable ancestor is decided by scroll chaining, which can be controlled using this property. The `contain` value can be used to ensure that mouse wheel scrolling is not propagated outside a given element, regardless of whether its scrollbars are visible.\n- Added animation support for decorators. #421 (thanks @0suddenly0)\n- Sibling selectors will now also match hidden elements.\n\n### On-demand rendering (power saving mode)\n\nIn games, the update and render loop normally run as fast as possible. However, in some applications it is desirable to reduce CPU usage and power consumption when the application is idle. RmlUi now provides the necessary utilities to achieve this. Implemented in #436 (thanks @Thalhammer), see also #331 #417 #430.\n\nUsers of RmlUi control their own update loop, however, this feature requires some support from the library side, because the application needs to know e.g. when animations are happening or when a text cursor should blink. In short, to implement this, users can now query the context for `Context::GetNextUpdateDelay()`, which returns the time until the next update loop should be run again.\n\nSee the [on-demand rendering documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/contexts.html#on-demand-rendering) for details and examples.\n\n### Text selection interface\n\nAdded the ability to set or retrieve the text selection on text fields. #419\n\nIn particular, the following methods are now available on `ElementFormControlInput` (`<input>` elements) and `ElementFormControlTextArea` (`<textarea>` elements):\n\n```cpp\n// Selects all text.\nvoid Select();\n// Selects the text in the given character range.\nvoid SetSelectionRange(int selection_start, int selection_end);\n// Retrieves the selection range and text.\nvoid GetSelection(int* selection_start, int* selection_end, String* selected_text) const;\n```\n\nSee the [form controls documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/element_packages/form.html#text-selection) for details.\n\n### RML and form element improvements\n\n- Add RML support for numeric character reference (Unicode escape sequences). #401 (thanks @dakror)\n- Make the `:checked` pseudo class active on the `<select>` element whenever its options list is open, for better styling capabilities.\n- Fix max length in text input fields not always clamping the value, such as when pasting text.\n- The slider input now only responds to the primary mouse button.\n- The slider input is now only draggable from the track or bar, instead of the whole element.\n- Fixed input elements not always being correctly setup when changing types.\n\n### Data bindings\n\n- Add new [data-alias attribute](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/data_bindings/views_and_controllers.html#data-alias) to make templates work with outside variables. #432 (thanks @dakror)\n- Add method to retrieve the `DataTypeRegister` during model construction. #412 #413 (thanks @LoneBoco)\n- Add ability to provide a separate data type register to use when constructing a new data model. Can be useful to provide a distinct type register for each shared library accessing the same context. Alternatively, allows different contexts to share a single type register. #409 (thanks @eugeneko)\n\n### Lua plugin\n\n- Make the Lua plugin compatible with Lua 5.1+ and LuaJIT. #387 (thanks @mrianura)\n- Updated to include the new text selection API. #434 #435 (thanks @ShawnCZek)\n\n### Backends\n\n- Vulkan renderer: Fix various Vulkan issues on Linux. #430 (thanks @Thalhammer)\n- GL3 renderer: Unbind the vertex array after use to avoid possible crash. #411\n\n### Stability improvements\n\n- Fix a potential crash during plugin shutdown. #415 (thanks @LoneBoco)\n\n### Build improvements\n\n- Improve CMake to better support RmlUi included as a subdirectory of a parent project. #394 #395 #397 (thanks @cathaysia)\n- Fix possible name clashes causing build failures during argument-dependent lookup (ADL). #418 #420 (thanks @mwl4)\n\n### Built-in containers\n\n- Replaced custom containers based on chobo-shl with equivalent ones from [itlib](https://github.com/iboB/itlib). #402 (thanks @iboB)\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Scrolling behavior changed, increased default mouse wheel scroll length, and enabled smooth scrolling by default. See notes above.\n- The `mousescroll` event no longer scrolls an element. Its `wheel_delta` parameter has been renamed to `wheel_delta_y`.\n- The signature of `Context::ProcessMouseWheel` has been changed, the old signature is still available but deprecated.\n\n\n## RmlUi 5.0\n\n### Backends\n\nRmlUi 5.0 introduces the backends concept. This is a complete refactoring of the old sample shell, replacing most of it with a multitude of backends. A backend is a combination of a renderer and a platform, and a light interface tying them together. The shell is now only used for common functions specific to the included samples.\n\nThis change is beneficial in several aspects:\n\n- Makes it easier to integrate RmlUi, as users can directly use the renderer and platform suited for their setup.\n- Makes it a lot easier to add new backends and maintain existing ones.\n- Allows all the samples to run on any backend by choosing the desired backend during CMake configuration.\n\nAll samples and tests have been updated to work with the [backends interface](Backends/RmlUi_Backend.h), which is a very light abstraction over all the different backends.\n\nThe following renderers and platforms are included:\n\n- A new OpenGL 3 renderer. #261\n  - Including Emscripten support so RmlUi even runs in web browsers now.\n- A new Vulkan renderer. #236 #328 #360 #385 (thanks @wh1t3lord)\n- A new GLFW platform.\n- The OpenGL 2 and SDL native renderers ported from the old samples.\n- The Win32, X11, SFML, and SDL platforms ported from the old samples.\n\nThe old macOS shell has been removed as it used a legacy API that is no longer working on modern Apple devices. Now the samples build again on macOS using one of the windowing libraries such as GLFW or SDL.\n\nSee the [Backends section in the readme](readme.md#rmlui-backends) for all the combinations of renderers and platforms, and more details. The backend used for running the samples can be selected by setting the CMake option `SAMPLES_BACKEND` to any of the [supported backends](readme.md#rmlui-backends).\n\n### RCSS selectors\n\n- Implemented the next-sibling `+` and subsequent-sibling `~` [combinators](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/selectors.html).\n- Implemented attribute selectors `[foo]`, `[foo=bar]`, `[foo~=bar]`, `[foo|=bar]`, `[foo^=bar]`, `[foo$=bar]`, `[foo*=bar]`. #240 (thanks @aquawicket)\n- Implemented the negation pseudo class `:not()`, including support for selector lists `E:not(s1, s2, ...)`.\n- Refactored structural pseudo classes for improved performance.\n- Selectors will no longer match any text elements, like in CSS.\n- Selectors now correctly consider all paths toward the root, not just the first greedy path.\n- Structural selectors are no longer affected by the element's display property, like in CSS.\n\n### RCSS properties\n\n- `max-width` and `max-height` properties now support the `none` keyword.\n\n### Text editing\n\nThe `<textarea>` and `<input type=\"text\">` elements have been improved in several aspects.\n\n- Improved cursor navigation between words (Ctrl + Left/Right).\n- Selection is now expanded to highlight selected newlines.\n- When word-wrap is enabled, words can now be broken to avoid overflow.\n- Fixed several issues where the text cursor would be offset from the text editing operations. In particular after word wrapping, or when suppressed characters were present in the text field's value. #313\n- Fixed an issue where Windows newline endings (\\r\\n) would produce an excessive space character.\n- Fixed operation of page up/down numpad keys being swapped.\n- The input method editor (IME) is now positioned at the caret during text editing on the Windows backend. #303 #305 (thanks @xland)\n- Fix slow input handling especially with CJK input on the Win32 backend. #311\n- Improve performance on document load and during text editing.\n\n### Elements\n\n- Extend the functionality of `Element::ScrollIntoView`. #353 (thanks @eugeneko)\n- `<img>` element: Fix wrong dp-scaling being applied when an image is cloned through a parent element. #310\n- `<handle>` element: Fix move targets changing size when placed using the `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` properties.\n\n### Data binding\n\n- Transform functions can now be called using C-like calling conventions, in addition to the previous pipe-syntax. Thus, the data expression `3.625 | format(2)` can now be identically expressed as `format(3.625, 2)`.\n- Handle null pointers when trying to access data variables. #377 (thanks @Dakror)\n- Enable registering a custom data variable definition. #367 (thanks @Dakror)\n\n### Context input\n\n- The hover state of any elements under the mouse will now automatically be updated during `Context::Update()`. #220\n- Added `Context::ProcessMouseLeave()` which ensures that the hovered state is removed from all elements and stops the context update from automatically hovering elements.\n- When `Context::ProcessMouseMove()` is called next the context update will start updating hover states again.\n- Added support for mouse leave events on all backends.\n\n### Layout improvements\n\n- Scroll and slider elements now use containing block's height instead of width to calculate height-relative values. #314 #321 (thanks @nimble0)\n- Generate warnings when directly nesting flexboxes and other unsupported elements in a top-level formatting context. #320\n- In some situations, changing the `top`/`right`/`bottom`/`left` properties may affect the element's size. These situations are now correctly handled so that the layout is updated when needed.\n\n### Lua plugin\n\n- Add `QuerySelector` and `QuerySelectorAll` to the Lua Element API. #329 (thanks @Dakror)\n- Add input-related methods and `dp_ratio` to the Lua Context API. #381 #386 (thanks @shubin)\n- Lua objects representing C++ pointers now compare equal if they point to the same object. #330 (thanks @Dakror)\n- Add length to proxy for element children. #315 (thanks @nimble0)\n- Fix a crash in the Lua plugin during garbage collection. #340 (thanks @slipher)\n\n### Debugger plugin\n\n- Show a more descriptive name for children in the element info window.\n- Fixed a crash when the debugger plugin was shutdown manually. #322 #323 (thanks @LoneBoco)\n\n### SVG plugin\n\n- Update texture when the `src` attribute changes. #361\n\n### General improvements\n\n- Small performance improvement when generating font effects.\n- Allow empty values in decorators and font-effects.\n- RCSS located within document `<style>` tags can now take comments containing xml tags. #341\n- Improve in-source function documentation. #334 (thanks @hobyst)\n- Invader sample: Rename event listener and instancer for clarity.\n\n### General fixes\n\n- Font textures are no longer being regenerated when encountering new ascii characters, fixes a recent regression.\n- Logging a message without an installed system interface will now be written to cout instead of crashing the application.\n- Fix several static analyzer warnings and one possible case of undefined behavior.\n- SDL renderer: Fix images with no alpha channel not rendering. #239\n\n### Build fixes\n\n- Fix compilation on Emscripten CI. #335 (thanks @hobyst)\n- Fix compilation with EASTL. #350 (thanks @eugeneko)\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Changed the signature of the keyboard activation in the system interface, it now passes the caret position and line height: `SystemInterface::ActivateKeyboard(Rml::Vector2f caret_position, float line_height)`.\n- Mouse and hover behavior may change in some situations as a result of the hover state automatically being updated on `Context::Update()`, even if the mouse is not moved. See above changes to context input.\n- Removed the boolean result returned from `Rml::Debugger::Shutdown()`.\n- RCSS selectors will no longer match text elements.\n- RCSS structural pseudo selectors are no longer affected by the element's display property.\n- Data binding: The signature of transform functions has been changed from `Variant& first_argument_and_result, const VariantList& other_arguments -> bool success` to `const VariantList& arguments -> Variant result`.\n\n\n## RmlUi 4.4\n\n### Fonts\n\n- Support for color emojis ð. [#267](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/267)\n- Support for loading fonts with multiple included font weights.

[#296](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/296) (thanks @MexUK)\n- The `opacity` property is now also applied to font effects. [#270](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/270)\n\n### Performance and resource management\n\n- Substantial performance improvement when looking up style rules with class names. Fixes some cases of low performance, see [#293](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/293).\n- Reduced memory usage, more than halved the size of `ComputedValues`.\n- Added `Rml::ReleaseFontResources` to release unused font textures, cached glyph data, and related resources.\n- Release memory pools on `Rml::Shutdown`, or manually through the core API. [#263](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/263) [#265](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/265) (thanks @jack9267)\n\n### Layout\n\n- Fix offsets of relatively positioned elements with percentage positioning.

[#282](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/282) (thanks @EhWhoAmI)\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- `FontEngineInterface::GenerateString` now takes an additional argument, `opacity`.\n- Computed values are now retrieved by function calls instead of member objects.\n\n\n## RmlUi 4.3\n\n### Flexbox layout\n\nSupport for flexible box layout. [#182](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/182) [#257](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/257)\n\n```css\ndisplay: flex;\n```\n\nSee usage examples, differences from CSS, performance tips, and all the details [in the flexbox documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/flexboxes.html).\n\n### Elements\n\n- `select` element:\n  - Emit `change` event even when the value of the newly selected option is the same.\n  - Do not wrap around when using up/down keys on options.\n  - Fix unintentional clipping of the scrollbar.\n- `tabset` element: Fix index parameter having no effect in ElementTabSet::SetPanel and ElementTabSet::SetTab.

[#230](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/230)\n- Improve behavior for collapsing negative vertical margins.\n- Pixel rounding improvements to the clip region.\n- Performance improvement: Avoid unnecesssary extra layouting step in some situations when scrollbars are added.\n\n### Samples\n\n- Add clipboard support to X11 samples. [#231](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/231) (thanks @barotto)\n- Windows shell: Fix OpenGL error on startup.\n\n### Tests\n\n- Visual tests suite: Add ability to overlay the previous reference capture of the test using the shortcut Ctrl+Q.\n- Add support for CSS flexbox tests to the CSS tests converter.\n\n### Lua plugin\n\n- Make Lua plugin API consistently one-indexed instead of zero-indexed. [#237](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/237) [#247](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/247) (thanks @nimble0)\n- Fix crash due to double delete in the Lua plugin. [#216](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/216)\n\n### Dependencies\n\n- Update LunaSVG plugin for compatibility with v2.3.0. [#232](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/232)\n- Warn when using FreeType 2.11.0 with the MSVC compiler, as this version introduced [an issue](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freetype/freetype/-/issues/1092) leading to crashes.\n\n### Build improvements\n\n- Fix log message format string when compiling in debug mode. [#234](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/234) (thanks @barotto)\n- Avoid enum name collisions with Windows header macros. [#258](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/258)\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- The `clip` property is now non-inherited. Users may need to update their RCSS selectors to achieve the same clipping behavior as previously when using this property.\n- Minor changes to the clipping behavior when explicitly using the `clip` property, may lead to different results in some circumstances.\n- RCSS escape character is now `\\` instead of `/`.\n- Lua plugin: Some scripts may need to be changed from using zero-based indexing to one-indexing.\n\n\n## RmlUi 4.2\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Add `Rml::Debugger::Shutdown`. This allows the debugger to be restarted on another host context. [#200](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/200) [#201](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/201) (thanks @Lyatus)\n- Improve color blending and animations.

[#218](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/218)\n- Fix render interface destructor calling virtual functions in some circumstances. [#222](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/222)\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Removed built-in conversion functions between UTF-8 and UTF-16 character encodings.\n- Slightly modified the lifetime requirements for the render interface for special use cases, see [requirements here](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/blob/aa070e7292302f9e61f3b0b3f60e13aded0561d6/Include/RmlUi/Core/Core.h#L99-L100). Will warn in debug mode on wrong use. [#222](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/222)\n\n\n\n## RmlUi 4.1\n\nRmlUi 4.1 is a maintenance release.\n\n- Several CMake fixes so that clients can more easily find and import RmlUi.\n- Curly brackets can now be used inside string literals in data expressions. [#190](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/190) (thanks @Dakror).\n- Inline events are now attached and detached when `on..` attributes change. [#189](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/189) (thanks @ZombieRaccoon).\n\n\n## RmlUi 4.0\n\nRmlUi 4.0 comes packed with several valuable new features as well as many fixes, as detailed below. The library has also been restructured to simplify its usage. For users coming from RmlUi 3.x, see [restructuring RmlUi](#restructuring-rmlui) below for details and an upgrade guide.\n\n### Data bindings (model-view-controller)\n\nRmlUi now supports a model-view-controller (MVC) approach through data bindings. This is a powerful approach for making documents respond to data changes, or in reverse, updating data based on user actions.\n\n```html\n<div data-model=\"my_model\">\n\t<h2>{{title}}</h2>\n\t<p data-if=\"show_text\">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy {{animal}}.</p>\n\t<input type=\"text\" data-value=\"animal\"/>\n</div>\n```\n\n- See [documentation for this feature](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/data_bindings.html) and more examples therein.\n- Have a look at the 'databinding' sample for usage examples and an enjoyable little game.\n- See discussion in [#83](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/83) and [#25](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/25).\n\nThanks to contributions from @actboy, @cloudwu, @C-Core, @Dakror, and @Omegapol; and everyone who helped with testing!\n\n### Test suite\n\nWork has started on a complete test suite for RmlUi. The tests have been separated into three projects.\n\n- `Visual tests`. For visually testing the layout engine in particular, with small test documents that can be easily added. Includes features for capturing and comparing tests for easily spotting differences during development. A best-effort conversion script for the [CSS 2.1 tests](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Test/CSS2.1/), which includes thousands of tests, to RML/RCSS is included for testing conformance with the CSS specifications.\n- `Unit tests`. To ensure smaller units of the library are working properly.\n- `Benchmarks`. Benchmarking various components of the library to keep track of performance increases or regressions for future development, and find any performance hotspots that could need extra attention.\n\n### Layout improvements\n\n- Floating elements, absolutely positioned elements, and inline-block elements (as before) will now all shrink to the width of their contents when their width is set to `auto`.\n- Replaced elements (eg. `img` and some `input` elements) now follow the normal CSS sizing rules. That is, padding and borders are no longer subtracted from the width and height of the element by default.\n- Replaced elements can now decide whether to provide an intrinsic aspect ratio, such that users can eg. set the width property on `input.text` without affecting their height.\n- Replaced elements now try to preserve the aspect ratio when both width and height are auto, and min/max-width/height are set.\n- Fixed several situations where overflowing content would not be hidden or scrolled when setting a non-default `overflow` property. [#116](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/116)\n- Overflow is now clipped on the padding area instead of the content area.\n\nThese changes may result in a differently rendered layout when upgrading to RmlUi 4.0. In particular the first two items. \n\n- If the shrink-to-fit width is undesired, set a definite width on the related elements, eg. using the `width` property or the `left`/`right` properties.\n- Replaced elements may need adjustment of width and height, in this case it may be useful to use the new `box-sizing: border-box` property in some situations.\n\n### Table support\n\nRmlUi now supports tables like in CSS, with some differences and enhancements. RCSS supports flexible sizing of rows and columns (as if using the CSS `fr` unit in grid layout). See the [tables documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/tables.html) for details. \n\n```html\n<table>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Name</td>\n\t\t<td colspan=\"2\">Items</td>\n\t\t<td>Age</td>\n\t</tr>\n\t<tr>\n\t\t<td>Gimli</td>\n\t\t<td>Helmet</td>\n\t\t<td>Axe</td>\n\t\t<td>139 years</td>\n\t</tr>\n</table>\n```\n\nUse the RCSS `display` property to enable table formatting. See the style sheet rules in the tables documentation to use the common HTML tags.\n\n### New RCSS properties\n\n- The `border-radius` property is now supported in RmlUi for drawing rounded backgrounds and borders.\n- Implemented the `word-break` RCSS property.\n- Implemented the `box-sizing` RCSS property.\n- Implemented the `caret-color` RCSS property.\n- New RCSS length units: `vw` and `vh`. [#162](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/162) (thanks @Dakror).\n\n### RCSS Media query support\n\nWe now support `@media` rules for dynamically or programmatically changing active styles. [#169](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/169) (thanks @Dakror).\n\nSee the [media queries documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/media_queries.html) for usage details and supported media features.\n\n### Improved high DPI support\n\n- Media queries support with `resolution` feature to toggle styles and sprites based on DPI.\n- Spritesheets can now define the target DPI scaling by using the `resolution` property.\n- Sprites can now be overrided by later `@spritesheet` rules, making it easy to eg. define high DPI versions of sprites.\n- Sprites in decorators and `<img>` elements now scale according to the targeted DPI.\n- Decorators and `<img>` elements now automatically update when sprites or DPI changes.\n- The samples and shell now implement high dpi support (only on Windows 10 for now).\n\n### New RML elements\n\n- Added [Lottie plugin](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/lottie.html) for displaying vector animations using the `<lottie>` element [#134](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/134) (thanks @diamondhat).\n- Added [SVG plugin](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/svg.html) for displaying vector images using the `<svg>` element.\n- Added `<label>` element for associating a caption with an input element.\n\n### Element improvements\n\n- Implemented `Element::QuerySelector`, `Element::QuerySelectorAll`, and `Element::Closest`. [#164](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/164) (thanks @Dakror).\n- The `tab-index: auto` property can now be set on the `<body>` element to enable tabbing back to the document.\n- `<select>` elements now react to changes in the `value` attribute.\n- Element attributes can now use escaped RML characters, eg. `<p example=\"&quot;Quoted text&quot;\"/>`. [#154](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/154) (thanks @actboy168).\n- Tabs and panels in tab sets will no longer set the `display` property to `inline-block`, thus it is now possible to customize the display property.\n- `<progress>` element now supports the `max` attribute. Changing its `fill-image` property now actually updates the image.\n\n### Input handling\n\n- Added `Context::IsMouseInteracting()` to determine whether the mouse cursor hovers or otherwise interacts with documents. [#124](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/124)\n- Added boolean return values to `Context::ProcessMouse...()` functions to determine whether the mouse is interacting with documents.\n- Fixed some situations where the return value of `Context::Process...()` was wrong.\n\n### Lua plugin\n\nImproved Lua plugin in several aspects.\n\n- Added detailed [documentation for the Lua plugin](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/lua_manual.html). [RmlUiDocs#4](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUiDoc/pull/4) (thanks @IronicallySerious)\n- Remove overriding globals, use standard pairs/ipars implementation, make array indices 1-based. [#95](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/95) [#137](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/137) (thanks @actboy168)\n- Improve compatibility with debuggers and fix compatibility with Lua 5.4. [#136](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/136) [#138](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/138) (thanks @actboy168)\n- Lua error reporting improvements, including stack trace. [#140](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/140) [#151](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/151) (thanks @actboy168)\n- Add support for declaring data bindings. [#146](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/146)  [#150](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/150) (thanks @cloudwu and @actboy168)\n\n### Samples\n\n- New `databinding` sample for demonstrating data bindings.\n- New `lottie` sample for demonstrating Lottie animations with the Lottie plugin.\n- New `svg` sample for demonstrating the SVG plugin.\n- The use of `datagrid` in sample projects has now been replaced with data bindings. This includes the `treeview` sample and the high scores document in the `invader` sample. Tutorials have not been updated.\n- The options document in the `luainvader` sample now demonstrate data bindings combined with Lua scripts.\n- Improved the SFML2 sample [#106](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/106) and [#103](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/103) (thanks @hachmeister).\n\n### Other features and improvements\n\n- Added `Rml::GetTextureSourceList()` function to list all image sources loaded in all documents. [#131](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/131)\n- Added `ElementDocument::ReloadStyleSheet()` function to reload styles without affecting the document tree. [#159](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/159) [#171](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/171) (thanks @Lyatus and @Dakror)\n- RCSS and scripts are now always loaded in declared order [#144](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/144) (thanks @actboy168).\n- A custom configuration can now be used by RmlUi. In this way it is possible to replace several types including containers to other STL-compatible containers (such as [EASTL](https://github.com/electronicarts/EASTL)), or to STL containers with custom allocators. See the `CUSTOM_CONFIGURATION` [CMake option](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/building_with_cmake.html#cmake-options). [#110](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/110) (thanks @rokups).\n- Added ability to change the default base tag in documents [#112](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/112)  (thanks @aquawicket).\n- Debugger improvements: Sort property names alphabetically. Fix a bug where the outlines would draw underneath the document.\n- Improved performance when using fonts with kerning.\n- Added `unsigned int` and `uint64_t` to Variant. [#166](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/166) [#176](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/176) (thanks @Omegapol and @Dakror).\n- Sprite sheets can now be declared anonymous, no name needed.\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix some situations where `text-decoration` would not be rendered. [#119](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/119).\n- Fix a bug where font textures were leaked on `Rml::Shutdown()`. [#133](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/133)\n- Fixed building with MinGW, and added it to the CI to avoid future breaks. [#108](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/108) (thanks @cloudwu).\n- Fixed building when targeting Windows UWP apps. [#178](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/178) (thanks @rokups).\n- Fixed several compilation issues and warnings. [#118](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/118) [#97](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/97) [#157](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/157) (thanks @SpaceCat-Chan and @LWSS).\n- Fixed a bug where the `transition: all ...;` property would not parse correctly.\n- Fix \\<textarea\\> getting an unnecessary horizontal scrollbar. [#122](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/122)\n- Fix text position changing in input fields when selecting text and font has kerning.\n- Fix text-decoration not always being regenerated. [#119](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/119)\n- Fix tabbing navigation when tabable elements are direct children of body.\n- Fix tabbing navigation in reverse direction from body.\n- Fix missing attributes when cloning elements. [#177](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/177) (thanks @Dakror).\n\n### Restructuring RmlUi\n\nRmlUi has been restructured to simplify its usage. This involves breaking changes but should benefit everyone using the library in the future. See discussion in [#58](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/58).\n\n- The old `Controls` plugin is now gone. But fear not! It has been merged into the `Core` project.\n- The old `Rml::Core` and `Rml::Controls` namespaces have been removed, their contents are now located directly in the `Rml` namespace.\n- The old `Controls` public header files have been moved to `<RmlUi/Core/Elements/...>`.\n- The old `Controls` source files and private header files have been moved to `Source/Core/Elements/...`.\n- The `Debugger` plugin remains as before at the same location and same namespace `Rml::Debugger`.\n\nThe Lua plugins have been changed to reflect the above changes.\n\n- The old Lua plugins `RmlCoreLua` and `RmlControlsLua` have been merged into a single library `RmlLua`.\n- The public header files are now located at `<RmlUi/Lua/...>`.\n- The Lua plugin is now initialized by calling `Rml::Lua::Initialise()` located in `<RmlUi/Lua/Lua.h>`.\n- Separated the Lua interpreter functions from initialization and the Lua plugin.\n- Renamed macros in the Lua plugin, they now start with `RMLUI_`.\n\n#### Upgrade guide\n\n- Remove the call to `Rml::Controls::Initialise()`, this is no longer needed.\n- Replace all inclusions of `<RmlUi/Controls.h>` with `<RmlUi/Core.h>` unless it is already included, or include individual header files.\n- Rename all inclusions of `<RmlUi/Controls/...>` to `<RmlUi/Core/Elements/...>`.\n- Replace all occurrences of `Rml::Core` with `Rml`.\n- Replace all occurrences of `Rml::Controls` with `Rml`.\n- Look for forward declarations in `namespace Rml { namespace Core { ... } }` and `namespace Rml { namespace Controls { ... } }`. Replace with `namespace Rml { ... }`.\n- Remove the linkage to the `RmlControls` library.\n- For users of the Lua plugin:\n  - Replace RmlUi's Lua header files with `<RmlUi/Lua.h>` or individual header files in `<RmlUi/Lua/...>`.\n  - Replace the old initialization calls with `Rml::Lua::Initialise()`. Previously this was `Rml::Core::Lua::Interpreter::Initialise()` and `Rml::Controls::Lua::RegisterTypes(...)`.\n  - Link with the library `RmlLua`, remove `RmlCoreLua` and `RmlControlsLua`.\n- Welcome to RmlUi 4.0 :)\n\n#### Related internal changes.\n\n- Refactored the two `WidgetSlider` classes to avoid duplicate names in Core and Controls.\n- Refactored `TransformPrimitive.h` by moving utility functions that should only be used internally to an internal header file.\n- Renamed header guard macros.\n\n### Deprecated functionality\n\n- The `datagrid` element and related functionality has been deprecated in favor of [data bindings](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/data_bindings.html) and [RCSS tables](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/tables.html).\n- The `<progressbar>` tag name has been deprecated in favor of `<progress>`. For now they work identically, but usage of `<progressbar>`  will raise a warning, expect future removal of this tag.\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- Namespaces and plugin names changed! See the restructuring changes above.\n- Using `{{` and `}}` inside RML documents is now reserved for usage with data bindings.\n- Attributes starting with `data-` are now reserved for RmlUi.\n- The changes to the layout engine may result in changes to the rendered layout in some situations, see above for more details.\n- The `BaseXMLParser` class has some minor interface changes.\n- Tab set elements `tab` and `panel` should now have their `display` property set in the RCSS document, use `display: inline-block` for the same behavior as before.\n- For custom, replaced elements: `Element::GetIntrinsicDimensions()` now additionally takes an intrinsic ratio parameter.\n- The `fill-image` property should now be applied to the `<progress>` element instead of its inner `<fill>` element.\n- The function `ElementDocument::LoadScript` is now changed to handle internal and external scripts separately. [#144](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/pull/144)\n- For custom decorators: Textures from filenames should now first be loaded through the `DecoratorInstancerInterface` and then submitted to the `Decorator`.\n\n\n## RmlUi 3.3\n\n###  Rml `select` element improvements\n\n- Prevent scrolling in the parent window when scrolling inside the selection box.\n- Close the selection box when scrolling in the parent document.\n- The selection box will now limit its height to the available space within the context's window dimensions, and position itself either below or above the `select` element as appropriate. [#91](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/91)\n\n### Cleaning up header files\n\nAn effort has been made for header files to include what they use, and nothing else. This effort has measurably improved compile times, especially when not using precompiled headers.\n\nThis change also makes it easier to include only parts of the library headers in the user application for improved compile times. That is, instead of including the whole core library using `#include <RmlUi/Core.h>`, one can specify which ones are needed such as `#include <RmlUi/Core/Element.h>`.\n\n### CMake precompiled header support\n\nThe library now makes use of CMake's precompiled header support (requires CMake 3.16 or higher), which can optionally be disabled. In Visual Studio, compilation times are improved by almost 50% when enabled.\n\n### Changes\n\n- The `style` attribute no longer requires a semi-colon `;` after the final property.\n- The sample projects now universally use the `F8` key to toggle the RmlUi debugger on all platforms.\n- Add an upper limit to the number of possible custom properties and events. This change will reduce the number of dynamic allocations in some cases.\n- Build improvements and several warnings fixed. Compiles cleanly with `-Wall -Wextra` and on MSVC with `/W4`.\n- The sample projects now find their assets when building and running the sample with Visual Studio's native CMake support and default settings. This also applies when targeting Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n- The mouse cursor API is now implemented on the X11 shell.\n- RmlUi is now C++20 compatible (C++14 is still the minimum requirement).\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Fix font textures not released when calling Core::ReleaseTextures [#84](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/84).\n- Re-implement `Rml::Core::ReleaseCompiledGeometries()` [#84](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/84).\n- Property `white-space: nowrap` no longer disables horizontal scrollbars on overflow [#94](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/94).\n- Changes to font effects are now properly applied whenever the `font-effect` property is changed [#98](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/98).\n- Fix structural pseudo-selectors only being applied if written with parenthesis [#30](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/30#issuecomment-597648310).\n\n\n## RmlUi 3.2\n\n### Animating keyword properties\n\nKeyword properties can now be animated. Keywords are always interpolated in discrete steps, and normally applied half-way to the next keyframe. The single exception to this rule is for the `visibility` property. As in the CSS specifications, this property always applies the `visible` keyword during transition when present either in the previous or next keyframe.\n\nThus, the following can produce a fade-out animation, removing visibility of the element at animation end (thanks to @uniquejack for the example).\n```css\n@keyframes fadeout {\n\tfrom {\n\t\topacity: 1;\n\t}\n\tto {\n\t\topacity: 0;\n\t\tvisibility: hidden;\n\t}\n}\n.fadeout {\n\tanimation: 1.2s cubic-in fadeout;\n}\n```\n\n### Changes\n\n- Animated properties are now removed when an animation completes.\n- Update robin_hood unordered_map to 3.5.0 (thanks @jhasse). [#75](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/75)\n\n### Bug fixes\n\n- Range input element: Change event reports the correct value instead of normalized (thanks @andreasschultes). [#72](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/72) [#73](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/73).\n- Fix wrong cast in elapsed time in SDL2 sample. [#71](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/71).\n- Avoid infinite recursion on Variant construction/assignment with unsupported types. [#70](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/issues/70).\n- Fix warnings issued by the MinGW compiler (thanks @jhasse).\n\n\n## RmlUi 3.1\n\n### Progress bar\n\nA new `progressbar` element is introduced for visually displaying progress or relative values. The element can take the following attributes.\n\n- `value`. Number `[0, 1]`. The fraction of the progress bar that is filled where 1 means completely filled.\n- `direction`. Determines the direction in which the filled part expands. One of:\n   - `top | right (default) | bottom | left | clockwise | counter-clockwise`\n- `start-edge`. Only applies to 'clockwise' or 'counter-clockwise' directions. Defines which edge the\ncircle should start expanding from. Possible values:\n   - `top (default) | right | bottom | left`\n\nThe element is only available with the `RmlControls` library.\n\n**Styling**\n\nThe progressbar generates a non-dom `fill` element beneath it which can be used to style the filled part of the bar. The `fill` element can use normal properties such as `background-color`, `border`, and `decorator` to style it, or use the new `fill-image`-property to set an image which will be clipped according to the progress bar's `value`. \n\nThe `fill-image` property is the only way to style circular progress bars (`clockwise` and `counter-clockwise` directions). The `fill` element is still available but it will always be fixed in size independent of the `value` attribute.\n\n**New RCSS property**\n\n- `fill-image`. String, non-inherited. Must be the name of a sprite or the path to an image.\n\n**Examples**\n\nThe following RCSS styles three different progress bars.\n```css\n@spritesheet progress_bars\n{\n\tsrc: my_progress_bars.tga;\n\tprogress:        103px 267px 80px 34px;\n\tprogress-fill-l: 110px 302px  6px 34px;\n\tprogress-fill-c: 140px 302px  6px 34px;\n\tprogress-fill-r: 170px 302px  6px 34px;\n\tgauge:      0px 271px 100px 86px;\n\tgauge-fill: 0px 356px 100px 86px;\n}\n.progress_horizontal { \n\tdecorator: image( progress );\n\twidth: 80px;\n\theight: 34px;\n}\n.progress_horizontal fill {\n\tdecorator: tiled-horizontal( progress-fill-l, progress-fill-c, progress-fill-r );\n\tmargin: 0 7px;\n\t/* padding ensures that the decorator has a minimum width when the value is zero */\n\tpadding-left: 14px;\n}\n.progress_vertical {\n\twidth: 30px;\n\theight: 80px;\n\tbackground-color: #E3E4E1;\n\tborder: 4px #A90909;\n}\n.progress_vertical fill {\n\tborder: 3px #4D9137;\n\tbackground-color: #7AE857;\n}\n.gauge { \n\tdecorator: image( gauge );\n\twidth: 100px;\n\theight: 86px;\n}\n.gauge fill { \n\tfill-image: gauge-fill;\n}\n```\nNow, they can be used in RML as follows.\n```html\n<progressbar class=\"progress_horizontal\" value=\"0.75\"/>\n<progressbar class=\"progress_vertical\" direction=\"top\" value=\"0.6\"/>\n<progressbar class=\"gauge\" direction=\"clockwise\" start-edge=\"bottom\" value=\"0.3\"/>\n```\n\n\n### New font effects\n\nTwo new font effects have been added.\n\n**Glow effect**\n\nRenders a blurred outline around the text. \n\nThe `glow` effect is declared as:\n```css\nfont-effect: glow( <width-outline> <width-blur> <offset-x> <offset-y> <color> );\n```\nBoth the outline pass and the subsequent blur pass can be controlled independently. Additionally, an offset can be applied which makes the effect suitable for generating drop shadows as well.\n\n**Blur effect**\n\nRenders a Gaussian blurred copy of the text.\n\nThe `blur` effect is declared as:\n```css\nfont-effect: blur( <width> <color> );\n```\nNote that, the blur effect will not replace the original text. To only show the blurred version of the text, set the `color` property of the original text to `transparent`.\n\n**Example usage**\n\n```css\n/* Declares a glow effect. */\nh1\n{\n\tfont-effect: glow( 3px #ee9 );\n}\n\n/* The glow effect can also create nice looking shadows. */\np.glow_shadow\n{\n\tcolor: #ed5;\n\tfont-effect: glow(2px 4px 2px 3px #644);\n}\n\n/* Renders a blurred version of the text, hides the original text. */\nh1\n{\n\tcolor: transparent;\n\tfont-effect: blur(3px #ed5);\n}\n```\n\nSee the `demo` sample for additional usage examples and results.\n\n\n\n### CMake options\n\nNew CMake option added.\n\n- `DISABLE_RTTI_AND_EXCEPTIONS` will try to configure the compiler to disable RTTI language support and exceptions. All internal use of RTTI (eg. dynamic_cast) will then be replaced by a custom solution. If set, users of the library should then `#define RMLUI_USE_CUSTOM_RTTI` before including the library.\n\n\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- For users that implement custom font effects, there are some minor changes to the font effect interface and the convolution filter.\n\n\n\n## RmlUi 3.0\n\n\nRmlUi 3.0 is the biggest change yet, featuring a substantial amount of new features and bug fixes. One of the main efforts in RmlUi 3.0 has been on improving the performance of the library. Users should see a noticable performance increase when upgrading.\n\n\n### Performance\n\nOne of the main efforts in RmlUi 3.0 has been on improving the performance of the library. Some noteable changes include:\n\n- The update loop has been reworked to avoid doing unnecessary, repeated calculations whenever the document or style is changed. Instead of immediately updating properties on any affected elements, most of this work is done during the Context::Update call in a more carefully chosen order. Note that for this reason, when querying the Rocket API for properties such as size or position, this information may not be up-to-date with changes since the last Context::Update, such as newly added elements or classes. If this information is needed immediately, a call to ElementDocument::UpdateDocument can be made before such queries at a performance penalty.\n- Several containers have been replaced, such as std::map to [robin_hood::unordered_flat_map](https://github.com/martinus/robin-hood-hashing).\n- Reduced number of allocations and unnecessary recursive calls.\n- Internally, the concept of computed values has been introduced. Computed values take the properties of an element and computes them as far as possible without introducing the layouting.\n\nAll of these changes, in addition to many smaller optimizations, results in a more than **25x** measured performance increase for creation and destruction of a large number of elements. A benchmark is included with the samples.\n\n\n### Sprite sheets\n\nThe RCSS at-rule `@spritesheet` can be used to declare a sprite sheet. A sprite sheet consists of a single image and multiple sprites each specifying a region of the image. Sprites can in turn be used in decorators.\n\nA sprite sheet can be declared in RCSS as in the following example.\n```css\n@spritesheet theme \n{\n\tsrc: invader.tga;\n\t\n\ttitle-bar-l: 147px 0px 82px 85px;\n\ttitle-bar-c: 229px 0px  1px 85px;\n\ttitle-bar-r: 231px 0px 15px 85px;\n\t\n\ticon-invader: 179px 152px 51px 39px;\n\ticon-game:    230px 152px 51px 39px;\n\ticon-score:   434px 152px 51px 39px;\n\ticon-help:    128px 152px 51px 39px;\n}\n```\nThe first property `src` provides the filename of the image for the sprite sheet. Every other property specifies a sprite as `<name>: <rectangle>`. A sprite's name applies globally to all included style sheets in a given document, and must be unique. A rectangle is declared as `x y width height`, each of which must be in `px` units. Here, `x` and `y` refers to the position in the image with the origin placed at the top-left corner, and `width` and `height` extends the rectangle right and down.\n\nThe sprite name can be used in decorators, such as:\n```css\ndecorator: tiled-horizontal( title-bar-l, title-bar-c, title-bar-r );\n```\nThis creates a tiled decorator where the `title-bar-l` and `title-bar-r` sprites occupies the left and right parts of the element at their native size, while `title-bar-c` occupies the center and is stretched horizontally as the element is stretched.\n\n\n### Decorators\n\nThe new RCSS `decorator` property replaces the old decorator declarations in libRocket. A decorator is declared by the name of the decorator type and its properties in parenthesis. Some examples follow.\n\n```css\n/* declares an image decorater by a sprite name */\ndecorator: image( icon-invader );\n\n/* declares a tiled-box decorater by several sprites */\ndecorator: tiled-box(\n\twindow-tl, window-t, window-tr, \n\twindow-l, window-c, window-r,\n\twindow-bl, window-b, window-br\n);\n\n /* declares an image decorator by the url of an image */\ndecorator: image( invader.tga );\n```\n\nThe `decorator` property follows the normal cascading rules, is non-inherited, and has the default value `none` which specifies no decorator on the element. The decorator looks for a sprite with the same name first. If none exists, then it treats it as a file name for an image. Decorators can now be set on the element's style, although we recommend declaring them in style sheets for performance reasons.\n\nFurthermore, multiple decorators can be specified on any element by a comma-separated list of decorators.\n```css\n/* declares two decorators on the same element, the first will be rendered on top of the latter */\ndecorator: image( icon-invader ), tiled-horizontal( title-bar-l, title-bar-c, title-bar-r );\n```\n\nWhen creating a custom decorator, you can provide a shorthand property named `decorator` which will be used to parse the text inside the parenthesis of the property declaration. This allows specifying the decorator with inline properties as in the above examples.\n\n\n### Decorator at-rule\n\nNote: This part is experimental. If it turns out there are very few use-cases for this feature, it may be removed in the future. Feedback is welcome.\n\nThe `@decorator` at-rule in RCSS can be used to declare a decorator when the shorthand syntax given above is not sufficient. It is best served with an example, we use the custom `starfield` decorator type from the invaders sample. In the style sheet, we can populate it with properties as follows.\n\n```css\n@decorator stars : starfield {\n\tnum-layers: 5;\n\ttop-colour: #fffc;\n\tbottom-colour: #fff3;\n\ttop-speed: 80.0;\n\tbottom-speed: 20.0;\n\ttop-density: 8;\n\tbottom-density: 20;\n}\n```\nAnd then use it in a decorator.\n```css\ndecorator: stars;\n```\nNote the lack of parenthesis which means it is a decorator name and not a type with shorthand properties declared.\n\n\n### Ninepatch decorator\n\nThe new `ninepatch` decorator splits a sprite into a 3x3 grid of patches. The corners of the ninepatch are rendered at their native size, while the inner patches are stretched so that the whole element is filled. In a sense, it can be considered a simplified and more performant version of the `tiled-box` decorator.\n\nThe decorator is specified by two sprites, defining an outer and inner rectangle:\n```css\n@spritesheet my-button {\n\tsrc: button.png;\n\tbutton-outer: 247px  0px 159px 45px;\n\tbutton-inner: 259px 19px 135px  1px;\n}\n```\nThe inner rectangle defines the parts of the sprite that will be stretched when the element is resized. \n\nThe `ninepatch` decorator is applied as follows:\n```css\ndecorator: ninepatch( button-outer, button-inner );\n```\nThe two sprites must be located in the same sprite sheet. Only sprites are supported by the ninepatch decorator, image urls cannot be used.\n\nFurthermore, the ninepatch decorator can have the rendered size of its edges specified manually.\n```css\ndecorator: ninepatch( button-outer, button-inner, 19px 12px 25px 12px );\n```\nThe edge sizes are specified in the common `top-right-bottom-left` box order. The box shorthands are also available, e.g. a single value will be replicated to all. Percent and numbers can also be used, they will scale relative to the native size of the given edge multiplied by the current dp ratio. Thus, setting\n```css\ndecorator: ninepatch( button-outer, button-inner, 1.0 );\n```\nis a simple approach to scale the decorators with higher dp ratios. For crisper graphics, increase the sprite sheet's pixel size at the edges and lower the rendered edge size number correspondingly.\n\n\n### Gradient decorator\n\nA `gradient` decorator has been implemented with support for horizontal and vertical color gradients (thanks to @viciious). Example usage:\n\n```css\ndecorator: gradient( direction start-color stop-color );\n\ndirection: horizontal|vertical;\nstart-color: #ff00ff;\nstop-color: #00ff00;\n```\n\n\n### Tiled decorators orientation\n\nThe orientation of each tile in the tiled decorators, `image`, `tiled-horizontal`, `tiled-vertical`, and `tiled-box`, can be rotated and flipped (thanks to @viciious). The new keywords are:\n```\nnone, flip-horizontal, flip-vertical, rotate-180\n```\n\nExample usage:\n\n```css\ndecorator: tiled-horizontal( header-l, header-c, header-l flip-horizontal );\n```\n\n\n### Image decorator fit modes and alignment\n\nThe image decorator now supports fit modes and alignment for scaling and positioning the image within its current element.\n\nThe full RCSS specification for the `image` decorator is now\n```css\ndecorator: image( <src> <orientation> <fit> <align-x> <align-y> );\n```\nwhere\n\n- `<src>`: image source url or sprite name\n- `<orientation>`: none (default) \\| flip-horizontal \\| flip-vertical \\| rotate-180\n- `<fit>`: fill (default) \\| contain \\| cover \\| scale-none \\| scale-down\n- `<align-x>`: left \\| center (default) \\| right \\| \\<length-percentage\\>\n- `<align-y>`: top \\| center (default) \\| bottom \\| \\<length-percentage\\>\n\nValues must be specified in the given order, any unspecified properties will be left at their default values. See the 'demo' sample for usage examples.\n\n\n### Font-effects\n\nThe new RCSS `font-effect` property replaces the old font-effect declarations in libRocket. A font-effect is declared similar to a decorator, by the name of the font-effect type and its properties in parenthesis. Some examples follow.\n\n```css\n/* declares an outline font-effect with width 5px and color #f66 */\nfont-effect: outline( 5px #f66 );\n\n/* declares a shadow font-effect with 2px offset in both x- and y-direction, and the given color */\nfont-effect: shadow( 2px 2px #333 );\n```\n\nThe `font-effect` property follows the normal cascading rules, is inherited, and has the default value `none` which specifies no font-effect on the element. Unlike in libRocket, font-effects can now be set on the element's style, although we recommend declaring them in style sheets for performance reasons.\n\nFurthermore, multiple font-effects can be specified on any element by a comma-separated list of font-effects.\n```css\n/* declares two font-effects on the same element */\nfont-effect: shadow(3px 3px green), outline(2px black);\n```\n\nWhen creating a custom font-effect, you can provide a shorthand property named `font-effect` which will be used to parse the text inside the parenthesis of the property declaration. This allows specifying the font-effect with inline properties as in the above examples.\n\nThere is currently no equivalent of the `@decorator` at-rule for font-effects. If there is a desire for such a feature, please provide some feedback.\n\n### RCSS Selectors\n\nThe child combinator `>` is now introduced in RCSS, which can be used as in CSS to select a child of another element.\n```css\np.green_theme > button { image-color: #0f0; }\n```\nHere, any `button` elements which have a parent `p.green_theme` will have their image color set to green. \n\nFurthermore, the universal selector `*` can now be used in RCSS. This selector matches any element.\n```css\ndiv.red_theme > * > p { color: #f00; }\n```\nHere, `p` grandchildren of `div.red_theme` will have their color set to red. The universal selector can also be used in combination with other selectors, such as `*.great#content:hover`.\n\n### Debugger improvements\n\nThe debugger has been improved in several aspects:\n\n- Live updating of values. Can now see the effect of animations and other property changes.\n- Can now toggle drawing of element dimension box, and live update of values.\n- Can toggle whether elements are selected in user context.\n- Can toggle pseudo classes on the selected element.\n- Added the ability to clear the log.\n- Support for transforms. The element's dimension box is drawn with the transform applied.\n\n### Removal of manual reference counting\n\nAll manual reference counting has been removed in favor of smart pointers. There is no longer a need to manually decrement the reference count, such as `element->RemoveReference()` as before. This change also establishes a clear ownership of objects. For the user-facing API, this means raw pointers are non-owning, while unique and shared pointers declare ownership. Internally, there may still be uniquely owning raw pointers, as this is a work-in-progress.\n\n#### Core API\n\nThe Core API takes raw pointers as before such as for its interfaces. With the new semantics, this means the library retains a non-owning reference. Thus, all construction and destruction of such objects is the responsibility of the user. Typically, the objects must stay alive until after `Core::Shutdown` is called. Each relevant function is commented with its lifetime requirements.\n\nAs an example, the system interface can be constructed into a unique pointer.\n```cpp\nauto system_interface = std::make_unique<MySystemInterface>();\nRml::Core::SetSystemInterface(system_interface.get());\nRml::Core::Initialise();\n...\nRml::Core::Shutdown();\nsystem_interface.reset();\n```\nOr simply from a stack object.\n```cpp\nMySystemInterface system_interface;\nRml::Core::SetSystemInterface(&system_interface);\nRml::Core::Initialise();\n...\nRml::Core::Shutdown();\n```\n\n#### Element API\n\nWhen constructing new elements, there is again no longer a need to decrement the reference count as before. Instead, the element is returned with a unique ownership\n```cpp\nElementPtr ElementDocument::CreateElement(const String& name);\n```\nwhere `ElementPtr` is a unique pointer and an alias as follows.\n```cpp\nusing ElementPtr = std::unique_ptr<Element, Releaser<Element>>;\n```\nNote that, the custom deleter `Releaser` is there to ensure the element is released from the `ElementInstancer` in which it was created.\n\nAfter having called `ElementDocument::CreateElement`, the element can be moved into the list of children of another element.\n```cpp\nElementPtr new_child = document->CreateElement(\"div\");\nelement->AppendChild( std::move(new_child) );\n```\nSince we moved `new_child`, we cannot use the pointer anymore. Instead, `Element::AppendChild` returns a non-owning raw pointer to the appended child which can be used. Furthermore, the new element can be constructed in-place, e.g.\n```cpp\nElement* new_child = element->AppendChild( document->CreateElement(\"div\") );\n```\nand now `new_child` can safely be used until the element is destroyed.\n\nThere are aliases to the smart pointers which are used internally for consistency with the library's naming scheme.\n```cpp\ntemplate<typename T> using UniquePtr = std::unique_ptr<T>;\ntemplate<typename T> using SharedPtr = std::shared_ptr<T>;\n```\n\n### Improved transforms\n\nThe inner workings of transforms have been completely revised, resulting in increased performance, simplified API, closer compliance to the CSS specs, and reduced complexity of the relevant parts of the library.\n\nSome relevant changes for users:\n- Removed the need for users to set the view and projection matrices they use outside the library.\n- Replaced the `PushTransform()` and `PopTransform()` render interface functions with `SetTransform()`, which is only called when the transform matrix needs to change and never called if there are no `transform` properties present.\n- The `perspective` property now applies to the element's children, as in CSS.\n- The transform function `perspective()` behaves like in CSS. It applies a perspective projection to the current element.\n- Chaining transforms and perspectives now provides more expected results. However, as opposed to CSS we don't flatten transforms.\n- Transform rotations can now be interpolated without decomposing when their rotation axes align. When the axes do not align, interpolation will be performed via decomposition (quaternion interpolation) as before. With this addition, transform interpolation should be fully compatible with the CSS specifications.\n- Have a look at the updated transforms sample for some fun with 3d boxes.\n\n\n### Focus flags, autofocus\n\nIt is now possible to autofocus on elements when showing a document. By default, the first element with the property `tab-index: auto;` as well as the attribute `autofocus` set, will receive focus.\n\nThe focus behavior as well as the modal state can be controlled with two new separate flags.\n```cpp\nElementDocument::Show(ModalFlag modal_flag = ModalFlag::None, FocusFlag focus_flag = FocusFlag::Auto);\n```\n\nThe flags are specified as follows:\n```cpp\n/**\n\t ModalFlag used for controlling the modal state of the document.\n\t\tNone:  Remove modal state.\n\t\tModal: Set modal state, other documents cannot receive focus.\n\t\tKeep:  Modal state unchanged.\n\n\tFocusFlag used for displaying the document.\n\t\tNone:     No focus.\n\t\tDocument: Focus the document.\n\t\tKeep:     Focus the element in the document which last had focus.\n\t\tAuto:     Focus the first tab element with the 'autofocus' attribute or else the document.\n*/\nenum class ModalFlag { None, Modal, Keep };\nenum class FocusFlag { None, Document, Keep, Auto };\n```\n\n\n### Font engine and interface\n\nThe RmlUi font engine has seen a major overhaul.\n\n- The default font engine has been abstracted away, thereby allowing users to implement their own font engine (thanks to @viciious). See `FontEngineInterface.h` and the CMake flag `NO_FONT_INTERFACE_DEFAULT` for details.\n- `font-charset` RCSS property is gone: The font interface now loads new characters as needed. Fallback fonts can be set so that unknown characters are loaded from them.\n- The API and internals are now using UTF-8 strings directly, the old UCS-2 strings are ditched completely. All `String`s in RmlUi should be considered as encoded in UTF-8.\n- Text string are no longer limited to 16 bit code points, thus grayscale emojis are supported, have a look at the `demo` sample for some examples.\n- The internals of the default font engine has had a major overhaul, simplifying a lot of code, and removing the BitmapFont provider.\n- Instead, a custom font engine interface has been implemented for bitmap fonts in the `bitmapfont` sample, serving as a quick example of how to create your own font interface. The sample should work even without the FreeType dependency.\n\n\n### CMake options\n\nThree new CMake options added.\n\n- `NO_FONT_INTERFACE_DEFAULT` removes the default font engine, thereby allowing users to completely remove the FreeType dependency. If set, a custom font engine must be created and set through `Rml::Core::SetFontEngineInterface` before initialization. See the `bitmapfont` sample for an example implementation of a custom font engine.\n- `NO_THIRDPARTY_CONTAINERS`: RmlUi now comes bundled with some third-party container libraries for improved performance. For users that would rather use the `std` counter-parts, this option is available. The option replaces the containers via a preprocessor definition. If the library is compiled with this option, then users of the library *must* specify `#define RMLUI_NO_THIRDPARTY_CONTAINERS` before including the library.\n- `ENABLE_TRACY_PROFILING`: RmlUi has parts of the library tagged with markers for profiling with [Tracy Profiler](https://bitbucket.org/wolfpld/tracy/src/master/). This enables a visual inspection of bottlenecks and slowdowns on individual frames. To compile the library with profiling support, add the Tracy Profiler library to `/Dependencies/tracy/`, enable this option, and compile.  Follow the Tracy Profiler instructions to build and connect the separate viewer. As users may want to only use profiling for specific compilation targets, then instead one can `#define RMLUI_ENABLE_PROFILING` for the given target.\n\n\n### Events\n\nThere are some changes to events in RmlUi, however, for most users, existing code should still work as before.\n\nThere is now a distinction between actions executed in event listeners, and default actions for events:\n\n- Event listeners are attached to an element as before. Events follow the normal phases: capture (root -> target), target, and bubble (target -> root). Each event listener is always attached to the target phase, and is additionally attached to either the bubble phase (default) or capture phase. Listeners are executed in the order they are added to the element. Each event type specifies whether it executes the bubble phase or not, see below for details.\n- Default actions are primarily for actions performed internally in the library. They are executed in the function `virtual void Element::ProcessDefaultAction(Event& event)`. However, any object that derives from `Element` can override the default behavior and add new behavior. The default actions are always executed after all event listeners, and only propagated according to the phases set in their `default_action_phase` value which is defined for each event type. If an event is interrupted with `Event::StopPropagation()`, then the default actions are not performed.\n\n\nEach event type now has an associated EventId as well as a specification defined as follows:\n\n- `interruptible`: Whether the event can be cancelled by calling `Event::StopPropagation()`.\n- `bubbles`: Whether the event executes the bubble phase. If true, all three phases: capture, target, and bubble, are executed. If false, only capture and target phases are executed.\n- `default_action_phase`: One of: None, Target, TargetAndBubble. Specifies during which phases the default action is executed, if any. That is, the phase for which `Element::ProcessDefaultAction()` is called. See above for details.\n\nSee `EventSpecification.cpp` for details of each event type. For example, the event type `click` has the following specification:\n```\nid: EventId::Click\ntype: \"click\"\ninterruptible: true\nbubbles: true\ndefault_action_phase: TargetAndBubble\n```\n\nWhenever an event listener is added or event is dispatched, and the provided event type does not already have a specification, the default specification\n`interruptible: true, bubbles: true, default_action_phase: None` is added for that event type. To provide a custom specification for a new event, first call the method:\n```\nEventId Rml::Core::RegisterEventType(const String& type, bool interruptible, bool bubbles, DefaultActionPhase default_action_phase)\n```\nAfter this call, any usage of this type will use the provided specification by default. The returned EventId can be used to dispatch events instead of the type string.\n\nVarious changes:\n- All event listeners on the current element will always be called after calling `StopPropagation()`. When propagating to the next element, the event is stopped. This behavior is consistent with the standard DOM events model. The event can be stopped immediately with `StopImmediatePropagation()`.\n- `Element::DispatchEvent` can now optionally take an `EventId` instead of a `String`.\n- The `resize` event now only applies to the document size, not individual elements.\n- The `scrollchange` event has been replaced by a function call. To capture scroll changes, instead use the `scroll` event.\n- The `textinput` event now sends a `String` in UTF-8 instead of a UCS-2 character, possibly with multiple characters. The parameter key name is changed from \"data\" to \"text\".\n\n\n### Other features\n\n- `Context::ProcessMouseWheel` now takes a float value for the `wheel_delta` property, thereby enabling continuous/smooth scrolling for input devices with such support. The default scroll length for unity value of `wheel_delta` is now three times the default line-height multiplied by the current dp-ratio.\n- The system interface now has two new functions for setting and getting text to and from the clipboard: `virtual void SystemInterface::SetClipboardText(const Core::String& text)` and `virtual void SystemInterface::GetClipboardText(Core::String& text)`.\n- The `text-decoration` property can now also be used with `overline` and `line-through`.\n- The text input and text area elements can be navigated and edited word for word by holding the Ctrl key. Can now also navigate by using Ctrl+Home/End and Page up/down. Furthermore, select all by Ctrl+A and select word by double click.\n- Double clicks are now submitted only when they're inside a small radius of the first click.\n- The `<img>` element can now take sprite names in the `sprite` attribute. For images the `src` attribute can be used as before.\n- The `sliderbar` on the `range` input element can now use margins to offset it from the track.\n\n\n### Breaking changes\n\nBreaking changes since RmlUi 2.0.\n\n- RmlUi now requires a C++14-compatible compiler (previously C++11).\n- Rml::Core::String has been replaced by std::string, thus, interfacing with the library now requires you to change your string types. This change was motivated by a small performance gain, additionally, it should make it easier to interface with the library especially for users already using std::string in their codebase. Furthermore, strings should be considered as encoded in UTF-8.\n- To load fonts, use `Rml::Core::LoadFontFace` instead of `Rml::Core::FontDatabase::LoadFontFace`.\n- Querying the property of an element for size, position and similar may not work as expected right after changes to the document or style. This change is made for performance reasons, see the description under *performance* for reasoning and a workaround.\n- The Controls::DataGrid \"min-rows\" property has been removed.\n- Removed RenderInterface::GetPixelsPerInch, instead the pixels per inch value has been fixed to 96 PPI, as per CSS specs. To achieve a scalable user interface, instead use the 'dp' unit.\n- The `<img>` element's `coords` attribute is now replaced by a `rect` attribute specified like for sprites.\n- Removed 'top' and 'bottom' from z-index property.\n- Angles need to be declared in either 'deg' or 'rad'. Unit-less numbers do not work.\n- See changes to the declaration of decorators and font-effects above.\n- See changes to the render interface regarding transforms above.\n- See changes to the event system above.\n- The focus flag in `ElementDocument::Show` has been changed, with a new enum name and new options, see above.\n- The tiled decorators (`image`, `tiled-horizontal`, `tiled-vertical`, and `tiled-box`) no longer support the old repeat modes.\n- Also, see removal of manual reference counting above.\n\n\n\n\n## RmlUi 2.0\n\nRmlUi 2.0 is the first release after the [original libRocket branch](https://github.com/libRocket/libRocket).\n\n### Transform property\n\nBased on the work of @shoemark, with additional fixes.\n\nUse `perspective`, `perspective-origin`, `transform` and `transform-origin` in RCSS, roughly equivalent to their respective CSS properties.\n\n```css\nperspective: 1000px;\nperspective-origin: 20px 50%;\ntransform: rotateX(10deg) skew(-10deg, 15deg) translateZ(100px);\ntransform-origin: left top 0;\n```\n\nAll transform properties and their argument types are as follows:\n```\nperspective,  length1\nmatrix,       abs_numbers6\nmatrix3d,     abs_numbers16\ntranslateX,   length1\ntranslateY,   length1\ntranslateZ,   length1\ntranslate,    length2\ntranslate3d,  length3\nscaleX,       number1\nscaleY,       number1\nscaleZ,       number1\nscale,        number2\nscale,        number1\nscale3d,      number3\nrotateX,      angle1\nrotateY,      angle1\nrotateZ,      angle1\nrotate,       angle1\nrotate3d,     number3angle1\nskewX,        angle1\nskewY,        angle1\nskew,         angle2\n```\n\nAngles take units of 'deg' or 'rad'.\n\n\n\n\n\n### Animations\n\n\nMost RCSS properties can be animated, this includes properties representing lengths, colors, or transforms. From C++, an animation can be started on an Element by calling\n\n```cpp\nbool Element::Animate(const String& property_name, const Property& target_value, float duration, Tween tween = Tween{}, int num_iterations = 1, bool alternate_direction = true, float delay = 0.0f, const Property* start_value = nullptr);\n```\n\nAdditional animation keys can be added, extending the duration of the animation, by calling\n\n```cpp\nbool Element::AddAnimationKey(const String& property_name, const Property& target_value, float duration, Tween tween = Tween{});\n```\n\nC++ example usage:\n\n```cpp\nauto p1 = Transform::MakeProperty({ Transforms::Rotate2D{10.f}, Transforms::TranslateX{100.f} });\nauto p2 = Transform::MakeProperty({ Transforms::Scale2D{3.f} });\nel->Animate(\"transform\", p1, 1.8f, Tween{ Tween::Elastic, Tween::InOut }, -1, true);\nel->AddAnimationKey(\"transform\", p2, 1.3f, Tween{ Tween::Elastic, Tween::InOut });\n```\n\n\nAnimations can also be specified entirely in RCSS, with keyframes.\n```css\nanimation: <duration> <delay> <tweening-function> <num_iterations|infinite> <alternate> <paused> <keyframes-name>;\n```\nAll values, except `<duration>` and `<kyframes-name>`, are optional. Delay must be specified after duration, otherwise values can be given in any order. Keyframes are specified as in CSS, see example below. Multiple animations can be specified on the same element by using a comma-separated list.\n\nTweening functions (or in CSS lingo, `animation-timing-function`s) specify how the animated value progresses during the animation cycle. A tweening function in RCSS is specified as `<name>-in`, `<name>-out`, or `<name>-in-out`, with one of the following names,\n```\nback\nbounce\ncircular\ncubic\nelastic\nexponential\nlinear\nquadratic\nquartic\nquintic\nsine\n```\n\nRCSS example usage:\n\n```css\n@keyframes my-progress-bar\n{\n\t0%, 30% {\n\t\tbackground-color: #d99;\n\t}\n\t50% {\n\t\tbackground-color: #9d9;\n\t}\n\tto { \n\t\tbackground-color: #f9f;\n\t\twidth: 100%;\n\t}\n}\n#my_element\n{\n\twidth: 25px;\n\tanimation: 2s cubic-in-out infinite alternate my-progress-bar;\n}\n```\n\nInternally, animations apply their properties on the local style of the element. Thus, mixing RML style attributes and animations should be avoided on the same element.\n\nAnimations currently support full interpolation of transforms, largely following the CSS specifications. Additionally, interpolation is supported for colors, numbers, lengths, and percentages.\n\nAnimations are very powerful coupled with transforms. See the animation sample project for more examples and details. There are also some [video demonstrations](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/animations_transitions_transforms.html) of these features in the documentation.\n\n\n### Transitions\n\nTransitions apply an animation between two property values on an element when its property changes. Transitions are implemented in RCSS similar to how they operate in CSS. However, in RCSS, they only apply when a class or pseudo-class is added to or removed from an element.\n\n```css\ntransition: <space-separated-list-of-properties|all|none> <duration> <delay> <tweening-function>;\n```\nThe property list specifies the properties to be animated. Delay and tweening-function are optional. Delay must be specified after duration, otherwise values can be given in any order. Multiple transitions can be specified on the same element by using a comma-separated list. The tweening function is specified as in the `animation` RCSS property.\n\n\nExample usage:\n\n```css\n#transition_test {\n\ttransition: padding-left background-color transform 1.6s elastic-out;\n\ttransform: scale(1.0);\n\tbackground-color: #c66;\n}\n#transition_test:hover {\n\tpadding-left: 60px;\n\ttransform: scale(1.5);\n\tbackground-color: #ddb700;\n} \n```\n\nSee the animation sample project for more examples and details.\n\n\n### Density-independent pixel (dp)\n\nThe `dp` unit behaves like `px` except that its size can be set globally to scale relative to pixels. This makes it easy to achieve a scalable user interface. Set the ratio globally on the context by calling:\n\n```cpp\nfloat dp_ratio = 1.5f;\ncontext->SetDensityIndependentPixelRatio(dp_ratio);\n```\n\nUsage example in RCSS:\n```css\ndiv#header \n{\n\twidth: 800dp;\n\theight: 50dp;\n\tfont-size: 20dp;\n}\n```\n\n\n### Pointer events\n\nSet the element property to disregard mouse input events on this and descending elements.\n```css\npointer-events: none;\n```\nDefault is `auto`.\n\n\n### Image-color property\n\nNon-standard RCSS property which multiplies a color with images in `<img>` tags and image decorators. Useful for `:hover`-events and for applying transparency.\n```css\nimage-color: rgba(255, 160, 160, 200);\nicon-decorator: image;\nicon-image: background.png 34px 0px 66px 28px;\n```\n\n\n### Inline-block\n\nUnlike the original branch, elements with\n```css\ndisplay: inline-block;\n```\nwill shrink to the width of their content, like in CSS.\n\n\n\n### Border shorthand\n\nEnables the `border` property shorthand.\n```css\nborder: 4px #e99;\n```\n\n\n### Various features\n\n- The slider on the `input.range` element can be dragged from anywhere in the element.\n- The `:checked` pseudo class can be used to style the selected item in drop-down lists.\n\n\n### Breaking changes\n\n- The namespace has changed from `Rocket` to `Rml`, include path from `<Rocket/...>` to `<RmlUi/...>`, and macro prefix from `ROCKET_` to `RMLUI_`.\n- `Rml::Core::SystemInterface::GetElapsedTime()` now returns `double` instead of `float`.\n```cpp\nvirtual double GetElapsedTime();\n```\n- The `font-size` property no longer accepts a unit-less `<number>`, instead add the `px` unit for equivalent behavior. The new behavior is consistent with CSS.\n- The old functionality for setting and drawing mouse cursors has been replaced by a new function call to the system interface, thereby allowing the user to set the system cursor.\n- Python support has been removed.\n"

          "content": "# RmlUi contribution guidelines\n\n## CMake\n\nRmlUi aims to support all of the following consumption modes:\n\n- Adding the library as a subdirectory directly from CMake.\n- Building the library \"in-source\" without installing.\n- Building and installing the library.\n- Using pre-built binaries on applicable platforms.\n\nThis flexibility allows projects to easily integrate the library within their build setups, and also provides a good foundation for integration into package managers. To support these modes, together with the aim of ensuring clean and maintainable code, the following conventions should be followed when editing CMake code for the project:\n\n- **Follow modern CMake conventions**. See [Modern CMake](https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/) by Henry Schreiner and contributors, and [Professional CMake](https://crascit.com/professional-cmake/) by Craig Scott.\n\n- **Go simple:** CMake already provides a wide set of features that have been adopted to work on a large variety of target platforms and compilers. Make use of these generic facilities rather than writing scenario-specific code or setting compiler-specific flags.\n\n  - **Compiler-specific options and flags should be provided by consumers:** If necessary, consumers should set variables on the command-line, set variables in the parent project, add a [CMake user presets](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-presets.7.html) file, or provide a [CMake toolchain file](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html), as appropriate. This applies in particular to setting options for their compiler toolchain, platform, building static instead of dynamic libraries, building framework packages for iOS and macOS, or other specific scenarios.\n\n  - **Avoid setting global variables:** If necessary, these should be set by the consumer, not by the project itself. This includes in particular the variable `CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`.\n\n  - **Avoid setting compiler flags:** This often creates an unnecessary dependency on certain compilers, increasing the complexity of build scripts and potentially creating issues with the project consuming the library.\n\n  - **In the event that compiler flags need to be set, please do so on a target basis** using either [CMake compile features](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-compile-features.7.html) and [`target_compile_features()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_features.html) when possible or [`target_compile_options()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_options.html). The use of such flags by the project by default needs to be noted in the documentation in order to help consumers predict and mitigate any issues that may arise when consuming the library.\n\n  - **Keep CMake presets small and independent of specific compilers**: The library-provided CMake presets should only provide a small number of typical scenarios for consumers, contributors, and maintainers. Flags and settings that are specific to certain compiler toolchains should not be in the presets. By following this convention, we avoid a combinatorial explosion due to base scenarios combined with different toolchains, as well as variations of each scenario. Instead, users should provide variables and flags specific to their setup.\n\n- **Assume building the library as a consumer:** The default behavior of the CMake project should be oriented towards the bare minimum needed for the library to work (tests, samples, and additional plugins disabled). If the consumer needs anything more, they should be the ones tweaking the behavior of the project to suit their needs via CMake options.\n\n- **Treat CMake code as production code:** When deemed necessary, context clues and additional information about certain decisions might also be given in the form of block comments delimited using [bracket comments](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#bracket-comment).\n\n- **Prefix all variables and targets visible from outer scopes:** Because the project aims to support consuming RmlUi as a CMake subdirectory, care should be taken when using variables and targets. CMake subdirectories inherit read and write access to all variables accessible from their parent scope/directory, meaning naming overlap of variables and targets may occur and lead to unexpected behavior. For this reason, the names of meaningful variables should begin with `RMLUI_`, and the name of all targets related to the project must begin with `rmlui_` (internal CMake targets and aliases) or `RmlUi::` (imported targets and aliases intended to be referenced externally when consumed as a CMake subdirectory or installed and exported when built standalone).\n\n- **Keep the scope clean:** For temporary variables that are necessary for a very limited amount of lines of code, remove them afterwards using `unset()`.\n\n- **Prefer quoted string literals:** Quoted string literals helps with clarity and protects some CMake functions from interpreting the string as a variable name. It further protects against unintended behavior in strings containing [references to variables](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-language.7.html#variable-references) in particular when whitespace is present.\n\n- **Do not reference [`CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR.html):** RmlUi aims to be consumable by other CMake projects when being included as a CMake sub-project using [`add_subdirectory()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_subdirectory.html). In this scenario, `CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR` won't point to the top source directory of the RmlUi source, but to the top source directory of the parent CMake project consuming RmlUi. For this reason, **reference either [`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR.html) or [`PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR.html) when relevant instead**.\n\n- **Use [generator expressions](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generator-expressions.7.html) when relevant instead of their CMake variable counterparts:** To find the folder where the executable has been built or to simply find the current build type, CMake variables like `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` and `CMAKE_BINARY_DIR` are commonly used. However, this behavior is not recommended as every build system has its own conventions when it comes to folder paths and are not always known at configure time, especially for multi-config generators like Visual Studio. For this reason, it is strongly advised to use CMake generator expressions whenever possible to ensure the project can be compiled regardless of the build system used. If a specific CMake feature doesn't work with generator expressions, try making a CMake script and [calling it at build time](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake.1.html#run-a-script) using [`add_custom_command()`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/add_custom_command.html) or create an issue or discussion in the RmlUi repository.\n\n- **Every time the minimum CMake version is going to be raised, check for the `RMLUI_CMAKE_MINIMUM_VERSION_RAISE_NOTICE` keyword in all CMake files (`*.cmake`, `CMakeLists.txt`):** This keyword appears in comments indicating improvements, changes or warnings in the CMake project that could be relevant once the minimum CMake version reaches a certain point. Contributors are invited to add more of these comments as they implement more code for the CMake project so that they can be later revised when the moment to increase the minimum CMake version comes.\n"

It is a fork of the [libRocket](https://github.com/libRocket/libRocket) project, introducing new features, bug fixes, and performance improvements. \n\nRmlUi aims at being a light-weight and performant library with its own layouting engine and few dependencies. In essence, RmlUi takes your HTML/CSS-like source files and turns them into vertices, indices and draw commands, and then you bring your own renderer to draw them. And of course there is full access to the element hierarchy/DOM, event handling, and all the interactivity and customizability you would expect. All of this directly from C++, or optionally from scripting languages using plugins. The core library compiles down to fractions of the size it takes to integrate a fully fledged web browser. \n\nRmlUi is based around the XHTML1 and CSS2 standards while integrating features from HTML5 and CSS3, and extends them with features suited towards real-time applications. Take a look at the [conformance](#conformance) and [enhancements](#enhancements) sections below for details.\n\nDocumentation is located at https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/\n\n## Features\n\n- Cross-platform architecture: Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, iOS, Switch, and more.\n- Dynamic layout system.\n- Full animation and transform support.\n- Efficient application-wide styling, with a custom-built templating engine.\n- Fully featured control set: buttons, sliders, drop-downs, and more.\n- Runtime visual debugging suite.\n\n## Extensible\n\n- Abstracted interfaces for plugging in to any game engine.\n- Decorator engine allowing custom application-specific effects that can be applied to any element.\n- Generic event system that binds seamlessly into existing projects.\n- Easily integrated and extensible with the Lua scripting plugin.\n\n## Controllable\n\n- The user controls their own update loop, calling into RmlUi as desired.\n- The library strictly runs as a result of calls to its API, never in the background.\n- Input handling and rendering is performed by the user.\n- The library generates vertices, indices, and textures for the user to render how they like.\n- File handling and the font engine can optionally be fully replaced by the user.\n\n## Conformance\n\nRmlUi aims to support the most common and familiar features from HTML and CSS, while keeping the library light and performant. We do not aim to be fully compliant with CSS or HTML, in particular when it conflicts with lightness and performance. Users are generally expected to author documents specifically for RmlUi, but any experience and skills from web design should be transferable.\n\nRmlUi supports most of CSS2 with some CSS3 features such as\n\n- Animations and transitions\n- Transforms (with full interpolation support)\n- Flexbox layout\n- Media queries\n- Border radius\n- Box shadows and mask images\n- Gradients (linear, radial, and conic) as decorators\n- Filters and backdrop filters (with all CSS filter functions)\n\nand many of the common HTML elements including `<input>`,  `<textarea>`, and `<select>`.\n\nFor details, see\n- [RCSS Property index](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/property_index.html) for all supported properties and differences from CSS.\n- [RML Element index](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rml/element_index.html) for all supported elements.\n\n## Enhancements\n\nRmlUi adds features and enhancements over CSS and HTML where it makes sense, most notably the following.\n\n- [Data binding (model-view-controller)](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/data_bindings.html). Synchronization between application data and user interface.\n- [Decorators](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/decorators.html). Full control over the styling of [all elements](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/style_guide.html).\n- [Sprite sheets](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/sprite_sheets.html). Define and use sprites with easy high DPI support.\n- [Templates](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rml/templates.html). Making windows look consistent.\n- [Localization](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/localisation.html). Translate any text in the document.\n- [Spatial navigation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/user_interface.html#nav). Suitable for controllers.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/). However, it can be fully replaced by a custom [font engine](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/interfaces/font_engine.html).\n- The standard library.\n\nIn addition, a C++14 compatible compiler is required.\n\n\n## Building RmlUi\n\nRmlUi is built using CMake and your favorite compiler, see the [building documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/building_with_cmake.html) for all the details and options. Windows binaries are also available for the [latest release](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/releases/latest). Most conveniently, it is possible to fetch the library using a dependency manager such as [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started.html) or [Conan](https://conan.io/).\n\n#### vcpkg\n\n```\nvcpkg install rmlui\n```\n\nThat's it! See below for details on integrating RmlUi.\n\nTo build RmlUi with the included samples we can use git and CMake together with vcpkg to handle dependencies.\n\n```\nvcpkg install freetype glfw3\ngit clone https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi.git\ncd RmlUi\ncmake -B Build -S . --preset samples -DRMLUI_BACKEND=GLFW_GL3 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=\"<path-to-vcpkg>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake\"\ncmake --build Build\n```\nMake sure to replace the path to vcpkg. This example uses the `GLFW_GL3` backend, other backends are available as shown below. When this completes, feel free to test the freshly built samples, such as the `invaders` sample (`rmlui_sample_invaders` target), and enjoy! The executables should be located somewhere in the `Build` directory.\n\nTo make all the samples available, you can additionally install `lua lunasvg rlottie harfbuzz` and pass `--preset samples-all` during CMake configuration.\n\n#### Conan\n\nRmlUi is readily available from [ConanCenter](https://conan.io/center/recipes/rmlui).\n\n\n## Integrating RmlUi\n\nHere are the general steps to integrate the library into a C++ application, have a look at the [integration documentation](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/integrating.html) for details.\n\n1. Build RmlUi as above or fetch the binaries, and [link it up](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/integrating.html#setting-up-the-build-environment) to your application.\n2. Implement the abstract [render interface](Include/RmlUi/Core/RenderInterface.h), or fetch one of the backends listed below.\n3. Initialize RmlUi with the interfaces, create a context, provide font files, and load a document.\n4. Call into the context's update and render methods in a loop, and submit input events.\n5. Compile and run!\n\nSeveral [samples](Samples/) demonstrate everything from basic integration to more complex use of the library, feel free to have a look for inspiration.\n\n\n## RmlUi Backends\n\nTo ease the integration of RmlUi, the library includes [many backends](Backends/) adding support for common renderers and platforms. The following terms are used here:\n\n- ***Renderer***: Implements the [render interface](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/interfaces/render.html) for a given rendering API, and provides initialization code when necessary.\n- ***Platform***: Implements the [system interface](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/cpp_manual/interfaces/system.html) for a given platform (operating system or window library), and adds procedures for providing input to RmlUi contexts.\n- ***Backend***: Combines a renderer and a platform for a complete windowing framework sample, implementing the basic [Backend interface](Backends/RmlUi_Backend.h).\n\nThe provided renderers and platforms are intended to be usable as-is by client projects without modifications, thereby circumventing the need to write custom interfaces. We encourage users to only make changes here when they are useful to all users, and then contribute back to the project. However, if they do not meet your needs it is also possible to copy them into your project for modifications. Feedback is welcome to find the proper abstraction level. The provided system and render interfaces are designed such that they can be derived from and further customized by the backend or end user.\n\nThe provided backends on the other hand are not intended to be used directly by client projects, but rather copied and modified as needed. They are intentionally light-weight and implement just enough functionality to make the [included samples](Samples/) run, while being simple to understand and build upon by users.

Sufficient for basic 2D layouts.\\\n**Transforms**: Enables the `transform` and `perspective` properties to take effect.\\\n**Clip masks**: Enables proper clipping of transformed elements, elements with border-radius.\\\n**Filters**: Support for the `filter` and `backdrop-filter` properties with all filter functions, such as blur and drop-shadow.\\\n**Shaders**: Support for all built-in decorators that require shaders, such as `linear-gradient` and `radial-gradient`. Other advanced rendering functions are also implemented, including render-to-texture and masking support for properties such as `box-shadow` and `mask-image`.\\\n**Built-in image support**: This only shows the supported formats built-in to the renderer, users are encouraged to derive from and extend the render interface to add support for their desired image formats.\n\n### Platforms\n\n| Platform support | Basic windowing | Clipboard | High DPI | Comments  |\n|------------------|:---------------:|:---------:|:--------:|-----------|\n| Win32            |       âï¸        |    âï¸     |    âï¸    | High DPI only supported on Windows 10 and newer. |\n| X11              |       âï¸        |    âï¸     |    â     |  |\n| SFML             |       âï¸        |    â ï¸     |    â     | Supports SFML 2 and SFML 3.

High DPI supported only on SDL 3. |\n\n**Basic windowing**: Open windows, react to resize events, submit inputs to the RmlUi context.\\\n**Clipboard**: Read from and write to the system clipboard.\\\n**High DPI**: Scale the [dp-ratio](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/rcss/syntax#dp-unit) of RmlUi contexts based on the monitor's DPI settings. React to DPI-changes, either because of changed settings or when moving the window to another monitor.\n\n### Backends\n\n| Platform \\ Renderer | OpenGL 2 (GL2) | OpenGL 3 (GL3) | Vulkan (VK) |

extend their respective renderers to provide image support based on SDL_image.\\\nÂ² Supports Emscripten compilation target.\n\nWhen building the samples, the backend can be selected by setting the CMake option `RMLUI_BACKEND` to `<Platform>_<RendererShorthand>` for any of the above supported combinations of platforms and renderers, such as `SDL_GL3`.\n\n\n## Example document\n\nThis example demonstrates a basic document with [data bindings](https://mikke89.github.io/RmlUiDoc/pages/data_bindings.html), which is loaded and displayed using the C++ code below.\n\n#### Document\n\n`hello_world.rml`\n\n```html\n<rml>\n<head>\n    <title>Hello world</title>\n    <link type=\"text/rcss\" href=\"rml.rcss\"/>\n    <link type=\"text/rcss\" href=\"window.rcss\"/>\n</head>\n<body data-model=\"animals\">\n    <h1>RmlUi</h1>\n    <p>Hello <span id=\"world\">world</span>!</p>\n    <p data-if=\"show_text\">The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy {{animal}}.</p>\n    <input type=\"text\" data-value=\"animal\"/>\n</body>\n</rml>\n```\nThe `{{animal}}` text and the `data-if`, `data-value` attributes represent data bindings and will synchronize with the application data.\n\n#### Style sheet\n\n`window.rcss`\n\n```css\nbody {\n    font-family: LatoLatin;\n    font-size: 18px;\n    color: #02475e;\n    background: #fefecc;\n    text-align: center;\n    padding: 2em 1em;\n    position: absolute;\n    border: 2px #ccc;\n    width: 500px;\n    height: 200px;\n    margin: auto;\n}\n\nh1 {\n    color: #f6470a;\n    font-size: 1.5em;\n    font-weight: bold;\n    margin-bottom: 0.7em;\n}\n\np { \n    margin: 0.7em 0;\n}\n\ninput.text {\n    background-color: #fff;\n    color: #555;\n    border: 2px #999;\n    padding: 5px;\n    tab-index: auto;\n    cursor: text;\n    box-sizing: border-box;\n    width: 200px;\n    font-size: 0.9em;\n}\n```\n\nRmlUi defines no styles internally, thus the `input` element is styled here, and [`rml.rcss` is included](Samples/assets/rml.rcss) for proper layout of common tags.\n\n\n#### C++ Initialization and loop\n\n`main.cpp`\n\n```cpp\n#include <RmlUi/Core.h>\n\nclass MyRenderInterface : public Rml::RenderInterface\n{\n    // RmlUi sends vertices, indices and draw commands through this interface for your\n    // application to render how you'd like.\n    /* ... */\n}\n\nstruct ApplicationData {\n    bool show_text = true;\n    Rml::String animal = \"dog\";\n} my_data;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv)\n{\n    // Initialize the window and graphics API being used, along with your game or application.\n\n    /* ... */\n\n    MyRenderInterface render_interface;\n\n    // Install the custom interfaces.\n    Rml::SetRenderInterface(&render_interface);\n\n    // Now we can initialize RmlUi.\n    Rml::Initialise();\n\n    // Create a context to display documents within.\n    Rml::Context* context =\n        Rml::CreateContext(\"main\", Rml::Vector2i(window_width, window_height));\n\n    // Tell RmlUi to load the given fonts.\n    Rml::LoadFontFace(\"LatoLatin-Regular.ttf\");\n    // Fonts can be registered as fallback fonts, as in this case to display emojis.\n    Rml::LoadFontFace(\"NotoEmoji-Regular.ttf\", true);\n\n    // Set up data bindings to synchronize application data.\n    if (Rml::DataModelConstructor constructor = context->CreateDataModel(\"animals\"))\n    {\n        constructor.Bind(\"show_text\", &my_data.show_text);\n        constructor.Bind(\"animal\", &my_data.animal);\n    }\n\n    // Now we are ready to load our document.\n    Rml::ElementDocument* document = context->LoadDocument(\"hello_world.rml\");\n    document->Show();\n\n    // Replace and style some text in the loaded document.\n    Rml::Element* element = document->GetElementById(\"world\");\n    element->SetInnerRML(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(u8\"ð\"));\n    element->SetProperty(\"font-size\", \"1.5em\");\n\n    bool exit_application = false;\n    while (!exit_application)\n    {\n        // We assume here that we have some way of updating and retrieving inputs internally.\n        if (my_input->KeyPressed(KEY_ESC))\n            exit_application = true;\n\n        // Submit input events such as MouseMove and key events (not shown) to the context.\n        if (my_input->MouseMoved())\n            context->ProcessMouseMove(mouse_pos.x, mouse_pos.y, 0);\n\n        // Update the context to reflect any changes resulting from input events, animations,\n        // modified and added elements, or changed data in data bindings.\n        context->Update();\n\n        // Prepare the application for rendering, such as by clearing the window. This calls\n        // into the RmlUi backend interface, replace with your own procedures as appropriate.\n        Backend::BeginFrame();\n        \n        // Render the user interface. All geometry and other rendering commands are now\n        // submitted through the render interface.\n        context->Render();\n\n        // Present the rendered content, such as by swapping the swapchain. This calls into\n        // the RmlUi backend interface, replace with your own procedures as appropriate.\n        Backend::PresentFrame();\n    }\n\n    Rml::Shutdown();\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n#### Rendered output\n\n![Hello world document](Samples/assets/hello_world.png)\n\nUsers can now edit the text field to change the animal. The data bindings ensure that both the document text as well as the application string `my_data.animal` are automatically modified accordingly.\n\n\n## Gallery\n\n**Game interface from the 'invader' sample**\\\n![Game interface](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUiDoc/blob/3f319d8464e73b821179ff8d20537013af5b9810/assets/gallery/invader.png?raw=true)\n\n**Game menu**\\\n![Game menu](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUiDoc/blob/3f319d8464e73b821179ff8d20537013af5b9810/assets/gallery/menu_screen.png?raw=true)\n\n**Simple game from the 'data_binding' sample**\\\n![Data binding sample](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikke89/RmlUiDoc/df1651db94e69f2977bc0344864ec061b56b104e/assets/gallery/data_binding.png)\n\n**Applying filters in the 'effects' sample**\\\n![Effects sample](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUiDoc/blob/master/assets/images/effects-sample-filters.png?raw=true)\n\n\\\n**Video demonstration of the 'effects' sample**\n\n[Effects sample video](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi/assets/5490330/bdc0422d-867d-4090-9d48-e7159e3adc18)\n\n**[Killing Time: Resurrected](https://nightdivestudios.com/killing-time-resurrected/) by [Nightdive Studios](https://www.nightdivestudios.com/) and [Ziggurat Interactive](https://www.ziggurat.games/game/killing-time-resurrected) -
