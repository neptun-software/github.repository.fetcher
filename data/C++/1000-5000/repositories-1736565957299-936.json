From the build directory, run cmake to the project root. Eg: `cd build && cmake ..`\n  3. To build, run `make`.\n  4. To install, run `make install`.\n\nCMake accepts a number of standard and extra arguments:\n\n  - BUILD_MAN_PAGES, pass -DBUILD_MAN_PAGES=ON to build man pages\n  - ENABLE_JOURNALD, pass -DENABLE_JOURNALD=OFF\n    to disable logging to the journal\n\nBy default, a debug build is created. To build for production, use\n`cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`.\n\nTo see all the possible arguments, run `cmake -L ..`.\nFor documentation on standard CMake variables, see:\n  http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/manual/cmake-variables.7.html\n\n### Post-installation steps\n\nBy default, SDDM runs as its own user. An `sddm` user needs to be created, with\nits home set to `/var/lib/sddm` by default.\n\n### Dependencies\n\nSDDM depends on PAM for authorization and XCB to communicate with the X server.\nApart from other things, it also depends on Qt for the user interface and event\nloop management.\nSDDM can optionally make use of logind (the systemd login manager API), or\nConsoleKit2, or upower to enable support for suspend, hibernate etc.\nIn order to build the man pages, you will need `rst2man` installed. It is\nprovided by the python `docutils` package\n\nNote that SDDM makes use of C++11 features for a modern and clean codebase,\ntherefore it needs a recent version of GCC to compile (4.7 at least).\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n"

Definitions\n\n a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other\n    pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,\n    arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work,\n    or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any\n    other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted\n    including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a\n    work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for\n    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is\n    a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work\n    in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an\n    Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\n    encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts,\n    or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f)\n    below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents,\n    constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its\n    entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,\n    each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which\n    together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a\n    Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the\n    purposes of this License.\n c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies\n    of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer\n    of ownership.\n d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer\n    (s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the\n    individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no\n    individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i)\n    in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and\n    other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or\n    otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore;\n    (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal\n    entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,\n    (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the\n    broadcast.\n f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of\n    this License including without limitation any production in the literary,\n    scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its\n    expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other\n    writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a\n    dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment\n    in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a\n    cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process\n    analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,\n    sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are\n    assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work\n    of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional\n    work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\n    performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent\n    it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety\n    or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary\n    or artistic work.\n g. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License\n    who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to\n    the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to\n    exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to\n    communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or\n    process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital\n    performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that\n    members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place\n    individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means\n    or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the\n    Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast\n    the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without\n    limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and\n    reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected\n    performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit,\nor restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or\nexceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection\nunder copyright law or other applicable laws.\n\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor\nhereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the\nduration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the\nWork as stated below:\n\n a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n    including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly\n    label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the\n    original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original\n    work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could\n    indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in\n    Collections; and,\n d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n\n     i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the\n        exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of\n        the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which\n        the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory\n        licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right\n        to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted\n        under this License; and,\n    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\n        royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a\n        member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing\n        schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights\n        granted under this License.\n\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or\nhereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such\nmodifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other\nmedia and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by\nLicensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\nsubject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of\n    this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on\n    the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the\n    recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient\n    under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must\n    keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform.\n    When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any\n    effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a\n    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that\n    recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the\n    Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the\n    Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of\n    this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n    must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as\n    required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon\n    notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from\n    the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4\n    (a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable\n    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original\n    Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original\n    Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor\n    institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution\n    Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other\n    reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the\n    Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if\n    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such\n    URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the\n    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an\n    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation\n    (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay\n    based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this\n    Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,\n    however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such\n    credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\n    Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a\n    manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing\n    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required\n    by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above\n    and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly\n    or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or\n    endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as\n    appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express\n    prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n    Attribution Parties.\n c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or\n    Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other\n    derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the\n    Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those\n    jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in\n    Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be\n    deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory\n    action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the\n    Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the\n    fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\n    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to\n    make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS\nTHE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND\nCONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING,\nWITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\nACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH\nEXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN\nNO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\nINCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS\nLICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. Termination\n\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically\n    upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or\n    entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this\n    License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such\n    individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses.\n    Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n    perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n    Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work\n    under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time;\n    provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this\n    License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted\n    under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full\n    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n\n8. Miscellaneous\n\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the\n    Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms\n    and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers\n    to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and\n    conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\n    remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the\n    parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n    extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n    consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed\n    by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n    respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements\n    or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor\n    shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any\n    communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual\n    written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for\n    the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28,\n    1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the\n    WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright\n    Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter\n    take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are\n    sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\n    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law.\n    If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n    includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional\n    rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not\n    intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\n    Creative Commons Notice\n\n    Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty\n    whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable\n    to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever,\n    including without limitation any general, special, incidental or\n    consequential damages arising in connection to this license.\n    Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has\n    expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all\n    rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\n    Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is\n    licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by\n    either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark\n    or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative\n    Commons.

          "content": "## INTRODUCTION\n\n[![IRC Network](https://img.shields.io/badge/irc-freenode-blue.svg \"IRC Freenode\")](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=sddm)\n\nSDDM is a modern display manager for X11 and Wayland sessions aiming to\nbe fast, simple and beautiful.\nIt uses modern technologies like QtQuick, which in turn gives the designer the ability to\ncreate smooth, animated user interfaces.\n\nSDDM is extremely themeable. We put no restrictions on the user interface design,\nit is completely up to the designer. We simply provide a few callbacks to the user interface\nwhich can be used for authentication, suspend etc.\n\nTo further ease theme creation we provide some premade components like a textbox,\na combox etc.\n\nThere are a few sample themes distributed with SDDM.\nThey can be used as a starting point for new themes.\n\n## SCREENSHOTS\n\n![sample screenshot](https://raw.github.com/sddm/sddm/master/src/greeter/theme/maui.jpg)\n\n## VIDEOS\n\n* [Video background](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKwz2FQcE3c)\n* [Maui theme 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0d1wkcU9DU)\n* [Maui theme 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ28mrOeuNA)\n\n## RESOURCES\n\n* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/issues)\n* [Wiki](https://github.com/sddm/sddm/wiki)\n* [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/group/sddm-devel)\n* IRC channel `#sddm` on [chat.freenode.net](https://webchat.freenode.net?channels=sddm)\n\n## INSTALLATION\n\nQt >= 5.15.0 is required to use SDDM.\n\nSDDM runs the greeter as a system user named \"sddm\" whose home directory needs\nto be set to `/var/lib/sddm`.\n\nIf pam and systemd are available, the greeter will go through logind\nwhich will give it access to drm devices.\n\nDistributions without pam and systemd will need to put the \"sddm\" user\ninto the \"video\" group, otherwise errors regarding GL and drm devices\nmight be experienced.\n\n## VIRTUAL TERMINALS\n\nSDDM is assumed to start at the tty specified by the cmake variable\nSDDM_INITIAL_VT which is an integer and defaults to 1.\n\nIf SDDM_INITIAL_VT wasn't available, SDDM will use the next available one\ninstead.\n\nYou can override SDDM_INITIAL_VT if you want to have a different one if,\nfor example, you were planning on using tty1 for something else.\n\n## LICENSE\n\nSource code of SDDM is licensed under GNU GPL version 2 or later (at your choosing).\nQML files are MIT licensed and images are CC BY 3.0.\n\n## TROUBLESHOOTING\n\n### NVIDIA Prime\n\nAdd this at the bottom of the Xsetup script:\n\n```sh\nif [ -e /sbin/prime-offload ]; then\n    echo running NVIDIA Prime setup /sbin/prime-offload, you will need to manually run /sbin/prime-switch to shut down\n    /sbin/prime-offload\nfi\n```\n\n### No User Icon\n\nSDDM reads user icon from either ~/.face.icon or FacesDir/username.face.icon\n\nYou need to make sure that SDDM user have permissions to read those files.\nIn case you don't want to allow other users to access your $HOME you can use\nACLs if your filesystem does support it.\n\n```sh\nsetfacl -m u:sddm:x /home/username\nsetfacl -m u:sddm:r /home/username/.face.icon\n```\n\n### Custom DPI\n\nIn order to set custom DPI for high resolution screens you should configure\nXorg yourself.  An easy way is to pass an additional argument to Xorg.\n\nEdit ``/etc/sddm.conf``, go to the ``X11`` section and change ``ServerArguments`` like this:\n\n```\nServerArguments=-nolisten tcp -dpi 192\n```\n\nto set DPI to 192.\n\nAs an alternative you can edit Xorg configuration ``xorg.conf``, please refer to the\nXorg documentation.\n"
