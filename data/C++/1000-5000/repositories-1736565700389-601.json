This\nOpenSource project originates from\n[Google Japanese Input](http://www.google.com/intl/ja/ime/).\n\nMozc is not an officially supported Google product.\n\nBuild Status\n------------\n\n| Linux | Windows | macOS | Android lib |\n|:-----:|:-------:|:-----:|:-----------:|\n| [![Linux](https://github.com/google/mozc/actions/workflows/linux.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/mozc/actions/workflows/linux.yaml) | [![Windows](https://github.com/google/mozc/actions/workflows/windows.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/mozc/actions/workflows/windows.yaml) | [![macOS](https://github.com/google/mozc/actions/workflows/macos.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/mozc/actions/workflows/macos.yaml) | [![Android lib](https://github.com/google/mozc/actions/workflows/android.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/google/mozc/actions/workflows/android.yaml) |\n\n\nWhat's Mozc?\n------------\nFor historical reasons, the project name *Mozc* has two different meanings:\n\n1. Internal code name of Google Japanese Input that is still commonly used\n   inside Google.\n2. Project name to release a subset of Google Japanese Input in the form of\n   source code under OSS license without any warranty nor user support.\n\nIn this repository, *Mozc* means the second definition unless otherwise noted.\n\nDetailed differences between Google Japanese Input and Mozc are described in [About Branding](docs/about_branding.md).\n\nBuild Instructions\n------------------\n\n* [How to build Mozc in Docker](docs/build_mozc_in_docker.md): Android library and Linux desktop builds.\n* [How to build Mozc in macOS](docs/build_mozc_in_osx.md): macOS build.\n* [How to build Mozc in Windows](docs/build_mozc_in_windows.md): Windows build.\n\nRelease Plan\n------------\n\ntl;dr. **There is no stable version.**\n\nAs described in [About Branding](docs/about_branding.md) page, Google does\nnot promise any official QA for OSS Mozc project.  Because of this,\nMozc does not have a concept of *Stable Release*.  Instead we change version\nnumber every time when we introduce non-trivial change.  If you are\ninterested in packaging Mozc source code, or developing your own products\nbased on Mozc, feel free to pick up any version.  They should be equally\nstable (or equally unstable) in terms of no official QA process.\n\n[Release History](docs/release_history.md) page may have additional\ninformation and useful links about recent changes.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nAll Mozc code written by Google is released under\n[The BSD 3-Clause License](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).\nFor third party code under [src/third_party](src/third_party) directory,\nsee each sub directory to find the copyright notice.  Note also that\noutside [src/third_party](src/third_party) following directories contain\nthird party code.\n\n### [src/data/dictionary_oss/](src/data/dictionary_oss)\nMixed.\nSee [src/data/dictionary_oss/README.txt](src/data/dictionary_oss/README.txt)\n\n### [src/data/test/dictionary/](src/data/test/dictionary)\nThe same to [src/data/dictionary_oss/](src/data/dictionary_oss).\nSee [src/data/dictionary_oss/README.txt](src/data/dictionary_oss/README.txt)\n\n### [src/data/test/stress_test/](src/data/test/stress_test)\nPublic Domain.
