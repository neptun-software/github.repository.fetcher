Are free avatar models available for commercial use? Do they support digital human customization? Are they based on photos or videos?<br>\nAnswer: The free avatar models are not available for commercial use! If needed, we can support digital human customization. Our digital human customization is based on videos. You can customize a unique digital human for use in the SDK. However, the customized digital human service is a paid service. You can contact us by scanning the QR code on WeChat.<br>\n<img src=\"https://github.com/GuijiAI/duix.ai/blob/main/res/ssx.png\" width=\"200\">\n\n#### 2. How to customize a digital avatar?<br>\nAnswer: To customize a silicon-based digital human, you need to shoot a 3-5 minute video featuring a real person speaking directly to the camera. The specific posture and content of the speech can be determined according to the actual usage scenario. For example, if the video is for legal consultation purposes, you can choose to appear in formal attire and speak about legal-related content, ensuring consistency with the overall context. <br>\n\n#### 3. How is the customization of digital avatars charged?<br>\nAnswer: We provide digital human customization that includes the avatar's appearance and voice, compatible with our SDK open-source interface. For additional customization needs, you can contact our customer service via email.<br>\n\n#### 4. How can the digital avatar be updated?<br>\nAnswer: Currently, the open-source version mainly provides public models. Customization is available upon request.<br>\n\n#### 5. Is there an API interface for avatar cloning<br>\nAnswer: The training service currently only supports deployment on our internal servers for invocation.<br>\n\n#### 6. Does the broadcasted wav file support streaming data?<br>\nAnswer: Streaming support is currently under modification and optimization, and it is not supported at the moment.<br>\n\n#### 7. Are there callback methods for the start and end of the broadcast?<br>\nAnswer:  Callback methods for the start and end of the broadcast are detailed in the SDK documentation. <br>\n\n#### 8. Are there any API controls for the digital human's actions?<br>\nAnswer: The API for controlling digital human actions is not supported at the moment.<br>\n\n#### 9. How to replace downloaded files?<br>\nAnswer: The replacement of downloaded files is detailed in the code.<br><br>\n\n···For more FAQs, please refer to 📑 [FAQ](https://jexopm4t2a.feishu.cn/wiki/Ef1VwGHtRiUIQIkQl1hco2ISnFc)  <br><br> \n\n## Version Record\n\n- **3.0.4**: Fixed an issue where some devices’ default gl float low precision caused the avatar to not display properly.\n- **3.0.3**: Optimized local rendering<br><br>\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n- We have drawn on [wenet](https://github.com/wenet-e2e/wenet) for audio features.<br><br>\n\n## Contact Us\n\n```\nmaoliyan@guiji.ai\n```\n\n## Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=GuijiAI/duix.ai&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#GuijiAI/duix.ai&Date)\n"
