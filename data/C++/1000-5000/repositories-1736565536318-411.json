          "content": "## What is Conceal? [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/conceal.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/conceal)\n\nConceal provides a set of Java APIs to perform cryptography on Android. \nIt was designed to be able to encrypt large files on disk in a fast and \nmemory efficient manner. \n\nThe major target for this project is typical Android devices which run old \nAndroid versions, have low memory and slower processors.\n\nUnlike other libraries, which provide a Smorgasbord of encryption algorithms \nand options, Conceal prefers to abstract this choice and use sane defaults. \nThus Conceal is not a general purpose crypto library, however it aims to provide \nuseful functionality.\n\n***Upgrading version?*** Check the [Upgrade notes](#upgrade-notes) for key compatibility!\n\n#### IMPORTANT: Initializing the library loader\n\nSince v2.0.+ (2017-06-27) you will need to initialize the native library loader.\nThis step is needed because the library loader uses the context.\nThe highly suggested way to do it is in the application class onCreate method like this:\n\n```java\nimport com.facebook.soloader.SoLoader;\npublic class MyApplication extends Application {\n    @Override\n    public void onCreate() {\n        super.onCreate();\n        SoLoader.init(this, false);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Quick start\n\n#### Setup options\n\n1. **Use Maven Central**: Available on maven central under **com.facebook.conceal:conceal:2.0.1@aar** as an AAR package.\nIf you use Android Studio and select the library using the UI, **make sure** to change `build.gradle` **to include the `@aar` suffix**. Otherwise the library won't be included.\n\n2. **Build using gradle**\n\n```bash\n./gradlew build\n```\n\nIt uses gradlew so it takes care of downloading Gradle and all the dependencies it needs.\nOutput will be in `/build/outputs/aar/` directory.\n\n3. **Use prebuilt binaries**: http://facebook.github.io/conceal/documentation/. (linked documentation needs update)\n\n###### An aside on KitKat\n> Conceal predates Jellybean 4.3. On KitKat, Android changed the provider for \n> cryptographic algorithms to OpenSSL. The default Cipher stream however still \n> does not perform well. When replaced with our Cipher stream \n> (see BetterCipherInputStream), the default implementation is competitive against \n> Conceal. On older phones, Conceal is faster than the system provided libraries.\n\n#### Re-build OpenSSL library\n\nYou can run make from the openssl directory. It will download the code and copile the libraries for each architecture.\n\n```bash\n# go to /third-party/openssl\nmake\n```\n\n#### Before running any test!\n\nTest uses BUCK build tool. BUCK uses the source code for OpenSSL. If you didn't already rebuilt OpenSSL form scrach (previous item) then\nrun this:\n\n```bash\n# go to /third-party/openssl\nmake clone\n```\n\nThat will download the OpenSSL code to a subdirectory.\n\n#### Running unit tests\n```bash\n# C++ tests\nbuck test :cpp\n```\n\n#### Running integration tests\n```bash\n# Emulator/device tests\n./instrumentTest/crypto/run\n```\n\nSince Conceal uses native libraries, the only way to run a test on the entire\nencryption process is using integration tests.\n\n#### Running Benchmarks\n```bash\n./benchmarks/run \\\n  benchmarks/src/com/facebook/crypto/benchmarks/CipherReadBenchmark.java \\\n  -- -Dsize=102400\n```\n\nThis script runs vogar with caliper benchmarks.\nYou can also specify all the options caliper provides.\n\n## Usage\n\n#### Entity and keys\n\n**Entity:** this is a not-secret identifier of your data. It's used for integrity check purposes (to know that the content has not been tampered) and also to verify it was not swapped with another valid encrypted content/file.\n\n**Key:** the key is provided by the KeyChain implementation passed to the Crypto object. So each time a new encryption is requested, the key is requested to the KeyChain. The key is generated randomly the first time on demand. You might change the implementation by we strongly suggest to generate a random value. If the encryption key needs for some reason to be based on a text password, you can try using the PasswordBasedKeyGenerator object.\n\n#### Encryption\n```java\n// Creates a new Crypto object with default implementations of a key chain\nKeyChain keyChain = new SharedPrefsBackedKeyChain(context, CryptoConfig.KEY_256);\nCrypto crypto = AndroidConceal.get().createDefaultCrypto(keyChain);\n\n// Check for whether the crypto functionality is available\n// This might fail if Android does not load libaries correctly.\nif (!crypto.isAvailable()) {\n  return;\n}\n\nOutputStream fileStream = new BufferedOutputStream(\n  new FileOutputStream(file));\n\n// Creates an output stream which encrypts the data as\n// it is written to it and writes it out to the file.\nOutputStream outputStream = crypto.getCipherOutputStream(\n  fileStream,\n  Entity.create(\"entity_id\"));\n\n// Write plaintext to it.\noutputStream.write(plainText);\noutputStream.close();\n```\n\n#### Decryption\n```java\n// Get the file to which ciphertext has been written.\nFileInputStream fileStream = new FileInputStream(file);\n\n// Creates an input stream which decrypts the data as\n// it is read from it.\nInputStream inputStream = crypto.getCipherInputStream(\n  fileStream,\n  Entity.create(\"entity_id\"));\n\n// Read into a byte array.\nint read;\nbyte[] buffer = new byte[1024];\n\n// You must read the entire stream to completion.\n// The verification is done at the end of the stream.\n// Thus not reading till the end of the stream will cause\n// a security bug. For safety, you should not\n// use any of the data until it's been fully read or throw\n// away the data if an exception occurs.\nwhile ((read = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n  out.write(buffer, 0, read);\n}\n\ninputStream.close();\n```\n\nIf you don't have a lot of data to encrypt, you could\nuse the convenience functions:\n\n```java\nbyte[] cipherText = crypto.encrypt(plainText, Entity.create(\"mytext\"));\n\nbyte[] plainText = crypto.decrypt(cipherText, Entity.create(\"mytext\"));\n```\n\n#### Integrity\n```java\nOutputStream outputStream = crypto.getMacOutputStream(fileStream, entity);\noutputStream.write(plainTextBytes);\noutputStream.close();\n\nInputStream inputStream = crypto.getMacInputStream(fileStream, entity);\n\n// Will throw an exception if mac verification fails.\n// You must read the entire stream to completion.\n// The verification is done at the end of the stream.\n// Thus not reading till the end of the stream will cause\n// a security bug. For safety, you should not\n// use any of the data until it's been fully read or throw\n// away the data if an exception occurs.\nwhile((read = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {\n  out.write(buffer, 0, read);\n}\ninputStream.close();\n```\n\n### Upgrade notes\n\nStarting with v1.1 recommended encryption will use a 256-bit key (instead of 128-bit). This means stronger security.\nYou should use this default.\n\nIf you need to read from an existing file, you still will need 128-bit encryption. You can use the old way of creating `Crypto` objects as it preserves its 128-bit behavior. Although ideally you should re-encrypt that content with a 256-bit key.\n\nAlso there's an improved way of creating Entity object which is platform independent. It's strongly recommended for new encrypted items although you need to stick to the old way for already encrypted content.\n\n#### Existing code still with 128-bit keys and old Entity (deprecated)\n\n```java\n// this constructor creates a key chain that produces 128-bit keys\nKeyChain keyChain = new SharedPrefsBackedKeyChain(context);\n// this constructor creates a crypto that uses  128-bit keys\nCrypto crypto = new Crypto(keyChain, library);\nEntity entity = new Entity(someStringId);\n```\n\n#### New code using 256-keys and Entity.create\n\nWe recommend the use of the factory class `AndroidConceal`.\n\n```java\n// explicitely create 256-bit key chain\nKeyChain keyChain = new SharedPrefsBackedKeyChain(context, CryptoConfig.KEY_256);\n// create the default crypto (expects 256-bit key)\nAndroidConceal.get().createDefaultCrypto(keyChain);\n// factory class also has explicit methods: createCrypto128Bits and ceateCrypto256Bits if desired.\nEntity entity = Entity.create(someStringId);\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n#### I'm getting NoSuchFieldError on runtime\n\nIf you hit an error on runtime and it says something similar to:\n\n````\njava.lang.NoSuchFieldError: no field with name='mCtxPtr' signature='J' in class Lcom/facebook/crypto/cipher/NativeGCMCipher;\n````\n\nThis happens because native code needs to refer to Java fields/methods. For doing so it uses typical JNI functions which receive the name and signature. At the same time tools like proguard trim off or rename class members in order to get smaller executables. Normally this process is run on release versions. When native code request the member, it's not present anymore.\n\nTo avoid this kind of problems exceptions can be defined. You will need to configure proguard with the rules defined in ``proguard_annotations.pro``. You can use the file as is, or you can include its content in your own proguard configuration file.\n"

This software contains the following license and notice below:\n\nCommon Public License - v 1.0\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\n    i) changes to the Program, and\n\n    ii) additions to the Program;\n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. \n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. \n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. \n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; \n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; \n\n    iii)\tstates that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \n\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\n-----\n\nThe following software may be included in this product: robolectric.
