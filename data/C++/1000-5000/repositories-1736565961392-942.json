At the moment [KVM](http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page) is the only supported hypervisor.\n\nIt tries to be compatible with npm module ecosystem and supports some of the Node.js API.\n\n_WARNING: project is in development and not ready for production use._\n\n### Installation\n\nFirst thing is the command line tool `runtime-cli`, it will add `runtime` command to the shell. Type `runtime` to get full usage help.\n\n```\nnpm install runtime-cli -g\n```\n\nMake sure QEMU is installed, it enables running applications locally.\n\n```\nbrew install qemu           # OSX\nsudo apt-get install qemu   # Ubuntu\n```\n\n### Getting Started\n\nCreate new project and add `index.js` entry point file:\n\n```\nmkdir project\ncd project\nnpm init\nnpm install runtimejs --save\necho \"console.log('ok')\" > index.js\n```\n\nRun project locally in QEMU:\n\n```\nruntime start\n```\n\nThat's it, it should start and print `ok` in the console. \n\nOptionally you can let it watch directory for changes and restart QEMU automatically:\n\n```\nruntime watch\n```\n\n## How does it work?\n\nThere are two main components: operating system kernel and a <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/runtimejs\"><nobr>JavaScript library</nobr></a>.\n\nThe kernel is written in C++ and manages low-level resources like CPU and memory, runs JavaScript using embedded V8 engine.
