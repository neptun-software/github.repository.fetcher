By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

          "content": "# Domoticz Security Setup\n\n_Applies to version: 2023.1 and up_\n\nThis document describes the security options within Domoticz.\n\nBy default, any Domoticz installation gets a default User/Password for an _admin_ user as basic protection for the network it is placed in. \n\n__NOTE__: _First thing to do is changing the default password into something else!_\n\nUsually that network would be someone's private network at home, work, school, barn, car, etc. And for many, if not most, use-cases that is sufficient and what we want. The goal is to measure and control things within the local environment.\n\nBut it is a __bad__ idea to connect any installation directly to the internet, as that would mean __anyone anywhere__ can access Domoticz and control connected devices. Could be _fun_ in some edge-cases, but most likely not what anyone would want.\n\nThe same applies for _larger_ networks, for example a school or an office, where you do not want just anyone that has access to the network, also get access to Domoticz. Schoolkids would probably love it, but teacher and staff probably not :)\n\nThere are a number of 'components'/'functions' involved when it comes to Domoticz security:\n\n* Users\n* Trusted networks\n* _Clients_\n* _Domoticz_\n  * The Domoticz __User Interface__ (or _website_. The UI should be regarded as a _client_)\n  * The Domoticz __Resource server__ (core server that does all the magic)\n  * The Domoticz __'IAM server'__ (Identity & Access Management)\n        _(actually part of the core server at the moment)_\n\nA graphical representation looks like this:\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n  subgraph sUI[User Interfaces]\n    DUI[Domoticz Web Interface]\n    OUI(Any Other Web Interface)\n    APP(Any Domoticz capable App)\n  end\n  subgraph sCORE[Domoticz Core Services]\n    direction LR\n    subgraph Services\n      RSRV[Resource Server]\n      IAM[IAM Server]\n    end\n    DB[(DataBase)] -.- Services\n  end\n  sUI -- \"Use, but only with valid Token!\" --> sCORE\n  subgraph exIAM[External IAM Services]\n    IM(Identity Managemement)\n    AM(Authorization Management)\n  end\n  sUI -. \"Could use to request access Token\" .-> exIAM\n  exIAM -. \"Has trust relation with\" .- sCORE\n```\n\n## Isn't Domoticz just 1 Application?\n\nYes and No :)\n\n__From a User perspective;__ often Domoticz is considered as a single application. Until the point where users start using alternative _'tools'_ to access/control their Domoticz setup.\n\nFor example when using an alternative- and/or additional Dashboard. An additional _'application'_ gets installed and is connected to the existing Domoticz installation.\n\nSame goes for example when a user starts to use a (native) mobile app. The Users installs an additional app on a mobile device and connects it to the Domoticz installation.\n\nIn all these case, the _Resource server_ stays the same, but we change the _UI_. Or just add more _UI's_ that can be used depending on the situation.\n\n__From a development architectural perspective;__ different parts of the Domoticz project/installation are used in different ways and situations.\n\nThe core part, the _Resource server_ is always used. It is the heart of the system that holds and controls all devices and data.\n\nDepending on the User(s) environment 1 of more different _User Interfaces (UI's)_ are used to interact with the _resource server_. Each of those different _UI's_ is called a _client_. And a standard Domoticz installation comes with a default _client_, the _web UI_.\n\nWhen a Domoticz setup becomes either more complex, gets more users, needs connection to the Internet or other less- or insecure networks, it becomes neccessary to add ___SECURITY___. This is where the functions and features of the _IAM server_ comes into play.\n\n### IAM server\n\nDomoticz has a build-in _IAM service_ (part of the core server at the moment) that can be used to handle _Identity_ (Authentication) and _Access_ (Authorization) Management. Here we can define Users and their (access)rights for a (single) Domoticz installation.\n\nBut often in larger/complex environments, there usually already is a more centralized _IAM service_, for example a Windows AD (Active Directory) Server or KeyCloak or a Cloud based solution like AWS Incognito or Microsoft's Azure AD.\n\nAlso in modern (Hybrid) Cloud environments, a more centralized _IAM service_ is often in place.\n\nUsing a centralized _IAM service_, instead of the internal _IAM server_ of each Domoticz installation, makes it much easier the do the on-and offboarding of Users, granting and revoking rights, etc. Also _Single Sign-On_ (SSO) to different applications including one- or more Domoticz installations becomes possible.\n\nAnd thanks to modern (web)standards like OAuth2, OpenID Connect, etc. different _IAM Services and servers_ become interchangable and interopperable, making the life of sysadmins a little easier.\n\nDue to the now build in support of those standards, Domoticz can become integrated in such environments.\n\n---\n\n## Add user-management\n\nA first step is to further leverage 'User-Management'. User-Management add's a first layer of security by requiring possible users to _identify_ themselves before they get access.\n\nUsing the menu 'Setup/Users', additional users can be added to the system.\n\n__NOTE__: It is not a problem to remove the default _admin_ user. But this means that when no other users have been defined, User Management is _turned off_ an now anyone can access Domoticz and gets _admin_ priveleges!\n\n__TIP__: Start with creating a new _admin_ User by giving the user _Admin_ priveleges! So you always have a user to fall back upon if something goes wrong.\n\n__RESCUE TIP__: In case that access to the UI has been lost because no valid (admin) User credentials are known, it is possible to regain access by stopping the Domoticz services and restart it with the `-nowwwpwd` option. Now the missing passwords can be reset. Make sure Domoticz is restarted once more but now _without_ this option to re-activate User-Management.\n\n## Add trusted-networks\n\nUsers coming from a _'trusted network'_ do not need to _identify_ themselves.\n\nBut when coming from 'outside' a trusted network, Domoticz will require the user to authenticate.\n\nIn 'Setup/Settings' on the _security_ tab, there is a section called _'Trusted Networks'_ where IP-addresses and IP-ranges (with wild-cards) can be entered. This ; (semicolon) separated list is used by Domoticz to allow requests coming from clients with an IP-address that falls in one of the listed ranges, to access Domoticz without the need to provide valid credentials.\n\n__NOTE__: Although this functionality seems very handy for easy access to Domoticz for example for scripting and connectivity reasons, it is easy to overlook the possible risks. It is prefered/safer to make sure that scripts, etc. use valid credentials. This has become easier with the use of tokens, so no need to store user credentials in scripts and pass them over the network with each request.\n\n## Add _clients_\n\n_(Applications/UI's that want to communicate with the Domoticz Server)_\n\nNext to _normal_ User Management, it is also possible to register _clients_. Clients are 'applications' that would like to interact with the core Domoticz server to retrieve information and/or perform actions. These applications should/could do so on behalf of registered Users.\n\nExamples of _clients_ are web applications like Dashticz, Reacticz, mobile apps like Domoticz mobile (Xamarin or Android), Domotix, Pilot Home Control or SaaS services as myDomoticz.\n\n_Why do we need clients?_\nBasically by having Users with a username/password, we created a way to secure the use of Domoticz _resources_. A given user can be restricted to do only a given number of actions. But the User uses a _client_ (an application) to perform these actions on his/her behalf. The standard Domoticz UI being one of them.\n\nWhen the Users wants to use other _clients_ as well, the _clients_ also need the Users username/password to perform actions on Domoticz resources (through interaction with the Domoticz resource server.)\n\nThe __problem__ is 'how to trust all these _clients_?'. Putting your Domoticz User credentials into a nice app you just installed on your mobile or found as a SaaS service or installed yourself, etc. makes these credentials open to (un)intentional leakage. Once these credentials are leaked, they could be used by any random _client_.\n\nTherefor it is better to tell the 'Domoticz resource server' which _clients_ are allowed to ask for access on behalf of a User when providing User credentials.\n\nUnder 'Setup/More Options/Applications' it is possible to add/modify _applications_ that Domoticz may trust to give access to resources on behalf of a user.\n\nThe information from an application is used by the _IAM Service_ when handing out Tokens to _clients_ (applications) on behalf of an (authorized) User.\n\n### Generating _secrets_ for _clients_\n\nTo be able to generate and sign secure _tokens_, each client needs to have some kind of _secret_.\n\nSuch a _secret_ is used to digitally sign the tokendata and is also used to validate if a _token_ is valid.\n\nIt is possibe to specify a _secret_ as a passphrase which will be used both for signing and validation. As both the IAM server (for signing) __and__ the Resource server (for validation) need to know this _secret_, it is not considered the most safe option.\n\nIt is better to use a _public/private keypair_ where the private key is used to sign the _token_ (by the IAM server) while the public key is used to validate it (by the Resource server).\n\nAt the moment of writing (2022), an RSA-PSS (Probabilistic) based keypair using 3072 bits key generation is considered quite safe for the coming years.\n\nSee below how to generate such a keypair (in PEM format):\n\n```\nopenssl genpkey -algorithm rsa-pss -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:3072 > [_yourpemfile_].pem\n\nopenssl rsa -pubout -in [_yourpemfile_].pem >> [_yourpemfile_].pem\n```\n\nIn cases where _token_ generation and signing is done by an external IAM service, only the _public key_ has to be made available for the _client_ in Domoticz.\n\n## Connecting Domoticz to the Internet/Cloud\n\nMore and more, Users are looking into ways to control their _Automated Home_ from a distance. So preferably _through the Cloud_. So the Domoticz setup somehow needs to be _accesible_ outside the safe environment of the Home.\n\nThis means there is a need to have some kind of _application_ (a _client_) that can access the _resource server_ to perform actions or exchange data.\n\nThe _resource server_ always has to be _in the Home_ (local) as here it can safely be connected to the devices it controls. Putting the _resource server_ in the Cloud would mean that all communication between Domoticz and the devices would have to go through the Cloud. That is not a wanted scenario as it poses numerous security risks that are almost impossible to mitigate. And probably not even possible with some/most hardware devices.\n\nThat leaves only the _client_ as a candidate to make it accessible/run in the Cloud.\n\nAnd to make sure that the _client_ can safely interact with the (local) _resource server_, this communication has to be secured. Using Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a good way to secure interaction with the _resource server_.\n\n---\n\n## Supporting web standards\n\nDomoticz tries to leverage best practices and (RFC) standards where possible. Sometimes not all details of each standard are fully implemented or honoured, but we should be as close as possible and fitting with Domoticz as possible. Any diversion, etc. should be well documented (and explained probably).\n\n## OAuth2 support (RFC6749)\n\nAt the moment a few flows/grant_types are supported:\n\n* __authorization_code__\n* __authorization_code with PKCE__\n* __password__\n* __refresh_token__\n\nThe _implicit_ flow is not implemented as it is not secure. But using _authorization_code flow with the PKCE extension_ is also possible now. PKCE stands for _Proof Key for Code Exchange_.\n\nWe do not support _client_credentials_ flow as we do not want 'anonymous' access by a client/application.\n\nTo see the details of what is supported by the current _IAM Service_, the specification can be requested through the _well known OpenID Configuration_ endpoint at `https://<yourdomoticz>/.well-known/openid-configuration` which will return something like:\n\n```JSON\n{\n    \"authorization_endpoint\": \"https://domoticz.local:8443/oauth2/v1/authorize\",\n    \"code_challenge_methods_supported\": [\n        \"S256\"\n    ],\n    \"grant_types_supported\": [\n        \"authorization_code\",\n        \"password\",\n        \"refresh_token\"\n    ],\n    \"issuer\": \"https://domoticz.local:8443/\",\n    \"response_types_supported\": [\n        \"code\"\n    ],\n    \"token_endpoint\": \"https://domoticz.local:8443/oauth2/v1/token\",\n    \"token_endpoint_auth_methods_supported\": [\n        \"client_secret_basic\"\n    ],\n    \"token_endpoint_auth_signing_alg_values_supported\": [\n        \"PS256\",\n        \"RS256\",\n        \"HS256\",\n        \"HS384\",\n        \"HS512\"\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n### Tokens\n\nThere are 3 types of _tokens_\n\n* _authorization code_\n* _access_token_\n* _refresh_token_\n\n### authorization_code flow (with PKCE)\n\nThis is the flow that should be used in almost all cases. Preferably using the PKCE extension as it is even more secure.\n\nThis flow returns an _access_token_ and an _refresh_token_ but only in the cases where the _authorization_code_ has been given to an registered _client_ application on behalf of an known users. If the _authorization_code_ has been created based on only a registered User, no _refresh_token_ is generated.\n\n### password flow\n\nUsing the password flow, one can get an _access_token_ without the need to first obtain an _authorization_code_ by just provider the username/password of a user.\n\nThe password flow does NOT return a _refresh_token_, only an _access_token_.\n\nAlthough this flow is not really regarded as __safe__, as in essense it is as simple as a normal login by providing a username/password, it is offered especially for local automation use-cases. For example for having scripts, etc. being able to communicate with the Domoticz server without the need to send the username/password of a user with each individual request.\n\nInstead it can provide a username/password once to obtain an _access_token_ and than use this _access_token_ till it expires. No need to provide the username/password in the meantime.\n\nProper scripts,etc. should behave like real _clients_ and use the _authorization_code_ flow instead.\n\n__TO-DO?__ Not implemented yet, but it probably better to limit the _password_ flow only to 'users' (scripts, etc.) that are within in _trusted network_. Otherwise the _password_ flow would also be available for use by 'users' that live outside _trusted networks_ like the Internet.\n\n### Using _refresh_tokens_\n\nThe goal of _refresh_tokens_ is to get a new _access_token_, for example when an _access_token_ has expired, without the need for the User to authenticate again to get a new _authorization_code_ to exchange for a new _access_token_.\n\nInstead by providing a (valid) _refresh_token_, a new _access_token_ and _refresh_token_ are handed out immediatly.\n\nA _refresh_token_ also has an expiration date/time (24 hours), but that is much longer than the life-time of an _access_token_ (which is 1 hour).\n\nThe use-case is for _clients_ that keep communicating with Domoticz for a longer period of time, for example a Dashboard like Dashticz. Without a _refresh_token_, the Dasboard would require the user the re-login every hour. (Or in a _bad_ implementation, store the users credentials and re-use them each time to re-login). \n\nNow only at start-up, the Dashboard has to ask for the users credentials and provide these to obtain an _authorization_code_. After that the user credentials are never needed again. Unless the Dashboard has stopped working and the latest _refresh_token_ has expired. Then the user has to re-login as a safety measure.\n\n## PKCE extension (RFC7636)\n\nProof Key Code Exchange (pronounced \"pixy\")\nMore secure auth_code flow for public clients (alternative to depricated implicit flow).\n\n## OpenID Connect (OIDC) support\n\nOpenID Connect adds additional best practices and standards on top of existing standards like OAuth2 and JWT.\n\nAt this moment, some OIDC parts are implementend, like support for\n\n* well-known end-point discovery\n\nBut other parts like _ID Tokens_ for example are not. Also not everything is fully compliant (yet) with OIDC, but some useful pieces are available and can be leveraged.\n\n## JWT support (RFC7519)\n\nThe __access_token__ returned is a so-called _JWT_ (Json Web Token) containing all kind of relevant information and is tamper-proof because it has been digitally signed.\n\n## More reading\n\nhttps://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/10/21/illustrated-guide-to-oauth-and-oidc\n\nhttps://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/05/01/is-the-oauth-implicit-flow-dead\n\nhttps://blog.postman.com/pkce-oauth-how-to/\n\n\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749\n\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636\n\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519\n\n---\n\n## Future developments and other options\n\nThanks to the support of open standards like OAuth, JWT, OIDC, etc. it becomes possible to use/integrate Domoticz into environments that use single-signon for example. Also it is possible to use external User Management for example by using an Azure AD, AWS Cognito, API Gateways or Microsoft Active Directy and Federation Services, Okta Identity or Red Hats KeyCloak (or FreeIPA), etc.\n\nScenario's where a central IAM system provides the User Management functionalities and hands-out the correct tokens, that than can be used by (local) Domoticz Servers. For example when managing multiple locations and installations of Domoticz.\n"
