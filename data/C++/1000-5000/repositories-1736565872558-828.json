More info at [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/topic/kb5020779-the-vulnerable-driver-blocklist-after-the-october-2022-preview-release-3fcbe13a-6013-4118-b584-fcfbc6a09936)\r\n\r\nIf you want to disable your vulnerable driver list you have to open regedit.exe, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\CI\\Config and set 'VulnerableDriverBlocklistEnable' as dword with value 0 and restart to apply the changes\r\n\r\nHave Fun!!\r\n\r\n#### TODO just maybe interesting ideas\r\n\r\nif anyone interested in create a pull request\r\n\r\nSelf cleaning of self execution ?\r\n\r\n* Registry User Assist\r\n* Prefetch (need to be deleted normally after it's update)\r\n* Recent files and AutomaticDestination\r\n* Registry RecentDocs\r\n* USN journal maybe?\r\n* Self deletion option?\r\n* Loaded driver deletion option?\r\n* SRUM may contain any information?\r\n* Shellbags in kdmapper named folders?\r\n\r\nMessages for common loading errors?\r\n"
