this mainly was a problem under macOS\n- added more translation (thank you mguerra, marcoxbresciani, amirkbrpr, marterra)\n\n## 21.10.14\n- more information about the different optional integrations and services in the\n  settings dialog were added to make it more clear what the user enables\n\n## 21.10.13\n- the text format items in the *Editor fonts & colors* settings now show their\n  assigned color again (for [#2275](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/2275))\n\n## 21.10.12\n- the text format item handling in the *Editor fonts & colors* settings was\n  improved (for [#2259](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/2259))\n- a problem with the text format item font selector under Windows was fixed\n  (for #[2259](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/2259))\n- the default for new note folders is `Don't allow file name to be different from headline`\n  again, because it makes more sense for the way QOwnNotes works (was changed in 21.8.12)\n    - existing note folders will not be modified automatically\n- the context menu of the spell checker is now better disabled in the *Log panel*\n- the note text of encrypted notes will now not be searched in the note search,\n  because the search results in the encoded text would be misleading\n  (for [#2254](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/2254))\n    - the file names of encrypted notes will still be searched\n- added repositories for **openSUSE Leap 15.4**\n  - please visit the [openSUSE installation page](https://www.qownnotes.org/installation/opensuse.html)\n    for instructions\n- added more translation (thank you marterra, rawfreeamy, mguerra, amirkbrpr)\n\n## 21.10.11\n- you can now set a different font for each text format in the *Editor fonts & colors*\n  settings (for [#2259](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/2259))\n- a PPA for Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) was added\n- added more Polish, Spanish translation (thank you rawfreeamy)\n\n## 21.10.10\n- no restart of the application is needed anymore when changing the default note file\n  extension (for [#2267](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/pull/2267), thank you @Waqar144)\n- a crash was fixed when the note headline was modified by a script in\n  `handleNewNoteHeadlineHook` (for [#2270](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/2270))\n    -

when a note is renamed or moved to another sub-folder note links with\n      heading fragments can now also be automatically renamed\n        - this also works with note links to the current note\n        - warning: this feature (especially the part with links to the current note)\n          was very complex and might introduce regressions\n- the build for very old Qt versions was (hopefully) fixed again\n- a possible crash was fixed when renaming a note directly in the note list when\n  <kbd>Enter</kbd> was pressed (for [#1837](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1837))\n- added more translation (thank you amirkbrpr, marterra, danilosf, evildeepblue,\n  marcoxbresciani, rawfreeamy)\n\n## 21.10.8\n- more features were added to the **linking of note heading** (for [#1977](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1977))\n    -

this works with opening links in the note text edit and the preview \n    - `[my note](my-note.md#First%20heading)` will attempt to jump to a heading\n      `First heading` in note `my-note.md` (note that `%20` is decoded as space)\n    -

(for [#1761](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1761))\n- the scripting command `startDetachedProcess` now has new parameters to define\n  a callback identifier that can later be implemented via the new scripting hook\n  `onDetachedProcessCallback` to be able to handle the output of a detached process\n  in a script (for [#1746](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1746), thank you @r00tr4v3n)\n    - please take a look at the documentation for\n      [startDetachedProcess](https://www.qownnotes.org/scripting/methods-and-objects.html#starting-an-external-program-in-the-background)\n      and

automatically\n  **remove trailing spaces** from the current note text when the note is stored\n  to disk (for [#1759](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1759))\n    - you will only see the changes once the note edit panel is refreshed to\n      prevent cursor jumping while you are editing the note\n- added more translation (thank you unchase, Gregory.K, Fabijenna, rakekniven, gbabin)\n\n## 20.5.10\n- fixed file links interpreted in code blocks (for [#1748](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1748), thank you @Waqar144)\n- migrated from `sub-folder` to `subfolder` in

more information please take a look at the\n      [Mainwindow scripting documentation](https://www.qownnotes.org/scripting/classes.html#mainwindow)\n- added a new scripting hook `websocketRawDataHook` that is called when data is\n  sent from the QOwnNotes Web Companion browser extension via the web browser's\n  context menu (for [#1740](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1740))\n    - you need the QOwnNotes Web Companion 20.5.0 or higher for this to work\n    - this works with either the `send page` and `send selection` feature of the\n      web companion\n    - if a hook implementation is found in a script no new note will be created\n    - take a look at the\n      [handleNoteNameHook documentation](https://www.qownnotes.org/scripting/hooks.html#websocketrawdatahook)\n      for more information\n- note tabs will now be reloaded correctly if the note-folder is reloaded\n  (for [#1720](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1720))\n    - all note assignments were previously lost because reloading the note-folder\n      causes all note ids to be different than before\n- fixed a possible crash when restoring note tabs (for [#1720](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1720))\n- added new scripting methods `fileExists` and `readFromFile` and a new parameter\n  `createParentDirs` for method `writeToFile` (for [#1736](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1736), thank you @r00tr4v3n)\n    - for more information please take a look at the\n      [scripting

menu items are shown on the first level\n  of the menu (for [#1737](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1737), thank you @r00tr4v3n)\n- added more Bengali, Brazilian Portuguese, French translation (thank you Oymate,\n  Fabijenna, gbabin, bepolymathe)\n\n## 20.5.6\n- leaving the distraction free mode with <kbd>Escape</kbd> now doesn't cause you\n  to enter the read-only mode automatically, you have to press <kbd>Escape</kbd>\n  a 2nd time to enter the read-only mode (for [#1733](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1733))\n- fixed a possible focus problem when entering the distraction free mode\n  (for [#1733](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1733))\n- fixed a possible crash in code block preview (for

[#1730](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1730))\n- added more translation (thank you rakekniven,\n  gbabin, unchase, mlocati, MGuerra, Oymate, Fabijenna, mlimacarlos)\n\n## 20.5.4\n- you can now stick a note to a tab with the new action `Toggle note stickiness of current tab`\n  in the *Note / Navigation* menu or by double-clicking on the tab\n  (for [#1730](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1730))\n    - this will cause a new tab being opened automatically if you click on\n      another note while in this tab\n    - the stickiness status will get also restored when the note folder is\n      switched or the application is started\n- if the note of the current tab is renamed now the tab also will be renamed\n  (for [#1720](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1720))\n\n## 20.5.3\n- fixed a problem with restoring note tabs of notes from sub-subfolders\n  (for [#1726](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1726))\n- fixed `Show note in file manager` for file manager Caja on Linux\n  (for [#1727](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1727), thank you @r00tr4v3n)\n- added more debug output in case note folder was not found on server\n  (for [#1725](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1725))\n- added more Spanish, Catalan, French, German, Italian, Russian translation\n  (thank you richarson, MGuerra, Fabijenna, gbabin, rakekniven, mlocati, unchase)\n\n## 20.5.2\n- **open note tabs are now restored** when the note folder is switched or the\n  application is started (for [#1726](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1726))\n    - restoring the last open note when switching note folders was also improved\n    - you can turn note tab restoring off in the *Panels settings*\n- added more Bengali translation (thank you Oymate)\n\n## 20.5.1\n- new tabbing shortcuts were added (for [#1720](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1720))\n    - you can now jump to the previous or next note tab with <kbd>Alt + PgUp</kbd>\n      and <kbd>Alt + PgDn</kbd>\n    - you can now close the current note tab with <kbd>Ctrl + W</kbd>\n    - you can now open a new note in a new tab with <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + N</kbd>\n    - do keep in mind that you can change or disable all shortcuts in the *Shortcuts settings*\n    - please visit [QOwnNotes shortcuts](https://www.qownnotes.org/getting-started/shortcuts.html)\n      for a list of all shortcuts\n- some glitches with duplicate tabs when the application was jumping to notes\n  while the note was already open as a tab were fixed (for [#1720](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1720))\n- tabs of removed notes are now also removed automatically (for [#1720](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1720))\n- there now is a software repository for **Fedora 32**\n    - please visit the [Fedora installation

right-click on a note in the note list and click `Open note in tab`\n  to **open the note in a tab** in the note edit panel (for [#1720](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1720))\n    - those tabs can be individually closed and moved\n    - opening notes without the new context menu action will open the note in\n      the current tab\n    - if only one tab is open the tabbed interface will be hidden\n    - since right-clicking a note in the note list also already opens the note\n      a click on the new context menu action will attempt to open the last note\n      to really open a new tab if only one tab was open\n    - double clicking a note in the note list will now cause the note to be\n      loaded in a tab if no `noteDoubleClickedHook` was registered in the\n      scripting engine\n- you will now get a warning dialog if you attempt to create a note subfolder\n  that will be ignored by the application, because the name is either used\n  internally or ignored in the *Panels settings* (for [#1718](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1718))\n- added more German, Spanish, Russian, Catalan, Bengali, Italian translation\n  (thank you rakekniven, richarson, unchase, MGuerra, 2fake1987, Oymate, tiwi90)\n\n## 20.4.18\n- the counts in the tag tree are now showing the amount of linked notes and not\n  the amount of note-links of a tag (for [#1709](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1709))\n- you now are able to show invisible subfolders (folders starting with `.`) in\n  the note subfolder panel if you clear the default `Ignored subfolders`\n  setting in the *Panels settings* (for [#1718](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1718))\n\n## 20.4.17\n- if you insert media files or attachments now a stripped-down version of the\n  file's original basename will be included into the filename of resulting file\n  in the `media` or `attachments` directory (for [#1716](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1716))\n\n## 20.4.16\n- there now are new scripting functions `note.renameNoteFile()` to rename a note\n  file and `note.allowDifferentFileName()` to check if it is allowed to have a\n  different note file name than the headline (for [#1704](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1704))\n    - the [meeting-note](https://github.com/qownnotes/scripts/tree/master/meeting-note)\n      script now makes use of these scripting functions\n    - for more information please take a look at the\n      [scripting documentation](https://www.qownnotes.org/scripting/classes.html#note)\n- fixed tag adding when moving tags to another parent in the tag panel when\n  handled by the scripting hook `noteTaggingByObjectHook` (for [#1705](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1705))\n\n## 20.4.15\n- when the setting to show all notes of a tag including the notes of their\n  children-tags is turned on now the note-count in the tag tree is adapted to\n  also count the notes of the children-tags (for [#1709](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1709))\n- some safety measures against note folder update race-conditions when renaming\n  tags while using the note-tagging scripting hooks `noteTaggingHook` or\n  `noteTaggingByObjectHook` were included (for [#1705](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1705))\n\n## 20.4.14\n- there now is a new scripting function `getTagByNameBreadcrumbList` to create\n  or fetch a tag by its name breadcrumb list (for [#1705](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1705))\n    - for more information please take a look at the\n      [scripting documentation](https://www.qownnotes.org/scripting/methods-and-objects.html#create-or-fetch-a-tag-by-its-name-breadcrumb-list)\n- moving of tags to another parent in the tag panel can now also be handled by\n  the scripting hook `noteTaggingByObjectHook` (for [#1705](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1705))\n    - the application will trigger a series of `add` and `remove` actions for\n      all selected tags and their children on all notes if tags are moved\n    - for more information please take a look at the\n      [scripting documentation](https://www.qownnotes.org/scripting/hooks.html#notetaggingbyobjecthook)\n- added more Albanian, Basque, Chinese Traditional, Hindi, French, Khmer,\n  Kurdish translation (thank you Fabijenna)\n\n## 20.4.13\n- there now is a new scripting hook `noteTaggingByObjectHook` to implement your\n  own note tagging mechanism in a script (for [#1703](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1703))\n    - similarly to `noteTaggingHook` you can implement your own note tagging\n      mechanism, but you are not bound to tag names in the tag tree root,\n      this way you can make use of the whole tag tree instead of only a tag list\n    - for more information please take a look at the\n      [scripting documentation](https://www.qownnotes.org/scripting/hooks.html#notetaggingbyobjecthook)\n- you can now fetch a tag by name (if there already exists a tag object) with\n  `tag.fetchByName()` via the scripting engine (for [#1703](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1703))\n    - for more information please take a look at the\n      [scripting documentation](https://www.qownnotes.org/scripting/classes.html#tag)\n- you can now fetch the parent tag names of a tag with `tag.getParentTagNames()`\n  via the scripting engine (for [#1703](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1703))\n    - for more information please take a look at the\n      [scripting

[#1697](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1697))\n    - this will help you in case when you accidentally clicked the checkbox and\n      then pressed `No`, for example with shortcut-triggered dialogs like\n      `Remove current note`\n    - for all dialogs where remembering your `No` makes sense all of your\n      decisions will be still remembered, for example with the dialog\n      `Note editing is currently disabled, do you want to allow it again?`\n      when you try to edit a note in read-only mode\n- added more Russian, German translation (thank you unchase, rakekniven)\n\n##

choose to **show your note folders** in your *Note folders panel*\n  **as buttons** in the *Panels settings* (for [#1676](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1676))\n    - you can use this button list vertically or horizontally, the buttons will\n      float to the next line if there is no space left\n- some title bar improvements were made (for [#1677](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1677))\n    - if more than one note folder exists then the name of the current note folder\n      will be shown in the title bar\n    - if a session

rakekniven, fitoschido, mlimacarlos, mlocati,\n  MGuerra, primokorn, unchase)\n\n## 20.3.0\n- there now is a new predefined layout **Preview only** to choose from at the\n  initial setup and in the *Layout settings* that shows no note edit panel, but\n  the preview panel instead\n    - you could use a workspace with this layout to switch between a workspace\n      with only the note edit and a workspace with only the preview with the\n      shortcut <kbd>Alt + Shift + P</kbd>\n        - please visit [QOwnNotes shortcuts](https://www.qownnotes.org/getting-started/shortcuts.html)\n          for a list of all shortcuts\n    - using a new layout in the *Layout settings* now creates a new workspace\n      instead of replacing the initial workspace, but keep in mind that workspaces\n      that demand that there is no central widget will not work properly if the\n      central widget is enabled\n- you can now also select text with they keyboard in the *Debug information* of\n  the *Debug settings*\n- fixed headings retaining old formatting when removing the heading marker\n  in the next line (for [#1641](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1641), thank you @Waqar144)\n-

thank you @Waqar144)\n- url-encoded links to notes will now also be correctly adapted if those notes\n  are renamed (for [#1546](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1546))\n\n## 20.2.9\n- note links generated from the *Link dialog* will now get url-encoded to be\n  better compatible with other tools that can link to files, like GitHub or\n  GitLab (for [#1546](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1546))\n    - for example `Note with one bracket].md` will now get `Note%20with%20one%20bracket%5D.md`\n    - links with just spaces still work in QOwnNotes, as well as `&#32;` as spaces\n    - the new note links are click-able in both the note edit and the preview\n      and the broken-note-link highlighter will also handle them correctly\n- the default shortcut for `Insert attachment` was changed to <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + X</kbd>\n  because of clashing with `Edit encrypted note` (for [#1637](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1637))\n    - please visit [QOwnNotes shortcuts](https://www.qownnotes.org/getting-started/shortcuts.html)\n      for a list of all shortcuts\n- added more Indonesian, Spanish, Danish, Vietnamese, Dutch, Estonian, Filipino,\n  Finnish, Greek, Hausa, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Urdu (Pakistan), Icelandic,\n  Turkish, Irish, Japanese, Korean, Kurdish, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian,\n  Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Serbian (Cyrillic),\n  Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Albanian, Arabic, Basque, Bengali,\n  Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Croatian, Czech,\n  German, Russian translation (thank you zmni, richarson, Fabijenna, rakekniven, unchase)\n\n## 20.2.8\n- conflicted copies of the note folder database `notes.sqlite` are now\n  immediately deleted if tags and tag assignments are not different to the ones\n  from the current `notes.sqlite` (for [#1625](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1625))\n    - all other table differences can be safely ignored\n\n## 20.2.7\n- some improvements to the todo list dialog were made\n    - if the todo items in a list will be reloaded from the server the current\n      text search will be applied again\n    - if the todo list is switched the current text search will be removed to\n      not confuse the user \n- fixed removing of the 3rd `\"` from `test \"test\"\"` with <kbd>Backspace</kbd>\n  (for [#1629](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1629), thank you @Waqar144)\n\n## 20.2.6\n- more improvements to the link dialog were made\n  (for [#1632](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1632))\n    - entering of `]` characters in link name line edit is now disabled since\n      they would break the markdown link\n        - they also will be removed from the link name automatically if they\n          were part of the note file name \n    - if one of the link characters `<>()` were found in the note url the legacy\n      way of linking will be used because otherwise the url would break the\n      markdown link\n- fixed fetching of todo calendar list in *Settings dialog* if cloud connection\n  was switched (for [#1631](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1631))\n\n## 20.2.5\n- fetching of remote note folders in the *Note folders settings* now should\n  work properly with Nextcloud (for [#1631](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1631))\n    - using different cloud connections now also works properly with the remote\n      note folder selector\n    - switching to another cloud connection in the *Note folders settings* now\n      also triggers a reload of the remote note folder selector if it is visible\n- attempted to fix random crashes while editing notes on macOS\n  (for [#1626](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1626), thank you @Waqar144)\n- attempted to fix rare QOwnNotes disk image mount problems under macOS\n  (for [#1630](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1630))\n- added repositories for **openSUSE Leap 15.2**\n    - please visit the [openSUSE installation page](https://www.qownnotes.org/installation#openSUSE)\n      for instructions\n- if you accept the *Link dialog* while on the *Note tab* now a possible URL in\n  the *URL tab* will be removed so that your selected note will be inserted\n  instead of the URL\n- automatic note file naming schema in case of duplicate note file names was\n  changed from appending a number like ` (1)` to just the number like ` 1`\n  because of problems with brackets in note links\n- added more Russian, Catalan, Brazilian Portuguese, Croatian, Czech, Danish,\n  Dutch, Estonian, Finnish, Greek, Hungarian, Irish, Japanese, Korean, Latvian,\n  Lithuanian, Macedonian, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi,\n  Romanian, Serbian (Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish, Uzbek,\n  Albanian, Basque, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional,\n  Indonesian, French, German, Italian translation (thank you unchase, MGuerra,\n  mlimacarlos, Fabijenna, zmni, primokorn, rakekniven, mlocati)\n\n## 20.2.4\n- conflicted copies of the note folder database `notes.sqlite` are now\n  immediately deleted if they are not different to the current `notes.sqlite`\n  (for [#1625](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1625))\n\n## 20.2.3\n- improved Setext-style headers highlighting with leading spaces\n  (for [#101](https://github.com/pbek/qmarkdowntextedit/issues/101), thank you @Waqar144)\n- allowed CMake and Make highlighting in the preview\n  (for [#1617](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/pull/1617),

20.2.2\n- automatic closing of brackets (and other characters) will now happen even if\n  you are in the middle of the line (for [#96](https://github.com/pbek/qmarkdowntextedit/pull/96), thank you

(for [#1052](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1052))\n- fixed highlighting of list items that start with tabulator characters and\n  checkboxes that don't have a space in the brackets (for [#1615](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1615), thank you @Waqar144)\n\n## 20.2.0\n- remote images and Nextcloud text images are now cached after being downloaded\n  for the preview until another note was be selected (for [#1244](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1244))\n    - this improves writing speed because the images now don't need to be\n      downloaded again every time the preview is refreshed\n- remote images and Nextcloud text images are now (like local images) resized in\n  the preview if the width of the preview panel is smaller than the image width\n  (for [#1597](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1597))\n\n## 20.1.19\n- fixed a possible crash in the broken-note-link highlighter\n  (for [#1611](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues/1611),

If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    {description}\n    Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  {signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n"

chat](https://badges.gitter.im/gitterHQ/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/qownnotes/qownnotes)\n\n\n[QOwnNotes](https://www.qownnotes.org) is the **open source notepad** with\n[**Markdown support**](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/blob/main/src/demonotes/Markdown%20Cheatsheet.md)\nand **todo list manager** for **GNU/Linux**, **macOS** and **Windows**,\nthat works together with [**Nextcloud Notes**](https://github.com/Nextcloud/notes)\nand [**ownCloud Notes**](https://github.com/owncloud/notes).\n\nYou are able to **write down** your **thoughts** with **QOwnNotes** and\n**edit or search** for them later from your **mobile device**, like with\n[Nextcloud Notes for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.niedermann.owncloud.notes)\nor the **Nextcloud / ownCloud web-service**.\n\nThe notes are stored as **plain text markdown files** and are\n**synced with Nextcloud's/ownCloud's file sync** functionality.\nOf course other software, like [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net) or\n[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) can be used too.\n\nIf you like the concept of having notes accessible in plain text files, like it\nis done in the Nextcloud / ownCloud notes apps to gain a maximum of **freedom**\nthen QOwnNotes is for you.\n\nVisit the project page here: [QOwnNotes project page](https://www.qownnotes.org)\n\nTo manage your **todo lists** in the web and on your mobile devices, you need to\ninstall the Tasks backend on [Nextcloud](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/tasks)\nor [ownCloud](https://marketplace.owncloud.com/apps/tasks).\n\nTo get more on-line features for your notes, like **versioning** and **trash** access,\nyou might also want to install the [QOwnNotesAPI](https://github.com/pbek/qownnotesapi)\napp on your server.\n\nTo access your ownCloud notes from your **mobile device** you may want to get one of these:\n\n- For Android and OwnCloud: [MyOwnNotes](https://f-droid.org/app/org.aykit.MyOwnNotes)\n- For Android and Nextcloud: [Notes](https://f-droid.org/packages/it.niedermann.owncloud.notes)\n- For iOS: [CloudNotes](https://itunes.apple.com/app/cloudnotes-owncloud-notes/id813973264)\n\nOn Android you could also

for all the ways to install QOwnNotes.\n\n## Building QOwnNotes\n\nTo get the most current features you can build the application from the source\ncode. Download the latest source here:\n[QOwnNotes Source on GitHub as ZIP](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/archive/main.zip)\n\nAlternatively you can also check out the code directly from the git repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes.git -b release --depth=1\ncd QOwnNotes\ngit submodule update --init\n```\n\nThen download [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source), you will also\nneed the packages `qtwebsockets` to build QOwnNotes with Qt6\n(only `qtwebsockets` for Qt5). If you build under Windows, you want to stick to\n*MinGw 64-bit*.\n\nAfterward open the project file `src/QOwnNotes.pro` and click on\n**Build** / **Build Project QOwnNotes**.\n\nOr you can build it directly in your terminal:\n\n```shell\ncd src\n\n# build binary translation files if you want another language than English\nlrelease QOwnNotes.pro\n\n# prepare build process and build the application\nqmake\nmake -j4\n```\n\n### Building QOwnNotes For Development\n\nIf you are going to work with the code, then you can do the following instead of the above:\n\n```shell\ncd src\nqmake CONFIG+=DEV_MODE CONFIG+=debug ..\nmake -j4\n```\n\nThe `DEV_MODE` variable enabled higher warning levels + precompiled headers.\n\nPlease feel free to contribute source code to this project, make suggestions or\nreport troubles on the [QOwnNotes issues page](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes/issues)!\n\nYou can also visit [QOwnNotes on GitHub](https://github.com/pbek/QOwnNotes).\n\n## Minimum software requirements\n\n- A desktop operating system, that supports [Qt](https://www.qt.io)\n- Qt 5.5+ / Qt 6.0+\n- gcc 4.8+\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis SOFTWARE PRODUCT is provided by THE PROVIDER \"as is\" and \"with all faults.\"\nTHE PROVIDER makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the\nsafety, suitability, lack of viruses, inaccuracies, typographical errors, or\nother harmful components of this SOFTWARE PRODUCT.\n\nThere are inherent dangers in the use of any software, and you are solely\nresponsible for determining whether this SOFTWARE PRODUCT is compatible with\nyour equipment and other software installed on your equipment.
