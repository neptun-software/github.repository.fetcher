It was created primarily to allow developers to target a simplified API that works across multiple API levels back to API level 16 (Jelly Bean).\n\n## Features\n- Compatible with API 16 onwards - runs on 99% of Android devices\n- Chooses the audio API (OpenSL ES on API 16+ or AAudio on API 27+) which will give the best audio performance on the target Android device\n- Automatic latency tuning\n- Modern C++ allowing you to write clean, elegant code\n- Workarounds for some known issues\n- [Used by popular apps and frameworks](https://github.com/google/oboe/wiki/AppsUsingOboe)\n\n## Documentation\n- [Getting Started Guide](docs/GettingStarted.md)\n- [Full Guide to Oboe](docs/FullGuide.md)\n- [API reference](https://google.github.io/oboe)\n- [History of Audio features/bugs by Android version](docs/AndroidAudioHistory.md)\n- [Migration guide for apps using OpenSL ES](docs/OpenSLESMigration.md)\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](docs/FAQ.md) (FAQ)\n- [Wiki](https://github.com/google/oboe/wiki)\n- [Our roadmap](https://github.com/google/oboe/milestones) - Vote on a feature/issue by adding a thumbs up to the first comment.\n\n### Community\n- Reddit: [r/androidaudiodev](https://www.reddit.com/r/androidaudiodev/)\n- StackOverflow: [#oboe](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/oboe)\n\n## Testing\n- [**OboeTester** app for measuring latency, glitches, etc.](apps/OboeTester/docs)\n- [Oboe unit tests](tests)\n\n## Videos\n- [Getting started with Oboe](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWz5rJ2EKKc_duWv9IPNvx9YBudNMmLSa)\n- [Low Latency Audio - Because Your Ears Are Worth It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vOf_fDtur4) (Android Dev Summit '18)\n- [Winning on Android](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWBojmBpS74) - How to optimize an Android audio app. (ADC '18)\n\n## Sample code and apps\n- Sample apps can be found in the [samples directory](samples). \n- A complete \"effects processor\" app called FXLab can  be found in the [apps/fxlab folder](apps/fxlab). \n- Also check out the [Rhythm Game codelab](https://developer.android.com/codelabs/musicalgame-using-oboe?hl=en#0).\n\n### Third party sample code\n- [Ableton Link integration demo](https://github.com/jbloit/AndroidLinkAudio) (author: jbloit)\n\n## Contributing\nWe would love to receive your pull requests.
