If you wish to \ncontinue to develop this code yourself, we recommend you fork it.\n\n-------------\n\nIntroduction\n============\n\nScribe is a server for aggregating log data that's streamed in real\ntime from clients. It is designed to be scalable and reliable.\n\nSee the Scribe Wiki for documentation:\nhttp://wiki.github.com/facebook/scribe\n\nKeep up to date on Scribe development by joining the Scribe Discussion Group:\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/scribe-server/\n\n\nLicense (See LICENSE file for full license)\n===========================================\nCopyright 2007-2008 Facebook\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\nHierarchy\n=========\n\nscribe/\n\n  aclocal/\n    Contains scripts for building/linking with Boost\n\n  examples/\n    Contains simple examples of using Scribe\n\n  if/\n    Contains Thrift interface for Scribe\n\n  lib/\n    Contains Python package for Scribe\n\n  src/\n    Contains Scribe source\n\n  test/\n    Contain php scripts for testing scribe\n\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n[libevent] Event Notification library\n[boost] Boost C++ library (version 1.36 or later)\n[thrift] Thrift framework (version 0.5.0 or later)\n[fb303] Facebook Bassline (included in thrift/contrib/fb303/)\n   fb303 r697294 or later is required.\n[hadoop] optional. version 0.19.1 or higher (http://hadoop.apache.org)\n\nThese libraries are open source and may be freely obtained, but they are not\nprovided as a part of this distribution.\n\n\nHelpful tips:\n-Thrift, fb303, and scribe installation expects python to be installed\n under /usr.  See PY_PREFIX option in 'configure --help' to change this path.\n-Some python installs do not include python site-packages in the default\n python include path.  If python cannot find the installed packages for\n scribe or fb303, try setting the environment variable PYTHONPATH to the\n location of the installed packages.  This path gets output during\n 'make install'. (Eg: PYTHONPATH='/usr/lib/python2.5/site-packages').\n\n\nTo build\n========\n\n./bootstrap.sh <configure options>\nmake\n\n(If you have multiple versions of Boost installed, see Boost configure options below.)\n\nSubsequent builds\n=================\n\n./bootstrap <configure options>\nmake\n\nOR\n\n./configure <configure options>\nmake\n\nNOTE: After the first run with bootstrap.sh you can use \"[ ./bootstrap | ./configure ] <options>\" followed by \"make\"\nto create builds with different configurations. \"bootstrap\" can be passed the same arguments as \"configure\".\n\nMake sure that if you change configure.ac and|or add macros run \"bootstrap.sh\".\nto regenerate configure. In short whenever in doubt run \"bootstrap.sh\".\n\n\nConfigure options\n=================\n\nTo find all available configure options run\n./configure --help\n\nUse *only* the listed options.\n\nExamples:\n# To disable optimized builds and turn on debug. [ default has been set to optimized]\n./configure --disable-opt\n\n# To disable static libraries and enable shared libraries. [ default has been set to static]\n./configure --disable-static\n\n# To build scribe with Hadoop support\n./configure --enable-hdfs\n\n# If the build process cannot find your Hadoop/Jvm installs, you may need to specify them manually:\n./configure --with-hadooppath=/usr/local/hadoop --enable-hdfs CPPFLAGS=\"-I/usr/local/java/include -I/usr/local/java/include/linux\" LDFLAGS=\"-ljvm -lhdfs\"\n\n# To set thrift home to a non-default location\n./configure --with-thriftpath=/myhome/local/thrift\n\n# If Boost is installed in a non-default location or there are multiple Boost versions\n# installed, you will need to specify the Boost path and library names\n./configure --with-boost=/usr/local --with-boost-system=boost_system-gcc40-mt-1_36 --with-boost-filesystem=boost_filesystem-gcc40-mt-1_36\n\n\nInstall\n=======\n\nas root:\nmake install\n\n\nRun\n===\n\nSee the examples directory to learn how to use Scribe.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\nThe build process for Scribe uses autoconf macros to compile/link with Boost.\nThese macros were written by Thomas Porschberg, Michael Tindal, and\nDaniel Casimiro.  See the m4 files in the aclocal subdirectory for more\ninformation.\n"
