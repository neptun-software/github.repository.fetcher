Include closed issues in your search.\n\nIf it has not been reported, create a new issue with at least the following information:\n\n- a short, descriptive title;\n- a detailed description of the issue, including any output from the command line;\n- steps for reproducing the issue;\n- your system information.\\*; and\n- the `version` output from the in-game console.\n\nPlease place logs either in a code block (press `M` in your browser for a GFM cheat sheet) or a [gist](https://gist.github.com).\n\n\\* The preferred and easiest way to get this information is from Steam's Hardware Information viewer from the menu (`Help -> System Information`). Once your information appears: right-click within the dialog, choose `Select All`, right-click again, and then choose `Copy`. Paste this information into your report, preferably in a code block.\n\nConduct\n-------\n\n\nThere are basic rules of conduct that should be followed at all times by everyone participating in the discussions.  While this is generally a relaxed environment, please remember the following:\n\n- Do not insult, harass, or demean anyone.\n- Do not intentionally multi-post an issue.\n- Do not use ALL CAPS when creating an issue report.\n- Do not repeatedly update an open issue remarking that the issue persists.\n\nRemember: Just because the issue you reported was reported here does not mean that it is an issue with Half-Life.  As well, should your issue not be resolved immediately, it does not mean that a resolution is not being researched or tested.  Patience is always appreciated.\n\n\nBuilding the SDK code\n-------\n\n[Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) 2019 is required to build mod DLLs on Windows. In the Visual Studio installer, install \"**Desktop development with C++**\" under \"**Workloads**\" and \"**C++ MFC for latest v142 build tools (x86 & x64)**\" under \"**Individual components**\". VS2019 projects can be found in the `projects\\vs2019` folder.\n\nTools have not yet been updated for VS2019, but can be built using the VS2010 projects in the `projects\\vs2010` folder. See the `readme.txt` file there.\n\nLinux binaries can be built using Makefiles found in the `linux` folder. They expect to be built / run in the [Steam Runtime \"scout\" environment](https://gitlab.steamos.cloud/steamrt/scout/sdk). The built binaries are copied to a directory called `game` at the same level as the root directory for the git repository. You can set `CREATE_OUTPUT_DIRS=1` while building to create the output directory structure automatically.\n"
