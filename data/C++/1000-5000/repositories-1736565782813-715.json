Navigate to the folder containing the presentation.\n2. Click on the presentation's filename.\n3. Click the \"View Raw\" link near the bottom of the page.\n\n## For Speakers - Submitting Materials\n\nTo submit your materials, email [speaker-files@cppcon.org](mailto:speaker-files@cppcon.org) with a link or attachment (if they are small).\n\nIf possible, please submit your slides in PDF format. This will allow the widest group of people to read them easily. If that’s not possible, you may also submit PowerPoint (`.ppt`/`.pptx`) files and zipped folders containing Keynote or HTML. If you have any questions, just email [speaker-files@cppcon.org](mailto:speaker-files@cppcon.org) and ask.\n\nFor source code, a `zip` or `tar.gz` is fine. Please do not include large files, and please ensure that all files can be distributed by CppCon to the public. You may mark your code as being placed in the public domain, or include a suitable license (e.g. BSD, MIT, Apache, LGPL, or GPL). We are relying on you to ensure the code is licensed appropriately.\n\nTo help make our job easier, please name your slide files as follows:\n\n> Presentation Title - Speaker Name - CppCon 2014\n\nFor example, Bjarne Stroustrup's keynote slides would be named \"Make Simple Tasks Simple - Bjarne Stroustrup - CppCon 2014\".\n\nDon’t worry about the name for code archives as we will be unzipping them.\n"
