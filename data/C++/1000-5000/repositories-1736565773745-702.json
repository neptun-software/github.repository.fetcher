Thanks to everyone who provided samples, videos, and system configurations to help identify the specific conditions necessary to trigger this bug!)\r\n- Fixed: Regression introduced in 1.1.44 which caused \"Fit Image to Screen\" to create a tiny window\r\n  instead of a window which filled the screen.\r\n- Fixed: In certain cases with certain image, after zooming out to 0% (as far as allowed), zooming in did not work and got stuck at 0%\r\n- Fixed: \"FileNameFormat\" INI option \"%filesize%\" substitution now shows MB when exceeding 1 MB, not 100 MB\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Updated French translation, thanks LaurentGrenet (GH https://github.com/LaurentGrenet)\r\n\r\n[1.1.44] 2023-02-27\r\nNew features:\r\n- Add support for Animated AVIF (AVIF Sequence)\r\n  PR #143, thanks qbnu (GH https://github.com/qbnu)\r\n- QOI (Quite OK Image) Read/Write support, (also supported on XP)\r\n  PR #150, thanks qbnu (GH https://github.com/qbnu)\r\n- New Mouse Gesture: CTRL + SHIFT + LMouse Drag => Instantly zoom into selected area\r\n  Modified backport feature from fork by David Neon (GH https://github.com/sdneon)\r\n- New Crop options: Fixed to image aspect ratio (actual ratio displays in menu), 7:5 (common print ratio), 1:1 (common web size)\r\n- New INI file setting: \"FlashWindowAlert\"\r\n  When WrapAroundFolder=false, briefly flash window when attempting to navigate beyond the beginning or end of the file list.\r\n  (Default to enabled, since it's visual UI feedback)\r\n- New INI file setting: \"BeepSoundAlert\"\r\n  When WrapAroundFolder=false, play the system beep sound when attempting to navigate beyond the beginning or end of the file list.\r\n  (Default to disabled, since audio feedback can be an annoyance)\r\n- When using a fixed crop mode, and resizing of crop/selection box:\r\n  Dragging the handles in Top-Left and Bottom-Right will change to portrait or landscape orientation if dragging in the direction to \"pull\" the crop into the other orientation.

Previously allowed: 10% - 1600%\r\n  Zoom out: Unlimited to as small as possible\r\n  Zoom in: Unlimited as long as the image \"rescaled\" by zoom factor is < 65535 in any dimension (internal limitation)\r\n- Crop ratios submenu is now sorted by increasing ratios, from square (1:1) to increasingly oblong\r\nOther changes:\r\n- New INI file setting: \"ZoomPausePercent\"\r\n  The default behavior of JPEGview is to briefly pause at 100% when continuously zooming in or out. (This ensures you can always get to perfectly 100%)\r\n  This new setting allows the user to configure to a different percentage, or disable to zoom continuously with no interruption\r\n- Reorder JPEGView.ini options grouping similar options and adding comment headers\r\n  Options should be easier to find and logically grouped. Previously, options were haphazardly added and weren't sorted in any particular order\r\n  (It might be a little painful to move your existing options over to the new INI format, but future options will be much easier to find!)\r\n  (Your existing INI will continue to work, if you choose to continue to use it, but you'll have to add in new options manually)\r\n- Updated Russian translation, thanks Dmitry Yerokhin\r\n- Updated Japanese translation, thanks maboroshin (GH https://github.com/maboroshin)\r\n- Updated Chinese Simplified translation, thanks dukeng (GH https://github.com/dunkeng)\r\n- New strings.txt English reference for translators, it will always be current to the code\r\n- Second part of movie/slideshow menus now translatable\r\n- Updated to Turbo JPEG library version 2.1.91 (2023-02-08)\r\n- Updated to JPEG XL library version 0.8.1 (2023-02-03)\r\n- Devs: Translation scripts to sync with code, regenerate at any time, and added some features to make translating easier, like missing and unused text\r\nInstaller Changes:\r\n- Add all built-in supported file extensions to Window's \"Open With >\" submenu\r\n- Add \"Edit with JPEGView\" option to Windows Explorer for all extensions JPEGView can save to\r\n- 64-bit installs into \"C:\\Program Files\" on new installs (existing installs will use previous install location)\r\n\r\n[1.1.43] 2023-02-06\r\nNew features:\r\n- HEIF/AVIF support\r\n  Supports AV1/HEVC encoded still images and image collections\r\n  (Not yet supported: thumbnails, animations, or AVC encoded images)\r\n  (NOTE: Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime vcruntime140.dll required)\r\n  PR #109, thanks qbnu (GH https://github.com/qbnu)\r\nChanged behavior:\r\n- KeyMap.txt is now optional, the defaults from KeyMap.txt.default will be loaded if a user-customized version does not exist\r\n  KeyMap.txt search paths: %AppData%\\JPEGView\\KeyMap.txt -> (JPEGView.exe dir)\\KeyMap.txt -> (JPEGView.exe dir)\\KeyMap.txt.default\r\n  (This means, extracting new releases will not overwrite your customized KeyMap.txt)\r\n- KeyMap.txt is now simplified to only the include key mappings.  The list of commands and help can be found in the KeyMap-README.html\r\n  (KeyMap.txt from older versions will continue to work if you have customized one)\r\n- Help Display now properly shows the on/off status of \"hide window title bar\" and \"always on top\" modes\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Updated French translation, thanks LaurentGrenet (GH https://github.com/LaurentGrenet)\r\n- Updated Japanese translation, thanks maboroshin (GH https://github.com/maboroshin)\r\n- Updated Russian translation, thanks Dmitry Yerokhin\r\n- Windows XP is still supported and special WinXP-compatible builds will be released (WinXP builds do not support new formats added after v1.0.37.1)\r\n- WebP is now integrated into JPEGView without needing webp.dll\r\n  PR #128, thanks qbnu (GH https://github.com/qbnu)\r\n\r\n[1.1.42] 2023-01-26\r\nNew features:\r\n- JPEG XL support, with animation\r\n  (NOTE: Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime vcruntime140.dll required when opening\r\n  JPEG XL files.

rotation is now stored in the parameter DB if no destructive processing (e.g. crop) has been applied before\r\n- Free rotation can be chained without error propagation because image is reloaded before rotation is applied.\r\n  This only applies if no destructive processing (e.g. crop) has been applied in the processing chain.\r\n- New INI file settings:\r\n  - MinimalWindowSize=width height\r\n    Allows setting the minimal window size in pixels\r\n  - MinimalDisplayTime = value\r\n    Minimal display time of an image when using the PgDn/PgUp keys (in milliseconds [0..1000 ms])\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Hiding parameter DB buttons when image is processed destructively as these operations cannot be stored in the\r\n  parameter DB.\r\n\r\n[1.0.32.2] 2014-12-04\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- More tolerance on corrupt EXIF data offsets - image is now displayed in this case (without EXIF of course)\r\n- Showing mouse cursor before asking for confirmations if mouse cursor was off before\r\n- ESC works again when no image is loaded into JPEGView (e.g. because the last image in a folder was deleted)\r\n- Taking DisplayMonitor into account also in windowed mode, not only fullscreen mode\r\n- Using forced sort order on command line (e.g. /order Z) also for slideshow lists\r\nNew features:\r\n- Set current image as desktop wallpaper\r\n  You can either set the original image (in Windows XP only BMP is supported) or the processed image as displayed.\r\n  The later is using also the size as displayed.\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Removed 'Edit global settings' menu entry. This has led to confusion as users unintentionally edit the global\r\n  INI file instead of the user INI file and wonder why the settings are not working.\r\n  If you need this menu item, set AllowEditGlobalSettings=true in the INI file to force showing it.\r\n- Batch rename dialog: Supporting %h and %min placeholders for hour and minute of modification date\r\n\r\n[1.0.32.1] 2014-03-28\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Prefetching image of correct size in windowed mode - prefetching was actually not working in this situation\r\n  and thus performance was poor in 1.0.32 in windowed mode.\r\n- Auto-zoom-mode 'Fill with crop': Handling portrait orientation images correctly in all cases\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Expanding environment variables in user commands and open with commands\r\n- New command available for mapping to a key: IDM_RENAME to rename current file.\r\n  By default this command is not mapped to a key and only available by clicking on the file name on the bottom panel.\r\n- Finer granularity control over deleting files (confirmations, availability)\r\n  AllowFileDeletion=false : Allows disabling file deleting in JPEGView\r\n  DeleteConfirmation=Always/OnlyWhenNoRecycleBin/Never : Controls confirmation when deleting with navigation panel button\r\n- When deleting files with the navigation panel button (x), a confirmation is required for files that are deleted permanently.\r\n  This is the case for drives that have no recycle bin, like memory sticks or network drives.\r\n- Updated Portuguese translation\r\n\r\n[1.0.32.0] 2014-03-21\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Window size in windowed mode was some pixels too small due to invalid reporting of window border size by OS\r\n- Fixed wrong line break in file titles in info panel for long file names\r\n- SingleInstance=true, fixed error on loading image in case window was minimized\r\n- Lossless JPEG-transformations cannot be applied anymore after the original pixels have been modified, e.g. by a crop.\r\n  Applying the transformations in this case would lead to unexpected results.\r\nNew features:\r\n- 64 bit version (in addition to existing 32 bit version)\r\n- New image processing: Change size (in menu Transform image > Change size)\r\n- Improvements in image file deletion:\r\n  - Button on navigation panel and 'Del' key deletes the current image file in the same same way Explorer does (by moving to recycle bin)\r\n  - 'Shift+Del' deletes the current image file permanently\r\n- Showing keyboard shortcuts in tooltips of the toolbox buttons\r\n- Traditional Chinese (Taiwan) translation and updated Chinese translation\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Settings/Admin > Set as default viewer: Calls the file association dialog from control panel to perform\r\n  the associations in Windows 8, because this is the only way under Windows 8 to properly change file associations.\r\n- Ctrl-X also copies the file name to the clipboard (as Ctrl-C)\r\n- Using Visual Studio 2013 to compile the 64 bit version\r\n\r\n[1.0.31.1] 2014-02-26\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Fixed crash when deleting files in 'Show folders and subfolders' navigation mode\r\n- Filenames with \\t in path are now displayed correctly when using customized file name display format\r\nNew features:\r\n- JPEGView is now fully high DPI capable (e.g. 200 % -> 192 dpi) and scales all GUI elements properly to high DPI settings.\r\n  This fixes problems on high DPI screens.\r\n- Ctrl-C also copies the file name to the clipboard so that Windows Explorer is able to paste the original file with Ctrl-V\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Moved menu item to store current parameters as default in INI file to 'Setting/Configuration' submenu\r\n\r\n[1.0.31] 2013-12-13\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Read ahead no longer turned off when failed to read one image\r\n- Fixed loading error of JPEGs with EXIF data and IDF1 section missing\r\n- Blending issues with nVidia cards fixed (hopefully now works correctly in all situations)\r\n- Fixed (sporadic) crash when deleting images permanently with the 'Del' key or when executing other user commands\r\n- Registration of file extensions in Windows 8 improved. Consider however that Windows 8 protects the standard\r\n  file associations. For changing these associations the 'Default programs' dialog of Windows 8 must be used.\r\n- Showing system menu and icon in Windows7/8 when switching from full screen to windowed mode\r\nNew features:\r\n- New supported file format: TGA (8, 15, 16, 24, 32 bits) - only for reading\r\n- User commands extensions\r\n  - Shortcuts with modifier keys can now be assigned to user commands. Shortcut format is as in the keymap, e.g. 'Ctrl+P'\r\n  - User commands can optionally be bound to a menu item in the submenu 'User commands' in the JPEGView context menu\r\n- 'Open with' menu\r\n  - In Settings/Admin it is possible to define applications to be started in the 'Open with' submenu of the JPEGView context menu.\r\n    The applications get passed the current image file name as argument on process startup.\r\n    It is also possible to assign a shortcut key for such an application.\r\n- Files can be sorted upcounting (default) or downcounting in all display order modes (by date, name, etc)\r\n  - Can be set in the context menu of JPEGView\r\n  - Stored to INI file\r\n- New display order mode: Sort by file size\r\n- New INI file setting:\r\n  UseEmbeddedColorProfiles=[true/false]\r\n  Setting this to true will enable color management for JPEG images and TIFF images (to the extend GDI+ supports it).\r\n  Default is 'false' because enabling this setting has some disadvantages:\r\n  - Turbo JPEG does not support embedded profiles, so GDI+ needs to be used what is much slower\r\n  - GDI+ cannot read some valid JPEG files (e.g. some grayscale JPEGs, observed with Windows XP)\r\n  Notice that GDI+ does not support V4 ICC color profiles in Windows XP. It does support these in Windows 7/8.\r\n- New INI file settings:\r\n  DefaultGUIFont=fontName fontSize [bold]\r\n  FileNameFont=fontName fontSize [bold]\r\n  Enables to change the GUI font, its size in points and its weight\r\n- Esc key can now be re-defined in keymap (e.g. to display to 'Open file' dialog)\r\n  Default remains to exit JPEGView\r\n- Some minor changes in navigation panel appearance\r\n\r\n[1.0.30] 2013-11-02\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Fixed crash (leading to potential exploit) when image width or height is larger than 32767\r\n- Improved zoom behavior for zoom < 10 %\r\n- Slide shows with alpha blending: maybe now also works correctly if graphics driver implements alpha blending somewhat inexactly\r\n- NoStrCmpLogical registry setting also checked in \"LOCAL MACHINE\" registry hive\r\n- Fixed size cropping bug fixed\r\n- Always registering JPEGView in registry when changing file assignments, thus fixing any invalid path, e.g. resulting from move\r\n  of the EXE to another directory\r\n- Animated GIFs and multiframe TIFFs can now be moved or deleted while displayed\r\nNew features:\r\n- New command line parameter '/autoexit'. If passed, ESC key will terminate JPEGView also if a slideshow is running or an animated GIF is playing.\r\n  Additionally it will auto-terminate JPEGView after the slideshow has finished when combined with the '/slideshow' command line parameter.\r\n  Thanks to SourceForge user manuthie for implementing this.\r\n- New command line parameter '/monitor [index]'. Shows JPEGView on the given monitor, overriding the INI file setting.\r\n- New placeholders that can be used in user commands:\r\n  %exepath% : Path to EXE folder where JPEGView is running\r\n  %exedrive% : Drive letter of the EXE path, e.g. \"c:\"\r\n- Displayed image is reloaded automatically when it changes on disk, using a file system change notifier.\r\n  The image list of the current directory is also reloaded when images are added or deleted in this directory.\r\n  To disable the file system notifier, set ReloadWhenDisplayedImageChanged=false in the INI file\r\n- When canceling the 'Open file' dialog after startup, JPEGView is not terminated but an empty window is shown with some hints what to do.\r\n  Can be used e.g. to paste images from clipboard.\r\n\r\n[1.0.29] 2013-04-21\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- EXIF (F2) and file name info (Ctrl+F2) no longer flicker when active during slide show with transition effect\r\n- No logical sorting of file names is done if HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\NoStrCmpLogical\r\n  registry value is set to 1. This matches the behavior of the Windows explorer.\r\n  Note that the default registry value for this is 0, therefore almost all users will notice no change.\r\nNew features:\r\n- Support for animated GIFs.\r\n  Limitations:\r\n  - Saving GIFs will only save the currently displayed frame.\r\n  - Some image processings (e.g. free rotation, perspective correction) will stop the animation and work on a single frame only\r\n  - No caching of the decoded frames. This has pros and cons. Pro is that memory consumption is limited. Con is that the CPU\r\n    load while playing can be rather high. However on a dual core CPU it's not a problem.\r\n- Support for multi-page TIFF. Note that (singlepage or multipage) TIFFs compressed with JPEG compression are not supported by GDI+.\r\n  This is a known issue of GDI+ that cannot be fixed in JPEGView (except if another TIFF library would be used)\r\n- New INI file setting: FileNameFormat allowing to display configurable information with Ctrl-F2. See INI file for information.\r\nOther changes:\r\n- WebP library 0.3.0 from Google is now used. This version supports lossy and lossless compression.\r\n  To use lossless compression with the WEBP format, select the \"WEBP lossless\" file format in the \"File Save\" dialog.\r\n  Be warned that lossless WEBP compression is very, very slow (decompression is fast however).\r\n\r\n[1.0.28] 2013-03-15\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Fixed bug in the window resizing code when 'DefaultWindowRect=max' and toggling between 100 % zoom and fit to window (space key)\r\n- Fixed bug causing that zoom was not saved to parameter DB when auto fitting window to image was on\r\n- Fixed bug that file pointer was invalid when deleting last file in folder and WrapAroundFolder=false in INI file\r\n- New algorithm to guess encoding (UTF-8, ANSI) of JPEG comments when no encoding is explicitly specified\r\nNew features:\r\n- Support for slide show transition effects (only in full screen mode)\r\n  This can also be set in the INI file and on the command line, see readme.html for more info about command line parameters.\r\n- File extensions can be registered to be opened by JPEGView over the 'Administration-Set as default viewer...' menu item\r\n- New info button in top, left corner of screen in fullscreen mode to show EXIF info. EXIF into closable on the EXIF panel itself.\r\n- When a supported camera RAW file was excluded in INI file but opened nevertheless in JPEGView (e.g. from explorer), the camera\r\n  raw file type is added temporarily until program termination\r\n- Russian translation of readme.html\r\n- Improved Chinese translation\r\n\r\n[1.0.27] 2013-01-20\r\nReplaced Intel JPEG library by Turbo JPEG (tjpeg, http://sourceforge.net/projects/libjpeg-turbo/)\r\nThis replacement has many reasons:\r\n- The Intel library license was not an open source type license\r\n- Newer versions of the Intel library are not free of charge. The old versions are not supported by Intel anymore.\r\n- Some JPEG files could not be read by the Intel library. tjpeg can read these files.\r\n- There is no free 64 bit version of the Intel library.\r\n  (This is important for the future when there may be a 64 bit version of JPEGView)\r\nThe tjpeg library is open source and (at least on modern CPUs) performs comparable to the Intel library. It is used by many other\r\nviewers and several Linux distributions.\r\nNote that tjpeg including lossless JPEG transformations has been statically linked to JPEGView. Therefore the application has grown\r\nby 300 KB. However the total size of the package is lower than before because IJL15.dll and jpegtran.exe are no longer needed.\r\n\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- When a folder is called 'pictures.jpg' for example, JPEGView no longer tries to process this folder as image\r\n- Exposure time display: When nominator and denominator are both big numbers, a fractional value is shown instead of bigNum/bigDenum\r\n- Reading slideshow list files (txt) encoded with UTF-8 and UTF-16 (little endian only) correctly\r\n- Reading slideshow list files (txt) using uppercase file endings for image files correctly\r\nNew features:\r\n- Lossless JPEG transformations integrated into JPEGView. The jpegtran.exe application is no longer part of the distribution of JPEGView.\r\n- Basque translation, thanks to Xabier Aramendi\r\n- Chinese translation, thanks to Yia Guo\r\n- Keymap.txt now also supports to remap mouse buttons to commands.\r\n- New INI file setting: 'TrimWithoutPromptLosslessJPEG'. Set to true to trim image before lossless JPEG transformations if needed without\r\n                        prompting the user for each image.\r\n- New INI file setting: DefaultWindowRect=sticky to save and restore the window size and position in window mode\r\n- New INI file setting: 'SingleInstance'. Set to true to open all images in one single instance (window) of JPEGView.\r\n- New INI file setting: 'ShowBottomPanel'. Set to false to disable showing the bottom panel when hovering with the mouse on bottom part\r\n  of window/screen.\r\n  Default is true (as before, was not configurable).\r\n- New INI file setting: 'MaxSlideShowFileListSizeKB'. Sets maximum size of slide show text files in KB.\r\n- New INI file setting: 'ForceGDIPlus'. If true, use GDI+ for reading JPEGS. Note that using GDI+ is much slower than the tjpeg library!\r\n- New command line parameters:\r\n  /slideshow xx    Starts JPEGView in slideshow mode, xx denotes the switching time in seconds. Only use when providing a file name,\r\n                   folder name or file list on the command line as first parameter.\r\n                   Example: jpegview.exe \"filelist.txt\" /slideshow 2\r\n  /fullscreen      Starts JPEGView in full screen mode, ignoring the INI file setting that is currently active\r\n  /order x         Forces file ordering mode 'x', ignoring the INI file setting that is currently active\r\n                   'x' can be M, C, N or Z, for the file ordering modes 'M:modification date', 'C:creation date', 'N:file name', 'Z:random'\r\n                   Example: jpegview.exe c:\\pictures /slideshow 2 /order z\r\n                   Shows a slideshow of the files in the folder \"c:\\pictures\" using random ordering and an interval of 2 seconds.\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Because the tjpeg static library cannot be linked with VS2005, JPEGView is now compiled with VS2010. If you are using Windows XP\r\n  before SP2, install SP2 or keep using version 1.0.26.\r\n\r\n[1.0.26] 2012-01-23\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Lossless rotate and crop now works in folders containing Unicode characters in the path.\r\n  Note that the file title must not contain Unicode characters due to the fact that jpegtrans.exe does not support this.\r\nNew features:\r\n- Portuguese (Portugal) translation, thanks to Sérgio Marques\r\n- Support for viewing embedded JPEG images in camera RAW files using code from the dcraw project (v8.86).\r\n- Support for loading images using Windows Image Codecs (WIC). By default WIC is used to load JPEG XR files (also called\r\n  High definition photo). When using Windows Vista or Windows 7, the Windows Camera Codec pack can be installed to get\r\n  support for full size camera RAW images in JPEGView. Refer to the readme.html for instructions.\r\n- New image processing: Perspective correction, use button on navigation panel to activate\r\n- Rotation and perspective correction: Option to keep aspect ratio when auto cropping\r\n- New INI file setting: 'AutoRotateEXIF' to disable auto rotation of images based on EXIF image orientation tag.\r\n  Default is true (the EXIF auto rotation is supported since many versions, this setting is introduced to turn this off).\r\n- New INI file setting: 'ScaleFactorNavPanel' to scale the navigation panel buttons, e.g. to make them larger on touch screens\r\n- Clicking into the image (without dragging) toggles visibility of navigation panel\r\n- Zoom by dragging mouse, activate with 'Shift-left mouse click' or with button on navigation panel\r\n- Random sorting order for images within folder, can be used e.g. for random slideshow mode (activate with 'z' key)\r\n- Improved crop handling: Crop rectangle can be resized using handles\r\n- When in 'Adjust window to image' zoom mode and in window mode, the window adjusts automatically to zoomed image size while zooming\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Russian version of keymap and INI file (KeyMap_ru.txt, JPEGView_ru.ini) containing explanations in Russian. Be aware that\r\n  these files must be renamed to KeyMap.txt and JPEGView.ini and copied over the original (English) versions when JPEGView shall use them.\r\n\r\n[1.0.25.1] 2011-11-13\r\n- Rollback to VS2005 to compile the project because of problems with Windows 7 and Windows XP before SP2.\r\n  The Windows 7 issues can be solved by using the latest versions of Windows SDK, WTL and ATL but the XP issue can't.\r\n  JPEGView will remain on VS2005 at least for some versions.\r\n  For VS2010 users, a solution and project file for VS2010 is included in the source code distribution.\r\n  WebP library needs to be compiled with VS2010 as the VS2005 compiler produces crashing code from the Google source -\r\n  so WebP will not work in XP SP1 or earlier.\r\n- libwebp_a.dll made delay loaded - therefore JPEGView runs without this DLL when you do not need webp.\r\n\r\n[1.0.25] 2011-11-13\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Previous image now works correctly when WrapAroundFolder is set to false\r\nNew features:\r\n- Czech translation, thanks to Milos Koutny\r\n- Greek translation, thanks to Paris Setos\r\n- WEBP image format supported (load and save), using the source code provided by Google\r\n- Keyboard shortcuts are now defined in the file KeyMap.txt, located in the EXE folder. Users can edit the key map if desired.\r\n- New INI file setting: ExchangeXButtons to exchange the forward and backward mouse buttons (default is true, now can be switched to false)\r\n- Putting file name first in window title (as it is convention in Windows)\r\n- Double-click to fit image to screen (according auto zoom mode currently set), respectively 100 % when already fit\r\n- New transformations: Mirror horizontally and vertically (and put the rotation commands also under the new transformations submenu)\r\nOther changes:\r\n- After having had massive problems with a compiler bug when compiling the WEBP source code, I decided to switch to Visual Studio 2010.\r\n  Install VS 2010 to compile JPEGView - Express Edition (free) is sufficient.\r\n\r\n[1.0.24.1]\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Crash fixed when zooming down images of some sizes to 10 %\r\n\r\n[1.0.24] 2011-10-11\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Navigation panel not truncated when window is small, instead the buttons are smaller.\r\n  Tooltip texts are also no longer truncated in small windows.\r\n- Modification date displayed with correct time zone adjustment\r\nNew features:\r\n- Portuguese translation, thanks to Carpegieri Torezan\r\n- New windowed mode that fits window size to image size, avoiding black borders.\r\n  Enable in INI file using:\r\n  DefaultWindowRect=image\r\n- New auto full screen mode that starts JPEGView in fullscreen mode when the image is larger than the screen\r\n  or in windowed mode (window fit to image) when the image is small enough to fit to the screen.\r\n  Enable in INI file using:\r\n  ShowFullScreen=auto\r\n  Note: This is the new default value in the INI file.\r\nChanged behaviour:\r\n- In the EXIF display (F2), the file name is broken into multiple lines when it is very long\r\n- F11 key is now used for toggling full screen (used to be Ctrl-W). Navigation panel visibility now uses Ctrl-N (instead of F11)\r\n- If the first image shown is smaller than the screen, JPEGView now starts in 'window fit to image' mode.\r\n  To restore the old behavior (always use fullscreen), set ShowFullScreen=true in INI file\r\n\r\n[1.0.23] 2011-03-07\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Improved memory handling for very large images. Read ahead turned off for very large images.\r\n  Also improved memory footprint for processing large images by stripwise processing.\r\n  Note that images > 100 MPixel still fail loading in most cases (tested with XP and 2GB memory)\r\n- When out of memory, image loading fails with error message instead of crashing\r\n- Set file modification time to EXIF time now correctly considers time zone\r\nNew features:\r\n- New image processing: Rotation by arbitrary angle\r\n  Using a button on the navigation panel, the image can be rotated with the mouse by a user-defined angle.\r\n  The preview of rotation is real-time and uses simple point-sampling. When the rotation is applied to the\r\n  image, bicubic interpolation is done, providing a good quality rotated image.\r\n  Note that this processing cannot be stored in the parameter DB.\r\n- Lossless crop\r\n- Display of JPEG comments (EXIF user comment, EXIF image description, JPEG COM marker, in this order)\r\n  Use INI file setting ShowJPEGComments to disable display of comments\r\n- Set modification time to EXIF time for all files in folder\r\n- New INI file setting: WrapAroundFolder.  Can be set to false to disable cyclic navigation\r\n  within a folder (going from last to first image)\r\n\r\n[1.0.22.1] 2011-02-16\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Fixed crash on startup when ShowFullScreen=true in INI file\r\nNew features:\r\n- Swedish translation (thanks to Åke)\r\n\r\n[1.0.22] 2011-01-14\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- Copying EXIF data when saving image in screen size (Ctrl-Shift-S)\r\n- Fixed crash when window is minimized while slideshow is playing\r\n- Close button is active when moving mouse to top, right corner of screen\r\nNew features:\r\n- Histogram can be displayed on the information panel (below EXIF information). Use ShowHistogram INI file entry\r\n  to set if the histogram shall be shown on the panel or not. If not shown by default it can be blended in with\r\n  a small button on the information panel.\r\n- Updating EXIF thumbnail image when saving processed image\r\n- New button on navigation panel: Keep processing parameters between images\r\n- Changed behavior of fit to screen/actual size button, fit to screen is now default when not yet fit to screen\r\n- Keeping fit to screen when resizing JPEGView window\r\n- Image processing panel: Temporarily reset slider by clicking with the mouse on slider number\r\n- Image processing panel: Reset slider to default value by double-clicking above slider\r\n- Romanian translation (thanks to Silviu)\r\n- Russian translation (thanks to Dmitry)\r\n- Updated Spanish translation (thanks to Daniel)\r\n\r\n[1.0.21] 2010-07-16\r\nBugs fixed:\r\n- After saving, navigation panel was not painted correctly sometimes\r\nNew features:\r\n- New image processing: Unsharp mask\r\n  Using a button on the image processing panel, an unsharp mask can be applied to the original pixels.\r\n  Note that preview is always in 100 % zoom. Unsharp masking cannot be stored in the parameter DB and it is not possible to\r\n  apply unsharp masking automatically after loading each image (unlike other processings)\r\n- New image processing: Color saturation\r\n  Support includes: Saturation on image processing panel, default saturation in INI file, parameter DB and landscape picture mode\r\n- UI colors can be set in INI file.

To set the number of cores to use to a specific value, set the CPUCoresUsed key\r\n  to a specific value in the INI file. Default is to use all cores (max 4) of the CPU.\r\n- Small thumbnail displayed when zooming, showing the visible section of the image. The section can be moved with\r\n  the mouse in the thumbnail image. To disable this feature set ShowZoomNavigator=false in INI file.\r\n- Spanish translation (thanks to Franco Bianconi)\r\n- About dialog\r\n- Tooltips for navigation panel buttons\r\n- New button on navigation panel to switch to actual image size / fit to screen\r\n- New INI file setting (Language=xx) to force user interface language (default is to use operating system language if supported by JPEGView)\r\n- New INI file setting (StoreToEXEPath=true/false) forcing to write to config data and parameter DB to EXE path (used when installed on USB stick)\r\n\r\n[1.0.15] 2007-12-27\r\nBugs removed:\r\n- If using ClearType fonts, the button text on the image processing area is now rendered correctly\r\n- EXIF information is now also found if not placed directly after SOI in JPEG image (e.g. after an APP0 block)\r\n- File name flickering fixed in image processing area (was happening when file name was long)\r\n- Zoom to 100% now always correctly zooms mouse cursor centered when the cursor is visible\r\nNew features:\r\n- Display of EXIF information from digicam JPEG files (F2) - can be made permanently using the INI file\r\n- Smoother screen update with less flickering by using back buffering of transparent areas\r\n- Navigation panel blended into image. The navigation panel is turned on by default but can be disabled with the F11 key.\r\n  To disable it permanently, press F11 then save the settings to the INI file with the context menu.\r\n  The blending factor of the panel can be configured also in the INI file.\r\n- New mode for optimal display of landscape pictures - lightens shadows and darkens highlights very progressively\r\n  Use Ctrl-L to enable or the button on the navigation panel\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Using smaller font for help display (F1)\r\n- Exclusion/inclusion folders for LDC and color correction: More specific folder overrides less specific when matching for inclusion\r\n  and exclusion\r\n- Using Crop without Ctrl pressed when image cannot be dragged\r\n- New INI file entry: CreateParamDBEntryOnSave to disable/enable creation of a parameter DB entry for images saved in JPEGView\r\n\r\n[1.0.14] 2007-11-09\r\nBugs removed:\r\n- If a JPEG cannot be read with the IJL library, GDI+ is tried as a second chance\r\n- Copy/rename dialog: Replacement text can now be longer than text input field (auto scroll enabled)\r\n- Reader no longer crashes when stripe is negative for images read with GDI+\r\n- Images with ending TIFF are no longer duplicated in file list\r\nNew features:\r\n- File open... always uses thumbnail view (not only in 'my picture' directory)\r\n- Saving files is now possible in the following formats: JPG, BMP, TIFF, PNG\r\n- Copy/rename dialog: New placeholder %n for number from original file name\r\n- Panning is faster and uses high quality resampling mode during pan\r\n- New command to reload current image (Ctrl-R)\r\n- Crop image section or zoom to image section with CTRL-Left mouse and dragging the mouse\r\n- Paste image from clipboard (Ctrl-V)\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Color and contrast correction switched off in default INI file.\r\n  It is recommended to switch it on for dedicated folders only, e.g. folders with digicam photos.\r\n  Of course any user INI file remains untouched by this change.\r\n- Due to an internal code simplification, all parameter DB entries for BMP images created with older versions\r\n  are lost with 1.0.14. Note that other formats (e.g. JPG) are not affected.\r\n\r\n[1.0.13] 2007-06-04\r\nBugs removed:\r\n- Sorting by name now works correctly for names of the form X1 X1_y X2 X3\r\n- When saving default values to INI file using the context menu, these default values are now immediately in effect for the next images\r\nNew features:\r\n- File lists (text files) now support relative paths (relative to file list location)\r\n- Movie mode enhanced and improved, now accessible using the context menu and automatically using fastest processing modes\r\n- Batch rename/copy, allowing to copy and rename a series of files, e.g. from the digicam to the harddisk. Several placeholders are\r\n  supported, e.g. file dates and consecutive numbers.\r\n- Possibility to set the auto zoom mode, enabling to zoom images to fit the screen with or without border\r\nOther changes:\r\n- Keeping parameters between images (F4) will now override any values from the parameter DB while active.\r\n  Note that while keeping parameters is on, storing to parameter DB is disabled.\r\n- ICO removed from supported format list - GDI+ claims to be able to read it but can't\r\n\r\n[1.0.12] 2007-05-08\r\nFirst release to public\r\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

Check operation system requirements\r\nJPEGView32:\r\n Windows XP SP2 or SP3 (it does NOT work with SP1 only)\r\n Windows XP 64 bit SP2\r\n Windows Vista SP2\r\n Windows 7\r\n Windows 8/8.1\r\n Windows 10\r\nJPEGView64:\r\n Windows 7 64 bit edition\r\n Windows 8/8.1 64 bit edition\r\n Windows 10 64 bit edition\r\n (not supported: Windows XP 64 bit)\r\n\r\n3. Extract directory\r\nJPEGView can be installed by simply extracting the directory with the chosen version to an arbitrary location on your hard disk, e.g.:\r\nFor the 32 bit version: JPEGView_X.Y.Z.zip\\JPEGView32\\  --> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\JPEGView32\\\r\nFor the 64 bit version: JPEGView_X.Y.Z.zip\\JPEGView64\\  --> C:\\Program Files\\JPEGView64\\\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n*****************************   Uninstallation   *****************************\r\n******************************************************************************\r\nTo remove JPEGView, just delete the folder JPEGView32 respectively JPEGView64 from your hard disk.\r\n\r\nIn case you have set JPEGView as default viewer for some file types, you should restore the old default viewer:\r\nJPEGView context menu > Settings/Admin > Set as default viewer...\r\nUncheck all file types and press 'OK'.\r\nWindows 8 and later: You need to choose another default program for the associated file types: Go to the control panel, choose Programs > Default Programs > Set Default Programs, select another viewer (e.g. the built in Photo Viewer) in the list on the left and finally click 'Set this program as default' on the right.\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n******************************   Why JPEGView ? ******************************\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n1. Yet another image viewer...\r\nCompared to many other image viewers, JPEGView has a rather different philosophy: Minimal GUI - maximal image.\r\nTherefore your first impression after having started JPEGView is probably disappointing - a 'file open' dialog allows choosing an image that is then shown - nothing else seems to be there. If you have been searching for an image viewer with classic menu, tool bar, side bar, status bar and browsing panel you should probably continue with the section 'Uninstallation' and use IrfanView or XnView instead.\r\n\r\n2. Still here?\r\nIf you want to try out a different approach with minimal GUI but nevertheless lots of functionality behind that minimal GUI, you may give a try to JPEGView. Be assured that there is more to discover!\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n******************************   First steps   *******************************\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n1. Start JPEGView and choose an image that is larger than your primary screen\r\nThis makes JPEGView displaying the image in full screen mode what is better suited for this tutorial. You can toggle between full screen mode and window mode with the F11 key at any time.\r\n\r\n2. Move your mouse - a semi-transparent panel with icons appears on the lower part of the screen\r\nThis is the navigation panel providing some basic navigation and other commands.\r\nMove the mouse pointer over the icons and a tooltip explains the functionality.\r\n\r\n3. Move your mouse to the bottom of the screen - the image processing panel appears\r\nThis panel provides some basic image processing that can be applied to the image.\r\n\r\n4. Move the mouse back to the center of the screen - the image processing panel disappears again.\r\n   Use the mouse wheel (or the + and - keys) to zoom in and out.\r\nWhen zoomed in, on the right side of the screen a thumbnail view appears, showing the zoomed section.\r\n\r\n5. While having zoomed in, press the left mouse button and drag the mouse\r\nThe image is panned.\r\n\r\n6. Move the mouse to the thumbnail view area. If the thumbnail is not shown currently, it will show up when the mouse is near. In the thumbnail image, press the left mouse button and drag the mouse.\r\nThe image is panned. JPEGView has no scrollbars and this is the way to scroll a zoomed image very quickly.\r\n\r\n7. Move the mouse to the top of the screen - some standard windows buttons appear.\r\nThe functionality of these buttons is obvious. But don't close, minimize or restore the window now.\r\n\r\n8. Move the mouse to the center of the screen and press the right mouse button.\r\nThe context menu of JPEGView appears, providing access to most functionality of JPEGView.\r\n\r\n9. That's it for the first steps. Terminate JPEGView with the 'Esc' key.\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n*************************   Set as default viewer   **************************\r\n******************************************************************************\r\nBecause JPEGView has no built in image browser, it's optimal usage scenario is to browse images with the Windows Explorer and start JPEGView by double clicking an image in the Explorer. You can then go through the images in the folder in JPEGView using the arrow keys or the navigation panel buttons. To enable this use case, JPEGView needs to be registered as default program for the image types it supports (i.e. jpg, gif, tif, bmp, etc).\r\n\r\n1. Start JPEGView, load an image and open the context menu (right mouse click).\r\nChoose: Settings/Admin > Set as default viewer...\r\nSelect the file types to be opened by JPEGView and press 'OK'.\r\n\r\n2. Starting with Windows 8, Microsoft made it harder and harder to change the default application for the standard image types.\r\nTherefore, the steps described above are not sufficient and some addional manual work is required.\r\nWindows 8 and 8.1: The 'default programs' dialog from the Control Panel is shown automatically to confirm the associations.\r\nWindows 10: Windows 10 only shows a message box where to set the 'standard apps'. To actually do so:\r\n - Open the Windows 10 start menu and type 'standard apps'. Click the found settings page.\r\n - On the right panel, scroll to the end and select 'Set defaults by app'\r\n - In the dialog that is appearing, choose 'JPEGView' in the list on the left panel\r\n - Now you can assign all (or a subset) of the image file types to JPEGView\r\n\r\n"

Выберите версию программы – 32- или 64-разрядную.\r\nJPEGView поставляется в двух версиях – 32- и 64-разрядной. Если вы пользуетесь 64-разрядной версией Windows 7, 8 или 10, рекомендуем выбирать 64-разрядную версию программы, во всех остальных случаях, либо если вы сомневаетесь, используйте 32-разрядный вариант. С помощью 64-разрядной версии можно загружать изображения размером более 100 мегапикселов.\r\n\r\n2. Извлеките файлы в папку.\r\nЧтобы установить программу JPEGView, просто распакуйте файлы нужной версии в какую-либо папку на диске, например:\r\nдля 32-разрядной версии: JPEGView_X.Y.Z.zip\\JPEGView32\\  --> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\JPEGView32\\\r\nдля 64-разрядной версии: JPEGView_X.Y.Z.zip\\JPEGView64\\  --> C:\\Program Files\\JPEGView64\\\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n********************************   Удаление   ********************************\r\n******************************************************************************\r\nЧтобы удалить JPEGView, просто удалите папку JPEGView32 или JPEGView64 с жёсткого диска.\r\nЕсли вы назначили JPEGView стандартным средством просмотра для каких-то типов файлов, то следует восстановить прежнюю стандартную программу просмотра.\r\nДля этого в контекстном меню JPEGView выберите команду \"Настройки > Назначить программой просмотра по умолчанию...\",\r\nпосле чего снимите отметки со всех типов файлов и нажмите OK.\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n*****************************   Почему JPEGView?  ****************************\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n1. Ещё одна программа просмотра изображений...\r\nВ сравнении со многими другими программами просмотра графики, у JPEGView другая философия: минимум – интерфейсу, максимум – изображению.\r\nПоэтому если вы только начали пользоваться JPEGView, то можете быть разочарованы - в окне выбора файла доступен лишь выбор файла для показа и ничего более. Если вам требуется программа просмотра графики с классическими меню, панелью инструментов, боковой панелью, строкой состояния и окном обзора, то, вероятно, самое время перейти к разделу 'Удаление' и остановить свой выбор на таких утилитах, как IrfanView или XnView.\r\n\r\n2. Вы всё ещё тут?\r\nЕсли вы хотите попробовать другой подход – с минимальным графическим интерфейсом, но, тем не менее, с большими функциональными возможностями, то JPEGView вам в помощь. Гарантируем, что вы обнаружите для себя много полезного!\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n******************************   Первые шаги   *******************************\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n1. Запустите JPEGView и выберите какое-нибудь изображение, имеющее больший размер, чем разрешение у основного монитора.\r\nВ этом случае JPEGView покажет изображение в полноэкранном режиме, который лучше подходит для данного руководства. Переключение между полноэкранным и оконным режимами - клавиша F11.\r\n\r\n2. Переместите мышь – в нижней части экрана появится полупрозрачная панель со значками.\r\nЭто навигационная панель, предоставляющая основные средства навигации и другие команды.\r\nНаводите указатель мыши на значки – появятся подсказки об их назначении.\r\n\r\n3. Переместите мышь в нижнюю часть экрана – появится панель обработки изображения.\r\nОна содержит основные средства для корректировки изображений.\r\n\r\n4. Переместите мышь в центр экрана – панель обработки изображения снова исчезнет.\r\nУвеличьте/уменьшите картинку роликом мыши или клавишами +/-.\r\nПри увеличении справа появится миниатюра, показывающая область картинки, которая сейчас выводится на экран.\r\n\r\n5. При увеличенном масштабе вывода изображения нажмите левую кнопку мыши и переместите мышь.\r\nИзображение также переместится.\r\n\r\n6. Переместите мышь на миниатюру. Если в данный момент миниатюра не отображается, она появится, когда указатель мыши будет рядом с этой областью экрана. Нажмите левую кнопку мыши на миниатюре и переместите мышь.\r\nИзображение также переместится. У JPEGView нет полос прокрутки, а такой способ позволяет прокручивать картинку очень быстро.\r\n\r\n7. Переместите мышь к верхней границе экрана – появятся стандартные кнопки Windows.\r\nИх назначение очевидно. Но сейчас не закрывайте, не свёртывайте и не восстанавливайте окно.\r\n\r\n8. Переместите мышь в центр экрана и нажмите правую кнопку мыши.\r\nПоявится контекстное меню JPEGView, дающее доступ к большинству функций JPEGView.\r\n\r\n9. Ну, вот и всё – для начала достаточно. Завершите работу JPEGView, нажав Esc.\r\n\r\n******************************************************************************\r\n**************   Назначение стандартным средством просмотра   ****************\r\n******************************************************************************\r\nПоскольку у JPEGView нет встроенного средства обзора изображений, оптимальным сценарием использования будет выбор изображения в Проводнике Windows и запуск JPEGView двойным щелчком по этому изображению. Затем можно будет просматривать с помощью JPEGView и другие изображения в данной папке, нажимая клавиши со стрелками или соответствующие кнопки на панели навигации. Чтобы реализовать такой сценарий, нужно назначить JPEGView стандартной программой просмотра файлов поддерживаемых типов (например, jpg, gif, tif, bmp и т.д.).\r\n\r\n1. Запустите JPEGView, загрузите какое-нибудь изображение и откройте контекстное меню (нажав правую кнопку мыши).\r\n   Выберите команду 'Настройки > Назначить программой просмотра по умолчанию...'.\r\n   Отметьте те типы файлов, которые вы хотите открывать с помощью JPEGView, и нажмите 'OK'.\r\n\r\n2. Начиная с Windows 8 компания Microsoft всё больше затрудняет изменение приложения по умолчанию для открытия изображений стандартных типов.\r\nПоэтому указанных выше действий недостаточно, требуется дополнительное ручное вмешательство.\r\nВ Windows 8 и 8.1 диалоговое окно стандартных программ из Панели управления открывается автоматически для подтверждения ассоциаций.\r\nВ Windows 10 отображается только окно сообщения для задания 'стандартных приложений'. Чтобы на самом деле изменить ассоциацию, сделайте следующее:\r\n - В Windows 10 откройте главное меню и введите \"Приложения по умолчанию\" ('standard apps'). Нажмите на найденной странице настроек.\r\n - В правой панели прокрутите вниз до конца и выберите \"Задать значения по умолчанию по приложению\" ('Set defaults by app').\r\n - В появившемся окне выберите в левой панели в списке 'JPEGView'.\r\n - Теперь вы можете ассоциировать все (или некоторые) типы графических файлов с JPEGView.\r\n\r\n"

Each release includes:\n\n* **Archive Zip/7z** - Portable\n* **Windows Installer MSI** - For Installs\n* **Source code** - Build it yourself\n\n## Portable\n\nJPEGView _does not require installation_ to run.  Just **unzip, and run** either the 64-bit version, or the 32-bit version depending on which platform you're on.  It can save the settings to the extracted folder and run entirely portable.\n\n## MSI Installer\n\nFor those who prefer to have JPEGView installed for All Users, a 32-bit/64-bit installer is available to download starting with v1.0.40.\n\n(Unfortunately, I don't own a code signing certificate yet, so the MSI release is not signed.  Please verify checksums!)\n\n### WinGet\n\nIf you're on Windows 11, or Windows 10 (build 1709 or later), you can also download it directly from the official [Microsoft WinGet tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) repository.  This downloads the latest MSI installer directly from GitHub for installation.\n\nExample Usage:\n\nC:\\> `winget search jpegview`\n```\nName     Id              Version  Source\n-----------------------------------------\nJPEGView sylikc.JPEGView 1.1.43  winget\n```\n\nC:\\> `winget install jpegview`\n```\nFound JPEGView [sylikc.JPEGView] Version 1.1.43\nThis application is licensed to you by its owner.\nMicrosoft is not responsible for, nor does it grant any licenses to, third-party packages.\nDownloading https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/releases/download/v1.1.43/JPEGView64_en-us_1.1.43.msi\n  ██████████████████████████████  4.23 MB / 4.23 MB\nSuccessfully verified installer hash\nStarting package install...\nSuccessfully installed\n```\n\n## PortableApps\n\nAnother option is to use the official [JPEGView on PortableApps](https://portableapps.com/apps/graphics_pictures/jpegview_portable) package.  The PortableApps launcher preserves user settings in a separate directory from the extracted application directory.  This release is signed.\n\n## Scoop\n\n[Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) is a Windows command-line installer and manager for portable applications.\n\nTo install with Scoop, run the following commands:\n\n```shell\nscoop bucket add extras\nscoop install extras/jpegview-fork\n```\n\nAfter installation, the configuration file is located at `%UserProfile%\\scoop\\persist\\JPEGView-fork\\JPEGView.ini`.\n\n## System Requirements\n\n* 64-bit version: Windows 7/8/10/11 64-bit or later\n* 32-bit version: Windows 7 or later\n  * A special _32-bit Windows XP SP2_ build is available, which supports most formats (except for formats added after v1.0.37.1, ex. Animated PNG, JXL, HEIC).  Other features and options are the same as the normal builds.\n\n## What's New\n\n* See what has changed in the [latest releases](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/releases)\n* Or Check the [CHANGELOG.txt](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt) to review new features in detail.\n\n# Localization\n\nBy default, the language is auto-detected to match your Windows Locale.  All the text in the menus and user interface should show in your language.  To override the auto-detection, manually set `Language` option in `JPEGView.ini`\n\nJPEGView is currently translated/localized to 28 languages:\n\n| INI Option | Language |\n| ---------- | -------- |\n| be | Belarusian |\n| bg | Bulgarian |\n| cs | Czech |\n| de | German |\n| el | Greek, Modern |\n| es-ar | Spanish (Argentina) |\n| es | Spanish |\n| eu | Basque |\n| fi | Finnish |\n| fr | French (Français) |\n| hu | Hungarian |\n| it | Italian |\n| ja | Japanese (日本語) |\n| ko | Korean (한국어) |\n| pl | Polish |\n| pt-br | Portuguese (Brazilian) |\n| pt | Portuguese |\n| ro | Romanian |\n| ru | Russian (Русский) |\n| sk | Slovak |\n| sl | Slovenian (Slovenščina) |\n| sr | Serbian (српски) |\n| sv | Swedish |\n| ta | Tamil |\n| tr | Turkish (Türkçe) |\n| uk | Ukrainian (Українська) |\n| zh-tw | Chinese, Traditional (繁體中文) |\n| zh | Chinese, Simplified (简体中文) |\n\nSee the [Localization wiki page](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/wiki/Localization#localization-status) for translation status for each language.\n\n# Help / Documentation\n\nThe JPEGView documentation is a little out of the date at the moment, but should still give a good summary of the features.\n\nThis [readme.html](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/blob/master/src/JPEGView/Config/readme.html) is part of the JPEGView package.\n\n# Brief History\n\nThis GitHub repo continues the legacy (is a \"fork\") of the excellent project [JPEGView by David Kleiner](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/).  Unfortunately, starting in 2020, the SourceForge project has essentially been abandoned, with the last update being [2018-02-24 (1.0.37)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jpegview/files/jpegview/).  It's an excellent lightweight image viewer that I use almost daily!\n\nThe starting point for this repo was a direct clone from SourceForge SVN to GitHub Git.  By continuing this way, it retains all previous commits and all original author comments.\n\nI'm hoping with this project, some devs might help me keep the project alive!  It's been awhile, and could use some new features or updates.  Looking forward to the community making suggestions, and devs will help with some do pull requests as some of the image code is quite a learning curve for me to pick it up. -sylikc\n\n## Special Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to [qbnu](https://github.com/qbnu) for adding additional codec support!\n* Animated WebP\n* Animated PNG\n* JPEG XL with animation support\n* HEIF/HEIC/AVIF support\n* QOI support\n* ICC Profile support for WebP, JPEG XL, HEIF/HEIC, AVIF\n* LibRaw support (all updated RAW formats, such as CR3)\n* Photoshop PSD support\n\nThanks to all the _translators_ which keep JPEGView strings up-to-date in different languages!  See [CHANGELOG.txt](https://github.com/sylikc/jpegview/blob/master/CHANGELOG.txt) to find credits for translators at each release!\n"
