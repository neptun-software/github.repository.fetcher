Many properties use this data type although they\n  should contain single line values only. If such properties do contain multiline values, silent data loss will happen when these\n  values are modified.\n- Some properties now use a numeric data type instead of a text data type. These properties must only contain numeric values,\n  this change should not lead to silent data loss because text values would have generated broken code.\n- Reorder project properties for clarity\n- Move some project C++ properties into global scope because they are in fact used by all languages\n- Use a common prefix for language specific project properties to prevent name clashes\n- Use more sensible default values for project properties\n- Update project file version to 1.18\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fix wxMediaControl Player Controls generated Python code ([#809](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder/issues/809))\n- Fix PHP code generation for objects with base classes\n- Fix name clash of project property `disconnect_mode` between Python and PHP\n- Prevent possible crash when loading a project file\n- Code for property grid manager code generated with an error ([#805](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder/issues/805))\n\n## [4.1.0] - 2024-02-26\n\n### Changed\n\n- Update required wxWidgets version to 3.2\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Prevent installation of TinyXML2 development files\n- Code generation for wxDataViewTreeCtrl sets an invalid style by default ([#799](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder/issues/799))\n- Error creating code in python. Create \"true\" Instead of \"True\" ([#803](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder/issues/803))\n- Generated C++ code cannot be built if wxNO_IMPLICIT_WXSTRING_ENCODING is defined ([#801](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder/issues/801))\n- Fix wxFlexGridSizer XRC output of growablerows and growablecols ([#806](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder/pull/806))\n- Lua: fixed missing parent name for top level box sizer ([#808](https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder/pull/808))\n\n## [4.0.0] -

Note that this feature is supported\n  in C++ and Python code generation only.\n- Menubar and toolbar can be inserted into project as top-level objects (they will\n  be generated as stand-alone classes which can be instantiated later or directly into XRC).\n  See 'Forms' palette.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Significantly improved speed of adding/removing of project items on large projects\n- Significantly improved speed of undo/redo/paste operations on large projects (note for existing projects:\n  the patch will have an effect after manual expansion and collapsing of all form-based items in the object tree)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed menu items' shortcuts in XRC\n- FS#280 - wxMenu not part of a wxMenuBar\n- Fixed startup crash on MacOS X 10.5.7 (for wxWidgets 2.8.10)\n- Fixed loading of wxTreeListCtrl events that were inherited from wxTreeCtrl in\n  wxAdditions\n- FS#444 - python code generation error\n- FS#428 - extra import(s) in wxpython code generation\n- FS#446 - Can't add Submenu to a Menu\n\n## 3.1.64 (Beta) - 2009-08-27\n\n### Fixed\n\n- FS#389 - Center option for dialogs should be set to wxBOTH by default\n- FS#391 - Change (some) user notifications from status bar to message box\n\n## 3.1.63 (Beta) - 2009-08-26\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed code generation of wxGrid events in Python\n\n## 3.1.62 (Beta) - 2009-08-19\n\n### Added\n\n- Added support for wxSearchCtrl widget\n- Added support for wxAnimationCtrl widget\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed code generation of system colors in Python\n- FS#430 - Spacer code generation in Python is incomplete (no proportion param)\n- FS#432 - Fatal error when resizing Object Properties\n- Fixed tooltips' code generation in Python\n- Sash position of wxSplitterWindow is set only if differs from -1\n\n## 3.1.61 (Beta) - 2009-06-11\n\n### Added\n\n- Added support for Python (wxPython) code generation\n\n### Fixed\n\n- FS#424 - No encoding declared\n- FS#425 - ListBook: C++ code instead of Python code\n\n## 3.1.60 (Beta) - 2009-03-06\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Moved the 'event_handler' type to the Forms plug-in. This allows different\n  event handling methods to be used per Frame/Dialog/Panel. This makes it even\n  easier to create Dialogs that don't need any inherited class to work.\n- Removed the 'virtual_decl' 'event_handler' method because it seemed like hassle\n  to get a linker error instead of a compiler error. It also cleans up the options\n  a bit.\n\n## 3.1.59 (Beta) - 2009-02-06\n\n### Fixed\n\n- FS#367 - Project-Properties: encoding is ignored. Fixed ANSII file generation - Loaden\n- FS#357 - wxFB overrides file without confirmation from user. - hykwok\n- FS#215 - Abstract or normal class generation. - c16\n- FS#394 - Separator reference not accessible through generated C++ code -

\"Can't edit choices if the '\\' is used\"\n\n## 3.0.56 (RC8) - 2008-03-18\n\n### Changed\n\n- Removed the two project-level XRC properties, \"bitmaps\" and \"icons\".\n  These never worked properly, and wxFB is not the right place to enter that information,\n  a standalone XRC file written with any text-editor would be much better.\n  This was prompted by, and caused the closure of, these issues:\n  FS#340 - \"bitmap resources are unnamed, preventing use of wxXmlResource::Get()->LoadBitmap()\"\n  FS#329 - \"XRC Properties - Follow on\"\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Added #include \\<wx/intl.h\\> to header file when using internationalization\n- Custom control now inherits from wxWindow, to provide common properties\n- FS#336 - \"Incorrect ScrollBar Disconnection\"\n- FS#310 - \"FB should not try to disconnect event handlers in dialog/frame's destructor.\"\n  This is now optional, see the \"disconnect_events\" property of the Project object.\n- FS#337 - \"Incorrect Vertical Toolbar Rendering\"\n- FS#328 - \"Unknown style flag wxTE_BESTWRAP for wxTextCtrl\"\n  Removed the flag, it is the default, and #define'd to 0x0000, so it was pointless anyway.\n- FS#339 - \"wx/icon.h not included when using resource icons in wxToolBar\"\n- FS#324 - \"\\[wxMac\\] Buttons on the component palette have a black background\"\n\n## 3.0.55 (RC7) - 2008-02-18\n\n### Fixed\n\n- FS#319 -

2008-02-01\n\n### Fixed\n\n- FS#308 - Bugs in non-interactive (-g) mode\n  Note: stderr is not normally available on Windows for GUI apps.\n        If -g is used, all logging goes to stderr and debug output.\n        Either start the process with a pipe for stderr (most IDEs will do this\n        for you), or use a Debug Viewer to watch the output.\n- FS#311 - wxFB 3.0 RC5 still generating incorrect wxMenu(item) code\n\n## 3.0.53 (RC5) - 2008-01-15\n\n### Changed\n\n- Improved refresh of selection inside a scrolled window\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed missing C++ code generation for menu separators and menu item bitmaps.\n- FS#290 -

\"wxSpinCtrl initial property not updating\"\n- FS#294 - \"wxRadioBox not selectable on form\"\n\n## 3.0.52 (RC4-1) - 2007-12-17\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed application closing when double clicking on an .fpb file in Windows\n- FS#288 - \\[OS X\\] Splash screen is truncated\n- FS#287 - Made wxFormBuilder compile on systems where wxStackWalker is not present\n- FS#289 - \\[OS X\\] Perform file associations on mac\n\n## 3.0.51 (RC4) -

This closes FS#58.\n  Cannot use wxGBS as the first sizer in a form until the object model improves.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Spacer now uses sizeritem, instead of being standalone.\n  This forced a project version uprev to 1.6\n- Converted all wxLogDebug to Debug::Print so __WXFB_DEBUG__ is used to\n  determine whether or not to log\n- Improved precompiled header support.\n  NOTE: You must now define WX_PRECOMP when compiling to use a precompiled header.\n\n## 3.0.22 (Beta 3) - 2007-02-23\n\n### Added\n\n- Added most of the higher level events for wxTopLevelWindows and wxWindow\n\n### Changed\n\n- Updated the event layout and used event inhertitance to get common events\n  throughout the controls\n\n## 3.0.21 (Beta 3) - 2007-02-22\n\n### Added\n\n- Added the 'Additional' controls events\n- Added wxEVT_UPDATE_UI event to all controls (if it has a sense)\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Prevent event handler duplication when there are different event handlers\n  with the same function (but it doesn't check that the event class is the\n  same)\n- Fixed FS#98 - Non-existing files are removed from the recent files list\n\n## 3.0.20 (Beta 3) - 2007-02-18\n\n### Changed\n\n- \"View:XRC Window\" now only generates the form that it will display\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed FS#93 - \"wxGrid -> Object type unknown in XRC.\"\n- Fixed FS#94 - \"Typo in code generation which includes \\<wx/imaglist.h\\>.\"\n- Fixed FS#96 - \"No XRC for wxStdDialogButtonSizer.\"\n- Added wxRadioBox label to XRC output\n\n## 3.0.19 (Beta 3) - 2007-02-12\n\n### Changed\n\n- wxFrame title bar color now using ActiveCaption\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed FS#89 - \"wxSpinCtrl cannot have negative min/max value.\"\n- Fixed FS#90 - \"Can't change the source of a bitmap.\"\n- Fixed FS#91 - \"ID's that start with 'wx' are not properly generated.\"\n- MainFrame is updated when a property is changed, even if the object\n  doesn't match with the selected object (i.e. sizeritem obj)\n\n## 3.0.18 (Beta 3) - 2006-02-01\n\n### Added\n\n- Implemented FS#6 - \"icons and bitmaps support\"\n- Implemented FS#87 - \"Run as command-line compiler\"\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Undo command of MoveHierarchy (move left) now restores the position of\n  the object\n- Fixed FS#86 - \"Object-tree context-menu \"Copy\" command has no effect\"\n\n## 3.0.17 (Beta 2) - 2007-01-19\n\n### Added\n\n- Added new 'Generate Inherited Class' dialog\n- Added menu events\n- Added Toolbar tool events\n\n### Changed\n\n- Changed generation of \"minimum_size\" and \"maximum_size\" for wxFrame and\n  wxDialog to using SetSizeHints\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed bug where dragging on created dialog statusbar was resizing the main\n  application window\n- Fixed FS#85 - \"required wx/imagelist.h for wxListbook using image files.\"\n  with help from akira\n- Fixed the \"relative_path\" and \"internationalize\" properties for code\n  generated from the inner template of a macro.

The means that the xml files\n  must have a declaration, and the encoding must be UTF-8. If it is not, wxFB\n  will offer to convert the file, from a user chosen original encoding. This\n  resolves FS#69.\n- Add the .fbp extension when saving if none is chosen. (this is really only\n  an linux issue)\n- Added a shortcut to the \"XRC Window\" menu item\n- Added property to skip frame's main sizer generation in certain cases for xrc code\n- Now using ints instead of uints for min, max, and val on wxSlider\n- Now remembering right splitter size in classic gui\n- Fixed wxSlider XRC generation for the minValue and maxValue properties\n- Status bar now stays on the bottom of the frame even when the sizer is empty\n\n### Changed\n\n- Single Instance Stuff:\n    Prefixed lockfiles with '.' so they are hidden.\n    Switched using \"localhost\" to \"127.0.0.1\", \"localhost\" was not working for me.\n    Added a status bar message in the second instance when the first instance\n    is brought to the front.\n    Moved single instance stuff to wxfbipc.cpp/h.\n- General innerframe rendering updates\n\n### Removed\n\n- Removed SetVendorName, it just added a level to the hierarchy in the windows\n  registry\n\n## 3.0.13 (Beta 2) - 2006-12-22\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Now generating all empty strings as wxEmptyString. This resolves FS#52.\n- wxRadioBox can now use internationalization on its label, too.\n  This resolves FS#50.\n- Generation of Microsoft BOM on UTF-8 files is now disabled on\n  platforms other than WXMSW. This resolves FS#46.\n- Fixed crash when editing the value of a wxTextCtrl in the designer,\n  under certain conditions. This resolves FS#45.\n\n## 3.0.12 (Beta 2) - 2006-12-08\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed problems with paths including non-English characters.\n  wxFB can now be installed to such paths, as well as open/save projects,\n  generate code, and import xrc files. This resolves FS#49.\n- Now only allowing one choice for non_flexible_grow_mode and for\n  flexible_direction on wxFlexGridSizer. This resolves FS#56.\n\n## 3.0.11 (Beta 2) - 2006-12-04\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Now generating user_headers include statements above the generated\n  header include. This resolves FS#55.\n- Fixed FS#51 - \"notebook-like objects errors while they are included into each other\"\n- Fixed FS#59 - \"wxCheckListBox: incorrect class name in XRC\"\n- Fixed  FS#62 - \"Sub-Classing top level items doesn't work.\"\n  This was a big change. The subclass property is now a parent property with two\n  children: name and header. The name is the subclass name, and header is the\n  header to include so that the subclass is defined while building. The header\n  is placed into the correct generated file depending on whether a form or control\n  is being subclassed. This removes most of the purposed of the \"user_headers\"\n  property, so it has been removed. A \"precompiled_header\" property was added,\n  with default value of \"wx/wxprec.h\". This fix necessitated the creation of a \"parent\"\n  property type, of which \"subclass\" is the only example. More information on parent\n  properties will soon be added to the wiki.\n\n## 3.0.10 (Beta 2) - 2006-11-15\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed FS#63 - \"Size/minimum-size is not working.\"\n- Fixed FS#60 - \"wxFlexGridSizer vgap/hgap if empty they get generated empty.\"\n  This was actually a bug with most numerical properties. Added a \"uint\" property\n  type to solve this. Most numerical properties are now unsigned integers, so the\n  property grid will not let it remain blank, and negative numbers are not accepted.\n  This approach is good because it is clear to the user what will happen when the\n  code is generated.\n- Fixed FS#66 - \"Adding common controls to toolbar.\"\n- Fixed FS#65 - \"Unfriendly object tree.\"\n- Implemented FS#68 - \"Smart enable/disable of toolbar items.\"\n  This was already mostly done. Just needed to enable/disable the appropriate alignment\n  buttons for wxBoxSizer and wxStaticBoxSizer.\n\n## 3.0.9 (Beta 2) - 2006-10-30\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed moving left, right, and into a new wxBoxSizer for spacers\n- Fixed FS#72 - \"When editing a property in the property grid, it is lost when you click away.\"\n- Fixed FS#73 - \"Toolbar tools not selecting the object in the object tree.\"\n- Fixed FS#71 - \"wxSplitter window sashpos not being set.\"\n\n## 3.0.8 (Beta 2) - 2006-10-27\n\n### Fixed\n\n- ID_DEFAULT is no longer defined when not used\n- Ids beginning with \"wxID_\" are no longer defined, this is to avoid redefining\n  wxWidgets special identifiers\n- Ids for forms now use the \"id\" property instead of being hardcoded to -1\n- Fixed wxSlider XRC generation for the minValue and maxValue properties\n\n## 3.0.7 (Beta 2) - 2006-10-26\n\n### Changed\n\n- wxID_ANY is now the default id\n- Object tree now saves its state\n- Object tree now also scrolls horizontally when selecting an object\n- Added class name and line to error message for unknown classes when importing xrc\n- Improved both C++ and XRC code generation for wxSplitterWindow\n\n## 3.0.6 (Beta 2) - 2006-10-25\n\n### Added\n\n- Added support for using wxSplitterWindow with only one child\n- Added min_pane_size and sashsize properties to wxSplitterWindow\n- Added maximum size property to wxWindow properties\n\n### Changed\n\n- Implemented FS#26 - \"Chronological id creation.\"\n\n## 3.0.5 (Beta 2) - 2006-10-20\n\n### Added\n\n- Implemented FS#48 - \"Improve error notification when a plugin is missing.\"\n  If widgets are missing, the project will not load at all.\n- Added a boolean \"xrc_skip_sizer\" property to Frame. The default is value is true.\n  When true, the main sizer of the frame will not be generated in XRC, if the sizer\n  only has one child. This is a workaround for a wx bug that ignores the \"size\"\n  property of the frame if it has a sizer. This resolves FS#74.\n- Added encoding check for all loaded xml files\n\n## 3.0.4 (Beta 1) - 2006-10-13\n\n### Changed\n\n- Now limiting to a single instance of wxFB per project file. The resolves FS#31.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed visual editor for subpanels\n- Fixed circular subclassing. This resolves FS#32.\n- Fixed Alt-Tab icon. This resolves FS#34.\n\n## 3.0.3 (Beta 1) - 2006-10-08\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed wxWindow settings code generation\n\n## 3.0.2 (Beta 1) - 2006-10-07\n\n### Added\n\n- Added center property for wxDialog and wxFrame. This closes FS#17.\n- Individual directories for each plug-in\n- Toolbar separators. This closes FS#11.\n- Possibility to group plugin components with toolbar separators\n\n### Changed\n\n- Premake script for sdk projects\n- Renamed contrib to wxAddition plug-in\n- Palette now remembers tab order\n- Major ripup/redesign of the plugin interface\n- Plugin directory out of src\n- wxAdditions plug-in to the wxAdditions repository\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed generation bugs in submenu and wxCheckList (now wxCheckListBox)\n  These were caused by subclass in version 2.00.75. This closes FS#20.\n- Changed title of save dialog box from \"Open Project\" to \"Save Project\".\n  This closes FS#18.\n- Fixed xrc generation of static bitmap using patch supplied by henrique.\n  This closes FS#16.\n- Added subclassing on forms. This closes FS#21.\n- Fixed C++ output of value property for wxGauge\n\n## 2.0.75 - 2006-09-13\n\n### Added\n\n- Added subclass and user_headers properties. This closes FS#5.\n\n## 2.0.74 - 2006-09-07\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed behaviour of wxSize and wxPoint properties when NumLock was\n  on (and possibly others)\n\n## 2.0.73 - 2006-08-28\n\n### Changed\n\n- File size for wxAdditions in the wxFormBuilder installer\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Fixed behaviour of wxSizer::Fit().

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

Using MSYS2 is a bit more convenient because it offers the required\nlibraries precompiled and CMake can find them automatically. Using the other compilers it might be necessary to specify the library\nlocations manually. The following instructions use MSYS2.\n\nInstall MSYS2 and open a MINGW32 or MINGW64 shell.\n\nInstalling the Prerequisites:\n\n```sh\npacman -Syu\npacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-toolchain ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-cmake ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-make base-devel git\npacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-wxWidgets3.2 ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-boost\n```\n\nBuilding:\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder\ncd wxFormBuilder\ncmake -S . -B _build -G \"MSYS Makefiles\" --install-prefix \"$PWD/_install\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\ncmake --build _build --config Release -j `nproc`\ncmake --install _build --config Release\n```\n\nRunning:\n\n```sh\n_install/wxFormBuilder\n```\n\n---\n\n### Linux\n\nBuilding on Linux has been tested on Ubuntu and Fedora with GCC in 64 bit mode but should work on many more distributions.\n\n#### Ubuntu\n\nInstalling the Prerequisites:\n\n```sh\nsudo apt install libwxgtk3.2-dev libwxgtk-media3.2-dev libboost-dev cmake make git\n```\n\nBuilding:\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder\ncd wxFormBuilder\ncmake -S . -B _build -G \"Unix Makefiles\" --install-prefix \"$PWD/_install\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\ncmake --build _build --config Release -j `nproc`\ncmake --install _build --config Release\n```\n\nRunning:\n\n```sh\n_install/bin/wxformbuilder\n```\n\n#### Fedora\n\nInstalling the Prerequisites:\n\n```sh\nsudo dnf install wxGTK-devel wxGTK-media boost-devel cmake make git\n```\n\nBuilding:\n\n```sh\ngit clone --recursive https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder\ncd wxFormBuilder\ncmake -S . -B _build -G \"Unix Makefiles\" --install-prefix \"$PWD/_install\" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\ncmake --build _build --config Release -j `nproc`\ncmake --install _build --config Release\n```\n\nRunning:\n\n```sh\n_install/bin/wxformbuilder\n```\n\n---\n\n### macOS\n\nBuilding on macOS has been tested with Clang in 64 bit mode using Xcode and make.
