          "content": "All Eclipse projects are governed by the Eclipse Foundation [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/eclipse/.github/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report any unacceptable behavior to conduct@eclipse-foundation.org.\n\n# Community Code of Conduct\n\n**Version 2.0  \nJanuary 1, 2023**\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as community members, contributors, Committers[^1], and Project Leads (collectively \"Contributors\") pledge to make participation in our projects and our community a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone.\n\nThis Community Code of Conduct (\"Code\") outlines our behavior expectations as members of our community in all Eclipse Foundation activities, both offline and online. It is not intended to govern scenarios or behaviors outside of the scope of Eclipse Foundation activities. Nor is it intended to replace or supersede the protections offered to all our community members under the law. Please follow both the spirit and letter of this Code and encourage other Contributors to follow these principles into our work. Failure to read or acknowledge this Code does not excuse a Contributor from compliance with the Code.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive and professional environment include:\n\n- Using welcoming and inclusive language;\n- Actively encouraging all voices;\n- Helping others bring their perspectives and listening actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to encourage other voices to join in;\n- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences;\n- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism;\n- Focusing on what is best for the community;\n- Showing empathy towards other community members;\n- Being direct but professional; and\n- Leading by example by holding yourself and others accountable\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by Contributors include:\n\n- The use of sexualized language or imagery;\n- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances;\n- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;\n- Public or private harassment, repeated harassment;\n- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission;\n- Violent threats or language directed against another person;\n- Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language;\n- Posting sexually explicit or violent material;\n- Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history;\n- Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms;\n- Excessive or unnecessary profanity;\n- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior; and\n- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nWith the support of the Eclipse Foundation employees, consultants, officers, and directors (collectively, the \"Staff\"), Committers, and Project Leads, the Eclipse Foundation Conduct Committee (the \"Conduct Committee\") is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior. The Conduct Committee takes appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code applies within all Project, Working Group, and Interest Group spaces and communication channels of the Eclipse Foundation (collectively, \"Eclipse spaces\"), within any Eclipse-organized event or meeting, and in public spaces when an individual is representing an Eclipse Foundation Project, Working Group, Interest Group, or their communities. Examples of representing a Project or community include posting via an official social media account, personal accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of Projects, Working Groups, and Interest Groups may be further defined and clarified by Committers, Project Leads, or the Staff.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Conduct Committee via conduct@eclipse-foundation.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. Without the explicit consent of the reporter, the Conduct Committee is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. The Conduct Committee is further obligated to ensure that the respondent is provided with sufficient information about the complaint to reply. If such details cannot be provided while maintaining confidentiality, the Conduct Committee will take the respondent‘s inability to provide a defense into account in its deliberations and decisions. Further details of enforcement guidelines may be posted separately.\n\nStaff, Committers and Project Leads have the right to report, remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code, or to block temporarily or permanently any Contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Any such actions will be reported to the Conduct Committee for transparency and record keeping.\n\nAny Staff (including officers and directors of the Eclipse Foundation), Committers, Project Leads, or Conduct Committee members who are the subject of a complaint to the Conduct Committee will be recused from the process of resolving any such complaint.\n\n## Responsibility\n\nThe responsibility for administering this Code rests with the Conduct Committee, with oversight by the Executive Director and the Board of Directors. For additional information on the Conduct Committee and its process, please write to <conduct@eclipse-foundation.org>.\n\n## Investigation of Potential Code Violations\n\nAll conflict is not bad as a healthy debate may sometimes be necessary to push us to do our best. It is, however, unacceptable to be disrespectful or offensive, or violate this Code. If you see someone engaging in objectionable behavior violating this Code, we encourage you to address the behavior directly with those involved. If for some reason, you are unable to resolve the matter or feel uncomfortable doing so, or if the behavior is threatening or harassing, please report it following the procedure laid out below.\n\nReports should be directed to <conduct@eclipse-foundation.org>. It is the Conduct Committee’s role to receive and address reported violations of this Code and to ensure a fair and speedy resolution.\n\nThe Eclipse Foundation takes all reports of potential Code violations seriously and is committed to confidentiality and a full investigation of all allegations. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the report supplied to the accused. Contributors who are being investigated for a potential Code violation will have an opportunity to be heard prior to any final determination. Those found to have violated the Code can seek reconsideration of the violation and disciplinary action decisions. Every effort will be made to have all matters disposed of within 60 days of the receipt of the complaint.\n\n## Actions\nContributors who do not follow this Code in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the Conduct Committee.\n\nThis Code does not address all conduct. It works in conjunction with our [Communication Channel Guidelines](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/communication-channel-guidelines/), [Social Media Guidelines](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/social_media_guidelines.php), [Bylaws](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/eclipse-foundation-be-bylaws-en.pdf), and [Internal Rules](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/ef-be-internal-rules.pdf) which set out additional protections for, and obligations of, all contributors. The Foundation has additional policies that provide further guidance on other matters.\n\nIt’s impossible to spell out every possible scenario that might be deemed a violation of this Code. Instead, we rely on one another’s good judgment to uphold a high standard of integrity within all Eclipse Spaces. Sometimes, identifying the right thing to do isn’t an easy call. In such a scenario, raise the issue as early as possible.\n\n## No Retaliation\n\nThe Eclipse community relies upon and values the help of Contributors who identify potential problems that may need to be addressed within an Eclipse Space. Any retaliation against a Contributor who raises an issue honestly is a violation of this Code. That a Contributor has raised a concern honestly or participated in an investigation, cannot be the basis for any adverse action, including threats, harassment, or discrimination. If you work with someone who has raised a concern or provided information in an investigation, you should continue to treat the person with courtesy and respect. If you believe someone has retaliated against you, report the matter as described by this Code. Honest reporting does not mean that you have to be right when you raise a concern; you just have to believe that the information you are providing is accurate.\n\nFalse reporting, especially when intended to retaliate or exclude, is itself a violation of this Code and will not be accepted or tolerated.\n\nEveryone is encouraged to ask questions about this Code. Your feedback is welcome, and you will get a response within three business days. Write to <conduct@eclipse-foundation.org>.\n\n## Amendments\n\nThe Eclipse Foundation Board of Directors may amend this Code from time to time and may vary the procedures it sets out where appropriate in a particular case.\n\n### Attribution\n\nThis Code was inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.4, available [here](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/).\n\n[^1]: Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Bylaws.\n"

SUMO allows modelling and analyzing intermodal traffic\nsystems, including road vehicles, public transport, cargo logistics and\npedestrians. Included with SUMO is a wealth of supporting tools, which handle\ntasks like route finding, visualization, network import and emission\ncalculation. SUMO can be enhanced with custom models and it provides various\nAPIs to remotely control and influence the simulation.\n\n* https://eclipse.dev/sumo\n\n## Developer resources\n\nInformation regarding source code management, builds, coding standards, and\nmore.\n\n* https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Developer/Main.html\n\nThe project maintains the following source code repositories\n\n* https://github.com/eclipse-sumo/sumo\n* https://github.com/eclipse-sumo/sumo.website\n* https://github.com/dlr-ts/homebrew-sumo\n\nWe are happily reviewing pull requests against the master of this repository.\nFor details see below and https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/FAQ.html#how_do_code_contributions_work.\n\nIn order to allow the development of separate external modules for SUMO (which are not\npart of the mainline repository) every source code directory lists the files and\nsubdirectories where modifications need to be made available under the EPL and in a\nseparate list which files / directories are considered interfaces to external modules,\nas an entry point see the [contribution README in the src dir](src/README_Contributing.md).\n\n## Eclipse Contributor Agreement\n\nBefore your contribution can be accepted by the project team contributors must\nelectronically sign the Eclipse Contributor Agreement (ECA).\n\n* http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php\n\nCommits that are provided by non-committers must have a Signed-off-by field in\nthe footer indicating that the author is aware of the terms by which the\ncontribution has been provided to the project. The non-committer must\nadditionally have an Eclipse Foundation account and must have a signed Eclipse\nContributor Agreement (ECA) on file.\n\nFor more information, please see the Eclipse Committer Handbook:\nhttps://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#resources-commit\n\n## Translating\n\nIf you want to help in translating SUMO please open an account at\n[Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/eclipse-sumo/) and add your translation there.\nConcerning the license and the contributor agreement the same rules apply as for code\nand documentation (you need to agree to the ECA). If you want to add a new language\nplease send a request to sumo-dev (see below) or follow\n[these steps](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Developer/Translating.html#new_language).\n\n## Contact\n\nContact the project developers via the project's \"dev\" list.\n\n* https://dev.eclipse.org/mailman/listinfo/sumo-dev\n"

DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n     Distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n     i) changes to the Program, and\n     ii) additions to the Program;\n  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n  \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n  are not Modified Works.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\nor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\nform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\neditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\n\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\nresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\ncontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\nin Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\nWorks shall not include works that contain only declarations,\ninterfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\nin each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\nor Modified Works thereof.\n\n\"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\nin any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\n\"Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making\nmodifications, including but not limited to software source code,\ndocumentation source, and configuration files.\n\n\"Secondary License\" means either the GNU General Public License,\nVersion 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\nexceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\nContributor.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n  look for such a notice.\n\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n"

For an explanation of the image formats see the section\n# output formats in the documentation of the dot tool (Graphviz (see:\n# https://www.graphviz.org/)).\n# Note: If you choose svg you need to set HTML_FILE_EXTENSION to xhtml in order\n# to make the SVG files visible in IE 9+ (other browsers do not have this\n# requirement).\n# Possible values are: png, jpg, jpg:cairo, jpg:cairo:gd, jpg:gd, jpg:gd:gd,\n# gif, gif:cairo, gif:cairo:gd, gif:gd, gif:gd:gd, svg, png:gd, png:gd:gd,\n# png:cairo, png:cairo:gd, png:cairo:cairo, png:cairo:gdiplus, png:gdiplus and\n# png:gdiplus:gdiplus.\n# The default value is: png.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOT_IMAGE_FORMAT       = svg\n\n# If DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT is set to svg, then this option can be set to YES to\n# enable generation of interactive SVG images that allow zooming and panning.\n#\n# Note that this requires a modern browser other than Internet Explorer. Tested\n# and working are Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera.\n# Note: For IE 9+ you need to set HTML_FILE_EXTENSION to xhtml in order to make\n# the SVG files visible. Older versions of IE do not have SVG support.\n# The default value is: NO.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nINTERACTIVE_SVG        = YES\n\n# The DOT_PATH tag can be used to specify the path where the dot tool can be\n# found. If left blank, it is assumed the dot tool can be found in the path.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOT_PATH               =\n\n# The DOTFILE_DIRS tag can be used to specify one or more directories that\n# contain dot files that are included in the documentation (see the \\dotfile\n# command).\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOTFILE_DIRS           =\n\n# You can include diagrams made with dia in doxygen documentation. Doxygen will\n# then run dia to produce the diagram and insert it in the documentation. The\n# DIA_PATH tag allows you to specify the directory where the dia binary resides.\n# If left empty dia is assumed to be found in the default search path.\n\nDIA_PATH               =\n\n# The DIAFILE_DIRS tag can be used to specify one or more directories that\n# contain dia files that are included in the documentation (see the \\diafile\n# command).\n\nDIAFILE_DIRS           =\n\n# When using plantuml, the PLANTUML_JAR_PATH tag should be used to specify the\n# path where java can find the plantuml.jar file or to the filename of jar file\n# to be used. If left blank, it is assumed PlantUML is not used or called during\n# a preprocessing step. Doxygen will generate a warning when it encounters a\n# \\startuml command in this case and will not generate output for the diagram.\n\nPLANTUML_JAR_PATH      =\n\n# When using plantuml, the PLANTUML_CFG_FILE tag can be used to specify a\n# configuration file for plantuml.\n\nPLANTUML_CFG_FILE      =\n\n# When using plantuml, the specified paths are searched for files specified by\n# the !include statement in a plantuml block.\n\nPLANTUML_INCLUDE_PATH  =\n\n# The DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES tag can be used to set the maximum number of nodes\n# that will be shown in the graph. If the number of nodes in a graph becomes\n# larger than this value, doxygen will truncate the graph, which is visualized\n# by representing a node as a red box. Note that doxygen if the number of direct\n# children of the root node in a graph is already larger than\n# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES then the graph will not be shown at all. Also note that\n# the size of a graph can be further restricted by MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH.\n# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 10000, default value: 50.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES    = 50\n\n# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag can be used to set the maximum depth of the graphs\n# generated by dot. A depth value of 3 means that only nodes reachable from the\n# root by following a path via at most 3 edges will be shown. Nodes that lay\n# further from the root node will be omitted. Note that setting this option to 1\n# or 2 may greatly reduce the computation time needed for large code bases. Also\n# note that the size of a graph can be further restricted by\n# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES. Using a depth of 0 means no depth restriction.\n# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 1000, default value: 0.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nMAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH    = 2\n\n# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES to allow dot to generate multiple output\n# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This\n# makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (>1.8.10) support\n# this, this feature is disabled by default.\n# The default value is: NO.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOT_MULTI_TARGETS      = YES\n\n# If the GENERATE_LEGEND tag is set to YES doxygen will generate a legend page\n# explaining the meaning of the various boxes and arrows in the dot generated\n# graphs.\n# Note: This tag requires that UML_LOOK isn't set, i.e. the doxygen internal\n# graphical representation for inheritance and collaboration diagrams is used.\n# The default value is: YES.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nGENERATE_LEGEND        = YES\n\n# If the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to YES, doxygen will remove the intermediate\n# files that are used to generate the various graphs.\n#\n# Note: This setting is not only used for dot files but also for msc temporary\n# files.\n# The default value is: YES.\n\nDOT_CLEANUP            = YES\n\n# You can define message sequence charts within doxygen comments using the \\msc\n# command. If the MSCGEN_TOOL tag is left empty (the default), then doxygen will\n# use a built-in version of mscgen tool to produce the charts. Alternatively,\n# the MSCGEN_TOOL tag can also specify the name an external tool. For instance,\n# specifying prog as the value, doxygen will call the tool as prog -T\n# <outfile_format> -o <outputfile> <inputfile>. The external tool should support\n# output file formats \"png\", \"eps\", \"svg\", and \"ismap\".\n\nMSCGEN_TOOL            =\n\n# The MSCFILE_DIRS tag can be used to specify one or more directories that\n# contain msc files that are included in the documentation (see the \\mscfile\n# command).\n\nMSCFILE_DIRS           =\n"
