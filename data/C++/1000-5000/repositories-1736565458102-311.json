Use a well named topic branch for the changes, preferably with uppercase and dashes, use your initials at the beginning of the branch name e.g. `JME-EDITOR-FIXES`.  Fork off the `master` branch.  Avoid forking from repository work branches as they may get rebased.\n\n* Test your changes as thoroughly as possible.\n\n* Please follow the code style for the language you are working in and try to match the general structure of Atomic code.  Check that your diff looks as clean and minimal as possible.\n\n* Add yourself to the end of the \"Contributors\" list in `AUTHORS.md` if you're not already on the list.  `By doing this you confirm that`:\n\n  - **You own the rights to the contribution**, or have the legal right to\n    license the contribution under the Atomic Game Engine Contribution License `CONTRIBUTION_LICENSE.md` on behalf of the copyright owner(s).\n\n  - You, or the copyright owner(s), agree to **irrevocably license the contribution** under the Atomic Game Engine Contribution License `CONTRIBUTION_LICENSE.md`\n\n  - Please include a link to your GitHub profile to allow your contribution to be identified accurately.\n\n* Create a pull request in Github.  For now, the \"base branch\" should be\n  \"master\", i.e. the pull requests are merged directly to the master branch.\n  In the description:\n\n  - Summarize the change and the motivation for the change.\n\nTo report bugs or request features\n----------------------------------\n\nUse GitHub issues to report bugs or request features:\n\n* Please include a compilation or execution log to help diagnosis.\n"

Issues will not be attended to, though PRs that fix build issues may be considered. The remainder of this README has been kept in place for future reference.\n\nWebsite: <a href=\"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine</a>\n\n#### Why Atomic?\n\nThe Atomic Game Engine is powerful native technology with a consistent API and tooling available in C++, C#, Typescript and JavaScript. The Atomic Editor is **installed in over 75 countries** and has hit “critical mass” with production in multiple industries.\n\nAtomic can also be used as a library in existing projects with a C++ SDK, C# NuGet, and JavaScript npm package in development.\n\n#### Atomic Technology\n\n- Consistent **2D/3D API** available in **JavaScript, TypeScript, C#, and C++**\n- Built-in Monaco JavaScript/TypeScript editor and support for **VSCode** and **Atom**\n- C# IDE integration with **Visual Studio**, **Xamarin Studio**, and **MonoDevelop**\n- **Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and WebGL** platform deployment\n- High performance native C++ core with single command builds and absolute minimum dependencies\n- Node based scene graph with access to low level graphics API for custom rendering on D3D 9/11, OpenGL 2/3/ES2, and WebGL\n- Modular component system including C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, and C++ logic components with networking\n- Drag and drop standard 2D/3D format import, including Autodesk FBX, Collada, Blender, Spriter, Tiled, and more\n- Innovative preview mode runs in subprocess for editor stability, reduced memory fragmentation, and is the foundation for future previewing on device\n- Chromium WebView for E-Commerce payments, accessing Facebook social graph, video streaming, and many more use cases\n- Automated script binding generation of native C++ subsystems\n- Best in class third party integrations including Box2D/Bullet physics, Recast/Detour pathfinding, TurboBadger UI, CEF3, duktape VM, SDL2\n- Available as precompiled binaries or fork on GitHub under the permissive MIT license\n- **Backed by professionals with decades of experience in the technology and game industries**\n\n---\n\n### Build Instructions\n\nThe Atomic Editor can be built for your platform using these <a href=\"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/wiki/Building-Atomic-from-Source\" target=\"_blank\">build instructions.</a>\n\n#### Atomic Resources\n\n##### Community\n\n<a href=\"https://discourse.atomicgameengine.com/\">Discourse</a>  \n<a href=\"https://gitter.im/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/\">Gitter Chat</a>\n\n##### Documentation\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/wiki/\">Wiki</a>  \n\n---\n\n#### Screenshots\n\n##### Atomic Examples\n[DevSnapshot]: https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/wiki/images/repo/DevSnapshot2116.png\n![alt text][DevSnapshot]\n\n##### Atomic on Mobile\n[ToonTown]: https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/wiki/images/repo/ToonTownTouchUpdate.gif\n![alt text][ToonTown]\n\n##### Atomic Build Settings\n[AndroidBuildSettings]: https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/wiki/images/repo/AndroidBuildSettings.png\n![alt text][AndroidBuildSettings]\n\n#### Atomic History\n\nTHUNDERBEAST GAMES began developing the Atomic Game Engine on November 12th, 2014 by forking Urho3D.  It was released under the permissive MIT license during GDC 2016.  Atomic is now being used in production environments, <a href=\"https://github.com/AtomicGameEngine/AtomicGameEngine/graphs/contributors\" target=\"_blank\">has 27 contributors</a>, and runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and WebGL!\n"
