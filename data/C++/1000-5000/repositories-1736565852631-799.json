A keylogger is a program that records your keystrokes, and this program saves them in a log file on your local computer.\n\nCheck out below to learn how to install them. These keyloggers are simple and bare bones, however they work great! Feel free to fork and improve it if you want. Be sure to check out the [issues](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/pulls) to see if your problem has been fixed, or to help out others.\n\nCurrently, there are three keylogger programs for the major operating systems; Windows, Mac and Linux.\n\n> Looking to make a fix or change on the website? You can find the website repo [here](https://github.com/simple-keylogger/simple-keylogger.github.io).\n\n## Contents\n- [Windows installation guide](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/blob/master/windows/README.md)\n- [Mac installation guide](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/blob/master/mac/README.md)\n- [Linux installation guide](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/blob/master/linux/README.md)\n- [Check out the site for more information](https://simple-keylogger.github.io/)\n\nOr, view the `README.md` file in each programs folder for more up to date information.\n\n## Windows\nTo change visibility of the window set the `#define` in line 13 to `visible` or `invisible`.\n\nSimply compile into an .exe, and then run. Visual Studio is good for this.\n\n- `invisible` makes the window of the logger disappear, and it also starts up hidden from view. Note that it is still visible in the task manager.\n- `visible` is visible, and the window does not close when typing. Great for testing it out.\n\nBoth of these save the keystrokes to a .txt file when closed.\n\n> Note that sometimes your compiler may throw up errors. If it does, keep compiling - the program still works. Please check issues and discussions if you have a problem.\n\n[@mydarkthawts](https://github.com/mydarkthawts) has an [excellent comment with a guide and a video on how to compile this here](https://github.com/GiacomoLaw/Keylogger/issues/80#issuecomment-1925503134).\n\n## Mac\nSee [Casey Scarborough](https://github.com/caseyscarborough/keylogger).\n\n## Linux\n\n### Usage\n```\n  pip install -r requirements. txt\n  keylogger.py\n```\n\n## How to run it\n\nBy running `nohup python3 keylogger.py &` command, it'll start to log your strokes:\nThe meaning of nohup is ‘no hangup‘.\nWhen nohup command use with ‘&’ then it doesn’t return to shell command prompt after running the command in the background. \n```\n$~/Keylogger/linux$ nohup python3 keylogger.py &\n[1] 12529 //this is the keylogger's PID (process ID)\n$:~/Keylogger/linux$ fg\n\n```\n\nThe Keylogger is now running! It will log your strokes to a file .\nStop it by typing the command `fg` then hitting `CTRL+C`\n\nor\n\n`kill {PID}` for example `kill 12529`\n\n\n---\n\n---\n#### Uses\n\nSome uses of a keylogger are:\n\n- Personal Control and File Backup: Make sure no one is using your computer when you are away.\n- Self analysis\n\n---\n\nFeel free to contribute to fix any problems, or to submit an issue!\n\nPlease note, this repo is for educational purposes only. No contributors, major or minor, are to fault for any actions done by this program.\n\nDon't really understand licenses or tl;dr?
