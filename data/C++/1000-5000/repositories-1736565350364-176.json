Send the input event to Applications.\n\n\nThreads and Lock (kext)\n-----------------------\nWe use a global lock to guard the status of modifier flags, the status of buttons, and other global variables.\nAll threads use this global lock. The only one thread runs at the same time.\n\nThreads:\n\n* Timer callback (*_timer_callback)\n* hooked function (EventInputQueue::push_*)\n* gIOMatchedNotification and gIOTerminatedNotification callback of input devices (Core::*Notification_callback)\n* IOUserClient callback (UserClient_kext::callback_*)\n\nFiles and Directories Overview\n------------------------------\n\nA selected list to orient you...\n\n* *make-package.sh*:  shell script to create a signed .dmg file.\n* *version*:  current version number string\n* *Tests/*:  tests based on gtest (Google C++ Testing Framework).\n* *files/*:  files and configurations for making OS/X applications\n  * *files/extra*:  shell scripts for packaging used by make-package.sh\n* *pkginfo/*:  more package tools, including setting the version number.\n* *src/*:\n  * *src/vendor/blueutil*:  command line control of Bluetooth\n  * *src/core/server/*:  main server code, what you see as the UI.\n    + *.../Frameworks/Sparkle.framework*:  modified Sparkle upgrader\n    + *.../Resources/include/checkbox*:  long ChangeKey list items\n  * *src/core/kext*:  main kernal extension magic\n* *util/uncrustify*:  code beautifier\n"

(Emacs Mode, Vi Mode, Mouse Keys Mode, ...)\n\nPrior to version 9.3.0, Karabiner was called *KeyRemap4MacBook*.\n\n**Please use [Karabiner-Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements) on macOS Sierra (10.12) or later.**\n\nWe made Karabiner-Elements from scratch due to kernel architecture changes in macOS Sierra.\n\nUseful links\n------------\n\n* Latest build: https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/\n* Mirror: http://tekezo.github.io/pqrs.org/\n* Google Group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osx-karabiner\n* List of key names: https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/blob/master/src/bridge/generator/keycode/data/KeyCode.data\n\nYou can also get the latest stable release package via fixed URL.\n\n```\n$ curl -L -O https://pqrs.org/latest/karabiner-latest.dmg\n```\n\nSystem requirements\n-------------------\n\nKarabiner works for all Mac products, including the MacBook series, iMac, Mac mini, and Mac Pro, with the requirement that the product runs OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher, up until MacOS 10.12 (Sierra), which is not supported.\n\n* If you require Karabiner for macOS 10.12, please use [Karabiner Elements](https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner-Elements).\n* If you require Karabiner for OS X 10.6 - 10.8, please use KeyRemap4MacBook 8.4.0.\n* If you require Karabiner for OS X 10.4 - 10.5, please use KeyRemap4MacBook 5.1.0.\n\n\nHow to build\n------------\n\nSystem requirements:\n\n* OS X 10.11+\n* Xcode 8+\n* Command Line Tools for Xcode\n* Boost 1.56.0+ (header-only) http://www.boost.org/\n\nPlease install Boost into `/opt/local/include/boost`. (eg. `/opt/local/include/boost/version.hpp`)\n\n### Step 1: Getting source code\n\nDownload the source to master.tar.gz in the current directory, this can be re-executed to restart a cancelled download.\n\n    curl -OLC - https://github.com/tekezo/Karabiner/archive/master.tar.gz\n\nExtract the master.tar.gz file to \"Karabiner-master\" and delete the tar.gz file\n\n    tar -xvzf master.tar.gz && rm master.tar.gz\n\n### Step 2: Building a package\n\n    cd Karabiner-master\n    make\n\nThe `make` script will create a redistributable **Karabiner-VERSION.dmg** in the current directory.\n\n\n**Note:**\nThe build may fail if you have changed any environment variables or if you have modified scripts in the `/usr/bin` locations. Use a clean environment (new account) if this is the case.\n"
