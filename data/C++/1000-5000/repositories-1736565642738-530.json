Loke and Heimdall communicate via the custom\nSamsung-developed protocol typically referred to as the 'Odin 3 protocol'.\n\nUSB communication in Heimdall is handled by the popular open-source USB library, [libusb](http://libusb.info).\n\n## Free & Open Source\n\nHeimdall is both free and open source. It is licensed under the MIT license (see LICENSE).\n\nHeimdall is maintained and predominantly developed by [Glass Echidna](http://glassechidna.com.au/),\na _tiny_ independent software development company. If you appreciate our work and would like\nto support future development please consider making a [donation](http://glassechidna.com.au/donate/).\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more details about how to compile and install Heimdall please refer to the\nappropriate platform specific README:\n\n#### Linux\n\n - Linux/README ([online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall/master/Linux/README))\n\n#### OS X\n\n - OSX/README.txt ([online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall/master/OSX/README.txt))\n\n#### Windows\n\n - Win32/README.txt ([online](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Benjamin-Dobell/Heimdall/master/Win32/README.txt))\n"
