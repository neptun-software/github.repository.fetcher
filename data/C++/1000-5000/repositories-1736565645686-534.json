A C++ compiler and a proper C++ build environment will need to be installed on your system prior to building this program. Under Debian and Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, the easiest way to get a base build environment set up is to install the meta-package **build-essential**. The following packages are required to be\ninstalled on your system in order to build this program:\n\n- `g++` from `gcc` (or clang compiler)\n- `cmake`\n- `extra-cmake-modules`\n- QT libraries:\n  - For QT6: `qt6-base-dev`, `qt6-tools-dev-tools` `libqt6core5compat6-dev` `qt6-tools-dev`\n  - For QT5: `qttools5-dev` and `qttools5-dev-tools` (`qt5-tools` on distros based on Arch Linux)\n- `libsdl2-dev` (`sdl2` on distros based on Arch Linux) (SDL2)\n- `libxi-dev` (`libxi` on distros based on Arch Linux) (Optional. Needed to compile with X11 and uinput support)\n- `libxtst-dev` (`libxtst` on distros based on Arch Linux) (Optional. Needed to compile with XTest support)\n- `libx11-dev` (`libx11` on distros based on Arch Linux) (Needed to compile with Qt5 support)\n- `itstool` (extracts messages from XML files and outputs PO template files, then merges translations from MO files to create translated XML files)\n- `gettext`\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Fedora dependencies</summary>\n\nOne-liner for installing above dependencies:\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf install git make cmake gcc cmake extra-cmake-modules qt6-qttools-devel SDL2-devel libXi-devel libXtst-devel libX11-devel itstool gettext-devel;\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Ubuntu/Debian dependencies</summary>\n\nOne-liner for installing above dependencies:  \n\n```bash\nsudo apt install g++ cmake extra-cmake-modules qt6-base-dev qt6-tools-dev-tools libqt6core5compat6-dev qt6-tools-dev libsdl2-dev libxi-dev libxtst-dev libx11-dev itstool gettext ninja-build\n```\n\nQT5 Variant:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install g++ cmake extra-cmake-modules qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools libsdl2-dev libxi-dev libxtst-dev libx11-dev itstool gettext ninja-build\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Windows dependencies</summary>\nIn case of Windows you need QT, SDL2 libraries, cmake and compiler (mingw for example).\n\nFor setting up your environment you may use `msys2`. Alternatively, you may use `MSVC`.\n\n</details>\n\n## Basic building\n\nThis way of building is useful for testing purposes.\n\nIn order to build this program, open a terminal and cd into the antimicrox\ndirectory. Enter the following commands in order to:\n\nClone repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox.git\n```\n\nBuild the program:\n\n```bash\ncd antimicrox\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake ..\ncmake --build .\n```\n\nRun built binaries\n\n```\n./bin/antimicrox\n```\n\n#### MSVC building tips\n\nRecent versions of Visual Studio (2017+) have support for cmake projects. Under Visual Studio 2022, building AntiMicroX is quite straight forward.\n- Ensure you have compatable versions of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) (5.9 works as of writing,) and [SDL2-devel](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/releases/) installed.\n- Open antimicrox as a local folder in VS22. It should pick up the `CMakeLists.txt` and offer an option to open the CMake settings editor. If it doesn't, right click on `CMakeLists.txt` in the solution explorer and select `CMake settings for antimicrox`.\n- In the `Command arguments` section, add an argument to tell CMake where to find your Qt; E.g.: `\"-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\\Qt\\5.9\\msvc2017_64\\lib\\cmake\"`. As of writing, Qt's msvc2017 works properly through vs22.\n- Under the `Cmake variables and cache` section, click the link labeled `Save and generate cmake cache to load variables.\n- If the CMake generation fails due to SDL2, find the variables named `SDL2_PATH`, `SDL2_INCLUDE_DIR`, and `SDL2_DLL_LOCATION_DIR` in the list view, and set them properly. You may also need to move the headers in the SDL2 include dir inside a folder named `SDL2` to match their include paths on other systems.\n- At this point you should be able to save your changes to regenerate the cmake cache, which will then allow you to build `antimicrox.exe` through Visual Studio.\n\nA recommended way of installation is building package typical for for your system (or building universal one like an AppImage).\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Installation using cmake (not recommended)</summary>\n\nThis way of installation is not recommended, because it doesn't integrate very well with some environments.\n\nInstall:\n\n```bash\nsudo cmake --install .\n```\n\nUninstall:\n\n```bash\nsudo make uninstall\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Build Options for CMake\n\nThere are a few application specific options that can be used when running\ncmake to build antimicrox. The following file will attempt to list some of those\noptions and describe their use in the project.\n\n### Universal Options\n\n    -DBUILD_DOCS\n\nDefault: OFF. Build documentation using doxygen (installed doxygen and dot required). Generated files can be found in `docs` directory\n\n    -DUPDATE_TRANSLATIONS\n\nDefault: OFF. Set updateqm target to call lupdate in order to update\ntranslation files from source.\n\n    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE\n\nDefault: Not defined. You can define build type.  \nDebug builds are compiled with enabled debug flags, disabled optimizations and better printing stack trace in case of crash.\n\n    -DTRANS_REMOVE_OBSOLETE\n\nDefault: OFF. Do not specify -noobsolete option when calling lupdate\ncommand for qm files. -noobsolete is a method for getting rid of obsolete text entries\n\n    -DCHECK_FOR_UPDATES\n\nDefault: OFF. Show update button in GUI when newer version is available. Recommended for builds distributed without package management systems.\n\n    -DWITH_TESTS\n\nDefault: OFF. Allows for the launch of test sources with unit tests\n\n    -DANTIMICROX_PKG_VERSION\n\nDefault: Not defined. (feature intended for packagers) Manually define version of package displayed in info tab. When not defined building time is displayed instead. Example: `-DANTIMICROX_PKG_VERSION=3.1.7-appimage`\n\n### Linux Options\n\n    -DAPPDATA\n\nDefault: ON. Build the project with AppData support.\n\n    -DWITH_UINPUT\n\nDefault: ON. Compile the program with uinput support.\n\n    -DINSTALL_UINPUT_UDEV_RULES\n\nDefault: ON. During installation process create new udev rule allowing regular users using uinput.\n\n    -DWITH_X11\n\nDefault: ON. Compile the program with X11 support.\n\n    -DWITH_XTEST\n\nDefault: ON. Compile the program with XTest support.\n\n---\n\n**qDebug output on terminal:**\n\nOn some systems, particularly if you do not have QtCreator installed, you may notice that some debug info (in particular qDebug() statements) do not generate any output on a Linux terminal. To fix this, you can create a qtlogging.ini file:\n\n    mkdir ~/.config/QtProject\n    printf '[Rules]\\n*.debug=true\\nqt.*.debug=false\\n' > ~/.config/QtProject/qtlogging.ini\n\nOnce this file is created and has the debug rules present, it should be picked up and applied automatically the next time you run cmake to create a build.\n\n## Building DEB package\n\n```bash\ncd antimicrox\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake .. -DCPACK_GENERATOR=\"DEB\"\ncmake --build . --target package\n```\n\n## Building RPM package\n\nIf your distribution doesn't yet have an RPM package, you can easily build one for yourself.\n\n```bash\ncd antimicrox\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake .. -DCPACK_GENERATOR=\"RPM\"\ncmake --build . --target package\n```\n\n## Building AppImage\n\nCreate build directory\n\n```bash\nmkdir build && cd ./build\n```\n\nDownload tools used for creating appimages (and make them executable)\n\n```bash\nwget https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy/releases/download/continuous/linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage\nwget https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit/releases/download/continuous/appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage\nwget https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy-plugin-qt/releases/download/continuous/linuxdeploy-plugin-qt-x86_64.AppImage\nchmod +x linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage\nchmod +x appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage\nchmod +x linuxdeploy-plugin-qt-x86_64.AppImage\n```\n\nBuild antimicrox and install it in AppDir directory\n\n```bash\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr\nmake\nmake install DESTDIR=AppDir\n```\n\nCreate AppImage file\n\n```bash\n./linuxdeploy-x86_64.AppImage --appdir AppDir --plugin qt\n./appimagetool-x86_64.AppImage AppDir/\n```\n\n## Building Flatpak\n\nThe command builds the package into the `build` folder and installs the created flatpak.\nThe Flathub manifest can be located in [Flathub's Github repo](https://github.com/flathub/io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox).\n\n```bash\nflatpak install flathub org.kde.Platform//5.11 org.kde.Sdk//5.11\nflatpak-builder --user --install build/ other/io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox.yml --force-clean\n```\n\n## Building Windows installer\n\nIn case of building Windows package you will need [NSIS](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download).\n\n```\ncmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -B .\\build\ncmake --build .\\build --target package\n```\n"

The WiimoteGlue project provided a way to allow uinput to\n  send absolute mouse pointer events when using uinput.\n\n- Fixed set changing with analog triggers.\n\n2015-10-19 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.20.2\n\n- Change Enhanced Precision and Easing Quad/Cubic acceleration\n  curves\n\n- Skipped straight to 2.20.2 since version 2.20 actually had 2.20.1 marked\n  as its version in the application\n\n2015-10-10 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.20\n\n- Replace usage of QElapsedTimer with QTime for mouse movement calculations.\n\n- Start using Qt 5 with Ubuntu Vivid package.\n\n- Change XTest pointer acceleration when starting the program.\n\n- Allow release slot to have a 0 ms interval. This is useful for people who\n  use a gamepad poll rate less than 10 ms.\n\n- Change minimize to tray code to work better with later versions of Gnome 3\n  and Unity.\n\n- Transfer travel distance axis changes when switching sets.\n\n2015-09-29 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.19.3\n\n- Japanese translation provided by tou omiya.\n\n- Make sure Game Controller Mapping dialog window reads raw joystick events.\n  This should fix problems regarding improper mapping causing controller elements\n  to no longer be mappable.\n\n- Make Set Change slots activate on button release instead of button press.\n\n- Tweaked the locking being performed in various portions of the program.\n\n- Fixed a problem with blank info window appearing when escaping from window\n  capture utility dialog.\n\n- Fixed issues with document-save-as icon staying displayed after resetting\n  a profile.\n\n- Fixed \"Media Next\" key binding for virtual keyboard.\n\n- Fixed various issues regarding binding slots in the Advanced Edit dialog window.\n\n2015-09-15 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.19.2\n\n- Add --next to allow multiple profiles to be loaded in one command call.\n\n- Add a flag to settings file when wizard is finished. Don't depend on any\n  other settings being changed during an application run.\n\n- Fixed issue with inserting Pause slots.\n\n- Fixed issue with blank application filepath being matched for auto profile\n  support.\n\n2015-09-03 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.19.1\n\n- Fixed SDL 1.2 build support.\n\n- Fixed issue with SDL thread not being stopped due to connections not being\n  made in some situations.\n\n- Fixed loading of a profile from a second instance.\n\n- Fixed problem with main window not being populated after the App Settings\n  Wizard was finished.\n\n- Fixed another portion of the program that assumed that a controller would be\n  connected at startup. Fixes excessive CPU load.\n\n2015-08-31 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.19\n\n- Added curve options for extra acceleration.\n\n- Fixed bug when App Settings Wizard would pop up when not needed.\n\n- Simplified Chinese translation updated.\n\n2015-08-24 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.18.2\n\n- Fixed overly active timer used to reset acceleration distances when\n  no events are returned from SDL in a given gamepad poll.\n\n- Sebian translation updated by Jay Alexander Fleming.\n\n- Changed behavior of 4 Way Cardinal mode for DPads. Diagonals are no longer\n  counted as a dead zone. This change is more likely temporary.\n  Up+Right - Up, Down+Right - Right, Down+Left - Down, Up+Left - Left\n\n2015-08-18 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.18.1\n\n- Fixed some threading issues when using X11.\n\n- Fixed excessive CPU load on startup when no controller is connected.\n\n2015-08-15 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.18\n\n- Perform event simulation in its own thread. Timer used for mouse speed\n  calculations has improved as a result.\n\n- Slow down Enhanced Precision mouse acceleration curve slightly. Changes\n  were mainly due to overall mouse emulation being tweaked.\n\n- Distributing 64 bit builds for Windows again.\n\n- Using a simulated event to click the minimize button in title bar now works\n  on Windows. The move to using a dedicated thread for event simulation allows\n  that to work now.\n\n- Simplified Chinese translation added thanks to zzpxyx.\n\n2015-08-02 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.17\n\n- Changed Enhanced Precision acceleration curve. The curve has been slowed down\n  slightly.\n\n- Changed how initial mouse movement is performed when the gamepad poll rate\n  and the mouse refresh rate differ.\n\n- Flash interface buttons after restoring the main window from the tray icon.\n\n- Tweaked mouse movement remainder routine. Remainders now only apply when\n  the direction along an axis is the same.\n\n- Raised maximum cycle reset time to 60 seconds.\n\n- Fixed improper cycle reset interval.\n\n2015-07-22 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.16\n\n- Loosen initial mouse movement experienced after going outside the dead zone.\n\n- Added option in the mouse settings section that would allow antimicroX to\n  reset the acceleration values being used for the uinput virtual mouse pointer.\n  This is useful after playing older Linux games that change the acceleration\n  settings for all mouse pointers after a game exits. Postal 2 and Doom 3 are two\n  examples of games in my game library that exhibit this behavior.\n\n- Queue all events before performing any actions. The priority of various events\n  has been changed as well.\n\n- Added option to change the gamepad poll rate used by the application. By\n  default, the old 10 ms poll rate will be used.\n\n- Bundle a few backup icon files. Mainly useful on SteamOS since the themes\n  used don't bundle a couple of essential icons that are expected to be present.\n\n- Compiled vmulti support into Windows build. The driver is not currently\n  provided. The program needs to be started with the arguments --eventgen vmulti.\n\n- Temporarily stop packaging a 64 bit version of the program for Windows.\n  Unfortunately, the version of Qt being used has a problem regarding timer\n  accuracy that is not experienced with the 32 bit version of Qt being used.\n  At this time, working around the problem is not feasible so there will be no\n  64 bit release. Please use the 32 bit version.\n\n- Change shortcuts used for the .msi package.\n\n- Bundle Qt translation files for Windows version.\n\n2015-06-27 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.15\n\n- Changed routine for extra acceleration for mouse movement. The new version\n  is a bit faster and more responsive than the previous version.\n\n- Added release circle setting for spring mouse mode. This can be used to have\n  the mouse return to a region around a character based on the last detected\n  direction of an analog stick.\n\n- Added a sub-menu to the virtual keyboard. Some multimedia and browser keys\n  can now be selected.\n\n- Added Execute slot type. A program can be set to launch when a slot is\n  activated.\n\n- Added Text Entry slot type. You can now have a string of text typed\n  when a slot is activated. This can be useful for inputting common commands in\n  games.\n\n- Added proper interpolation to determine the start of diagonal regions of\n  analog sticks. This is used for mouse movement in order to determine the proper\n  starting dead zone point.\n\n- Changed Enhanced Precision mouse acceleration curve. The new changes in the\n  curve should be much looser than before.\n\n- Fixed --unload command line option. Enforce reloading of config file\n  when finished.\n\n- Fixed issue with spring mouse mode where the mouse would temporarily return\n  to center when switching stick directions quickly.\n\n- Fixed some bindings in the virtual keyboard when using SendInput for the\n  event generator.\n\n- Fixed issue with widgets used to update stick and dpad delay. The spinbox can\n  now be used to edit the delay.\n\n- Reduced multiple instances of some objects. Reduces memory usage slightly.\n\n2015-05-01 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.14\n\n- Refactored extra axis acceleration. This revision uses individual gamepad\n  polls again. Other changes in the code have made switching back feasible. With\n  minor adjustments, the mouse will be looser but very controllable.\n\n- Added longer duration for extra axis acceleration. This allows extra\n  acceleration to be performed over a period of time as opposed to just one\n  gamepad poll.\n\n- Changed key repeat routine when using SendInput on Windows. Key releases\n  restart the last active key repeat delay.\n\n- Now using Qt64-NG for the 64 bit Windows builds.\n\n- Initial experiments with vmulti support in the Windows version. Using that\n  driver would allow antimicroX to use a virtual keyboard and mouse rather than\n  using SendInput. That would allow antimicroX to work around UAC problems and\n  anti-cheat programs. Support is not currently compiled into the Windows builds\n  due to not being able to properly distribute the vmulti driver.\n\n- Do not write empty names tag in profiles if no custom button names have been\n  specified.\n\n- Allow mouse history buffer size to go up to 100.\n\n- Allow diagonal range to go up to 90 degrees.\n\n- Remove old mouse speeds from mouse history buffer if stick has been returned\n  to the dead zone. History buffer will be filled with zeroes.\n\n- Omit hotplugging dependent code when compiling against SDL 1.2.\n\n- Fixed dpad pointer bug when certain QueuedConnection slots are executed.\n\n2015-03-31 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.13\n\n- Updated extra axis acceleration routine. Now, extra acceleration is\n  calculated after an axis has stopped moving past the assigned threshold\n  in one gamepad poll.\n\n- Stick presets now change the diagonal range of a stick. This is mainly\n  beneficial for mouse control changes so that 65 degrees is used by default.\n\n- Added a screen selector for Spring mouse mode in settings menu.\n\n- Added a small language selection portion to the settings menu.\n\n- Added a small logger. Please run antimicroX with \"--log-level debug\" in order\n  to get output about button presses.\n\n2015-03-22 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.12.1\n\n- Implemented a small wizard that will be run when antimicroX is launched\n  for the first time. It currently only has a page for editing some of the mouse\n  settings and a page for associating antimicroX with .amgp files on Windows.\n\n- Show slots that are active for a stick modifier button on the main interface.\n  The text for the main stick direction buttons will be prefixed with the\n  currently active slots of the stick modifier button.\n\n- Corrected issue with stick and dpad events not getting activated on a set\n  change. Events were being queued but not executed.\n\n2015-03-15 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.12\n\n- Added option for extra mouse acceleration. Enabling that option will\n  increase the speed of the mouse based on the amount an axis has travelled in one\n  gamepad poll and the set multiplier. This will greatly affect how the mouse\n  behaves and it will make mouse movement looser. Using this feature can be\n  problematic if the analog stick on your controller is worn out and loose.\n\n- Corrected issue with extra mouse sync events occurring when not needed (0,0\n  events). This change seems to have smoothed out mouse movement on the low end\n  of an axis a bit.\n\n- Tweaked controller unplug workaround to still invoke release events for\n  axes and buttons. For triggers, the release value is modified from what is\n  provided by SDL so an unplug event will cause a release event to occur for the\n  triggers.\n\n2015-02-25 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.11.1\n\n- Added workaround to allow gamepad unplugging on Windows to not\n  activate bindings for the triggers. This was caused by the way controller\n  unplugging is handled by SDL (primarily with the Windows version).\n  SDL sends a release value for all elements of an unplugged joystick a brief\n  period before sending the expected SDL_JOYDEVICEREMOVED event. The problem is\n  that the released value used for triggers assumes that the dead zone is half the\n  trigger's full range. This would cause bindings for triggers to usually activate\n  for a brief period before SDL would send the final SDL_JOYDEVICEREMOVED event\n  which would then deactivate those bindings.\n\n- Changes for the portable Windows version. Allow relative profile paths for\n  use in the portable package on Windows. Associate profiles registry change\n  prompt skipped.\n\n- Queue stick and dpad events. Allows for better control of 8-way sticks\n  and dpads.\n\n2015-02-07 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.11\n\n- Adjusted the Enhanced Precision, Easing Quadratic, and Easing Cubic\n  mouse acceleration curves. The low end of each curve has been loosened a bit\n  and the rest of the curves have been adjusted accordingly. Comparing the two\n  versions, the resulting mouse speed for a given axis point is slightly lower\n  in the new versions for most of the curve. The extreme low end and the extreme\n  high end of the curves will be slightly faster.\n\n- Updated Qt to version 5.4.0 for the Windows builds.\n\n- Compiled a 64 bit version for Windows thanks to the Qt-x64 project.\n\n- Added a set changing slot.\n\n- Added AppData for use when packaging on Linux thanks to Jeff Backus.\n\n- Fixed bug with mouse wheel event methods for axes which resulted in negative\n  values being passed to the event timer.\n\n2014-12-29 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.10.1\n\n- Changed event handler fallback method under Linux.\n\n- Changed interface of Assignments page in Advanced Button Dialog.\n\n- Reset set number upon changing profiles.\n\n- Added \"About Development\" tab to About Dialog.\n\n- Fixed dynamic text resizing in Button Edit Dialog under Linux.\n\n- Fixed launching a second instance in order to load a profile in the\n  first instance.\n\n2014-12-10 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.10\n\n- Changed allowed values for easing duration. The minimum value has been\n  lowered to 0.0 and the maximum value has been increased to 5.0.\n\n- Added a stick modifier button. This button is primarily meant to be used\n  to assign walk/run functionality to an analog stick. Instead of having to\n  create distance zones and assign keyboard modifier keys to each stick button,\n  you can now make the assignment on the stick modifier button and it\n  will apply to the stick as a whole. It makes assigning walk/run functionality\n  to an analog stick much less cumbersome. The DreadOut demo has already shown a\n  use case where only the stick modifier button was needed due to the demo not\n  handling running when using the left stick on an Xbox 360 controller.\n\n- Increased idle mouse timer interval to 100 ms.\n\n- Added a load profile slot. You can now tell the program to load a different\n  profile upon pressing a button.\n\n- Added gradient functionality for the high end of the Easing Quadratic and\n  Easing Cubic mouse acceleration curves.\n\n- Raise process priority on Windows. Now, the antimicroX process will run\n  with High priority. This allows internal timers to work better and be less\n  susceptible to the activity of other running programs. On Linux, the priority of\n  the main thread has been increased.\n\n- Take multiple direction buttons into account when assigning set switching\n  to stick buttons.\n\n- If uinput is enabled but not usable at runtime then XTest will be used\n  as a fallback option for the Linux version.\n\n- Tweaked Gradient and Pulse turbo modes to make them a bit tighter. A lower\n  delay will be needed in profiles to achieve a similar control from previous\n  versions. On the plus side, this has been tested to work with FlatOut 2 fairly\n  well. It is good enough to use and actually win some races against AI opponents.\n\n- Added analog control for mouse wheel buttons that are mapped to an axis\n  button.\n\n- Tweaked mouse movement code to improve mouse accuracy. This is mainly due\n  to discovering the QElapsedTimer class that is included in Qt.\n\n- Fixed middle mouse button binding when using the uinput event handler\n  on Linux.\n\n- Fixed memory leaks that were discovered by Valgrind.\n\n2014-11-19 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.9\n\n- Added mouse refresh rate as an option. Please be mindful of how your\n  system behaves if you set the refresh rate to a low value like 1 ms.\n  In the worst case scenario, you could end up dedicating one CPU core on\n  just the antimicroX process. Also, on Windows, you will want to make sure\n  to disable the \"Enhance Pointer Precision\" option if you use a low value\n  otherwise Windows will severely slow down the mouse pointer.\n\n- Added an application level mouse smoothing option. The older button level\n  smoothing option has been removed. The old option didn't do much since it only\n  dealt with the partial distance remainder.\n\n- Button responsiveness has been improved. The old mouse movement code was\n  creating a bottleneck for button processing which would result in a slight\n  delay.\n\n- Changed mouse movement code. The overall mouse movement should be smoother\n  now.\n\n- Allow the Windows setting \"Enhance Pointer Precision\" to be disabled while\n  antimicroX is running. This will make sure Windows does not directly manipulate\n  the mouse events sent to the system. This will allow mouse control on an analog\n  stick to be more accurate on Windows.\n\n- Changes to Auto Profile to allow more variables for matching. Multiple\n  window properties can be specified which will cause antimicroX to count an\n  entry as a match only if all specified properties match.\n\n- Changed how windows are grabbed in X on Linux.\n\n- Minor fix for Gradient and Pulse turbo modes. There were times when the\n  timer interval controlling those modes could be negative and cause problems.\n\n2014-11-05 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.8.1\n\n- Fixed some buttons in virtual keyboard when program is using uinput support.\n\n- Fixed Update Joysticks option for SDL 1.2 users.\n\n2014-10-28 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.8\n\n- Added delay settings for analog sticks and dpads. This is meant to\n  keep some games from overreacting when switching directions quickly.\n  A delay is especially useful for games that utilize a dash on a key double tap.\n  This will also be very useful while playing rougelike games. The new\n  delay setting allows for more responsive controls than the old alternative of\n  using hold zones on individual direction buttons.\n\n- Added two new mouse acceleration curves: Easing Quadratic and\n  Easing Cubic. These new mouse acceleration curves are meant to mimic the\n  camera control that is used for gamepad support in some recent first person\n  shooters such as Borderlands 2. Once a stick direction has reached a threshold\n  (80%) then the mouse speed will gradually accelerate over a period of time\n  before the mouse speed reaches its peak. The duration of the easing method is\n  set at 0.50 seconds by default but the setting is configurable per\n  button.\n\n- Major refactor to mouse event generation. The new routine requires\n  fewer system resources and it is more accurate.\n\n- Made uinput support a runtime option for Linux users. The program can\n  now be compiled with both XTest and uinput support and the event\n  generator can be specified using the --eventgen flag. It defaults\n  to XTest if available. The option is only available when the program\n  is compiled with both XTest and uinput support.\n\n- Added right click context menus for buttons in main interface.\n\n- Fixed issue with Game Controller Mapping dialog. Controller DPads that\n  are exposed as 4 buttons can now be bound to the DPad of an SDL Game\n  Controller.\n\n- Fixed an issue with incorrect profile names being displayed in the\n  profile combobox.\n\n- Fixed issue introduced in version 2.7 regarding mouse movement calculations\n  for the left direction of analog sticks. A major portion of the\n  safe zone for that direction was being skipped.\n\n- Changed button groups in the main interface to update immediately\n  when a stick or dpad mode has been changed.\n\n- Initial removal of old joystick abstraction support in interface when using\n  SDL 2.\n\n2014-10-14 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.7\n\n- Added a UAC workaround for use in Windows. antimicroX can be restarted\n  as Administrator in case a game is running with elevated permissions and\n  the events generated by antimicroX are not detected by a game.\n\n- Added more key aliases for uinput support.\n\n- Force higher dead zones for axes in Game Controller Mapping window.\n\n- Fixed virtual keyboard in Button Edit Dialog window for Linux users\n  utilizing XTest support.\n\n- Display some minor mouse stats in Mouse Settings dialog.\n\n- Alter Analog Stick dialog window to show some new stats. Also,\n  show square stick coordinates as well as adjusted circle\n  stick coordinates.\n\n- Added square stick to circle stick conversion.\n\n- Fixed issue with VK_LSHIFT and VK_RSHIFT aliases not being saved properly\n  on Windows.\n\n- xinput is used for the uinput virtual pointer in order to\n  disable mouse acceleration for the pointer. This allows spring mode to work\n  as intended.\n\n- Added some code to guess which axes of a gamepad should be considered\n  triggers by default while in old Joystick mode. The initial values of\n  axes are taken from SDL and those are used as the point of the axes\n  while centered. If the initial value of an axis is below -30,000 then\n  an axis is considered to be a trigger.\n\n2014-09-16 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.6\n\n- Added two new Turbo modes. Gradient mode is used to change the key press\n  time depending on the position of an axis (useful for racing games).\n  Pulse mode is used to change how many times a key press is invoked depending\n  on the position of an axis (scrolling in a web browser using arrow keys).\n\n- Fixed profile resetting in a couple of places.\n\n- A Russian translation has been provided by Dima Koshel.\n\n- Added option to invoke Game Controller mapping window from command line.\n  The final mapping string will be printed to stdout. This is useful\n  for saving a SDL_GAMECONTROLLERCONFIG for your controller that\n  can be used system wide. Any SDL 2 game can then be set up to use\n  that mapping and it can be changed if needed.\n\n- Profiles now use a unique .amgp file extension. Older xml profiles will\n  continue to be supported.\n\n- Fixed spring mouse mode so that it uses proper axis distance values.\n\n- Set changing has been fixed for analog sticks and virtual dpads.\n\n- EXPERIMENTAL. uinput support has been added to the source code. Binary\n  Linux packages will continue to utilize XTest for event generation for the\n  time being. If you would like to test uinput integration then you will have\n  to compile the program using -DWITH_UINPUT=ON and -DWITH_XTEST=OFF\n  when running cmake. Playing Warsow 1.51 in Linux using antimicroX requires\n  using uinput integration. Also, keys can now be pressed in a tty.\n\n2014-08-01 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.5\n\n- Fixed packaging the Windows version so the program will work on\n  Windows XP again.\n\n- Delay rendering of flashing buttons. This helps improve controller\n  responsiveness when the main window is not hidden.\n\n- Reduced the size of written profiles. Only changed values are\n  now stored in profiles.\n\n- Updated German translation provided by phob and Leonard Koenig.\n\n- Allow a profile to be listed as the final argument on the command line.\n  Ex: antimicroX ~/antimicroX-profiles/profile.xml.\n\n- Added diagonal distance support for distance slots for Standard\n  mode on Sticks and DPads. This was necessary for some modifier assignments\n  to work properly. The best example is for assigning walking in Half-Life 1.\n\n- Allow generated events to be sent to a different X display than the\n  application is running on. This change was mainly done to better work\n  with SteamOS. antimicroX can be run via ssh with X tunneling in order\n  to configure profiles on one system but the program will send events to the\n  X display that is running Steam and games.\n\n- Auto Profile support has improved for SteamOS. Application grabbing can\n  now be done while in the SteamOS BPM Session. Steam BPM can be grabbed as\n  well.\n\n- Only show active or soon to be active slots for buttons in the main\n  window. The text displayed on the buttons will update when a\n  new zone has been reached due to using slots such as distance or hold.\n\n- Allow no profile to be assigned to an application for an Auto Profile entry.\n  This means that the program will choose an empty profile when the application\n  for that Auto Profile entry has focus. This will help with disabling antimicro\n  for applications that already have controller support.\n\n- Controller Mapping dialog now stops processing events until all elements\n  have been released on a controller.\n\n2014-05-30 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.4\n\n- Relative spring mode added.\n\n- Key repeating changes in Windows.\n\n- Updated Windows version to use Qt 5.3.0.\n\n- Set copying added.\n\n- Corrected application checks used for Auto Profile support\n  in Windows.\n\n2014-05-23 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.3.3\n\n- Tweaked Enhanced Precision mouse acceleration curve.\n\n- Tweaked \"all\" option in Auto Profile. No profile assigned to \"all\" now\n  implies that a blank configuration should be loaded.\n\n- Manpage created by Jeff Backus.\n\n- Migrated to the CMake build system.\n\n2014-05-15 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.3.2\n\n- Fixed problem with old profiles not being usable in the\n  program.\n\n2014-05-13 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.3.1\n\n- Added new Enhanced Precision mouse curve. It is now the default\n  mouse curve. The new mouse curve will make the cursor move slowly\n  towards the low end of an axis and the cursor movement will be\n  accelerated towards the high end of an axis.\n\n- Added unsaved profile dialogs.\n\n- Added key repeating behavior under Windows.\n\n- Increased maximum turbo interval.\n\n- Added more options to the Edit Settings dialog.\n\n- Added profile name display editing.\n\n- Fixed invalid pointer issue for Hold events.\n\n2014-05-02 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.3\n\n- Added a daemon mode.\n\n- Added joystick profile compatibility parser for game controllers.\n  Old profiles are now usable when using SDL Game Controller support.\n  Old profiles have to be mapped against the same controller that\n  is connected.\n\n- Added cycle reset support. Sequences with cycles can now get\n  returned to the first cycle zone in a sequence after a period of\n  time.\n\n- Changed Auto Profile support to work properly in SteamOS\n  while running the SteamOS Big Picture Mode session. On many\n  tested games (Duke Nukem 3D, SuperTux, World of Goo), the\n  game had to be run in windowed mode in order for Auto Profile\n  support to be able to detect the application. It is recommended\n  that you run games in windowed mode when using Auto Profile support\n  in the SteamOS BPM session. This is not an issue when running the Steam\n  desktop client in desktop mode.\n\n- Added a delay slot type. A delay slot can be used for\n  key presses in a key combination. Unlike other macro slots, slots\n  placed before a delay slot will remain active after the specified\n  time has passed.\n\n- Added option to allow the program to start on Windows startup.\n\n- Changed dialogs for secondary set buttons to display the set\n  that the button is currently in.\n\n- Changed turbo mode to give more control. Key presses are now given\n  more time to be active. Key presses and releases now run for a\n  duration of t/2 seconds.\n\n- Altered tray menu to display a single list when only one controller\n  is connected. An option has been added to allow for a single\n  list to also be used when multiple controllers are detected.\n\n- Fixed issue with Windows XP Auto Profile workaround.\n  On the plus side, now the program is confirmed to work in\n  Windows XP.\n\n- Fixed issues with Auto Profile support saving and precedence.\n\n2014-04-19 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.2\n\n- Added example controller display to Game Controller Mapping\n  dialog window.\n\n- Added Auto Profile support. Allows for profiles to be associated\n  with specific applications.\n\n- Added button icons in Windows version.\n\n- Added a press time slot type. That slot type is used\n  to have keys active for a specific period of time.\n\n- Allow Pause slots to have a 0 second interval. Allows\n  for a forced key release.\n\n- Windows version is now built with SDL 2.0.3.\n\n- Fixed 8-Way D-Pad mode.\n\n- Fixed preset options in various dialogs to account for new aliases.\n\n- Fixed ampersand rendering in set buttons.\n\n- Fixed spring mouse mode dimension support.\n\n- Fixed spring mouse mode accuracy under Windows.\n\n2014-02-28 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.1\n\n- Added new stick and dpad modes.\n\n- Added set names.\n\n- Minor fixes for Windows.\n\n- Fixed QSettings usage to reduce reads and write to config file.\n\n2014-02-10 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.0.1\n\n- Active keyboard keys now use a reference count. This will\n  be useful for keeping modifier keys held when moving a stick\n  from a diagonal direction to a cardinal direction. This will allow a run\n  to be maintained properly.\n\n- A release delay has been added to release slot events. This is needed\n  for some games where a key press and release might happen too quickly\n  for a game, such as The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, to catch it.\n\n- Altered data sent to SendInput under Windows. The change should allow\n  games that rely exclusively on scancode data to detect keyboard\n  key presses now. Previously, keyboard emulation would not work\n  while playing The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion on Windows.\n\n- Improved key associations under Windows. VK*OEM*\\* keys associations\n  are now generated at runtime which will allow associations\n  to be more layout independent.\n\n- Changed some portions of the Windows version so that the Numpad\n  Enter key can be emulated.\n\n- The recent profile list is now updated when a profile is added\n  or removed from the list as opposed to when the program is closed.\n  This allows the list to be in sync while utilizing hotplugging.\n\n2014-01-04 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 2.0\n\n- Migrated profiles to use Qt key values as opposed to using native key code\n  values. Allows for better cross-platform compatibility. Current\n  joystick profiles will be migrated when first loaded by the program.\n\n- Program can now be compiled against SDL 2.\n\n- The Game Controller API provided by SDL 2 has been integrated into the\n  application. The API is used to abstract various gamepads to a unified\n  standard. Profiles made against the Game Controller API can be used with\n  any controller that is supported. Unsupported controllers will have to be\n  mapped in the program.\n\n- A simple Game Controller mapping window has been made so people that are using\n  an unsupported controller can map that controller so that it can be used with\n  the Game Controller API. Any saved mapping string will be loaded into\n  SDL when antimicro is first launched or when you select the\n  \"Update Joysticks\" option in the main window.\n\n- Any new saved profile will include the device type that it is\n  associated with in the filename. Joysticks and game controllers use slightly\n  different file specifications.\n\n- Joystick hotplugging support has been added thanks to SDL 2.\n\n- On Windows, XInput support is now available. This allows the Xbox 360\n  controller guide button to be usable and both gamepad triggers can be used at\n  the same time. Previously, only DirectInput was being used so both triggers were\n  being mapped to one axis so they would negate each other if used at the same\n  time. This problem would really affect people trying to play Call of Duty with a\n  360 controller when the \"Hold Aim Down the Sight\" option is enabled in the game.\n\n- The list of recent profiles is now tied to a joystick GUID or joystick name\n  if the GUID is not available (compiled against SDL 1.2).\n\n- Program options window has been made. For right now, it is only being used to\n  allow users to be able to disable Game Controller integration for specific\n  controllers.\n\n- Mouse events are queued before a mouse event is sent to the system. This\n  allows for smoother diagonal mouse movement. This really helped improve camera\n  control for me in Warsow.\n\n- Key checker dialog has been made so you can check the alias values that are\n  being used for keyboard keys. This is mainly for debugging purposes. If you\n  find that a keyboard key that you use does not have a built-in alias, please\n  let me know so an alias can be added. Although, the key can still be used in\n  the program and saved to a profile. The major downside is that a profile\n  that uses an unsupported key will not be cross-platform compatible.\n\n2013-12-13 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 1.2\n\n- Improved while held set changing so that the program should not get stuck on\n  the wrong set. The changes made should behave roughly like the old while held\n  workaround that used turbo.\n\n- Windows port of antimicro has been made.\n\n- Tweaked code used for button presses and releases in order\n  to improve responsiveness.\n\n- Allow time-dependent action slots to have an interval\n  as low as 0.01 seconds.\n\n- Tweaked Release action slot. Release slots can now be placed at the\n  beginning of the assigned slots. This can be useful for\n  Tap and Hold slot configurations.\n\n- Pause slots can now be used with Release slots.\n\n- Profiles can be removed from the recent configs list.\n\n- Spring mouse mode preview has now been enabled.\n\n- Mouse speed modifier action slot has been added. This can be used to modify\n  the mouse speed settings used with any controller element while the slot is\n  active. The setting will modify the mouse speed by the percentage that is\n  specified. The mouse speed modifier can be used to allow for the mouse speed\n  to be slowed down while sniping.\n\n- Button and action names have been added. Names can be used to describe\n  the action that a slot sequence performs in the game.\n\n- Mouse wheel buttons are now used as a form of mouse movement. Mouse wheel\n  scrolling is now possible without using turbo. The speed that the wheel is\n  rotated can be specified in the mouse settings dialog window.\n\n- Added support for two extra mouse buttons.\n\n- A new controller properties window has been made. This window shows various\n  bits of information provided by SDL about a controller as well as the current\n  values of all the controller elements.\n\n- Added quick assign functionality for sticks and virtual dpads.\n\n- Windows version of the program now uses LocalAppData variable to know\n  where to place the program's settings file.\n\n- New translations provided by the translation team.\n\n2013-10-03 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 1.1\n\n- Added spring mouse mode. This mode is used to move the mouse cursor\n  from the center of the screen based on how much an axis has been moved\n  from the dead zone. The mouse cursor will be returned to the center\n  of the screen when the axis is released.\n\n- Added mouse curve options from QJoyPad.\n\n- Tweaked mouse movement in cursor mode to improve axis responsiveness\n  and to allow mouse movement to be less jittery.\n\n- Added optional mouse smoothing for a further reduction\n  in jitter in exchange for slightly delayed responsiveness.\n\n- Moved various mouse settings into a new dialog window.\n  Several other dialog windows have been changed to point to the\n  new dialog window to allow for mouse setting adjustments.\n\n- Added an option to start the program hidden.\n\n- Tray menu has been tweaked to allow configuration profiles to be\n  disabled. A blank new profile will be enabled in the program\n  for a controller. This is equivalent to selecting <New> in the main window\n  combobox.\n\n- Serbian translation provided by Jay Alexander Fleming.\n\n- Brazilian Portuguese translation provided by VaGNaroK.\n\n2013-07-12 Travis Nickles <nickles.travis@gmail.com>\n\nVersion 1.0\n\n- 8-way controls have been implemented. This allows keys to be mapped\n  to the diagonal directions of controller sticks and dpads. 8-way controls\n  allow rougelike games to be playable.\n\n- Virtual Dpad support has been added. Axes and buttons can be mapped\n  to a virtual dpad. This is useful for mapping dpads that are detected as a\n  pair of axes in SDL.\n\n- A Quick Set option has been added. Using the Quick Set option, you\n  can press a button on the controller and the program will bring up the edit\n  window for that specific button. The button can then be mapped to an\n  assignment from the edit window. The Quick Set option also works for axes,\n  controller sticks, and dpads. This is more of a convenience function than\n  anything but I have found it really useful since implementing it.\n\n- Main interface button text is now updated whenever the assigned slots\n  are changed. This allows the buttons' text to be in sync in many situations\n  that was not possible before.\n\n- Toggle and Turbo can be used together to create automated key macros for\n  use in MMORPGs.\n\n\\* _This Changelog was automatically generated by [github_changelog_generator](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator)_\n"

          "content": "                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

          "content": "Profile Tips\n============\n\n## Sticks\n\n### Dead Zones\n\nThe XInput standard of 8,000 will typically be used in profiles for analog\nsticks. For an Xbox 360 controller, that value tends to be the best minimum\nvalue to ensure that no unintentional events are produced due to what position\na stick will be centered at.\n\nWhen using a different controller, you will likely want to play with the value\nof the dead zone used for the analog sticks and find what works best for\nyour controller. As an example, when I make profiles for my Logitech F310\ngamepad, I find that using a dead zone value of 2,000 for the analog sticks\nworks best.\n\n### Left Stick (Keyboard)\n\nThe default diagonal range of 45 degrees is recommended when mapping keyboard\nkeys to an analog stick when using the **standard** stick mode. If only one\naction should ever occur at a time and the diagonal direction doesn't matter as\nmuch, you might want to look into **4-way cardinal** stick mode. That can be\nuseful for navigating menus or mapping weapon hotkeys to an analog stick.\n\nSome games will overreact when mapping WASD or other keyboard keys to an\nanalog stick. This is mainly due to how quickly directions can be changed\nespecially if you have the stick positioned right around where a diagonal zone\nresides. If you encounter problems in game or you just want to make movement a\nlittle more definitive, you can adjust the **stick delay** value used for that\nstick. That will cause direction changes to be slightly delayed. Even setting\nthe value to 0.01 seconds can greatly increase control in some games.\n\n### Right Stick (Mouse)\n\nTo allow for better mouse control with an analog stick, it is recommended\nthat you use a diagonal range of at least 65 degrees instead of the\nnormal 45 degree value. If you want more twitchy mouse control, you will\nlikely want to set the diagonal range of the stick to 89 degrees or 90 degrees.\nThis will minimize the range used for the absolute cardinal directions.\n\nAnother tip that will allow for more twitchy mouse control is related\nto the dead zone used for the analog stick. Decreasing the value used for\nthe stick dead zone can help make mouse control feel more responsive than\nwhen using the standard value of 8,000 even when using an Xbox 360 controller.\n\nBased on my experience, even decreasing the value to 6,000 can make a\nhuge difference. The big compromise is that there might be some mouse\ncursor drift if the analog stick does not center back to the assigned dead\nzone. On my Xbox 360 controller, I find that the stick can get stuck slightly\nin the southwest region of the stick; the other directions don't have this\nissue. However, the mouse cursor drift is very minimal and you can easily\ncompensate while playing a game. It doesn't hinder gameplay and the benefit\nobtained far outweights the minor problem.\n\nOne final thing that you can do to make mouse movement more twitchy is to\nenable extra acceleration for mouse events. Changing the **extra duration** of\nacceleration will have the biggest impact on mouse movement. Increasing the\nmaximum extra duration of the acceleration will loosen the mouse movement.\nChanging the **multiplier** is another option that will change how mouse\nmovement behaves. One final option that can be changed is to use a different\ncurve for extra acceleration. **Linear** is still the default setting since it\nwas the only option available for many versions but I find myself using\n**Ease Out Quad** lately. Besides altering the final multiplier used, it also\nchanges the final duration experienced.\n\nWith all the options available for extra acceleration, you will have an easier\ntime performing a quick 180 degree turn while still having precision on the low\nend of a stick for aiming at targets.\n\n## Action Names\n\nIt is generally recommended that you specify action names when making profiles\nthat you will share with other people. This will allow other people to more\neasily decipher what buttons are used for in a profile. Specifying action names\ncan also be a helpful reminder for yourself in order to document a more complex\naction.\n"

[Support](#support)  \n\n## Description\n\nAntiMicroX is a graphical program used to map gamepad keys to keyboard, mouse, scripts and macros. You can use this program to control any desktop application with a gamepad on Linux🐧 and Windows 🪟.  \nIt can be also used for generating SDL2 configuration (useful for mapping atypical gamepads to generic ones like xbox360).\n\nWe support X.org and Wayland.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Mapping of gamepads/joystick buttons to:\n  - keyboard buttons\n  - mouse buttons and moves\n  - scripts and executables\n  - macros consisting of elements mentioned above\n- Assigning multiple switchable sets of mappings to gamepad.\n- Auto profiles - assign profile to active application window (not in Wayland [note](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/issues/303)).\n\nThis program is currently supported under various Linux\ndistributions.\n\nThis application is continuation of project called `AntiMicro`, which was later abandoned and revived by juliagoda.\n\nLegacy repositories:\n- First AntiMicroX repository: https://github.com/juliagoda/antimicroX\n- Second, maintained by organization: https://github.com/AntiMicro/antimicro\n- First, original AntiMicro repository: https://github.com/Ryochan7/antimicro\n\n**Screenshots:**  \nDisclaimer: Theme may depend on your system configuration.\n\n<table border=\"0px\" >\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <img src=\"./other/appdata/screenshots/app_light.png\" alt=\"Main Window\" />\n    </td>\n    <td>\n      <img src=\"./other/appdata/screenshots/controllermapping.png\" alt=\"Mapping\" />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>\n      <img src=\"./other/appdata/screenshots/calibration.png\" alt=\"Calibration\" />\n    </td>\n    <td>\n    <img src=\"./other/appdata/screenshots/advanced.png\" alt=\"Advanced settings\" />\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n\n## License\n\nThis program is licensed under the GPL v.3. Please read the LICENSE text document\nincluded with the source code if you would like to read the terms of the license.\nThe license can also be found online at\nhttp://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt\n\n## Installation\n\n### Windows\n\nJust download `antimicrox-X.X.X-AMD64.exe` from [Release site](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/releases/latest) and install it.\n\n### Flatpak\n\nThe flatpak version is distributed on Flathub, and runs on most major Linux distributions. See instructions here: [Flathub application page](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox)\n\nIf you have Flathub [set up](https://flatpak.org/setup/) already:\n\n```bash\nflatpak install flathub io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox\n```\n\n❕ Flatpak package may not work correctly with wayland [(Fix available here)](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/wiki/Open-uinput-error)\n\n### AppImage\n\nDownload from the [release site](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/releases).\n\nIt is recommended to use [AppImageLauncher](https://github.com/TheAssassin/AppImageLauncher) with this package.\n\n### Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions\n\nDownload from the [release site](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/releases) and install `.deb` package.\n\n### Fedora\n\n```\ndnf install antimicrox\n```\n\n### openSUSE\n\nA [package](https://software.opensuse.org/package/antimicrox) is available.\n\n```\nzypper install antimicrox\n```\n\n### Arch Linux or Arch Linux based distributions:\n\n```\ntrizen -S antimicrox\n```\n**or**\n\npre-built version can de downloaded from unofficial repository called [chaotic-aur](https://lonewolf.pedrohlc.com/chaotic-aur/).\n\nAppend (one of listed mirrors) to `/etc/pacman.conf`:\n```bash\n# Brazil\nServer = http://lonewolf-builder.duckdns.org/$repo/$arch\n# Germany\nServer = http://chaotic.bangl.de/$repo/$arch\n# USA (Cloudflare cached)\nServer = https://repo.kitsuna.net/$arch\n# Netherlands\nServer = https://chaotic.tn.dedyn.io/$arch\n```\nTo check signature, add keys:\n```bash\nsudo pacman-key --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com -r 3056513887B78AEB 8A9E14A07010F7E3\nsudo pacman-key --lsign-key 3056513887B78AEB\nsudo pacman-key --lsign-key 8A9E14A07010F7E3\n```\nInstall package\n```bash\npacman -S antimicrox\n```\n\n### Building Yourself\n\nList of required dependencies and build instructions can be found [here](./BUILDING.md).\n\n### Packages status\n\nStatus of package `antimicrox`:  \n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/antimicrox.svg?columns=3&minversion=3.1)](https://repology.org/project/antimicrox/versions)\n\n## Command Line\n\nRun `antimicrox --help` or read `man antimicrox` for command-line parameters.\n\n<details>\n  <summary>Commandline for flatpak</summary>\n  In case of flatpak package AntiMicroX can be launched with command:\n  <br>\n  <code>flatpak run io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox</code> instead of just <code>antimicrox</code>\n  <br>\n  In some cases it may be good to add alias\n  <br>\n  <code>alias antimicrox='flatpak run io.github.antimicrox.antimicrox'</code><br>\n  fo file <code>~/.bashrc</code>\n</details>\n\n## Wiki\n\n[Look here](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox/wiki)\n\n## Testing Under Linux\n\nIf you are having problems with antimicrox detecting a controller or\ndetecting all axes and buttons, you should test the controller outside of\nantimicrox to check if the problem is with antimicrox or not. The two endorsed\nprograms for testing gamepads outside of antimicrox are **sdl-jstest**\n(**sdl2-jstest**) and **evtest**. SDL2 utilizes evdev on Linux so performing\ntesting with older programs that use joydev won't be as helpful since some\ndevices behave a bit differently between the two systems. Another method also exists, \nwhich can be found [here](https://github.com/juliagoda/SDL_JoystickButtonNames).\n\n## AntiMicroX Profiles\n\nIf you would like to send the profile you are using for your application or find something \nfor yourself, [here](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox-profiles) is the forked repository. If you want to report a bug, ask \na question or share a suggestion, you can do that on the antimicrox page or on the\n[antimicrox-profiles](https://github.com/AntiMicroX/antimicrox-profiles) page.\n\n## Support\n\nThere are several ways to get help with AntiMicroX. The easiest way is to upvote (with 👍) issues you thing are the most important ones. It is also possible to fund some issues using [Polar](https://polar.sh) platform to attract contributors.\n\n### Contributing\n\nAny contributions into codebase are welcome. You can find contribution guide [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md).  \nSome issues are may have bounties which are meant to attract contributors.\n\n### Translation\n\nTranslation process is handled via [Weblate](https://weblate.org/).
