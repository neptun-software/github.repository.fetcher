An\nindependent module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify this library, you must extend this\nexception to your version of the library.\n\nNote: this exception relieves you of any obligations under sections 4 and 5 of this license, and section 6 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n\nTerms of the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 with Special Exception:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 3, 29 June 2007\n\nCopyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nThis version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.\n\n0. Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, âthis Licenseâ refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the âGNU GPLâ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\nâThe Libraryâ refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn âApplicationâ is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA âCombined Workâ is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the âLinked Versionâ.\n\nThe âMinimal Corresponding Sourceâ for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe âCorresponding Application Codeâ for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\n\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nd) Do one of the following:\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License âor any later versionâ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n*********************************************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*********************************************************************************************************************************\nSoftware Licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.

All rights reserved.\n\n\nTerms of NVIDIA Software License Agreement and CUDA Supplement to Software License Agreement\n---------------------------------------------------\nTerms of License Agreement for NVIDIA Software Development Kits\n\nRelease Date: May 21, 2019\nImportant NoticeâRead before downloading, installing, copying or using the licensed software:\nThis license agreement, including exhibits attached (\"Agreementâ) is a legal agreement between you and NVIDIA Corporation (\"NVIDIA\") and governs your use of a NVIDIA software development kit (âSDKâ).\n\nEach SDK has its own set of software and materials, but here is a description of the types of items that may be included in a SDK: source code, header files, APIs, data sets and assets (examples include images, textures, models, scenes, videos, native API input/output files), binary software, sample code, libraries, utility programs, programming code and documentation.\n\nThis Agreement can be accepted only by an adult of legal age of majority in the country in which the SDK is used.\n\nIf you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind the entity to this Agreement, in which case âyouâ will mean the entity you represent.\n\nIf you donât have the required age or authority to accept this Agreement, or if you donât accept all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, do not download, install or use the SDK.\n\nYou agree to use the SDK only for purposes that are permitted by (a) this Agreement, and (b) any applicable law, regulation or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions.\n\n1.1. License\n1.1.1. License Grant\nSubject to the terms of this Agreement, NVIDIA hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable license, without the right to sublicense (except as expressly provided in this Agreement) to:\n\nInstall and use the SDK,\nModify and create derivative works of sample source code delivered in the SDK, and\nDistribute those portions of the SDK that are identified in this Agreement as distributable, as incorporated in object code format into a software application that meets the distribution requirements indicated in this Agreement.\n1.1.2. Distribution Requirements\nThese are the distribution requirements for you to exercise the distribution grant:\nYour application must have material additional functionality, beyond the included portions of the SDK.\nThe distributable portions of the SDK shall only be accessed by your application.\nThe following notice shall be included in modifications and derivative works of sample source code distributed: âThis software contains source code provided by NVIDIA Corporation.â\nUnless a developer tool is identified in this Agreement as distributable, it is delivered for your internal use only.\nThe terms under which you distribute your application must be consistent with the terms of this Agreement, including (without limitation) terms relating to the license grant and license restrictions and protection of NVIDIAâs intellectual property rights. Additionally, you agree that you will protect the privacy, security and legal rights of your application users.\nYou agree to notify NVIDIA in writing of any known or suspected distribution or use of the SDK not in compliance with the requirements of this Agreement, and to enforce the terms of your agreements with respect to distributed SDK.\n1.1.3. Authorized Users\nYou may allow employees and contractors of your entity or of your subsidiary(ies) to access and use the SDK from your secure network to perform work on your behalf.\n\nIf you are an academic institution you may allow users enrolled or employed by the academic institution to access and use the SDK from your secure network.\n\nYou are responsible for the compliance with the terms of this Agreement by your authorized users. If you become aware that your authorized users didnât follow the terms of this Agreement, you agree to take reasonable steps to resolve the non-compliance and prevent new occurrences.\n\n1.1.4. Pre-Release SDK\nThe SDK versions identified as alpha, beta, preview or otherwise as pre-release, may not be fully functional, may contain errors or design flaws, and may have reduced or different security, privacy, accessibility, availability, and reliability standards relative to commercial versions of NVIDIA software and materials. Use of a pre-release SDK may result in unexpected results, loss of data, project delays or other unpredictable damage or loss.\n\nYou may use a pre-release SDK at your own risk, understanding that pre-release SDKs are not intended for use in production or business-critical systems.\n\nNVIDIA may choose not to make available a commercial version of any pre-release SDK. NVIDIA may also choose to abandon development and terminate the availability of a pre-release SDK at any time without liability.\n\n1.1.5. Updates\nNVIDIA may, at its option, make available patches, workarounds or other updates to this SDK. Unless the updates are provided with their separate governing terms, they are deemed part of the SDK licensed to you as provided in this Agreement. You agree that the form and content of the SDK that NVIDIA provides may change without prior notice to you. While NVIDIA generally maintains compatibility between versions, NVIDIA may in some cases make changes that introduce incompatibilities in future versions of the SDK.\n\n1.1.6. Third Party Licenses\nThe SDK may come bundled with, or otherwise include or be distributed with, third party software licensed by a NVIDIA supplier and/or open source software provided under an open source license. Use of third party software is subject to the third-party license terms, or in the absence of third party terms, the terms of this Agreement.

Limitations\nThe following license limitations apply to your use of the SDK:\nYou may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble, or remove copyright or other proprietary notices from any portion of the SDK or copies of the SDK.\nExcept as expressly provided in this Agreement, you may not copy, sell, rent, sublicense, transfer, distribute, modify, or create derivative works of any portion of the SDK. For clarity, you may not distribute or sublicense the SDK as a stand-alone product.\nUnless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not indicate that an application created with the SDK is sponsored or endorsed by NVIDIA.\nYou may not bypass, disable, or circumvent any encryption, security, digital rights management or authentication mechanism in the SDK.\nYou may not use the SDK in any manner that would cause it to become subject to an open source software license. As examples, licenses that require as a condition of use, modification, and/or distribution that the SDK be:\nDisclosed or distributed in source code form;\nLicensed for the purpose of making derivative works; or\nRedistributable at no charge.\nUnless you have an agreement with NVIDIA for this purpose, you may not use the SDK with any system or application where the use or failure of the system or application can reasonably be expected to threaten or result in personal injury, death, or catastrophic loss. Examples include use in nuclear, avionics, navigation, military, medical, life support or other life critical applications. NVIDIA does not design, test or manufacture the SDK for these critical uses and NVIDIA shall not be liable to you or any third party, in whole or in part, for any claims or damages arising from such uses.\nYou agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless NVIDIA and its affiliates, and their respective employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, fines, restitutions and expenses (including but not limited to attorneyâs fees and costs incident to establishing the right of indemnification) arising out of or related to your use of the SDK outside of the scope of this Agreement, or not in compliance with its terms.\n\n1.3. Ownership\nNVIDIA or its licensors hold all rights, title and interest in and to the SDK and its modifications and derivative works, including their respective intellectual property rights, subject to your rights described in this section. This SDK may include software and materials from NVIDIAâs licensors, and these licensors are intended third party beneficiaries that may enforce this Agreement with respect to their intellectual property rights.\nYou hold all rights, title and interest in and to your applications and your derivative works of the sample source code delivered in the SDK, including their respective intellectual property rights, subject to NVIDIAâs rights described in this section.\nYou may, but donât have to, provide to NVIDIA suggestions, feature requests or other feedback regarding the SDK, including possible enhancements or modifications to the SDK. For any feedback that you voluntarily provide, you hereby grant NVIDIA and its affiliates a perpetual, non-exclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, license, sublicense (through multiple tiers of sublicensees), and distribute (through multiple tiers of distributors) it without the payment of any royalties or fees to you. NVIDIA will use feedback at its choice. NVIDIA is constantly looking for ways to improve its products, so you may send feedback to NVIDIA through the developer portal at https://developer.nvidia.com.\n\n1.4. No Warranties\nTHE SDK IS PROVIDED BY NVIDIA âAS ISâ AND âWITH ALL FAULTS.â TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF ANY DEFECTS THEREIN, WHETHER LATENT OR PATENT. NO WARRANTY IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF TRADE USAGE, COURSE OF DEALING OR COURSE OF TRADE.\n\n1.5. Limitation of Liability\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, NVIDIA AND ITS AFFILIATES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF DATA OR LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR THE COSTS OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE PRODUCTS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SDK, WHETHER SUCH LIABILITY ARISES FROM ANY CLAIM BASED UPON BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIAâS AND ITS AFFILIATES TOTAL CUMULATIVE LIABILITY UNDER OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED US$10.00. THE NATURE OF THE LIABILITY OR THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS OR SUITS SHALL NOT ENLARGE OR EXTEND THIS LIMIT.\n\nThese exclusions and limitations of liability shall apply regardless if NVIDIA or its affiliates have been advised of the possibility of such damages, and regardless of whether a remedy fails its essential purpose. These exclusions and limitations of liability form an essential basis of the bargain between the parties, and, absent any of these exclusions or limitations of liability, the provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, the economic terms, would be substantially different.\n\n1.6. Termination\nThis Agreement will continue to apply until terminated by either you or NVIDIA as described below.\nIf you want to terminate this Agreement, you may do so by stopping to use the SDK.\nNVIDIA may, at any time, terminate this Agreement if:\n(i) you fail to comply with any term of this Agreement and the non-compliance is not fixed within thirty (30) days following notice from NVIDIA (or immediately if you violate NVIDIAâs intellectual property rights);\n(ii) you commence or participate in any legal proceeding against NVIDIA with respect to the SDK; or\n(iii) NVIDIA decides to no longer provide the SDK in a country or, in NVIDIAâs sole discretion, the continued use of it is no longer commercially viable.\nUpon any termination of this Agreement, you agree to promptly discontinue use of the SDK and destroy all copies in your possession or control. Your prior distributions in accordance with this Agreement are not affected by the termination of this Agreement. Upon written request, you will certify in writing that you have complied with your commitments under this section. Upon any termination of this Agreement all provisions survive except for the license grant provisions.\n\n1.7. General\nIf you wish to assign this Agreement or your rights and obligations, including by merger, consolidation, dissolution or operation of law, contact NVIDIA to ask for permission. Any attempted assignment not approved by NVIDIA in writing shall be void and of no effect. NVIDIA may assign, delegate or transfer this Agreement and its rights and obligations, and if to a non-affiliate you will be notified.\n\nYou agree to cooperate with NVIDIA and provide reasonably requested information to verify your compliance with this Agreement.\n\nThis Agreement will be governed in all respects by the laws of the United States and of the State of Delaware as those laws are applied to contracts entered into and performed entirely within Delaware by Delaware residents, without regard to the conflicts of laws principles. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is specifically disclaimed. You agree to all terms of this Agreement in the English language.\n\nThe state or federal courts residing in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute or claim arising out of this Agreement. Notwithstanding this, you agree that NVIDIA shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies or an equivalent type of urgent legal relief in any jurisdiction.\n\nIf any court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be construed as limited to the extent necessary to be consistent with and fully enforceable under the law and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Unless otherwise specified, remedies are cumulative.\n\nEach party acknowledges and agrees that the other is an independent contractor in the performance of this Agreement.\n\nThe SDK has been developed entirely at private expense and is âcommercial itemsâ consisting of âcommercial computer softwareâ and âcommercial computer software documentationâ provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS.

Additional Definitions.\n\nAs used herein, âthis Licenseâ refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the âGNU GPLâ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\nâThe Libraryâ refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\nAn âApplicationâ is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.\n\nA âCombined Workâ is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the âLinked Versionâ.\n\nThe âMinimal Corresponding Sourceâ for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\nThe âCorresponding Application Codeâ for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\nYou may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\nIf you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:\n\na) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\nb) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.\n\n3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\nThe object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n4. Combined Works.\n\nYou may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:\n\na) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.\nb) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nc) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\nd) Do one of the following:\n0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.\n1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.\ne) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n5. Combined Libraries.\n\nYou may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\nThe Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License âor any later versionâ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\nIf the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.\n*********************************************************************************************************************************\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*********************************************************************************************************************************\nSoftware Licensed under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License:\n1.

This license is for your protection as a Contributor as well as the protection of MegEngine and its users; it does not change your rights to use your own Contributions for any other purpose.\n\nThis Agreement allows an individual or an entity to submit Contributions to MegEngine, to authorize Contributions submitted by its designated employees to MegEngine, and to grant copyright and patent licenses.\n\nthereto. You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to MegEngine. Except for the license granted herein to MegEngine and recipients of software distributed by MegEngine, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.\n\n1. **Definitions**. \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with MegEngine. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.\nFor the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\"Contribution\" shall mean the code, documentation or any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to MegEngine for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by MegEngine (the \"Work\").\nFor the purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to MegEngine or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, MegEngine for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n2. **Grant of Copyright License**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to MegEngine and to recipients of software distributed by MegEngine a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.\n\n3. **Grant of Patent License**. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to MegEngine and to recipients of software distributed by MegEngine a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a crossclaim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity under this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n4. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above license. If You are an entity, You represent further that each of Your employee designated by You is authorized to submit Contributions on behalf of You. If You are an individual and Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent further that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to MegEngine, or that Your employer has executed a separate CLA with MegEngine.\n\n5. If you do post content or submit material on MegEngine and unless we indicate otherwise, you grant MegEngine a nonexclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, and fully sublicensable right to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, perform, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such content throughout the world in any media. You grant MegEngine and sublicensees the right to use your GitHub Public Profile, including but not limited to name, that you submit in connection with such content. You represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content that you post; that the content is accurate; that use of the content you supply does not violate this policy and will not cause injury to any person or entity; and that you will indemnify MegEngine for all claims resulting from content you supply. MegEngine has the right but not the obligation to monitor and edit or remove any activity or content. MegEngine takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.\n\n6. You represent that each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. Should You wish to submit work that is not Your original creation, You may submit it to MegEngine separately from any Contribution, identifying the complete details of its source and of any license or other restriction (including, but not limited to, related patents, trademarks, and license agreements) of which You are personally aware, and conspicuously marking the work as \"Submitted on behalf of a third party: [named here]\".\n\n7. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\n\n8. You agree to notify MegEngine of any facts or circumstances of which You become aware that would make these representations inaccurate in any respect.\n\n9. This the effective date of this Contributor License Agreement is 2020/3/23. MegEngine reserves the right to update or change this Agreement at any time, by posting the most current version of the Agreement on MegEngine, with a new effective date. All such changes in the Agreement are effective from the effective date. Your continued use of MegEngine after we post any such changes signifies your agreement to those changes. If you do not agree to the then-current Agreement, you must immediately discontinue using MegEngine.\n\n"
