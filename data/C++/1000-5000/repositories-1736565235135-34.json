Go to our\n[landing page][] to browse our documentation and see some examples.\n\nLiquidFun is an extension of [Box2D][]. It adds a particle based fluid and soft\nbody simulation to the rigid body functionality of [Box2D][]. LiquidFun can be\nbuilt for many different systems, including Android, iOS, Windows, OS X, Linux,\nand JavaScript. Please see `Box2D/Documentation/Building/` for details.\n\nDiscuss LiquidFun with other developers and users on the\n[LiquidFun Google Group][]. File issues on the [LiquidFun Issues Tracker][]\nor post your questions to [stackoverflow.com][] with a mention of\n**liquidfun**.\n\nPlease see [Box2D/Documentation/Building/][] to learn how to build LiquidFun and\nrun the testbed.\n\nLiquidFun has a logo that you can use, in your splash screens or documentation,\nfor example. Please see the [Programmer's Guide][] for the graphics and further\ndetails.\n\nFor applications on Google Play that integrate this tool, usage is tracked.\nThis tracking is done automatically using the embedded version string\n(`b2_liquidFunVersionString`), and helps us continue to optimize it. Aside from\nconsuming a few extra bytes in your application binary, it shouldn't affect\nyour application at all. We use this information to let us know if LiquidFun\nis useful and if we should continue to invest in it. Since this is open\nsource, you are free to remove the version string but we would appreciate if\nyou would leave it in.\n\n  [LiquidFun Google Group]: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/liquidfun\n  [LiquidFun Issues Tracker]: http://github.com/google/liquidfun/issues\n  [stackoverflow.com]: http://www.stackoverflow.com\n  [landing page]: http://google.github.io/liquidfun\n  [1.1.0]: http://google.github.io/liquidfun/ReleaseNotes.html\n  [Box2D]: http://box2d.org\n  [Box2D/Documentation/Building/]: http://google.github.io/liquidfun/Building.html\n  [Programmer's Guide]: http://google.github.io/liquidfun/Programmers-Guide.html\n"
