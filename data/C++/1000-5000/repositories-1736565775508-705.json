now available on [cortex-nightly](#beta--nightly-versions):\n- Engines Management (install specific llama-cpp version and variants)\n- Nvidia Hardware detection & activation (current: Nvidia, future: AMD, Intel, Qualcomm)\n- Cortex's roadmap is to implement the full OpenAI API including Tools, Runs, Multi-modal and Realtime APIs.\n\n## Local Installation\n\nCortex has an Local Installer that packages all required dependencies, so that no internet connection is required during the installation process.\n\nCortex also has a [Network Installer](#network-installer) which downloads the necessary dependencies from the internet during the installation.\n\n<h4> \n  <img src='https://github.com/janhq/docs/blob/main/static/img/windows.png' style=\"height:15px;

Clone the Cortex.cpp repository [here](https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp).\n2. Navigate to the `engine` folder.\n3. Configure the vpkg:\n\n```bash\ncd vcpkg\n./bootstrap-vcpkg.bat\nvcpkg install\n```\n\n4. Build the Cortex.cpp inside the `engine/build` folder:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path_to_vcpkg_folder_in_cortex_repo/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-static\ncmake --build . --config Release\n```\n\n5. Verify that Cortex.cpp is installed correctly by getting help information.\n\n```sh\ncortex -h\n```\n\n#### MacOS\n\n1. Clone the Cortex.cpp repository [here](https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp).\n2. Navigate to the `engine` folder.\n3. Configure the vpkg:\n\n```bash\ncd vcpkg\n./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\nvcpkg install\n```\n\n4. Build the Cortex.cpp inside the `engine/build` folder:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake .. -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path_to_vcpkg_folder_in_cortex_repo/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake\nmake -j4\n```\n\n5. Verify that Cortex.cpp is installed correctly by getting help information.\n\n```sh\ncortex -h\n```\n\n#### Linux\n\n1. Clone the Cortex.cpp repository [here](https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp).\n2. Navigate to the `engine` folder.\n3. Configure the vpkg:\n\n```bash\ncd vcpkg\n./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\nvcpkg install\n```\n\n4.

Verify that Cortex.cpp is installed correctly by getting help information.\n\n```sh\ncortex -h\n```\n\n## Uninstallation\n\n### Windows\n\n1. Open the Windows Control Panel.\n2. Navigate to `Add or Remove Programs`.\n3. Search for `cortexcpp` and double click to uninstall. (for beta and nightly builds, search for `cortexcpp-beta` and `cortexcpp-nightly` respectively)\n\n### MacOs\n\nRun the uninstaller script:\n\n```bash\nsudo sh cortex-uninstall.sh\n```\n\nFor MacOS, there is a uninstaller script comes with the binary and added to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory. The script is named `cortex-uninstall.sh` for stable builds, `cortex-beta-uninstall.sh` for beta builds and `cortex-nightly-uninstall.sh` for nightly builds.\n\n### Linux\n\n```bash\nsudo apt remove cortexcpp\n```\n\n## Contact Support\n\n- For support, please file a [GitHub ticket](https://github.com/janhq/cortex.cpp/issues/new/choose).\n- For questions, join our Discord [here](https://discord.gg/FTk2MvZwJH).\n- For long-form inquiries, please email [hello@jan.ai](mailto:hello@jan.ai).\n"
