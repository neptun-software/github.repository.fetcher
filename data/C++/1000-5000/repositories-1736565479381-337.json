I am very interested\nin quantitative finance. For more about me, you can visit:\n\n- My blog `financioneroncios <https://financioneroncios.wordpress.com/>`_.\n- My `linkedin <https://www.linkedin.com/in/dany-cajas/>`_.\n- My `SSRN author page <https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/cf_dev/AbsByAuth.cfm?per_id=2931756>`_ where you can find all my working papers.\n- Or write me to `dcajasn@gmail.com <dcajasn@gmail.com >`_.\n\nI like to learn and apply my knowledge in practical applications; for this\nreason, I started my blog to practice and share in my native language the things\nthat I've been learned until now. One topic that always have been very\ninteresting to me is portfolio optimization. However, I realized that\nopen-source libraries (python) are few (there are among one and four) and are\nmainly focused on mean variance optimization, ignoring advances in other\nconvex risk measures (CVaR, MAD, Maximum Drawdown, etc.) and other\nestimations techniques like robust estimates, Black Litterman and risk factors\nmodels. For this reason, I developed Riskfolio-Lib, a well documented library\nthat will help students, academics and practitioners to apply mathematically complex optimization models in their strategic asset allocation process.\n"

The list of solvers compatible with CVXPY is available in [Choosing a solver](https://www.cvxpy.org/tutorial/advanced/index.html#choosing-a-solver) section of CVXPY's documentation. However, to select an adequate solver for each risk measure we can use the following table that specifies which type of programming technique is used to model each risk measure.\n\n| Risk Measure                          | LP | QP | SOCP | SDP | EXP | POW |\n|---------------------------------------|----|----|------|-----|-----|-----|\n| Variance (MV)                         |    |    | X    | X*  |     |     |\n| Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)         | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n| Gini Mean Difference (GMD)            |    |    |      |     |     | X** |\n| Semi Variance (MSV)                   |    |    | X    |     |     |     |\n| Kurtosis (KT)                         |    |    |      | X   |     |     |\n| Semi Kurtosis (SKT)                   |    |    |      | X   |     |     |\n| First Lower Partial Moment (FLPM)     | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n| Second Lower Partial Moment (SLPM)    |    |    | X    |     |     |     |\n| Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)      | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n| Tail Gini (TG)                        |    |    |      |     |     | X** |\n| Entropic Value at Risk (EVaR)         |    |    |      |     | X   |     |\n| Relativistic Value at Risk (RLVaR)    |    |    |      |     |     | X** |\n| Worst Realization (WR)                | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n| CVaR Range (CVRG)                     | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n| Tail Gini Range (TGRG)                |    |    |      |     |     | X** |\n| Range (RG)                            | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n| Average Drawdown (ADD)                | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n| Ulcer Index (UCI)                     |    |    | X    |     |     |     |\n| Conditional Drawdown at Risk (CDaR)   | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n| Entropic Drawdown at Risk (EDaR)      |    |    |      |     | X   |     |\n| Relativistic Drawdown at Risk (RLDaR) |    |    |      |     |     | X** |\n| Maximum Drawdown (MDD)                | X  |    |      |     |     |     |\n\n(*) When SDP graph theory constraints are included. In the case of integer programming graph theory constraints, the model assume the SOCP formulation.\n\n(**) For these models is highly recommended to use MOSEK as solver, due to in some cases CLARABEL cannot find a solution and SCS takes too much time to solve them.\n\nLP - Linear Programming refers to problems with a linear objective function and linear constraints.\n\nQP - Quadratic Programming refers to problems with a quadratic objective function and linear constraints.\n\nSOCP - Second Order Cone Programming refers to problems with second-order cone constraints.\n\nSDP - Semidefinite Programming refers to problems with positive semidefinite constraints.\n\nEXP - refers to problems with exponential cone constraints.\n\nPOW - refers to problems with 3-dimensional power cone constraints.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\nRiskfolio-Lib supports Python 3.9 or higher.\n\nInstallation requires:\n- [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) >= 1.24.0\n- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/) >= 1.10.0\n- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) >= 2.0.0\n- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) >= 3.8.0\n- [clarabel](https://oxfordcontrol.github.io/ClarabelDocs/stable/) >= 0.6.0\n- [cvxpy](https://www.cvxpy.org/) >= 1.5.2\n- [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) >= 1.3.0\n- [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/) >= 0.13.5\n- [arch](https://bashtage.github.io/arch/) >= 7.0\n- [xlsxwriter](https://xlsxwriter.readthedocs.io) >= 3.1.2\n- [networkx](https://networkx.org) >= 3.0\n- [astropy](https://www.astropy.org) >= 5.1\n- [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) >= 2.10.1\n\n## Installation\n\nThe latest stable release (and older versions) can be installed from PyPI:\n\n    pip install riskfolio-lib\n\n## Citing\n\nIf you use Riskfolio-Lib for published work, please use the following BibTeX entry:\n\n```\n@misc{riskfolio,\n      author = {Dany Cajas},\n      title = {Riskfolio-Lib (6.3.1)},\n      year  = {2024},\n      url   = {https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib},\n      }\n```\n \n## Development\n\nRiskfolio-Lib development takes place on Github: https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib\n\n\n## Consulting Fees\n\nRiskfolio-Lib is an open-source project, but since it's a project that is not financed for any institution, I started charging for consultancies that are not related to errors in source code. Our fees are as follows:\n\n- $ 25 USD (United States Dollars) per question that doesn't require to check code.\n- $ 50 USD to check a small size script or code (less than 200 lines of code). The fee of the solution depends on the complexity of the solution:\n    - $ 50 USD for simple errors in scripts (modify less than 10 lines of code).\n    - For most complex errors the fee depends on the complexity of the solution but the fee is $ 150 USD per hour.\n- $ 100 USD to check a medium size script or code (between 201 and 600 lines of code). The fee of the solution depends on the complexity of the solution:\n    - $ 50 USD for simple errors in scripts (modify less than 10 lines of code).\n    - For most complex errors the fee depends on the complexity of the solution but the fee is $ 150 USD per hour.\n- For large size script or code (more than 600 lines of code) the fee is variable depending on the size of the code. The fee of the solution depends on the complexity of the solution:\n    - $ 50 USD for simple errors in scripts (modify less than 10 lines of code).\n    - For most complex errors the fee depends on the complexity of the solution but the fee is $ 150 USD per hour.\n\n**All consulting must be paid in advance**.\n\nYou can contact me through:\n\n- __[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dany-cajas/)__\n- __[Gmail](dcajasn@gmail.com)__\n\nYou can pay using one of the following channels:\n\n- __[Github Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/dcajasn)__\n\n- <a href='https://ko-fi.com/B0B833SXD' target='_blank'><img height='36' style='border:0px;height:36px;' src='https://cdn.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi1.png?v=2' border='0' alt='Buy Me a Coffee at ko-fi.com' /></a>\n\n## RoadMap\n\nThe plan for this module is to add more functions that will be very useful\nto asset managers.\n\n- Add more functions based on suggestion of users.\n"
