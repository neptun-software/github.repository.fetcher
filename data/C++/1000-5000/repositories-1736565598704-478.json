          "content": "0.4.6\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Added `target` property to RTCPeerConnection events (thanks, @CharlesRA).\n- Support for additional APIs in `lib/browser.js` (thanks, @piranna).\n- Added a naïve version of `getDeviceMedia` that delegates to `getUserMedia`\n  (thanks, @piranna).\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Although Node 14 support was confirmed in v0.4.5, it was not included in the\n  \"engines\" property of package.json (thanks, @farnabaz).\n- Potential fix for a crash mentioned in #637 (thanks, @thedracle).\n\n0.4.5\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Updated to WebRTC M81.\n- Added support for Node 14.\n- Added rollback support.\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- RTCPeerConnection no longer raises \"icegatheringstatechange\" when the\n  RTCPeerConnection is closed. Thanks, @arlolra. (#625)\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- With the update from M79 to M81, the `dtx`, `ptime`, and `codecPayloadType`\n  parameters to RTCRtpEncodingParameters no longer take affect. They've also\n  been removed from the WebRTC 1.0 specification (see [here](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-pc/issues/2350)).\n  Although this is technically a SemVer-breaking change, few users of this\n  library are depending on the removed functionality, and I prefer not to\n  increment the version number at this time.\n\n0.4.4\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- `addTrack` now supports multiple MediaStream arguments (#548). Additionally,\n  MediaStreams can now be constructed with arbitrary IDs. For more information,\n  see below. Thanks, @csheely and @sgodin.\n- `setStreams` now supports multiple MediaStream arguments.\n\nMediaStream\n-----------\n\nMediaStreams in node-webrtc can be constructed with arbitrary IDs. For example,\nthe following MediaStream, `stream`, has its ID set to \"foo\".\n\n```js\nconst stream = new MediaStream({ id: 'foo' });\nstream.id === 'foo';  // true\n```\n\n0.4.3\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Updated to WebRTC M79.\n- Added support for Node 13.\n- Added support for a number of new standard APIs (see below).\n\n### RTCPeerConnection\n\n- Added support for `restartIce`.\n- Added support for \"icecandidateerror\" events.\n\n### RTCDtlsTransport\n\n- Added support for `getRemoteCertificates`.\n\n### RTCRtpSender, RTCRtpReceiver & RTCRtpTransceiver\n\n- Added support for `getCapabilities` to RTCRtpSender and RTCRtpReceiver.\n- Added support for `setParameters` to RTCRtpSender.\n- Added support for `setStreams` to RTCRtpSender (at this time, up to one\n  MediaStream argument is supported).\n- Added support for `sendEncodings` to RTCRtpTransceiverInit.\n- Added support for `setCodecPreferences` to RTCRtpTransceiver.\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed a bug where VideoFrame timestamps reported via RTCP were incorrect\n  (#566). Thanks, @lonocvb.\n- Fixed a bug where, in some cases, Ninja builds failed on macOS (#582). Thanks,\n  @taylorhoward92.\n- Fixed bugs related to N-API usage in recent version of Node 12 and 13.\n\n0.4.2\n=====\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fix image stride issue at certain resolutions. (#536)\n\n0.4.1\n=====\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fix memory leak when receiving strings over RTCDataChannel. (#528)\n\n0.4.0\n=====\n\nnode-webrtc is now implemented using N-API, which is ABI stable across Node\nreleases. This means we can now ship fewer binaries while supporting a\npotentially greater number of Node releases. As of 0.4.0, node-webrtc targets\nN-API version 3.\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Updated to WebRTC M74.\n- Added support for Node 12.\n- Added support for Electron 4 and 5.\n- Added initial RTCIceTransport support (see below).\n- Added initial RTCSctpTransport support (see below).\n- Expanded RTCIceCandidate support (see below).\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Avoid crashing when `createDataChannel` fails. (#508)\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- Dropped support for Node 6.\n- Installing from NPM only downloads pre-built binaries. If you wish to build\n  from source, install from the source repository. (#200)\n- Unified Plan is now the default. For Plan B behavior, set the `sdpSemantics`\n  RTCConfiguration property or the `SDP_SEMANTICS` environment variable to\n  \"plan-b\".\n\nRTCIceTransport\n---------------\n\nRTCDtlsTransport now exposes RTCIceTransport under the `iceTransport` property.\n\nThe following attributes are supported:\n\n- `role`\n- `component`\n- `state`\n- `gatheringState`\n\nThe following events are supported:\n\n- \"statechange\"\n- \"gatheringstatechange\"\n\nRTCSctpTransport\n----------------\n\nRTCPeerConnection now exposes RTCSctpTransport under the `sctp` property.\n\nThe following attributes are supported:\n\n- `transport`\n- `state`\n\nThe following attributes are partially supported:\n\n- `maxMessageSize` (always `null`)\n- `maxChannels` (always `null`)\n\nThe \"statechange\" event is also supported.\n\nRTCIceCandidate\n---------------\n\nRTCIceCandidates now include the following attributes:\n\n- `foundation`\n- `component`\n- `priority`\n- `address`\n- `protocol`\n- `port`\n- `type`\n- `tcpType`\n- `relatedAddress`\n- `relatedPort`\n- `usernameFragment`\n\n0.3.7\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n### RTCDtlsTransport\n\nRTCRtpSender and RTCRtpReceiver now provide access to RTCDtlsTransport via the\n`transport` property (initially `null`). Currently, RTCDtlsTransport only\nsupports the `state` property, the \"statechange\" event, and the \"error\" event.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- Updated to WebRTC M73.\n- Added `maxPacketLifeTime` getter to RTCDataChannel (#492).\n- Added `negotiated` getter to RTCDataChannel.\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed `addIceCandidate` queueing behavior (#498).\n\n0.3.6\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n### Programmatic Audio\n\nThis release of node-webrtc adds non-standard, programmatic audio APIs in the\nform of RTCAudioSource and RTCAudioSink. These APIs are similar to the\npreviously added RTCVideoSource and RTCVideoSink APIs. With these APIs, you can\n\n* Pass audio samples to RTCAudioSource via the `onData` method. Then use the\n  RTCAudioSource's `createTrack` method to create a local audio\n  MediaStreamTrack.\n* Construct an RTCAudioSink from a local or remote audio MediaStreamTrack. The\n  RTCAudioSink will emit a \"data\" event every time audio samples are received.\n  When you're finished, stop the RTCAudioSink by calling `stop`.\n\nBecause these APIs are non-standard, they are exposed via a `nonstandard`\nproperty on node-webrtc's exports object. For example,\n\n```js\nconst { RTCAudioSource, RTCAudioSink } = require('wrtc').nonstandard;\n\nconst source = new RTCAudioSource();\nconst track = source.createTrack();\nconst sink = new RTCAudioSink(track);\n\nconst sampleRate = 8000;\nconst samples = new Int16Array(sampleRate / 100);  // 10 ms of 16-bit mono audio\n\nconst data = {\n  samples,\n  sampleRate\n};\n\nconst interval = setInterval(() => {\n  // Update audioData in some way before sending.\n  source.onData(data);\n});\n\nsink.ondata = data => {\n  // Do something with the received audio samples.\n};\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  clearInterval(interval);\n  track.stop();\n  sink.stop();\n}, 10000);\n```\n\n#### RTCAudioSource\n\n```webidl\n[constructor]\ninterface RTCAudioSource {\n  MediaStreamTrack createTrack();\n  void onData(RTCAudioData data);\n};\n\ndictionary RTCAudioData {\n  required Int16Array samples;\n  required unsigned short sampleRate;\n  octet bitsPerSample = 16;\n  octet channelCount = 1;\n  unsigned short numberOfFrames;\n};\n```\n\n* Calling `createTrack` will return a local audio MediaStreamTrack whose source\n  is the RTCAudioSource.\n* Calling `onData` with RTCAudioData pushes a new audio samples to every\n  non-stopped local audio MediaStreamTrack created with `createTrack`.\n* RTCAudioData should represent 10 ms worth of 16-bit audio samples.\n\n#### RTCAudioSink\n\n```webidl\n[constructor(MediaStreamTrack track)]\ninterface RTCAudioSink {\n  void stop();\n  readonly attribute boolean stopped;\n  attribute EventHandler ondata;\n};\n```\n\n* RTCAudioSink's constructor accepts a local or remote audio MediaStreamTrack.\n* As long as neither the RTCAudioSink nor the RTCAudioSink's MediaStreamTrack\n  are stopped, the RTCAudioSink will raise a \"data\" event any time RTCAudioData\n  is received.\n* The \"data\" event has all the properties of RTCAudioData.\n* RTCAudioSink must be stopped by calling `stop`.\n\n### RTCVideoFrame `rotation`\n\nThe RTCVideoFrame raised in RTCVideoSink's \"frame\" event now includes a\nproperty, `rotation`, which indicates rotation of the RTCVideoFrame. Possible\nvalues are 0, 90, 180, and 270.\n\n### EventListener `handleEvent`\n\nEventListener instances now support [`handleEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener/handleEvent).\n\n0.3.5\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n### Programmatic Video\n\nThis release of node-webrtc adds non-standard, programmatic video APIs in the\nform of RTCVideoSource and RTCVideoSink. With these APIs, you can\n\n* Pass [I420](https://wiki.videolan.org/YUV/#I420) frames to RTCVideoSource via\n  the `onFrame` method. Then use RTCVideoSource's `createTrack` method to create\n  a local video MediaStreamTrack.\n* Construct an RTCVideoSink from a local or remote video MediaStreamTrack. The\n  RTCVideoSink will emit a \"frame\" event every time an I420 frame is received.\n  When you're finished, stop the RTCVideoSink by calling `stop`.\n\nBecause these APIs are non-standard, they are exposed via a `nonstandard`\nproperty on node-webrtc's exports object. For example,\n\n```js\nconst { RTCVideoSource, RTCVideoSink } = require('wrtc').nonstandard;\n\nconst source = new RTCVideoSource();\nconst track = source.createTrack();\nconst sink = new RTCVideoSink(track);\n\nconst width = 320;\nconst height = 240;\nconst data = new Uint8ClampedArray(width * height * 1.5);\nconst frame = { width, height, data };\n\nconst interval = setInterval(() => {\n  // Update the frame in some way before sending.\n  source.onFrame(frame);\n});\n\nsink.onframe = ({ frame }) => {\n  // Do something with the received frame.\n};\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  clearInterval(interval);\n  track.stop();\n  sink.stop();\n}, 10000);\n```\n\nThis release also adds bindings to some [libyuv](https://chromium.googlesource.com/libyuv/libyuv/)\nfunctions for handling I420 frames. These can be useful when converting to and\nfrom RGBA.\n\n#### RTCVideoSource\n\n```webidl\n[constructor(optional RTCVideoSourceInit init)]\ninterface RTCVideoSource {\n  readonly attribute boolean isScreencast;\n  readonly attribute boolean? needsDenoising;\n  MediaStreamTrack createTrack();\n  void onFrame(RTCVideoFrame frame);\n};\n\ndictionary RTCVideoSourceInit {\n  boolean isScreencast = false;\n  boolean needsDenoising;\n};\n\ndictionary RTCVideoFrame {\n  required unsigned long width;\n  required unsigned long height;\n  required Uint8ClampedArray data;\n};\n```\n\n* Calling `createTrack` will return a local video MediaStreamTrack whose source\n  is the RTCVideoSource.\n* Calling `onFrame` with an RTCVideoFrame pushes a new video frame to every\n  non-stopped local video MediaStreamTrack created with `createTrack`.\n* An RTCVideoFrame represents an I420 frame.\n\n#### RTCVideoSink\n\n```webidl\n[constructor(MediaStreamTrack track)]\ninterface RTCVideoSink {\n  void stop();\n  readonly attribute boolean stopped;\n  attribute EventHandler onframe;\n};\n```\n\n* RTCVideoSink's constructor accepts a local or remote video MediaStreamTrack.\n* As long as neither the RTCVideoSink nor the RTCVideoSink's MediaStreamTrack\n  are stopped, the RTCVideoSink will raise a \"frame\" event any time an\n  RTCVideoFrame is received.\n* The \"frame\" event has a property, `frame`, of type RTCVideoFrame.\n* RTCVideoSink must be stopped by calling `stop`.\n\n#### `i420ToRgba` and `rgbaToI420`\n\nThese two functions are bindings to libyuv that provide conversions between I420\nand RGBA frames. WebRTC expects I420, whereas APIs like the\n[Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) expect\nRGBA, so these functions are useful for converting between. For example,\n\n```js\nconst { i420ToRgba, rgbaToI420 } = require('wrtc').nonstandard;\n\nconst width = 640;\nconst height = 480;\nconst i420Data = new Uint8ClampedArray(width * height * 1.5);\nconst rgbaData = new Uint8ClampedArray(width * height * 4);\nconst i420Frame = { width, height, data: i420Data };\nconst rgbaFrame = { width, height, data: rgbaData };\n\ni420ToRgba(i420Frame, rgbaFrame);\nrgbaToI420(rgbaFrame, i420Frame);\n```\n\n### MediaStreamTrack\n\n- Added support for setting MediaStreamTrack's `enabled` property (#475).\n\n0.3.4\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Updated to WebRTC M71.\n- Relay remote audio MediaStreamTracks on Windows (0.1.5 initially introduced\n  this feature for Linux and macOS; now, Windows supports it, too).\n- Added support for [pkg](https://github.com/zeit/pkg) (#404).\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Calling certain methods, like `addTrack`, `removeTrack`, etc., with objects\n  that were not instances of MediaStreamTrack, RTCRtpSender, etc., could lead to\n  segfaults. This was because we did not properly validate objects before\n  attempting to unwrap them. (#448)\n\n0.3.3\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Experimental support for armv7l and arm64. Binaries built for these\n  architectures have been tested with QEMU but not on real devices. Please test\n  them out. If you install node-webrtc directly on an ARM device, node-pre-gyp\n  should pull the correct binaries automatically. Otherwise, you may need to set\n  the `TARGET_ARCH` environment variable to \"arm\" (armv7l) or \"arm64\". For\n  example,\n\n  ```\n  TARGET_ARCH=arm64 npm install\n  ```\n\n- Set `DEBUG=true` to install debug binaries (Linux- and macOS-only). For\n  example,\n\n  ```\n  DEBUG=true npm install\n  ```\n\n0.3.2\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Support for Node 11 on Windows.\n\n0.3.1\n=====\n\nThis release adds a number of new features and brings us closer to\nspec-compliance, thanks to the tests at\n[web-platform-tests/wpt](http://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt).\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n### `getUserMedia`\n\nThis release adds limited `getUserMedia` support. You can create audio and video\nMediaStreamTracks; however, the resulting MediaStreamTracks do not capture any\nmedia. You can add these MediaStreamTracks to an RTCPeerConnection; however, no\nmedia will be transmitted. You can confirm by checking `bytesSent` and\n`bytesReceived` in `getStats`.\n\n```js\nconst { getUserMedia } = require('wrtc');\n\ngetUserMedia({\n  audio: true,\n  video: true\n}).then(stream => {\n  stream.getTracks().forEach(track => stop());\n});\n```\n\nAlthough we will parse and validate some members of the MediaStreamConstraints\nand related dictionaries, we do not use their values at this time.\n\n### `getStats`\n\nThis release adds limited standards-compliant `getStats` support. Previous\nnode-webrtc releases exposed the legacy, callback-based `getStats` API. This\nrelease preserves that API but adds the Promise-based API. Neither the\nMediaStreamTrack selector argument nor the RTCRtpSender- and\nRTCRtpReceiver-level `getStats` APIs are implemented at this time.\n\n```js\n// Legacy API\npc.getStats(\n  response => { /* ... */ },\n  console.error\n);\n\n// Standards-compliant API\npc.getStats().then(\n  report => { /* ... */ },\n  console.error\n);\n```\n\n### Unified Plan and `sdpSemantics`\n\nThis release adds support for RTCRtpTransceivers and Unified Plan SDP via\n\n* A non-standard RTCConfiguration option, `sdpSemantics`, and\n* An environment variable, `SDP_SEMANTICS`.\n\nConstruct an RTCPeerConnection with `sdpSemantics` set to \"unified-plan\" or\nlaunch your application with `SDP_SEMANTICS=unified-plan` to enable\nRTCRtpTransceiver support; otherwise, \"plan-b\" is the default.\n\n```js\nconst { RTCPeerConnection } = require('wrtc');\n\nconst pc = new RTCPeerConnection({\n  sdpSemantics: 'unified-plan'  // default is \"plan-b\"\n});\n```\n\n```\nSDP_SEMANTICS=unified-plan node app.js\n```\n\n### RTCRtpTransceiver\n\nYou can use RTCRtpTransceivers and related APIs when Unified Plan is enabled.\nThis includes the following RTCPeerConnection methods\n\n- `addTransceiver`\n- `getTransceivers`\n\nand the following RTCTrackEvent properties\n\n- `transceiver`\n\nThe following RTCRtpTransceiver methods are supported\n\n- `stop`\n\nas well as the following RTCRtpTransceiver properties\n\n- `mid`\n- `sender`\n- `receiver`\n- `stopped`\n- `direction`\n- `currentDirection`\n\n`setCodecPreferences` is not yet implemented. When calling `addTransceiver`,\nonly the following RTCRtpTransceiverInit dictionary members are supported\n\n- `direction`\n- `streams`\n\n```js\nconst assert = require('assert');\nconst { MediaStream, RTCPeerConnection, RTCRtpTransceiver } = require('wrtc');\n\nconst pc = new RTCPeerConnection({\n  sdpSemantics: 'unified-plan'\n});\n\nconst t1 = pc.addTransceiver('audio', {\n  direction: 'recvonly'\n});\n\nconst t2 = pc.addTransceiver(t1.receiver.track, {\n  direction: 'sendonly',\n  streams: [new MediaStream()]\n});\n```\n\n### MediaStreamTrack\n\nAdded limited support for the `muted` property (it always returns `false`).\n\n### Miscellaneous\n\n- APIs that should throw DOMExceptions, such as `addTrack`, will use\n  [domexception](https://github.com/jsdom/domexception) to construct those\n  DOMExceptions, if installed.\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Calling `addTrack` twice with the same MediaStreamTrack should throw an\n  InvalidAccessError (#442).\n- MediaStream's `getTrackById` did not work for video MediaStreamTracks.\n- MediaStream's `clone` method did not `clone` MediaStreamTracks.\n- MediaStreamTrack's `readyState` was not updated when `stop` was called.\n\n0.3.0\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Support for Node 11. Binaries are available for Linux and macOS. Windows\n  binaries will become available in a subsequent release once AppVeyor gains\n  support for Node 11.\n- Updated to WebRTC M70. This release no longer uses\n  [mayeut/libwebrtc](https://github.com/mayeut/libwebrtc); instead, WebRTC is\n  built from source.\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- Dropped support for Node 9\n- Minimum CMake version bumped to 3.12\n- Minimum GCC version bumped to 5.4\n- Minimum Microsoft Visual Studio version bumped to 2017\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Updating to WebRTC M70 fixes an RTCDataChannel-related interop bug with recent\n  Firefox releases (#444).\n\n0.2.2\n=====\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Destroy AudioDeviceModule on the worker thread.\n\n0.2.1\n=====\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed an AudioDeviceModule memory and thread leak (#429).\n- Fixed an issue where closing an RTCPeerConnection would raise \"open\" events on\n  any RTCDataChannels whose `readyState` was \"connecting\" (#436).\n\n0.2.0\n=====\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- Dropped support for Node 4, 5 and 7 (#408).\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed a race when closing an RTCDataChannel (#358).\n- Fixed memory leaks in `createOffer`, `createAnswer`, `addIceCandidate`, and\n  `getStats` (#425).\n\n0.1.6\n=====\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed an issue with receiving multiple ArrayBuffers over an RTCDataChannel\n  that could cause invalid memory accesses (#406).\n\n0.1.5\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- This release allows relaying remote MediaStreamTracks. This can be useful for\n  test applications. **Note:** currently, Windows cannot relay audio\n  MediaStreamTracks, only video.\n\n### MediaStream\n\nThis release adds support for MediaStream. Most MediaStream APIs are supported,\nexcluding the \"addtrack\" and \"removetrack\" events. You can construct\nMediaStreams as follows:\n\n```js\nconst { MediaStream } = require('wrtc');\n\nconst stream1 = new MediaStream();\nconst stream2 = new MediaStream(stream1);\n```\n\nAssuming you already have some Array of MediaStreamTracks, `tracks`, you can\nalso construct a MediaStream with\n\n```js\nconst stream3 = new MediaStream(tracks);\n```\n\nOr, if you have an existing MediaStream, you can `clone` it.\n\n```js\nconst stream4 = stream3.clone();\n```\n\nThis release also adds support for the following methods\n\n- `getTracks`\n- `getAudioTracks`\n- `getVideoTracks`\n- `getTrackById`\n- `addTrack`\n- `removeTrack`\n\nand the following attributes\n\n- `id`\n- `active`\n\n### RTCTrackEvent\n\nThis release adds support for the `streams` property.\n\n### RTCPeerConnection\n\nThis release adds support for `addTrack`, `removeTrack`, and `getSenders`.\nAlthough we don't yet provide a way to construct local MediaStreamTracks, you\ncan relay remote MediaStreamTracks as follows:\n\n```js\npc.ontrack = ({ track, streams }) => {\n  pc.addTrack(track, ...streams);\n};\n```\n\n### RTCRtpSender\n\nThis release adds support for the following methods\n\n- `getCapabilities` (always throws for now)\n- `getParameters`\n- `setParameters` (always returns a rejected Promise for now)\n- `getStats` (always returns a rejected Promise for now)\n- `replaceTrack`\n\nand the following attributes\n\n- `track`\n- `transport` (always returns `null` for now)\n- `rtcpTransport` (always returns `null` for now)\n\n0.1.4\n=====\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Added support for Node 10 (#402)\n\n### RTCPeerConnection\n\n- Added support for `getReceivers`.\n- Added partial support for the RTCTrackEvent. RTCPeerConnection will emit the\n  RTCTrackEvent with two attributes: `track` and `receiver`. In the future, we\n  will add support for the `streams` and `transceiver` attributes.\n\n### RTCRtpReceiver\n\nThis release adds partial support for RTCRtpReceiver, including methods\n\n- `getParameters`\n- `getContributingSources` (always returns an empty array for now)\n- `getSynchronizationSources` (always returns an empty array for now)\n- `getStats` (always returns a rejected Promise for now)\n\nand attributes\n\n- `track`\n- `transport` (always returns `null` for now)\n- `rtcpTransport` (always returns `null` for now)\n\nRTCRtpReceiver also includes partial support for the static method\n`getCapabilities`; however, it always returns a rejected Promise.\n\n### MediaStreamTrack\n\nThis release adds partial support for remote MediaStreamTracks, including\nattributes\n\n- `enabled` (read-only for now)\n- `id`\n- `kind`\n- `readyState`\n\n0.1.3\n=====\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed memory leaks related to RTCPeerConnection events.\n\n0.1.2\n=====\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed memory leaks related to sending and receiving messages over\n  RTCDataChannels (#205, #304, #319). There are some less severe leaks related\n  to RTCPeerConnection events that remain. These will be addressed in a future\n  release.\n\n0.1.1\n=====\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Calling `createDataChannel` on a closed RTCPeerConnection no longer returns\n  `undefined`; instead, it raises an InvalidStateError (#314, #382).\n- Worked around WebRTC [Issue 7585](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/webrtc/issues/detail?id=7585)\n  on Linux by backporting the `epoll`-based PhysicalSocketServer from WebRTC\n  M61 into node-webrtc. This allows many more concurrent RTCPeerConnections on\n  Linux (for example, up to 3000 in my tests, not exceeding thread limits).\n  (#362)\n\n0.1.0\n=====\n\nThis project will begin to follow [SemVer](https://semver.org) in preparation\nfor a 1.0.0 release.\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\nBesides updating to WebRTC M60 (using\n[mayeut/libwebrtc](https://github.com/mayeut/libwebrtc)), this release adds a\nnumber of features that bring node-webrtc closer to standards-compliance. We\nstill have a ways to go, but we're now testing against\n[w3c/web-platform-tests](https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests).\n\n### RTCConfiguration\n\nRTCPeerConnection's constructor now accepts the following standard properties:\n\n* `bundlePolicy`\n* `iceCandidatePoolSize`\n* `iceServers` (no support for OAuth yet)\n* `iceTransportPolicy`\n* `rtcpMuxPolicy`\n\nRTCConfiguration also accepts a non-standard property, `portRange`. This\nproperty constrains the port range used by the RTCPeerConnection's ICE\ntransports. For example,\n\n```js\nconst { RTCPeerConnection } = require('wrtc');\n\nconst pc = new RTCPeerConnection({\n  portRange: {\n    min: 10000, // defaults to 0\n    max: 20000  // defaults to 65535\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### RTCPeerConnection\n\nRTCPeerConnection now supports two new methods:\n\n* `getConfiguration`\n* `setConfiguration`\n\nRTCPeerConnection now supports the following properties:\n\n* `canTrickleIceCandidates` (always returns `null` for now)\n* `connectionState` (derived from `iceConnectionState`)\n* `currentLocalDescription`\n* `currentRemoteDescription`\n* `pendingLocalDescription`\n* `pendingRemoteDescription`\n\nRTCPeerConnection now supports the following events:\n\n* \"connectionstatechange\"\n* \"negotiationneeded\"\n\n### RTCOfferOptions and RTCAnswerOptions\n\nRTCPeerConnection's `createOffer` method now accepts RTCOfferOptions, and\nRTCPeerConnection's `createAnswer` method now accepts RTCAnswerOptions.\nRTCOfferOptions supports\n\n* `iceRestart`\n* `offerToReceiveAudio`\n* `offerToReceiveVideo`\n\nBoth RTCOfferOptions and RTCAnswerOptions support `voiceActivityDetection`.\n\n### RTCDataChannelInit\n\nRTCPeerConnection's `createDataChannel` method now accepts\n\n* `id`\n* `maxPacketLifeTime`\n* `maxRetransmits`\n* `negotiated`\n* `ordered`\n* `protocol`\n\n### RTCDataChannel\n\nRTCDataChannel supports the following properties:\n\n* `id`\n* `maxRetransmits`\n* `ordered`\n* `priority` (always returns \"high\")\n* `protocol`\n\nRTCDataChannel's `send` method now supports sending Blobs provided by\n[jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom); however, there is no support for\nreceiving Blobs.\n\n### Top-level Exports\n\nAdded top-level exports for\n\n* RTCDataChannel\n* RTCDataChannelEvent\n* RTCPeerConnectionIceEvent\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed a failed assertion when closing RTCPeerConnection's or RTCDataChannel's\n  event loop (#376).\n- Moved AudioDeviceModule construction to the worker thread. This fixes a thread\n  checker assertion raised by debug builds of libwebrtc.\n- Copy StatsReports on the signaling thread. This fixes a thread checker\n  assertion raised by debug builds of libwebrtc.\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- Dropped support for \"moz\"- and \"webkit\"-prefixed WebRTC APIs in\n  `lib/browser.js`. This means that, when bundling JavaScript that depends on\n  node-webrtc for the browser, the resulting bundle will no longer depend on\n  these APIs (#369).\n- Dropped support for the now non-standard `url` attribute in RTCIceServer.\n- Dropped support for the `RTCIceConnectionStates`, `RTCIceGatheringStates`, and\n  `RTCSignalingStates` properties on the RTCPeerConnection prototype. These were\n  an implementation detail that some libraries used for detecting node-webrtc.\n- Dropped support for the `RTCDataStates` and `BinaryTypes` properties on the\n  RTCDataChannel prototype. This, too, was an implementation detail.\n\n0.0.67\n======\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- ObjectWrap instances accessed in an event loop (like PeerConnection and\n  DataChannel) were getting freed before the event loop completed, which caused\n  segfaults. Now, we call `Ref` in the ObjectWrap instances' constructors and\n  `Unref` in their event loops.\n- Fixed another source of segfaults, where, if a DataChannel's\n  PeerConnectionFactory was freed, accessing the underlying DataChannelInterface\n  would try to use Threads which had been freed.\n\n0.0.66\n======\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Fixed a CPU regression introduced in 0.0.63. We now share a single\n  PeerConnectionFactoryInterface across PeerConnectionInterfaces, and we now use\n  a \"dummy\" AudioDeviceModule instead of FakeAudioDeviceModule.\n\n0.0.65\n======\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Added support for sending Buffers (#103)\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- Sending an ArrayBufferView over an RTCDataChannel did not take into account\n  the ArrayBufferView's `offset` or `length` properties. This resulted in\n  sending the entire backing ArrayBuffer instead of just the data in the\n  ArrayBufferView.\n- unzip-stream 0.2.2 breaks compatibility with Node 4 and 5. This release pins\n  to unzip-stream 0.2.1.\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- Building from source requires CMake 3.1 or newer\n\n0.0.64\n======\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- We no longer `Externalize` ArrayBuffers. This fixes an error when sending\n  ArrayBuffers mutliple times (#262 and #264) and a memory leak (#304).\n- Fixed RTCDataChannel-related segfaults by checking for `nullptr` (#236 and\n  #325)\n\n0.0.63\n======\n\nNew Features\n------------\n\n- Support for Node 9\n- Updated to WebRTC M57 (using [libwebrtc](https://github.com/aisouard/libwebrtc))\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- Minimum Mac OS X version bumped to 10.9\n- Minimum Microsoft Visual Studio version bumped to 2015\n"

For an actively maintained fork supporting Node 20 and more recent versions of WebRTC, see [@roamhq/wrtc](https://github.com/WonderInventions/node-webrtc). Once `@roamhq/wrtc` is stable, it will be merged back into this repository.\n\nOther alternatives that might suit your needs are [node-datachannel](https://github.com/murat-dogan/node-datachannel) and [werift](https://github.com/shinyoshiaki/werift-webrtc)\n\n<h1 align=\"center\">\n  <img height=\"120px\" src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d9/Node.js_logo.svg\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  <img height=\"120px\" src=\"https://webrtc.github.io/webrtc-org/assets/images/webrtc-logo-vert-retro-dist.svg\" />\n</h1>\n\n[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/wrtc.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wrtc) [![macOS/Linux Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/node-webrtc/node-webrtc/tree/develop.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/node-webrtc/node-webrtc) [![Windows Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/iulc84we28o1i7b9?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/markandrus/node-webrtc-7bnua)\n\nnode-webrtc is a Node.js Native Addon that provides bindings to [WebRTC M87](https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/webrtc/+/branch-heads/4280). This project aims for spec-compliance and is tested using the W3C's [web-platform-tests](https://github.com/web-platform-tests/wpt) project. A number of [nonstandard APIs](docs/nonstandard-apis.md) for testing are also included.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\n```\nnpm i -g node-pre-gyp\nnpm install wrtc\n```\n\nInstalling from NPM downloads a prebuilt binary for your operating system × architecture. Set the `TARGET_ARCH` environment variable to \"arm\" or \"arm64\" to download for armv7l or arm64, respectively. Linux and macOS users can also set the `DEBUG` environment variable to download debug builds.\n\nYou can also [build from source](docs/build-from-source.md).\n\nSupported Platforms\n-------------------\n\nThe following platforms are confirmed to work with node-webrtc and have prebuilt binaries available. Since node-webrtc targets [N-API version 3](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html), there may be additional platforms supported that are not listed here. If your platform is not supported, you may still be able to [build from source](docs/build-from-source.md).\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <td colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\"></td>\n      <th colspan=\"3\">Linux</th>\n      <th colspan=\"2\">macOS</th>\n      <th>Windows</th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>armv7l</th>\n      <th>arm64</th>\n      <th>x64</th>\n      <th>arm64</th>\n      <th>x64</th>\n      <th>x64</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th rowspan=\"6\">Node</th>\n      <th>8</th>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>10</th>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>11</th>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12</th>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>13</th>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>14</th>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th rowspan=\"2\">Electron</th>\n      <th>4</th>\n        <td align=\"center\"></td>\n        <td align=\"center\"></td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n        <td align=\"center\"></td>\n        <td align=\"center\"></td>\n        <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\"></td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n      <td align=\"center\">✓</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nSee [node-webrtc/node-webrtc-examples](https://github.com/node-webrtc/node-webrtc-examples).\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nContributions welcome!

If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,\n    then:\n\n    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices\n        from the source.\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 1 of the IJG License\n        - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License\n        - Clauses 1 and 3 of the zlib License\n\n    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source\n        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file (if\n        there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can\n        simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 1 of the IJG License\n        - Clause 2 of the zlib License\n\n    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the\n        copyright or license text in that file.\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 1 of the IJG License\n\n2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or\n    if you are distributing an application that statically links with\n    libjpeg-turbo, then:\n\n    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:\n\n        This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG\n        Group.\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 2 of the IJG license\n\n    2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API, then\n        your product documentation must include the text of the Modified BSD\n        License.\n\n        **Origin**\n        - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License\n\n3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the\n    contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.\n\n    **Origin**\n    - IJG License\n    - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License\n\n4.  The IJG and The libjpeg-turbo Project do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be\n    free of defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable\n    consequences resulting from your use of the software.\n\n    **Origin**\n    - IJG License\n    - Modified BSD License\n    - zlib License\n\n```\n\n# libsrtp\n```\n/*\n *\t\n * Copyright (c) 2001-2017 Cisco Systems, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n * \n * Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\n * modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions\n * are met:\n * \n *   Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n *   notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n * \n *   Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above\n *   copyright notice, this list of conditions and the following\n *   disclaimer in the documentation and/or other materials provided\n *   with the distribution.\n * \n *   Neither the name of the Cisco Systems, Inc. nor the names of its\n *   contributors may be used to endorse or promote products derived\n *   from this software without specific prior written permission.\n * \n * THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS\n * &quot;AS IS&quot; AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\n * LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS\n * FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
