          "content": "# ZNC 1.9.1 (2024-07-03)\n\n* This is a security release to fix CVE-2024-39844: remote code execution vulnerability in modtcl.\n    * To mitigate this for existing installations, simply unload the modtcl module for every user, if it's loaded. Note that only users with admin rights can load modtcl at all.\n    * Thanks to Johannes Kuhn (DasBrain) for reporting, to glguy for the patch, and to multiple IRC network operators for help with mitigating this on server side before disclosure.\n* Improve tooltips in webadmin.\n\n\n# ZNC 1.9.0 (2024-02-22)\n\n## New\n* Support for capability negotiation 302 and `cap-notify`. ZNC now has API `AddServerDependentCapability()`, using which modules can easily implement new capabilities: if server supports a cap, it will automatically be offered to clients which support `cap-notify` and ZNC will notify the module when the capability is enabled or disabled for server and for each client.\n    * Several capabilities (`away-notify`, `account-notify`, `extended-join`) were moved from the core to a new module: corecaps.\n    * The corecaps module is loaded automatically when upgrading from old config and when creating new config, but it's possible to unload it.\n        * Note: users who were using pre-release versions of 1.9.x (from git or from nightly tarballs) won't have it loaded automatically, because the existing config states `Version = 1.9`. In such case you can load it manually. This is to honor choice of users who decide to unload it, since we don't know whether the module is missing intentionally.\n    * Added support for `account-tag` capability, also in corecaps module.\n* Updated password hashing algorithm from SHA-256 to Argon2id (if libargon2 is installed). Existing passwords are transparently upgraded upon login.\n* Allow ordering of channels: via `ListChans`, `MoveChan` and `SwapChans` commands, and via webadmin.\n* New user options: `DenySetIdent`, `DenySetNetwork`, `DenySetRealName`, `DenySetQuitMsg`, `DenySetCTCPReplies`.\n* Switched `--makeconf` wizard default network from freenode to Libera.\n* Added Portuguese and Turkish translations.\n* znc-buildmod: output where the module was written to\n\n## Fixes\n* Fixed crash when receiving SASL lines from server without having negotiated SASL via CAP.\n* Fixed build with SWIG 4.2.0.\n* Fixed build with LibreSSL.\n* Fixed handling of timezones when parsing server-time tags received from server.\n* Use module names as the module ident, otherwise some clients were merging conversations with different modules together.\n* Stopped sending invalid 333 (`RPL_TOPICWHOTIME`) to client if topic owner is unknown.\n* Fixed an ODR violation.\n* Better hide password in PASS debug lines, sometimes it was not hidden.\n* CAP REQ sent by client without CAP LS now suspends the registration as the spec requires.\n\n## Modules\n* autoop: In some cases settings were parsed incorrectly, resulting in failure to do the autoop, now it's fixed.\n* clientnotify: Added options to reduce amount of notifications depending on the IP and the client ID of the connecting client.\n* controlpanel: Fixed help output.\n* log: Log nickserv account in the joins lines.\n* modperl: Allow overriding label for timers, which means now there can be more than 1 timer per module.\n* modpython:\n    * Rewrote internals of how modpython loads modules.\n    * Main motivation for the switch from using `imp` to using `importlib` was to support Python 3.12+.\n        * As an additional benefit, now it's possible to structure the module as a python package (a subdirectory with `__init__.py` and other .py files).\n        * All the old python modules should load as they were before.\n        * ZNC no longer supports loading a C python extension directly through modpython (though I doubt there were any users of that obscure feature): if you want to some parts of the module to be compiled, you can always import that from `__init__.py`.\n    * Implemented `Module.AddCommand()`\n* route_replies:\n    * Added Solanum-specific 337 (`RPL_WHOISTEXT`) to possible replies of `/whois`.\n    * Route replies to `/topic`.\n* sasl: Don't forward 908 (`RPL_SASLMECHS`) to clients.\n* webadmin: Fixed order of breadcrumbs in network page.\n* watch: Allow new entries to use spaces.\n\n## Notes for package maintainers\n* Require C++17 compiler. That is, GCC 8+ or Clang 5+.\n* Removed autoconf, leaving only CMake as the build system. The `configure` script is now merely a wrapper for CMake, and accepts mostly the same parameters as the old `configure`. You can use either `configure` as before, or CMake directly. Minimum supported CMake version is 3.13.\n* If cctz library is available on the system, it will be used, otherwise the bundled copy will be used.\n* libargon2 is new optional dependency.\n* Dropped support for Python < 3.4\n* Dropped support for SWIG < 4.0.1\n* The systemd unit now passes `--datadir=/var/lib/znc`.\n\n## Internal\n* Switched to steady clock for cache map and for sockets to fix certain issues with leap seconds and DST.\n* Made `CUser::Put...()` send to all clients instead of only networkless clients. Deprecate `CUser::PutAllUser()`.\n* Setup Github Actions to replace old Travis CI setup.\n* Added CIFuzz.\n* Added CodeQL.\n* List of translators is now automatically generated from Crowdin.\n* Modernized the way how CMake is used.\n* Updated default SSL settings from Mozilla recommendations.\n* Rewrote message parsing using `std::string_view`, improving the performance of the parser.\n* Web: removed legacy xhtml syntax.\n* Documented more functions.\n* Made some integration tests run faster by changing ServerThrottle value in the test.\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.8.2 (2020-07-07)\n\n## New\n* Polish translation\n* List names of translators in TRANSLATORS.md file in source, as this contribution isn't directly reflected in git log\n* During --makeconf warn about listening on port 6697 too, not only about 6667\n\n## Fixes\n* webadmin: When confirming deletion of a network and selecting No, redirect to the edituser page instead of listusers page\n* Make more client command results translateable, which were missed before\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.8.1 (2020-05-07)\n\nFixed bug introduced in ZNC 1.8.0:\n\nAuthenticated users can trigger an application crash (with a NULL pointer dereference) if echo-message is not enabled and there is no network. CVE-2020-13775\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.8.0 (2020-05-01)\n\n## New\n* Output of various commands (e.g. `/znc help`) was switched from a table to a list\n* Support IP while verifying SSL certificates\n* Make it more visible that admins have lots of privileges\n\n## Fixes\n* Fix parsing of channel modes when the last parameter starts with a colon, improving compatibility with InspIRCd v3\n* Fix null dereference on startup when reading invalid config\n* Don't show server passwords on ZNC startup\n* Fix build with newer OpenSSL\n* Fix in-source CMake build\n* Fix echo-message for `status`\n\n## Modules\n* controlpanel: Add already supported NoTrafficTimeout User variable to help output\n* modpython:\n    * Use FindPython3 in addition to pkg-config in CMake to simplify builds on Gentoo when not using emerge\n    * Support python 3.9\n* modtcl: Added GetNetworkName\n* partyline: Module is removed\n* q: Module is removed\n* route_replies: Handle more numerics\n* sasl: Fix sending of long authentication information\n* shell: Unblock signals when spawning child processes\n* simple_away: Convert to UTC time\n* watch: Better support multiple clients\n* webadmin: Better wording for TrustPKI setting\n\n## Internal\n* Refactor the way how SSL certificate is checked to simplify future socket-related refactors\n* Build integration test and ZNC itself with the same compiler (https://bugs.gentoo.org/699258)\n* Various improvements for translation CI\n* Normalize variable name sUserName/sUsername\n* Make de-escaping less lenient\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.7.5 (2019-09-23)\n\n* modpython: Add support for Python 3.8\n* modtcl: install .tcl files when building with CMake\n* nickserv: report success of Clear commands\n* Update translations, add Italian, Bulgarian, fix name of Dutch\n* Update error messages to be clearer\n* Add a deprecation warning to ./configure to use CMake instead in addition to an already existing warning in README\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.7.4 (2019-06-19)\n\n## Fixes\n* This is a security release to fix CVE-2019-12816 (remote code execution by existing non-admin users). Thanks to Jeriko One for the bugreport.\n* Send \"Connected!\" messages to client to the correct nick.\n\n# Internal\n* Increase znc-buildmod timeout in the test.\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.7.3 (2019-03-30)\n\n## Fixes\nThis is a security release to fix CVE-2019-9917.

Minimum supported CMake version is 3.1. For now ZNC can be built with either CMake or autoconf. In future autoconf is going to be removed. \n    * Currently `znc-buildmod` requires python if CMake was used; if that's a concern for you, please open a bug.\n* Increase minimum GCC version from 4.7 to 4.8. Minimum Clang version stays at 3.2.\n* Make ZNC UI translateable to different languages (only with CMake), add partial Russian and German translations.\n    * If you want to translate ZNC to your language, please join https://crowdin.com/project/znc-bouncer\n* Configs written before ZNC 0.206 can't be read anymore\n* Implement IRCv3.2 capabilities `away-notify`, `account-notify`, `extended-join`\n* Implement IRCv3.2 capabilities `echo-message`, `cap-notify` on the \"client side\"\n* Update capability names as they are named in IRCv3.2: `znc.in/server-time-iso`→`server-time`, `znc.in/batch`→`batch`. Old names will continue working for a while, then will be removed in some future version.\n* Make ZNC request `server-time` from server when available\n* Increase accepted line length from 1024 to 2048 to give some space to message tags\n* Separate buffer size settings for channels and queries\n* Support separate `SSLKeyFile` and `SSLDHParamFile` configuration in addition to existing `SSLCertFile`\n* Add \"AuthOnlyViaModule\" global/user setting\n* Added pyeval module\n* Added stripcontrols module\n* Add new substitutions to ExpandString: `%empty%` and `%network%`.\n* Stop defaulting real name to \"Got ZNC?\"\n* Make the user aware that debug mode is enabled.\n* Added `ClearAllBuffers` command\n* Don't require CSRF token for POSTs if the request uses HTTP Basic auth.\n* Set `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=strict` for session cookies\n* Add SNI SSL client support\n* Add support for CIDR notation in allowed hosts list and in trusted proxy list\n* Add network-specific config for cert validation in addition to user-supplied fingerprints: `TrustAllCerts`, defaults to false, and `TrustPKI`, defaults to true.\n* Add `/attach` command for symmetry with `/detach`. Unlike `/join` it allows wildcards.\n* Timestamp format now supports sub-second precision with `%f`. Used in awaystore, listsockets, log modules and buffer playback when client doesn't support server-time\n* Build on macOS using ICU, Python, and OpenSSL from Homebrew, if available\n* Remove `--with-openssl=/path` option from ./configure. SSL is still supported and is still configurable\n\n## Fixes\n* Revert tables to how they were in ZNC 1.4\n* Remove flawed Add/Del/ListBindHost(s). They didn't correctly do what they were intended for, but users often confused them with the SetBindHost option. SetBindHost still works.\n* Fix disconnection issues when being behind NAT by decreasing the interval how often PING is sent and making it configurable via a setting to change ping timeout time\n* Change default flood rates to match RFC1459, prevent excess flood problems\n* Match channel names and hostmasks case-insensitively in autoattach, autocycle, autoop, autovoice, log, watch modules\n* Fix crash in shell module which happens if client disconnects at a wrong time\n* Decrease CPU usage when joining channels during startup or reconnect, add config write delay setting\n* Always send the users name in NOTICE when logging in.\n* Don't try to quit multiple times\n* Don't send PART to client which sent QUIT\n* Send failed logins to NOTICE instead of PRIVMSG\n* Stop creating files with odd permissions on Solaris\n* Save channel key on JOIN even if user was not on the channel yet\n* Stop buffering and echoing CTCP requests and responses to other clients with self-message, except for /me\n* Support discovery of tcl 8.6 during `./configure`\n\n## Modules\n* adminlog:\n    * Make path configurable\n* alias:\n    * Add `Dump` command to copy your config between users\n* awaystore:\n    * Add `-chans` option which records channel highlights\n* blockmotd:\n    * Add `GetMotd` command\n* clearbufferonmsg:\n    * Add options which events trigger clearation of buffers.\n* controlpanel:\n    * Add the `DelServer` command.\n    * Add `$user` and `$network` aliases for `$me` and `$net` respectively\n    * Allow reseting channel-specific `AutoClearChanBuffer` and `BufferSize` settings by setting them to `-`\n    * Change type of values from \"double\" to \"number\", which is more obvious for non-programmers\n* crypt:\n    * Fix build with LibreSSL\n    * Cover notices, actions and topics\n    * Don't use the same or overlapping NickPrefix as StatusPrefix\n    * Add DH1080 key exchange\n    * Add Get/SetNickPrefix commands, hide the internal keyword from ListKeys\n* cyrusauth:\n    * Improve UI\n* fail2ban:\n    * Make timeout and attempts configurable, add BAN, UNBAN and LIST commands\n* flooddetach:\n    * Detach on nick floods\n* keepnick:\n    * Improve behaviour by listening to ircd-side numeric errors\n* log:\n    * Add `-timestamp` option\n    * Add options to hide joins, quits and nick changes.\n    * Stop forcing username and network name to be lower case in filenames\n    * Log user quit messages\n* missingmotd:\n    * Include nick in IRC numeric 422 command, reduce client confusion\n* modperl:\n    * Provide `operator \"\"` for `ZNC::String`\n    * Honor `PERL5LIB` env var\n    * Fix functions like `HasPerm()` which accept `char`\n    * When a broken module couldn't be loaded, it couldn't be loaded anymore even if it was fixed later.\n    * Force strings to UTF-8 in modperl to fix double encoding during concatenation/interpolation.\n* modpython:\n    * Require ZNC to be built with encodings support\n    * Disable legacy encoding mode when modpython is loaded.\n    * Support `CQuery` and `CServer`\n* nickserv:\n    * Use `/nickserv identify` by default instead of `/msg nickserv`.\n    * Support messages from X3 services\n* notify_connect:\n    * Show client identification\n* sasl:\n    * Add web interface\n    * Enable all known mechanisms by default\n    * Make the first requirement for SET actually mandatory, return information about settings if no input for SET\n* schat:\n    * Require explicit path to certificate.\n* simple_away:\n    * Use ExpandString for away reason, rename old `%s` to `%awaytime%`\n    * Add `MinClients` option\n* stickychan:\n    * Save registry on every stick/unstick action, auto-save if channel key changes\n    * Stop checking so often, increase delay to once every 3 minutes\n* webadmin:\n    * Make server editor and CTCP replies editor more fancy, when JS is enabled\n    * Make tables sortable. \n    * Allow reseting chan buffer size by entering an empty value\n    * Show per-network traffic info\n    * Make the traffic info page visible for non-admins, non-admins can see only their traffic\n\n## Internal\n* Stop pretending that ZNC ABI is stable, when it's not.

It was broken for a long time, but\n  started segfaulting only now. This is a useability fix, not a security fix,\n  because self-signed (or signed by a CA) certificates can be created\n  without using `--makepem`, and then combined into znc.pem.\n* Fix build on Cygwin.\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.6.5 (2017-03-12)\n\n## Fixes\n\n* Fixed a regression of 1.6.4 which caused a crash in modperl/modpython.\n* Fixed the behavior of `verbose` command in the sasl module.\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.6.4 (2016-12-10)\n\n## Fixes\n\n* Fixed build with OpenSSL 1.1.\n* Fixed build on Cygwin.\n* Fixed a segfault after cloning a user. The bug was introduced in ZNC 1.6.0.\n* Fixed a segfault when deleting a user or network which is waiting for DNS\n  during connection. The bug was introduced in ZNC 1.0.\n* Fixed a segfault which could be triggered using alias module.\n* Fixed an error in controlpanel module when setting the bindhost of another user.\n* Fixed route_replies to not cause client to disconnect by timeout.\n* Fixed compatibility with the Gitter IRC bridge.\n\n## Internal\n* Fixed `OnInvite` for modpython and modperl.\n* Fixed external location of GoogleTest for `make test`.\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.6.3 (2016-02-23)\n\n## Core\n* New character encoding is now applied immediately, without reconnect.\n* Fixed build with LibreSSL.\n* Fixed error 404 when accessing the web UI with the configured URI prefix,\n  but without the `/` in the end.\n* `znc-buildmod` now exits with non-zero exit code when the .cpp file is not found.\n* Fixed `znc-buildmod` on Cygwin.\n* ExpandString got expanded. It now expands `%znc%` to\n  `ZNC <version> - http://znc.in`, honoring the global \"Hide version\" setting.\n* Default quit message is switched from `ZNC <version> - http://znc.in` to `%znc%`,\n  which is the same, but \"automatically\" changes the shown version when ZNC gets upgraded.\n  Before, the old version was recorded in the user's quit message, and stayed the same\n  regardless of the current version of ZNC.\n\n## Modules\n* modperl:\n    * Fixed a memory leak.\n* sasl:\n    * Added an option to show which mechanisms failed or succeeded.\n* webadmin:\n    * Fixed an error message on invalid user settings to say what exactly was invalid.\n    * No more autocomplete password in user settings. It led to an error when ZNC\n      thought the user is going to change a password, but the passwords didn't match.\n\n\n\n# ZNC 1.6.2 (2015-11-15)\n\n## Fixes\n\n* Fixed a use-after-delete in webadmin.

Default ciphers are what Mozilla advices: https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Intermediate_compatibility_.28default.29\n* Validate SSL certificates.\n* Allow clients to specify an ID as part of username (user[@identifier][/network]). Currently not used, but modules can use it.\n* Add alias module for ZNC-side command interception and processing.\n* Support character encodings with separate settings for networks, and for clients. It replaces older charset module, which didn't work well with webadmin, log and other modules.\n* Support X-Forwarded-For HTTP header, used with new TrustedProxy setting.\n* Add URIPrefix option for HTTP listeners, used with reverse proxy.\n* Store query buffers per query the same way it's done for channels, add new option AutoClearQueryBuffer.\n* Add DisableChan command to *status, it was available only in webadmin before.\n* Allow wildcards in arguments of Help commands of *status and various modules.\n* Support IRCv3.2 batches, used for buffer playbacks.\n* Support IRCv3.2 self-message.\n* Remove awaynick module. It's considered bad etiquette.\n* Add JoinDelay setting, which allows a delay between connection to server, and joining first channel. By default it joins immediately after connect.\n* Make Detach, EnableChan and DisableChan commands of *status accept multiple channels.\n* znc-buildmod: Build output to the current working directory.\n* Wrap long lines in tables (e.g. in Help or ListAvailMods commands).\n* Support ECDHE if available in OpenSSL.\n* Report ZNC version more consistently, add HideVersion setting, which hides ZNC version from public.\n* Bump compiler requirements to support C++11. This means GCC 4.7+, Clang 3.2+, SWIG 3.0.0+.\n\n\n## Fixes\n\n* Disable TLS compression.\n* Disallow setting ConnectDelay to zero, don't hammer server with our failed connects.\n* Simplify --makeconf.\n* Fix logic to find an available nick when connecting to server.\n* Fix handling of CTCP flood.\n* Allow network specific quit messages.\n* Make various text labels gender-neutral.\n* Fix finding SWIG 3 on FreeBSD.\n* Handle multi-receiver NOTICE and PRIVMSG.\n* Make channels follow user-level settings when appropriate.\n* Write disabled status to config for disabled channels.\n* Fix double output in messages from modules.\n* Fix memory leak in gzip compression in HTTP server.\n* Use random DNS result instead of choosing the same one every time.\n* Fix HTTP basic auth.\n* Mention network in message shown if client didn't send PASS.\n\n\n## Modules\n\n* autoattach:\n    * Make it also a network module.\n* autoreply:\n    * Use NOTICE instead of PRIVMSG.\n* autoop:\n    * Add support for multiple hostmasks per user.\n* awaystore:\n    * Store CTCP ACTIONs too.\n    * Reset timer and return from away when a client does a CTCP ACTION.\n    * Allows use of strftime formatting in away messages.\n* bouncedcc:\n    * Fix quotes in file names.\n    * Fix check for \"Connected\" state.\n* buffextras:\n    * Make it also a network module.\n* chansaver:\n    * Fix saving channel keys.\n    * Add support for loading as a global module.\n* controlpanel:\n    * Add AddChan, DelChan commands, useful for admins to edit other users' channels, was available only in webadmin before.\n    * Check if adding a new channel succeeded.\n    * Revise Help output.\n    * Allow wildcards for GetChan and SetChan.\n* flooddetach:\n    * Show current value in Lines and Secs commands.\n    * Add Silent [yes|no] command, similar to route_replies.\n* listsockets:\n    * Show traffic stats.\n* log:\n    * Use only lower case characters in log filenames.\n    * Use directories and YYYY-MM-DD filename by default.\n    * Add support for logging rules.

Also, you can switch between different networks on the fly using the /znc JumpNetwork command.\n\nWhen you first run ZNC 1.0, it will automatically convert your config and create a network called \"default\" for each user. Settings from each user are moved into these \"default\" networks. When you log into ZNC without setting a network, the \"default\" network will automatically be chosen for you.\n\nUsers can create new networks up to an admin-configurable limit. By default, this limit is one network per user.\n\nExisting user-per-network setups can be migrated to the new multinetwork setup using the /znc MoveNetwork command.\n\nYou can see a list of networks via /znc ListNetworks and /znc ListAllUserNetworks.\n\n## Timezones\nTimezone can now be configured by name, e.g. \"GMT-9\", or \"Europe/Madrid\". Old TimezoneOffset setting (which was the number of hours between the server's timezone and the user's timezone) is deprecated and should not be used anymore. Its old value is lost. The reason for this change is that the old TimezoneOffset was not trivial to count and often broke during switches to/from daylight savings time.\n\nSo if you previously used the TimezoneOffset option, you now have to configure your timezone again (via the webadmin or controlpanel module).\n\n## No more ZNC-Extra\nMost modules from ZNC-Extra are now enabled in the usual installation. It was pointless to have them shipped in the tarball, but requiring user to add some weird flags to ./configure.\n\nAntiidle, fakeonline and motdfile modules are dropped.\n\nAway module is renamed to awaystore to better explain its meaning.\n\n## Fixes\n* Don't try IPv6 servers when IPv6 isn't available. Use threads for non-blocking DNS instead of c-ares.\n* Fix debug output of identfile.\n* Don't forward WHO replies with multi-prefix to clients which don't support multi-prefix\n* Send nick changes to clients before we call the OnNick module hook\n* Don't connect to SSLed IRC servers when ZNC is compiled without SSL support\n* Fix check for visibility support in the compiler\n* Fix compilation on cygwin again, including modperl and modpython\n* Support parting several channels at once\n* Fix a crash in admin (now controlpanel) module\n* Fix webadmin to deny setting a bindhost that is not on the global list of allowed bindhosts.\n* Fix using empty value for defaults in user page in webadmin.\n\n## Minor Stuff\n* Rename admin module to controlpanel to make it clearer that it's not the same as admin flag of a user.\n* Add protection from flood. If you send multiple lines at once, they will be slowed down, so that the server will not disconnect ZNC due to flood. It can be configured and can be completely turned off. Default settings are: 1 line per second, first 4 lines are sent at once.\n* Modules can support several types now: a module can be loaded as a user module, as a network module and as a global module, if the module supports these types.\n* Rename (non-)KeepBuffer to AutoClearChanBuffer\n* Process starttls numeric\n* Improvements to modperl, modpython, modtcl.\n* Add timestamps to znc --debug\n* Listeners editor in webadmin\n* Add sasl module which uses SASL to authenticate to NickServ.\n* Rename saslauth to cyrusauth, to make it clearer that it's not needed to do SASL authentication to NickServ.\n* Modules get a way to describe their arguments.\n* webadmin: allow editing of the bindhost without global list.\n* Don't send our password required notice until after CAP negotiation\n* Rewrite the JOIN channel logic, dropping MaxJoins\n* Support messages directed to specific user prefixes (like /msg @#channel Hello)\n* Show link to http://znc.in/ from web as a link. It was plain text before.\n* Webadmin: use HTML5 numeric inputs for numbers.\n* Add SSL/IPv6/DNS info to znc --version\n* Clarify that only admins can load the shell module.\n* cyrusauth: Allow creating new users on first login\n* Clear channel buffers when keep buffer is disabled if we're online\n* send_raw: Add a command to send a line to the current client\n* webadmin: Implement clone user\n* autoreply: Honor RFC 2812.\n* Add 381 to the buffer (\"You are now an IRC Operator\")\n* identfile: Pause the connection queue while we have a locked file\n* Add ShowBindHost command\n* autoop: Check for autoops when we get op status\n* Improvements and fixes to the partyline module\n* partyline Drop support for fixed channels\n* Check that there're modules available on startup. Check if ZNC is installed or not.\n* Modified description field for bouncedcc module to explain what the module actually does.\n* nickserv: add support for nickserv requests on wenet.ru and rusnet.\n* send 422 event if MOTD buffer is empty\n* route_replies: Handle much more replies\n* Clear text colors before appending timestamps to buffer lines, add space before AppendTimestamp for colorless lines.\n* Don't replace our motd with a different servers motd\n* webadmin: Add a \"Disabled\" checkbox for channels\n* Send a 464 ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH to clients that did not supply a password\n* Separate compilation and linking for modules.\n* Trim spaces from end of commands to autoattach.\n* nickserv: add ghost, recover and release\n* Warn if config was saved in a newer ZNC version.\n* Backup znc.conf when upgrading ZNC.\n\n## Internal Stuff\n* #include <znc/...h> instead of #include \"...h\"\n* Add string formatting function with named params.\n* Python, perl: support global, user, network modules.\n* Csock: able use non-int number of secs for timer.\n* CString(\"off\").ToBool() shouldn't be true\n* Python: Override __eq__ to allow comparison of strings\n* python: Allow iterating over CModules\n* Add methods to CModule to get the web path\n* Rework modperl to better integrate with perl.\n* Store all 005 values in a map.\n* Python: Use znc.Socket if no socket class is specified in CreateSocket()\n* CZNC::WriteConfig(): Better --debug output\n* Slight refactor of CBuffer & CBufLine.\n* Implemented an OnInvite hook\n* Allow a client to become \"away\"\n* Create a connection queue\n* Set default TrimPrefix to \":\"\n* Add a config writer\n* Wrap MODULECALL macros in a do-while\n* Don't require CTimer's label to be unique if its empty\n* Allow loading python

(r2050)\n* The traffic stats caused a NULL pointer dereference if there were any unauthenticated connections. CVE-2010-2488 (r2051)\n* Csocket had a bug where a wrong error message was generated and one that caused busy loops with c-ares. (r2053)\n\n# ZNC 0.090 (2010-06-06)\n\n## Upgrading from previous versions\n\n## Errors during start-up\nThe shell, email and imapauth modules have been moved from the regular module set to the \"extra\" set, you have to use --enable-extra with ./configure to compile them.\n\nSo, to fix these errors, edit the znc.conf file in ~/.znc/configs and don't load those modules, or recompile znc with extra.\n\n### WebMods\nWhile previously only the \"webadmin\" provided an HTTP server/interface, the HTTP server is now integrated into ZNC's core. This means that all modules (not only webadmin) can now provide web pages. Examples shipping with ZNC are lastseen, stickychan and notes. Old-style module arguments to webadmin will be automatically converted to the new syntax.\n\nPlease note that the WebMods interface uses session cookies instead of 'Basic' HTTP authentication.\n\nAll URLs to webadmin's settings pages have changed. Please adjust your scripts etc. if necessary.\n\n### Running without installing\nIf you want to run ZNC without doing make install, i.e. if you want to run it from the source dir, you will have to add --enable-run-from-source as an argument to ./configure. You do not have to care about this if you use a --prefix= or if you install ZNC system-wide.\n\n### I upgraded and WebAdmin/WebMods is acting weird, Log Out does not work.\nStarting with 0.090, ZNC uses cookies instead of HTTP Basic authentication. If your browser is still sending the Basic credentials to ZNC, e.g. because you have saved them in a bookmark, or password manager, or simply haven't restarted your browser in a while, those will continue to work, even after you click the Log Out button.\n\nTo fix this, remove any user:pass@host portions from your bookmarks, remove all entries for ZNC's web interface from your password manager, and restart your browser.\n\n## New stuff\n* Webmods - Every module can now provide its own webpages.

(r1670)\n\n## Fixes\n* Allow specifing port and password for delserver. (r1640)\n* Write the config file on restart and shutdown. (r1641)\n* Disable c-ares if it is not found unless --enable-c-ares was used. (r1644) (r1645)\n* blockuser was missing an admin check. (r1648)\n* Sometimes, removing a server caused znc to lose track of which server it is connected to. (r1659)\n* Include a more portable header for uint32_t in SHA256.h. (r1665)\n* Fixed cases where ZNC didn't properly block PONG replies to its own PINGs. (r1668)\n* Fixed a possible crash if a client disconnected before an auth module was able to verify the login. (r1669)\n* Away allowed to accidentally execute IRC commands. (r1672)\n* Correctly bind to named hosts if c-ares is enabled. (r1673)\n* Don't accept only spaces as QuitMsg because this would cause an invalid config to be written out. (r1675)\n\n## Minor stuff\n* Comment out some weird code in Client.cpp. (r1646)\n* Remove connect_throttle since it's obsoleted by fail2ban. (r1649)\n* Remove outdated sample znc.conf.

(r1663)\n\n# ZNC 0.076 (2009-09-24)\n\n## New stuff\n* Add a make uninstall Makefile target. (r1580)\n* Imported modules from znc-extra: fixfreenode, buffextras, autoreply, route_replies, adminlog. (r1591) (r1592) (r1593) (r1594) (r1595)\n* Imported the rest of znc-extra under modules/extra hidden behind configure's --enable-extra. (r1605) (r1606) (r1608) (r1609) (r1610)\n* ZNC now uses SHA-256 instead of MD5 for hashing passwords. MD5 hashes still work correctly. (r1618)\n\n## Fixes\n* Don't cache duplicate raw 005 (e.g. due to /version). (r1579)\n* Send a MODE removing all user modes to clients when we lose the irc connection. (r1583)\n* Use a nickmask instead of a nick as the source for ZNC-generated MODE commands. (r1584)\n* Use the right error codes if startup fails. (r1585)\n* Fix a NULL pointer dereference in some of the ares-specific code. (r1586)\n* VHost and Motd input boxes in graphiX and dark-clouds in webadmin didn't insert newlines.

(r1627)\n* CUser::Clone now handles modules after all other settings, making it work with shell. (r1628)\n* Some CSS selectors in webadmin's dark-clouds and graphiX skins were wrong. (r1631)\n* The help of admin was improved. (r1632) (r1633)\n\n## Minor stuff\n* make distclean now also removes the pkg-config files. (r1581)\n* Add the autoconf check for large file support. (r1587)\n* Generic \"not enough arguments\" support for route_replies and some fix for /lusers. (r1598) (r1600)\n* ZNC now tries to join channels in random order. (r1601) (r1602) (r1603)\n* route_replies now handles \"No such channel\" for /names. (r1614)\n* Fixes a theoretical crash on shutdown. (r1624)\n* saslauth was moved to znc-extra. (r1626)\n\n## Internal stuff\n* Now using autoconf 2.64. (r1604)\n* Removed unused classes CNoCopy and CSafePtr. (r1607)\n* Moved CZNC::FindModPath() to CModules. (r1611)\n* Added CModules::GetModDirs() as a central place for finding module dirs. (r1612) (r1629)\n* Added CModules::GetModPathInfo() which works like GetModInfo() but which takes the full path to the module. (r1613)\n* Updated to latest Csocket which adds openssl 1.0 compatibility and fixes some minor bug. (r1615) (r1621)\n* Merged the internal join and ping timers. (r1622) (r1623)\n\n# ZNC 0.074 (2009-07-23)\n\n## Fixes\n* Fix a regression due to (r1569): Webadmin was broken if the skins were accessed through an absolute path (=almost always). (r1574)\n* Fix a possible crash if users are deleted while they have active DCC sockets. (r1575)\n\nSorry for breaking your webadmin experience guys. :(\n\n# ZNC 0.072 (2009-07-21)\n\nAll webadmin skins are broken in this release due to a bug in webadmin itself. This is fixed in the next release.\n\nHigh-impact security bugs\nThere was a path traversal bug in ZNC which allowed attackers write access to any place to which ZNC has write access. The attacker only needed a user account (with BounceDCCs enabled). Details are in the commit message. (r1570)\n\nThis is CVE-2009-2658.\n\nAffected versions\nAll ZNC versions since ZNC 0.022 (Initial import in SVN) are affected.\n\n## New stuff\n* /msg *status uptime is now accessible to everyone.

(r1574)\n* Fix a possible crash if users are deleted while they are connecting to IRC. (r1557)\n* Limit HTTP POST data to 1 MiB. (r1559)\n* OnStatusCommand() wasn't called for commands executed via /znc. (r1562)\n* On systems where sizeof(off_t) is 4, all ZNC-originated DCCs failed with \"File too large (>4 GiB)\". (r1568)\n* ZNC didn't properly verify paths when checking for directory traversal attacks (Low impact). (r1569)\n\n## Minor stuff\n* Minor speed optimizations. (r1527) (r1532)\n* stickychan now accepts a channel list as module arguments. (r1534)\n* Added a clear command to nickserv. (r1554)\n* Added an execute command to perform.

(r1536)\n* Stuff. (r1537) (r1550)\n* EMFILE in CSockets is handled by closing the socket. (r1544)\n* Special thanks to cnu and flakes!\n\n# ZNC 0.070 (2009-05-23)\n\n## New stuff\n* Add a CloneUser command to admin. (r1477)\n* Make webadmin work better with browser caches in conjunction with changing skins. (r1481) (r1482)\n* Better error messages if binding a listening port fails. (r1483)\n* admin module now supports per-channel settings. (r1484)\n* Fix the KICK that partyline generates when a user is deleted. (r1486)\n* fail2ban now allows a couple of login attempts before an IP is banned. (r1489)\n* Fixed a crash bug in stickychan. (r1500)\n* Install a pkg-config .pc file.

(r1402)\n* A user is now always notified for failed logins to his account. This now also works with auth modules like imapauth. (r1415) (r1416)\n* Added /msg *status UpdateModule <mod> which reloads an user module on all users. (r1418) (r1419)\n* A module whose version doesn't match the current ZNC version is now marked as such in ListAvailModules and friends. (r1420)\n* Added a Set password command to admin. (r1423) (r1424)\n* ZNC no longer uses znc.conf-backup. (r1432)\n* Two new command line options were added to ZNC:\n* ZNC --foreground and znc -f stop ZNC from forking into the background. (r1441)\n* ZNC --debug and znc -D produce output as if ZNC was compiled with --enable-debug. (r1442) (r1443)\n\n## Fixes\n* cd in shell works again. (r1401)\n* Make WALLOPS properly honour KeepBuffer. Before this, they were always added to the replay buffer. (r1405)\n* ZNC now handles raw 432 Illegal Nickname when trying to login to IRC and sends its AltNick. (r1425)\n* Fix a crash with recursion in module calls. (r1438)\n* Fixed some compiler warnings with -Wmissing-declarations. (r1439)\n\n## Minor stuff\n* Allow a leading colon on client's PASS commands. (r1403)\n* CFile::IsDir() failed on \"/\". (r1404)\n* CZNC::AddUser() now always returns a useful error description. (r1406)\n* Some micro-optimizations. (r1408) (r1409)\n* The new default for JoinTries is 10. This should help some excess flood problems. (r1411)\n* All webadmin skins must now reside inside the webadmin skins dir or they are rejected. (r1412)\n* Watch now saves its module settings as soon as possible, to prevent data loss on unclean shutdown. (r1413) (r1414)\n* Regenerated configure with autoconf 2.63. (r1426)\n* Some dead code elimination. (r1435)\n* Clean up znc -n output a little. (r1437)\n\n## Internal stuff\n* CString::Base64Decode() now strips newlines.

(r1431)\n\n# ZNC 0.066 (2009-02-24)\n\nThere was a privilege escalation bug in webadmin which could allow all ZNC users to write to znc.conf. They could gain shell access through this. (r1395) (r1396)\n\nThis is CVE-2009-0759.\n\n## Affected versions\nThis bug affects all versions of ZNC which include the webadmin module. Let's just say this affects every ZNC version, ok? ;)\n\n## Who can use this bug?\nFirst, ZNC must have the webadmin module loaded and accessible to the outside. Now any user who already has a valid login can exploit this bug.\n\nAn admin must help (unknowingly) to trigger this bug by reloading the config.\n\n## Impact\nThrough this bug users can write arbitrary strings to the znc.conf file.\n\nUnprivileged ZNC users can make themselves admin and load the shell module to gain shell access.\nUnprivileged ZNC users can temporarily overwrite any file ZNC has write access to via ISpoof. This can be used to overwrite ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and gain shell access.\nUnprivileged ZNC users can permanently truncate any file to which ZNC has write access via ISpoof. ZNC never saves more than 1kB for restoring the ISpoofFile.\n\n## How can I protect myself?\nUpgrade to ZNC 0.066 or newer or unload webadmin.\n\n## What happens?\nWebadmin doesn't properly validate user input. If you send a manipulated POST request to webadmin's edit user page which includes newlines in e.g. the QuitMessage field, this field will be written unmodified to the config. This way you can add new lines to znc.conf. The new lines will not be parsed until the next rehash or restart.\n\nThis can be done with nearly all input fields in webadmin. Because every user can modify himself via webadmin, every user can exploit this bug.\n\n## Thanks\nThanks to cnu for finding and reporting this bug.\n\n## New stuff\n* Added the admin module. (r1379) (r1386)\n* savebuff and away no longer ask for a password on startup. (r1388)\n* Added the fail2ban module. (r1390)\n\n## Fixes\n* savebuff now also works with KeepBuffer turned off. (r1384)\n* webadmin did not properly escape module description which could allow XSS attacks. (r1391)\n* Fix some \"use of uninitialized variable\" warnings. (r1392)\n* Check the return value of strftime(). This allowed reading stack memory. (r1394)\n\n## Minor stuff\n* Some dead code elimination. (r1381)\n* Don't have two places where the version number is defined. (r1382)\n\n## Internal stuff\n* Removed some useless and unused CFile members. (r1383)\n* Removed the DEBUG_ONLY define. (r1385)\n* OnFailedLogin() is now called for all failed logins, not only failed IRC ones. This changes CAuthBase API. (r1389)\n\n# ZNC 0.064 (2009-02-16)\n\n## New stuff\n* schat now prints a message if a client connects and there are still some active schats. (r1282)\n* awaynick: Set awaynick on connect, not after some time. (r1291)\n* Allow adding new servers through /msg *status addserver even if a server with the same name but e.g. a different port is already added. (r1295) (r1296)\n* Show the current server in /msg *status listservers with a star. (r1308)\n* /msg *status listmods now displays the module's arguments instead of its description. Use listavailmods for the description. (r1310)\n* ZNC now updates the channel buffers for detached channels and thus gives a buffer replay when you reattach. (r1325)\n* watch now adds timestamps to messages it adds to the playback buffers. (r1333)\n* ZNC should now work on cygwin out of the box (use --disable-ipv6). (r1351)\n* Webadmin will handle all HTTP requests on the irc ports. (r1368) (r1375)\n\n## Fixes\n* Handle read errors in CFile::Copy() instead of going into an endless loop. (r1280) (r1287)\n* Make schat work properly again and clean it up a little. (r1281) (r1303)\n* Removed all calls to getcwd(). We now no longer depend on PATH_MAX. (r1286)\n* stickychan: Don't try to join channels if we are not connected to IRC. (r1298)\n* watch now saved its settings. (r1304)\n* Don't forward PONG replies that we requested to the user. (r1309)\n* awaynick evaluated the awaynick multiple times and thus didn't set the nick back. (r1313)\n* znc-config --version said '@VERSION@' instead of the actual version number. (r1319)\n* Handle JOIN redirects due to +L. (r1327)\n* Remove the length restrictions on webadmin's password fields which led to silent password truncation. (r1330)\n* Webadmin now reloads global modules if you change their arguments. (r1331)\n* The main binary is no longer built with position independent code. (r1338)\n* ZNC failed to bounce DCCs if its own ip started with a value above 127. (r1340)\n* Savebuff no longer reloads old channel buffers if you did /msg *status clearbuffer. (r1345)\n* Some work has been done to make ZNC work with mingw (It doesn't work out of the box yet). (r1339) (r1341) (r1342) (r1343) (r1344) (r1354) (r1355) (r1356) (r1358) (r1359)\n* modperl used huge amounts of memory after some time. This is now fixed. (r1357)\n* shell now generates error messages if e.g. fork() fails. (r1369)\n* If the allowed buffer size is lowered, the buffer is now automatically shrunk. (r1371)\n* webadmin now refuses to transfer files bigger than 16 MiB, because it would block ZNC. (r1374)\n\n## Minor stuff\n* Only reply to /mode requests if we actually know the answer. (r1290)\n* Lowered some timeouts. (r1297)\n* Memory usage optimizations. (r1300) (r1301) (r1302)\n* Allow custom compiler flags in znc-buildmod via the $CXXFLAGS and $LIBS environment flags. (r1312)\n* Show the client's IP in debug output if no username is available yet. (r1315)\n* Allow /msg *status setbuffer for channels we are currently not on. (r1323)\n* Updated the README. (r1326)\n* Use @includedir@ instead of @prefix@/include in the Makefile. (r1328)\n* Use RTLD_NOW for loading modules instead of RTLD_LAZY which could take down the bouncer. (r1332)\n* Use stat() instead of lstat() if the later one isn't available. (r1339)\n* CExecSock now generates an error message if execvp() fails. (r1362)\n* Improved some error messages. (r1367)\n\n## Internal stuff\n* Add traffic tracking support to CSocket. Every module that uses CSocket now automatically gets the traffic it causes tracked. (r1283)\n* Add VERSION_MINOR and VERSION_MAJOR defines. (r1284) (r1285)\n* Rework CZNC::Get*Path() a little. (r1289) (r1292) (r1299)\n* Remove the IPv6 stuff from CServer. It wasn't used at all. (r1294)\n* Make email use CSocket instead of Csock. (r1305)\n* Cleaned up and improved CFile::ReadLine() and CChan::AddNicks() a little. (r1306) (r1307)\n* Replaced most calls to strtoul() and atoi() with calls to the appropriate CString members. (r1320)\n* Moved the SetArgs() call before the OnLoad() call so that modules can overwrite there arguments in OnLoad(). (r1329)\n* Let CZNC::AddUser() check if the user name is still free. (r1346)\n* API stuff\n    * Added CModule::IsGlobal(). (r1283)\n    * Added CModule::BeginTimers(), EndTimers(), BeginSockets() and EndSockets(). (r1293)\n    * Added CModule::ClearNV(). (r1304)\n    * Removed ReadFile(), WriteFile(), ReadLine() (Use CFile instead), Lower(), Upper() (Use CString::AsUpper(), ::ToUpper(), ::*Lower() instead) and added CFile::ReadFile() (r1311)\n    * Added CModules::OnUnknownUserRaw(). (r1314)\n    * Added CUtils::SaltedHash() for computing the salted MD5 hashes ZNC uses. (r1324)\n    * Removed CLockFile and made CFile take over its job. (r1337) (r1352) (r1353)\n    * Change the return type to CUtils::GetPass() to CString. (r1343)\n    * Added a DEBUG(f) define that expands to DEBUG_ONLY(cout << f << endl). (r1348) (r1349)\n    * Removed some unused functions and definitions. (r1360) (r1361)\n\n# ZNC 0.062 (2008-12-06)\n\n## New stuff\n* Add --disable-optimization to configure. (r1206)\n* New webadmin skin dark-clouds by bigpresh. (r1210)\n* Added the q module as a replacement for QAuth. (r1217) (r1218)\n* Added an enhanced /znc command: (r1228)\n* /znc jump is equal to /msg *status jump\n* /znc *shell pwd is equal to /msg *shell pwd\n* Webadmin should generate less traffic, because it now uses client-side caching for static data (images, style sheets, ...). (r1248)\n* Changes to the vhost interface from *status: (r1256)\n* New commands: AddVHost, RemVHost and ListVHosts.\n* SetVHost now only accepts vhosts from the ListVHosts list, if it is non-empty.\n* ZNC now should compile and work fine on Mac OS. (r1258)\n* IPv6 is now enabled by default unless you disable it with --disable-ipv6. (r1270)\n\n## Fixes\n* Make keepnick usable. (r1203) (r1209)\n* Don't display 'Your message to .. got lost' for our own nick. (r1211)\n* Fix compile error with GCC 4.3.1 if ssl is disabled. Thanks to sebastinas. (r1212)\n* Limit the maximum buffer space each socket may use to prevent DoS attacks. (r1233)\n* Properly clean the cached perms when you are kicked from a channel.

When you connect to\nZNC you get a buffer replay for each channel which shows what was said\nlast. This option selects the number of lines this replay should consist\nof. Increasing this can greatly increase ZNC's memory usage if you are\nhosting many users. The default value should be fine for most setups.\n\n> Would you like to keep buffers after replay?\n\nIf this is disabled, you get the buffer playback only once and then it is\ndeleted. If this is enabled, the buffer is not deleted. This may be useful\nif you regularly use more than one client to connect to ZNC.\n\n## Using ZNC\n\nOnce you have started ZNC you can connect with your favorite IRC-client to\nZNC. You should use `username:password` as the server password (e.g.\n`/pass user:pass`).\n\nOnce you are connected you can do `/msg *status help` for some commands.\nEvery module you have loaded (`/msg *status listmods`) should additionally\nprovide `/msg *modulename help`\n\n## File Locations\n\nIn its data dir (`~/.znc` is default) ZNC saves most of its data. The only\nexception are modules and module data, which are saved in\n`<prefix>/lib/znc` and `<prefix>/share/znc`, and the znc binary itself.\nMore modules (e.g. if you install some later) can be saved in\n`<data dir>/modules` (-> `~/.znc/modules`).\n\nIn the datadir is only one file:\n\n- `znc.pem` - This is the server certificate ZNC uses for listening and is\ncreated with `znc --makepem`.\n\nThese directories are also in there:\n\n- configs - Contains `znc.conf` (ZNC's config file) and backups of older\n  configs.\n- modules - ZNC also looks in here for a module.\n- moddata - Global modules save their settings here.\n  (e.g. webadmin saves the current skin name in here)\n- users   - This is per-user data and mainly contains just a moddata\n  directory and a directory for each network configured.\n\n## ZNC's config file\n\nThis file shouldn't be too hard too understand. An explanation of all the\nitems can be found on the\n[Configuration](https://wiki.znc.in/Configuration) page.\n**Warning: it is better not to edit config while ZNC is running.** Use the\n[webadmin] and [controlpanel] modules instead.\n\n[webadmin]:https://wiki.znc.in/Webadmin\n[controlpanel]:https://wiki.znc.in/Controlpanel\n\nIf you changed some settings while ZNC is running, a simple\n`pkill -SIGUSR1 znc` will make ZNC rewrite its config file. Alternatively\nyou can use `/msg *status saveconfig`\n\n## Writing own modules\n\nYou can write your own modules in either C++, python or perl.\n\nC++ modules are compiled by either saving them in the modules source dir\nand running make or with the `znc-buildmod` shell script.\n\nFor additional info look in the wiki:\n\n- [Writing modules](https://wiki.znc.in/Writing_modules)\n\nPerl modules are loaded through the global module\n[ModPerl](https://wiki.znc.in/Modperl).\n\nPython modules are loaded through the global module\n[ModPython](https://wiki.znc.in/Modpython).\n\n## Further information\n\nPlease visit https://znc.in/ or #znc on Libera.Chat if you still have questions:\n- [ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/#znc](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/#znc)\n\nYou can get the latest development version with git:\n`git clone https://github.com/znc/znc.git --recursive`\n"
