Most users should probably [install hotspot](README#getting-hotspot) from the distro\npackage manager or as an [AppImage](README#for-any-linux-distro-appimage).\n\n### Required Dependencies\n\nAs of now, you will need the following dependencies to build this project:\n\n- CMake 3.1.0 or higher\n- any C++11 enabled compiler\n- Qt 5.15.0 or higher\n- libelf\n- libelfutils\n- gettext\n- extra-cmake-modules\n- KDE Frameworks 5 (packages are usually called libkf5-*-devel):\n  - threadweaver\n  - i18n\n  - configwidgets\n  - coreaddons\n  - itemviews\n  - itemmodels\n  - kio\n  - solid\n  - windowsystem\n  - notifications\n  - iconthemes\n  - parts\n  - archive (optional)\n- [KDDockWidgets](https://github.com/KDAB/KDDockWidgets)\n  - this library is not yet packaged on most distributions, you'll have to compile it yourself from source\n\n### On Debian/Ubuntu\n\n```bash\nadd-apt-repository ppa:kubuntu-ppa/backports\napt-get update\napt-get install libkf5threadweaver-dev libkf5i18n-dev libkf5configwidgets-dev libkf5syntaxhighlighting-dev \\\n    libkf5coreaddons-dev libkf5itemviews-dev libkf5itemmodels-dev libkf5kio-dev libkf5parts-dev \\\n    libkf5solid-dev libkf5windowsystem-dev libkf5notifications-dev libkf5iconthemes-dev libelf-dev \\\n    libdw-dev cmake extra-cmake-modules gettext libqt5svg5-dev\n```\n\nNote: Ubuntu 20.04 does not provide the minimal version of QT, if you use this old Ubuntu version then\nyou'd need to _additionally_ install it from a version outside of the distro repository.\nThe automatic builds via GitHub actions [use the following][Ubuntu2004Script] for that:\n\n```bash\n    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:beineri/opt-qt-5.15.4-focal\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get install -y qt515base qt515svg qt515x11extras \\\n        libqt5x11extras5-dev   # this one is optional for Hotspot, but required for KDDockWidgets\n```\n\n[Ubuntu2004Script]:https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/blob/master/scripts/compile-test/BaseUbuntu20.04\n\n### On Fedora\n\n```bash\ndnf install cmake gcc glibc-static gcc-c++ libstdc++-static qt5-qtbase qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtsvg-devel \\\n    extra-cmake-modules elfutils-devel kf5-threadweaver-devel \\\n    kf5-kconfigwidgets-devel kf5-kitemviews-devel kf5-kitemmodels-devel kf5-syntax-highlighting-devel \\\n    kf5-kio-devel kf5-solid-devel kf5-kwindowsystem-devel kf5-kiconthemes-devel \\\n    kf5-knotifications-devel kf5-kparts-devel\n```\n\n### Arch Linux\n\n```bash\npacman -Syu\npacman -S cmake gcc extra-cmake-modules threadweaver kconfigwidgets knotifications syntax-highlighting \\\n    kiconthemes kitemviews kitemmodels kwindowsystem kio kparts solid libelf gettext qt5-base\n```\n\n### OpenSUSE\n\n```bash\nzypper in cmake gcc-c++ extra-cmake-modules threadweaver-devel kio-devel \\\n    solid-devel kcoreaddons-devel threadweaver-devel kconfigwidgets-devel \\\n    kitemmodels-devel kitemviews-devel kwindowsystem-devel kparts-devel syntax-highlighting-devel \\\n    libqt5-qtbase-devel libqt5-qtsvg-devel libelf-devel libdw-devel gettext glibc-devel-static \\\n    knotifications-devel kiconthemes-devel libzstd-devel binutils\n```\n\n### Building Hotspot itself\n\n```bash\ngit clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot.git\nmkdir build-hotspot\ncd build-hotspot\ncmake ../hotspot\nmake\n# now you can run hotspot from the build folder:\n./bin/hotspot\n# or `make install` it and launch it from your $PATH\n```\n\nIf you need help building this project for your platform, [contact us for help](https://www.kdab.com/about/contact/).\n\n## Online\n\nInstead of installing all dependencies and building Hotspot locally you may do so online with the following link:\n[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/GitMensch/hotspot)\nThis environment uses a clean, pre-configured Ubuntu 22.04 LTS environment. Just open, possibly\nhave a look at the multiple building tasks, wait a bit until building is finished which is done\nas soon as a hotspot window opens in the preview and you can start coding / debugging hotspot.\n\nNotes:\n\n- This Gitpod setup is maintained by @GitMensch and not used by @KDAB directly.\n- Building may take a while as we don't use pre-builts or a special docker container in this environment yet.\n\n## Debugging the AppImage\n\nWhen the AppImage crashes or is excessively slow, please provide a usable backtrace or profile run.\n\nIf you're building Hotspot yourself you have the debugging symbols availalbe, when using a distro version\nyou can check with your distribution documentation how to install the debug symbols.\n\nBut debugging is also possible when using the [AppImage](README#for-any-linux-distro-appimage) using debuginfod or\nmanual symbol loading.\n\nTo do that, you will need to download the debuginfo artifact that matches the AppImage you downloaded.\n\n### AppImage-Debugging using manual symbol loading\n\nFor using this approach you need to first unpack the debug information\ndownloaded from the release:\n\n```bash\n$ tar -xvf hotspot-debuginfo-*.tar.bz2\nhotspot-debuginfo-v1.2.3-45-g02fd82c/usr/bin/hotspot\nhotspot-debuginfo-v1.2.3-45-g02fd82c/usr/lib64/libexec/hotspot-perfparser\n```\n\nStarting the debugger is possible directly with executing the AppImage as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ ./hotspot-v1.2.3-45-g02fd82c-x86_64.AppImage &\n$ gdb -q -p $(pidof hotspot) -ex \"add-symbol-file hotspot-debuginfo-v1.2.3-45-g02fd82c/usr/bin/hotspot\"\nAttaching to process 123456\n```\n\nwith a GDB session of\n\n```txt\nReading symbols from /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/squashfs-root/usr/bin/hotspot...\n\n(No debugging symbols found in /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/squashfs-root/usr/bin/hotspot)\nReading symbols from /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/squashfs-root/usr/bin/../lib/libKF5ThreadWeaver.so.5...\n(No debugging symbols found in /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/squashfs-root/usr/bin/../lib/libKF5ThreadWeaver.so.5)\n...\n0x00007fea98ae0a38 in poll () from /usr/lib64/libc.so.6\nadd symbol table from file \"hotspot-debuginfo-v1.2.3-45-g02fd82c/usr/bin/hotspot\"\n(y or n) y\nReading symbols from hotspot-debuginfo-v1.2.3-45-g02fd82c/usr/bin/hotspot...\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x00007ff72544ca38 in poll () from /usr/lib64/libc.so.6\n#1  0x00007ff7246777d7 in _xcb_in_read_block () from /usr/lib64/libxcb.so.1\n#2  0x00007ff7246754e9 in xcb_connect_to_fd () from /usr/lib64/libxcb.so.1\n#3  0x00007ff72467943c in xcb_connect_to_display_with_auth_info () from /usr/lib64/libxcb.so.1\n#4  0x00007ff7283a95ea in _XConnectXCB () from /usr/lib64/libX11.so.6\n#5  0x00007ff728399d89 in XOpenDisplay () from /usr/lib64/libX11.so.6\n#6  0x00007ff70f181527 in QXcbBasicConnection::QXcbBasicConnection(char const*) () from /tmp/squashfs-root/usr/plugins/platforms/../../lib/libQt5XcbQpa.so.5\n#7  0x00007ff70f15b072 in QXcbConnection::QXcbConnection(QXcbNativeInterface*, bool, unsigned int, char const*) ()\n   from /tmp/squashfs-root/usr/plugins/platforms/../../lib/libQt5XcbQpa.so.5\n#8  0x00007ff70f15e588 in QXcbIntegration::QXcbIntegration(QStringList const&, int&, char**) ()\n   from /tmp/squashfs-root/usr/plugins/platforms/../../lib/libQt5XcbQpa.so.5\n#9  0x00007ff7286ad41f in ??

Also note that you cannot debug any QT (or other system) parts\nthis way, only Hotspot itself.\n\n### AppImage-Debugging using debuginfod\n\nTo use debuginfod, you will need to additionally download the docker image from `ghcr.io/kdab/kdesrc-build:latest`.\nFor that you need to authenticate yourself to GitHub. If you have a `ghcr.io` authentication token and\nuse `pass`, you can do that with\n\n```bash\n$ scripts/appimage/download_docker.sh\ndownloading docker image from ghcr.io\nLogin Succeeded\nlatest: Pulling from kdab/kdesrc-build\nDigest: sha256:1be0cdbeff1c8c796b77a4244a1f257e02c4a896fd6add93b7b00a9d76db8727\n...\nghcr.io/kdab/kdesrc-build:latest\nRemoving login credentials for ghcr.io\n```\n\nOnce that is done, you can run the `scripts/appimage/run_debuginfod_in_docker.sh` script as such:\n\n```bash\n$ ./scripts/appimage/run_debuginfod_in_docker ~/Downloads/debuginfo.zip\nunpacking debuginfo...\nhotspot-debuginfo-v1.3.0-391-g590f810/usr/bin/hotspot\nhotspot-debuginfo-v1.3.0-391-g590f810/usr/lib64/libexec/hotspot-perfparser\nstarting debuginfod in docker...\nto use it on your host system, set:\n\n    export DEBUGINFOD_URLS=\"127.0.0.1:12345 https://debuginfod.centos.org/ https://debuginfod.archlinux.org\"\n\n[Fri May 24 19:58:56 2024] (16/16): opened database /opt/app-root/src/.debuginfod.sqlite\n[Fri May 24 19:58:56 2024] (16/16): sqlite version 3.7.17\n[Fri May 24 19:58:56 2024] (16/16): started http server on IPv4 IPv6 port=12345\n...\n```\n\nKeep that `debuginfod` process running. You can now start using the local debuginfod in combination with\nthe official Centos instance to get debug information for all the dependencies and build artifacts of hotspot.\nHere is one example for that using GDB:\n\n```bash\n$ ./hotspot-v1.2.3-45-g02fd82c-x86_64.AppImage &\n$ export DEBUGINFOD_URLS=\"127.0.0.1:12345 https://debuginfod.centos.org/ https://debuginfod.archlinux.org\"\n$ gdb -q -p $(pidof hotspot)\nAttaching to process 123456\n...\n```\n\nwith a GDB session of\n\n```txt\n...\nThis GDB supports auto-downloading debuginfo from the following URLs:\n127.0.0.1:12345 https://debuginfod.centos.org/ https://debuginfod.archlinux.org\nEnable debuginfod for this session? (y or [n]) y\nDebuginfod has been enabled.\nTo make this setting permanent, add 'set debuginfod enabled on' to .gdbinit.\nDownloading 37.95 MB separate debug info for /home/user/Downloads/squashfs-root/usr/bin/hotspot\n...\n(gdb) bt\n#0  0x00007f70bd5140bf in __GI___poll (fds=0x2c83f40, nfds=5, timeout=0) at ../sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/poll.c:29\n#1  0x00007f70b7a4c3fc in g_main_context_iterate.isra () from /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0\n#2  0x00007f70b7a4c52c in g_main_context_iteration () from /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/usr/lib/libglib-2.0.so.0\n#3  0x00007f70bdd08aa4 in QEventDispatcherGlib::processEvents(QFlags<QEventLoop::ProcessEventsFlag>) ()\n   from /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/usr/lib/libQt5Core.so.5\n#4  0x00007f70bdcb361b in QEventLoop::exec(QFlags<QEventLoop::ProcessEventsFlag>) ()\n   from /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/usr/lib/libQt5Core.so.5\n#5  0x00007f70bdcbb26c in QCoreApplication::exec() () from /tmp/.mount_hotspoBCRbef/usr/lib/libQt5Core.so.5\n#6  0x000000000043a23e in main (argc=<optimized out>, argv=<optimized out>) at /__w/hotspot/hotspot/src/main.cpp:194\n(gdb) continue\n```\n\nNote that source files are not supported in this way yet, as that would blow up the size of the docker image\nand thereby slow down our CI.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                       Version 3, 29 June 2007\n\n Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for\nsoftware and other kinds of works.\n\n  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed\nto take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15.

As the first goal, we want to provide a UI like\nKCachegrind around Linux perf. Looking ahead, we intend to support various other\nperformance data formats under this umbrella.\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n<!--\n    TOC generated with https://github.com/jonschlinkert/markdown-toc\n    To update, run `markdown-toc -i README.md`\n-->\n\n<!-- toc -->\n\n- [Screenshots](#screenshots)\n  - [Visualizing Data](#visualizing-data)\n  - [Time Line](#time-line)\n  - [Record Data](#record-data)\n- [Getting Hotspot](#getting-hotspot)\n  - [ArchLinux](#archlinux)\n  - [Debian / Ubuntu](#debian--ubuntu)\n  - [Gentoo](#gentoo)\n  - [Fedora](#fedora)\n  - [For any Linux distro: AppImage](#for-any-linux-distro-appimage)\n- [Building Hotspot](#building-hotspot)\n- [Using](#using)\n  - [Off-CPU Profiling](#off-cpu-profiling)\n  - [Embedded Systems](#embedded-systems)\n  - [Import Export](#import-export)\n  - [tracepoints](#tracepoints)\n  - [Disassembler](#disassembler)\n- [Known Issues](#known-issues)\n  - [Broken Backtraces](#broken-backtraces)\n  - [debuginfod](#debuginfod)\n  - [Missing Features](#missing-features)\n  - [Recording with perf without super user rights](#recording-with-perf-without-super-user-rights)\n  - [Export File Format](#export-file-format)\n- [Qt Creator](#qt-creator)\n- [License](#license)\n\n<!-- tocstop -->\n\n## Screenshots\n\nHere are some screenshots showing the most important features of Hotspot in action:\n\n### Visualizing Data\n\nThe main feature of Hotspot is the graphical visualization of a `perf.data` file.\n\n![hotspot summary page](screenshots/summary.png?raw=true \"Hotspot summary page\")\n\n![hotspot FlameGraph page](screenshots/flamegraph.png?raw=true \"Hotspot FlameGraph page\")\n\nNote: Inlined functions have a darker border than non-inlined ones.\n\n![hotspot off-CPU analysis](screenshots/off-cpu.png?raw=true \"hotspot off-CPU analysis\")\n\n![hotspot caller-callee page](screenshots/caller-callee.png?raw=true \"Hotspot caller-callee page\")\n\n![hotspot bottom-up page](screenshots/bottom-up.png?raw=true \"Hotspot bottom-up page\")\n\n![hotspot top-down page](screenshots/top-down.png?raw=true \"Hotspot top-down page\")\n\n![hotspot dockwidget layouts](screenshots/dockwidgets.png?raw=true\n\"Hotspot with custom dockwidget layout and disassembly view\")\n\n### Time Line\n\nThe time line allows filtering the results by time, process or thread. The data views are updated accordingly.\n\n![hotspot timeline filtering by time](screenshots/timeline-filter-time.png?raw=true\n\"Hotspot timeline filtering by time\")\n\n![hotspot timeline filtering by thread or process](screenshots/timeline-filter-thread.png?raw=true\n\"Hotspot timeline filtering by thread or process\")\n\n![hotspot timeline filtering applied to FlameGraph](screenshots/timeline-flamegraph.png?raw=true\n\"Hotspot timeline filtering also applies to the data views on top, like e.g. the FlameGraph.\nYou can also zoom in on the timeline and inspect individual sample data.\")\n\n### Record Data\n\nYou can also launch `perf` from Hotspot, to profile a newly started application\nor to attach to already running process(es). Do take the\n[caveats below](#recording-with-perf-without-super-user-rights) into account though.\n\n![hotspot launch application](screenshots/record-launch.png?raw=true\n\"Hotspot can launch a new application and profile it with perf from the record page.\")\n\n![hotspot attach to process](screenshots/record-attach.png?raw=true\n\"Hotspot also allows runtime-attaching of perf to existing applications to profile them.\")\n\n## Getting Hotspot\n\n*Note: Hotspot is not yet packaged on all Linux distributions. In such cases, or if you want to use the\nlatest version, please use the AppImage which will work on any recent Linux distro just fine.*\n\n### ArchLinux\n\nHotspot is available in AUR (https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hotspot).\n\n### Debian / Ubuntu\n\nHotspot is available in Debian (https://packages.debian.org/hotspot) and Ubuntu\n(https://packages.ubuntu.com/hotspot).\n\n### Gentoo\n\nHotspot ebuilds are available from our overlay (https://github.com/KDAB/kdab-overlay).\n\n### Fedora\n\nHotspot is available in Fedora (https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/hotspot/hotspot/).\n\n### For any Linux distro: AppImage\n\nYou can either head over to the most [current release](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/releases/latest)\nor the [continuous build](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/releases/tag/continuous).\nIn both cases you'll find the AppImage under \"Assets\" that you can download.\nUntar the AppImage file (in case of the latest release), then make it executable and then run it.\n\nPlease use the latest build to get the most recent version. If it doesn't work, please report a\nbug and test the latest stable version.\n\n*Note: Your system libraries or preferences are not altered. In case you'd like to remove Hotspot again,\nsimply delete the downloaded file. Learn more about AppImage [here](https://appimage.org/).*\n\nTo find out how to debug the AppImage, see [HACKING](HACKING.md#debugging-the-appimage).\n\n## Building Hotspot\n\nBuilding Hotspot from source gives you the latest and greatest, but you'll have to make sure all its\ndependencies are available. Most users should probably [install Hotspot](#getting-hotspot) from the distro\npackage manager or as an [AppImage](#for-any-linux-distro-appimage).\n\nFor everyone that wants to contribute to Hotspot or use the newest version without the AppImage detailed\nnotes are found at [HACKING](HACKING.md#table-of-contents).\n\n## Using\n\n### General\n\nFirst of all, record some data with `perf`. To get backtraces, you will need to enable the dwarf callgraph\nmode:\n\n```bash\nperf record --call-graph dwarf <your application>\n...\n[ perf record: Woken up 58 times to write data ]\n[ perf record: Captured and wrote 14.874 MB perf.data (1865 samples) ]\n```\n\nNow, if you have Hotspot available on the same machine, all you need to do is launch it.\nIt will automatically open the `perf.data` file in the current directory (similar to `perf report`).\n\nAlternatively, you can specify the path to the data file on the console:\n\n```bash\nhotspot /path/to/perf.data\n```\n\n### Command Line options\n\nDepending on your needs you may want to pass additional command line options to Hotspot.\nThis allows to one-time set configuration options that are found in the GUI under \"Settings\"\nand also allows to convert Linux perf data files into the smaller and portable perfdata format\n(see [Import / Export](#import-export) for details on that).\nAll command line options are shown with `--help`:\n\n```text\nUsage: hotspot [options] [files...]\nLinux perf GUI for performance analysis.\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help               Displays help on commandline options.\n  --help-all               Displays help including Qt specific options.\n  -v, --version            Displays version information.\n  --sysroot <path>         Path to sysroot which is used to find libraries.\n  --kallsyms <path>        Path to kallsyms file which is used to resolve\n                           kernel symbols.\n  --debugPaths <paths>     Colon separated list of paths that contain debug\n                           information. These paths are relative to the\n                           executable and not to the current working directory.\n  --extraLibPaths <paths>  Colon separated list of extra paths to find\n                           libraries.\n  --appPath <path>         Path to folder containing the application executable\n                           and libraries.\n  --sourcePaths <paths>    Colon separated list of search paths for the source\n                           code.\n  --arch <path>            Architecture to use for unwinding.\n  --exportTo <path>        Path to .perfparser output file to which the input\n                           data should be exported. A single input file has to\n                           be given too.\n  --perf-binary <path>     Path to the perf binary.\n  --objdump-binary <path>  Path to the objdump binary.\n\nArguments:\n  files                    Optional input files to open on startup, i.e.\n                           perf.data files.\n```\n\n### Off-CPU Profiling\n\nHotspot supports a very powerful way of doing wait-time analysis, or off-CPU profiling.\nThis analysis is based on kernel tracepoints in the linux scheduler. By recording that\ndata, we can find the time delta during which a thread was not running on the CPU, but\ninstead was off-CPU. There can be multiple reasons for that, all of which can be found\nusing this technique:\n\n- synchronous I/O, e.g. via `read()` or `write()`\n- page faults, e.g. when accessing `mmap()`'ed file data\n- calls to `nanosleep()` or `yield()`\n- lock contention via `futex()` etc.\n- preemption\n- and probably many more\n\nBy leveraging kernel trace points in the scheduler, the overhead is pretty manageable\nand we only pay a price, when the process is actually getting switched out. Most notably\nwe do not pay a price when e.g. a mutex lock operation can be handled directly in\nuser-space.\n\nTo do off-CPU analysis with Hotspot, you need to record the data with a very specific\ncommand:\n\n```bash\nperf record \\\n    -e cycles \\                             # on-CPU profiling\n    -e sched:sched_switch --switch-events \\ # off-CPU profiling\n    --sample-cpu \\                          # track on which core code is executed\n    -m 8M \\                                 # reduce chance of event loss\n    --aio -z \\                              # reduce disk-I/O overhead and data size\n    --call-graph dwarf \\                    # we definitely want backtraces\n    <your application>\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the off-CPU check box in Hotspot's integrated record page.\n\nDuring the analysis, you can then switch between the \"cycles\" cost view for on-CPU data\nto the \"off-CPU time\" cost view for wait-time analysis. Often, you will want to change\nbetween both, e.g. to find places in your code which may require further parallelization\n(see also [Amdahl's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)).\n\nThe \"sched:sched_switch\" cost will also be shown to you. But in my opinion that is less\nuseful, as it only indicates the number of scheduler switches. The length of the time\ninbetween is often way more interesting to me - and that's what is shown to you in the\n\"off-CPU time\" metric.\n\n### Embedded Systems\n\nIf you are recording on an embedded system, you will want to analyze the data on your\ndevelopment machine with Hotspot. To do so, make sure your sysroot contains the debug\ninformation required for unwinding (see below). Then record the data on your embedded\nsystem:\n\n```bash\nembedded$ perf record --call-graph dwarf <your application>\n...\n[ perf record: Woken up 58 times to write data ]\n[ perf record: Captured and wrote 14.874 MB perf.data (1865 samples) ]\nembedded$ cp /proc/kallsyms /tmp/kallsyms # make pseudo-file a real file\n```\n\nIt's OK if your embedded machine is using a different platform than your host. On your\nhost, do the following steps then to analyze the data:\n\n```bash\nhost$ scp embedded:perf.data embedded:/tmp/kallsyms .\nhost$ hotspot --sysroot /path/to/sysroot --kallsyms kallsyms \\\n              perf.data\n```\n\nIf you manually deployed an application from a path outside your sysroot, do this instead:\n\n```bash\nhost$ hotspot --sysroot /path/to/sysroot --kallsyms kallsyms --appPath /path/to/app \\\n              perf.data\n```\n\nIf your application is also using libraries outside your sysroot and the appPath, do this:\n\n```bash\nhost$ hotspot --sysroot /path/to/sysroot --kallsyms kallsyms --appPath /path/to/app \\\n              --extraLibPaths /path/to/lib1:/path/to/lib2:... \\\n              perf.data\n```\n\nAnd, worst-case, if you also use split debug files in non-standard locations, do this:\n\n```bash\nhost$ hotspot --sysroot /path/to/sysroot --kallsyms kallsyms --appPath /path/to/app \\\n              --extraLibPaths /path/to/lib1:/path/to/lib2:... \\\n              --debugPaths /path/to/debug1:/path/to/debug2:... \\\n              perf.data\n```\n\n### Import Export\n\nThe `perf.data` file format is not self-contained. To analyze it, you need access\nto the executables and libraries of the profiled process, together with debug symbols.\nThis makes it unwieldy to share such files across machines, e.g. to get the help from\na colleague to investigate a performance issue, or for bug reporting purposes.\n\nHotspot allows you to export the analyzed data, which is then fully self-contained.\nThis feature is accessible via the \"File > Save As\" menu action. The data is then\nsaved in a self-contained `*.perfparser` file. To import the data into Hotspot again,\njust open that file directly in place of the original `perf.data` file.\n\nAs an alternative you can also do the export from command line (without a GUI, so that's\nalso usable with automated builds) using the `--exportTo` option.\n\n**Note:** The file format is _not_ yet stable. Meaning data exported by one version\nof Hotspot can only be read back in by the same version. This problem will be\nresolved in the future, as time permits.\n\n### tracepoints\n\nHotspot currently only shows the name of the tracepoints in the timeline.\n\n![hotspot tracepoints](screenshots/tracepoints.png?raw=true \"Hotspot tracepoints\")\n\n### Disassembler\n\n![hotspot disassembler page](screenshots/disassembler.png?raw=true \"Hotspot disassembler page\")\n\nHotspot includes an disassembler, which can show you the cost per instruction.\nThe disassembler uses colors to indicate which assembly lines correspond to\nwhich source code line.\nFor easier navigation, you can simply click on a line and the other view will jump to it.\nYou can follow function calls with a double click.\nIn the sourcecode view you can press ctrl+f or press the search icon to open a search window.\n\nIf you have the sources in different directory, you can use `--sourcePaths` or the settings to\nselect tell the disassembler to search there for the source code.\n\n## Known Issues\n\nIf anything breaks in the above and the output is less usable than `perf report`, please\n[report an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues).\nThat said, there are some known issues that people may trip over:\n\n### Broken Backtraces\n\nUnwinding the stack to produce a backtrace is a dark art and can go wrong in many ways.\nHotspot relies on `perfparser` (see below), which in turn relies on `libdw` from elfutils\nto unwind the stack. This works quite well most of the time, but still can go wrong. Most\nnotably, unwinding will fail when:\n\n- an ELF file (i.e. executable or library) referenced by the `perf.data` file is missing\n  - to fix this, try to use one of the following CLI arguments to let Hotspot know where to look for the\n    ELF files:\n    - `--debugPaths <paths>`: Use this when you have split debug files in non-standard locations\n    - `--extraLibPaths <paths>`: Use this when you have moved libraries to some other location since recording\n    - `--appPath <paths>`: This is kind of a combination of the above two fields. The path is traversed\n     recursively, looking for debug files and libraries.\n    - `--sysroot <path>`: Use this when you try to inspect a data file recorded on an embedded platform\n- an ELF file is missing debug information\n  - to fix this, install the debug package from your distro\n  - or compile the code in \"release with debug\" mode, i.e. ensure your compiler is invoked with something\n    like `-O2 -g`. You will have to repeat the `perf record` step\n  - potentially both of the above is not an option for you, e.g. when the library is closed source and\n    supplied by a thirdparty vendor. If that is the case,\n    you may be lucky and the library contains frame pointers. If so, then try to build elfutils from current\n    git master (you want commit a55df2c1, which should be part of 0.170).\n    This version of elfutils will try to fallback to the frame pointer for unwinding, when the debug\n    information is missing.\n- your call stacks are too deep\n  - by default, `perf record` only copies a part of the stack to the data file. This can lead to issues with\n    very deep call stacks, which will be cut off at some point. This issue will break the top-down call trees\n    in Hotspot, as visualized in the Top-Down view or the Flame Graph. To fix this, you can try to increase\n    the stack dump size, i.e.:\n\n        perf record --call-graph dwarf,32768\n\n    Note that this can dramatically increase the size of the `perf.data` files - use it with care. Also have a\n    look at `man perf record`.\n  - For some scenarios, recursive function calls simply fail to be unwound.

Some of these are planned to be resolved\nin the future. Others may potentially never get implemented. But be aware that the following features\nare _not_ available in Hotspot currently:\n\n- the columns in the tables are currently hardcoded, while potentially a user may want to change this to show\n  e.g. cost per-process or thread and so forth. Basic group-by functionality was added, but a more flexible\n  column arrangement a la WPA is not planned for now.\n- many of the more advanced features, such as `--itrace`, `--mem-mode`, `--branch-stack` and\n  `--branch-history`, are unsupported\n\n### Recording with perf without super user rights\n\nIt is **not** a good idea to launch Hotspot with `sudo` or as `root` user. See e.g.\n[Editing Files As Root](https://blog.martin-graesslin.com/blog/2017/02/editing-files-as-root/)\nfor an article on that matter. [Issue #83](https://github.com/KDAB/hotspot/issues/83) is\nalso relevant in this contact.\n\nBut without superuser rights, you may see error messages such as the following\nwhen using Hotspot's record feature:\n\n```text\nYou may not have permission to collect stats.\nConsider tweaking /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid:\n  -1 - Not paranoid at all\n   0 - Disallow raw tracepoint access for unpriv\n   1 - Disallow cpu events for unpriv\n   2 - Disallow kernel profiling for unpriv\n```\n\nTo workaround this limitation, Hotspot can run perf itself with elevated privileges.\n\n### Export File Format\n\nThe current data export is limited to a format that can only be read back by Hotspot of the same\nversion. This makes interop with other visualization tools quasi impossible. This is known and\nwill get improved in the future. Most notably support for export to web viewers such as\n[perfetto](https://perfetto.dev/) or the [Mozilla profiler](https://profiler.firefox.com/) is\nplanned but not yet implemented. Patches welcome!\n\n## Qt Creator\n\nThis project leverages the excellent `perfparser` utility created by The Qt Company\nfor their Qt Creator IDE.
