[#2502](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2502)\n   * REMOVED: appveyor builds. [#2550](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2550)\n   * REMOVED: Removed x86 CI builds. [#2792](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2792)\n\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Crazy ETAs.  If a way has forward speed with no backward speed and it is not oneway, then we must set the default speed.  The reverse logic applies as well.  If a way has no backward speed but has a forward speed and it is not a oneway, then set the default speed. [#2102](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2102)\n   * FIXED: Map matching elapsed times spliced amongst different legs and discontinuities are now correct [#2104](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2104)\n   * FIXED: Date time information is now propagated amongst different legs and discontinuities [#2107](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2107)\n   * FIXED: Adds support for geos-3.8 c++ api [#2021](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues/2021)\n   * FIXED: Updated the osrm serializer to not set junction name for osrm origin/start maneuver - this is not helpful since we are not transitioning through the intersection.  [#2121](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2121)\n   * FIXED: Removes precomputing of edge-costs which lead to wrong results [#2120](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2120)\n   * FIXED: Complex turn-restriction invalidates edge marked as kPermanent [#2103](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues/2103)\n   * FIXED: Fixes bug with inverted time-restriction parsing [#2167](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2167)\n   * FIXED: Fixed several bugs with numeric underflow in map-matching trip durations. These may\n     occur when serializing match results where adjacent trace points appear out-of-sequence on the\n     same edge [#2178](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2178)\n     - `MapMatcher::FormPath` now catches route discontinuities on the same edge when the distance\n       percentage along don't agree. The trip leg builder builds disconnected legs on a single edge\n       to avoid duration underflow.\n     - Correctly populate edge groups when matching results contain loops. When a loop occurs,\n       the leg builder now starts at the correct edge where the loop ends, and correctly accounts\n       for any contained edges.\n     - Duration over-trimming at the terminating edge of a match.\n   * FIXED: Increased internal precision of time tracking per edge and maneuver so that maneuver times sum to the same time represented in the leg summary [#2195](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2195)\n   * FIXED: Tagged speeds were not properly marked. We were not using forward and backward speeds to flag if a speed is tagged or not.  Should not update turn channel speeds if we are not inferring them.  Added additional logic to handle PH in the conditional restrictions. Do not update stop impact for ramps if they are marked as internal. [#2198](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2198)\n   * FIXED: Fixed the sharp turn phrase [#2226](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2226)\n   * FIXED: Protect against duplicate points in the input or points that snap to the same location resulting in `nan` times for the legs of the map match (of a 0 distance route) [#2229](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2229)\n   * FIXED: Improves restriction check on briding edge in Bidirectional Astar [#2228](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2242)\n   * FIXED: Allow nodes at location 0,0 [#2245](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2245)\n   * FIXED: Fix RapidJSON compiler warnings and naming conflict [#2249](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2249)\n   * FIXED: Fixed bug in resample_spherical_polyline where duplicate successive lat,lng locations in the polyline resulting in `nan` for the distance computation which shortcuts further sampling [#2239](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2239)\n   * FIXED: Update exit logic for non-motorways [#2252](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2252)\n   * FIXED: Transition point map-matching. When match results are on a transition point, we search for the sibling nodes at that transition and snap it to the corresponding edges in the route. [#2258](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2258)\n   * FIXED: Fixed verbal multi-cue logic [#2270](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2270)\n   * FIXED: Fixed Uturn cases when a not_thru edge is connected to the origin edge. [#2272](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2272)\n   * FIXED: Update intersection classes in osrm response to not label all ramps as motorway [#2279](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2279)\n   * FIXED: Fixed bug in mapmatcher when interpolation point goes before the first valid match or after the last valid match. Such behavior usually leads to discontinuity in matching. [#2275](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2275)\n   * FIXED: Fixed an issue for time_allowed logic.  Previously we returned false on the first time allowed restriction and did not check them all. Added conditional restriction gurka test and datetime optional argument to gurka header file. [#2286](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2286)\n   * FIXED: Fixed an issue for date ranges.  For example, for the range Jan 04 to Jan 02 we need to test to end of the year and then from the first of the year to the end date.  Also, fixed an emergency tag issue.  We should only set the use to emergency if all other access is off. [#2290](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2290)\n   * FIXED: Found a few issues with the initial ref and direction logic for ways.  We were overwriting the refs with directionals to the name_offset_map instead of concatenating them together.  Also, we did not allow for blank entries for GetTagTokens. [#2298](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2298)\n   * FIXED: Fixed an issue where MatchGuidanceViewJunctions is only looking at the first edge. Set the data_id for guidance views to the changeset id as it is already being populated. Also added test for guidance views. [#2303](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2303)\n   * FIXED: Fixed a problem with live speeds where live speeds were being used to determine access, even when a live\n   speed (current time) route wasn't what was requested. [#2311](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2311)\n   * FIXED: Fix break/continue typo in search filtering [#2317](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2317)\n   * FIXED: Fix a crash in trace_route due to iterating past the end of a vector. [#2322](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2322)\n   * FIXED: Don't allow timezone information in the local date time string attached at each location. [#2312](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2312)\n   * FIXED: Fix short route trimming in bidirectional astar [#2323](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2323)\n   * FIXED: Fix shape trimming in leg building for snap candidates that lie within the margin of rounding error [#2326](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2326)\n   * FIXED: Fixes route duration underflow with traffic data [#2325](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2325)\n   * FIXED: Parse mtb:scale tags and set bicycle access if present [#2117](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2117)\n   * FIXED: Fixed segfault.  Shape was missing from options for valhalla_path_comparison and valhalla_run_route.  Also, costing options was missing in valhalla_path_comparison. [#2343](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2343)\n   * FIXED: Handle decimal numbers with zero-value mantissa properly in Lua [#2355](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2355)\n   * FIXED: Many issues that resulted in discontinuities, failed matches or incorrect time/duration for map matching requests. [#2292](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2292)\n   * FIXED: Seeing segfault when loading large osmdata data files before loading LuaJit. LuaJit fails to create luaL_newstate() Ref: [#2158](https://github.com/ntop/ntopng/issues/2158) Resolution is to load LuaJit before loading the data files. [#2383](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2383)\n   * FIXED: Store positive/negative OpenLR offsets in bucketed form [#2405](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/2405)\n   * FIXED: Fix on map-matching return code when breakage distance limitation exceeds. Instead of letting the request goes into meili and fails in finding a route, we check the distance in loki and early return with exception code 172. [#2406](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2406)\n   * FIXED: Don't create edges for portions of ways that are doubled back on themselves as this confuses opposing edge index computations [#2385](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2385)\n   * FIXED: Protect against nan in uniform_resample_spherical_polyline. [#2431](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2431)\n   * FIXED: Obvious maneuvers. [#2436](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2436)\n   * FIXED: Base64 encoding/decoding [#2452](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2452)\n   * FIXED: Added post roundabout instruction when enter/exit roundabout maneuvers are combined [#2454](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2454)\n   * FIXED: openlr: Explicitly check for linear reference option for Valhalla serialization. [#2458](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2458)\n   * FIXED: Fix segfault: Do not combine last turn channel maneuver. [#2463](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2463)\n   * FIXED: Remove extraneous whitespaces from ja-JP.json.

Uninitialized spare0_ field produced UB which causes gurka_reproduce_tile_build to fail intermittently. [#2499](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2499)\n   * FIXED: Drop unused CHANGELOG validation script, straggling NodeJS references [#2506](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2506)\n   * FIXED: Fix missing nullptr checks in graphreader and loki::Reach (causing segfault during routing with not all levels of tiles available) [#2504](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2504)\n   * FIXED: Fix mismatch of triplegedge roadclass and directededge roadclass [#2507](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2507)\n   * FIXED: Improve german destination_verbal_alert phrases [#2509](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/2509)\n   * FIXED: Undefined behavior cases discovered with undefined behavior sanitizer tool.

Also, updated default speeds based on roadclass in lua.  Fixed an issue where we were subtracting 1 from uint32_t when 0 for stop impact.  Updated reclassify link logic to allow residential roads to be added to the tree, but we only downgrade the links to tertiary.  Updated TransitionCost functions to add 1.5 to the turncost when transitioning from a ramp to a non ramp and vice versa.  Also, added 0.5f to the turncost if the edge is a roundabout. [#1931](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1931)\n\n* **Enhancement**\n   * ADDED: Caching url fetched tiles to disk [#1887](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1887)\n   * ADDED: filesystem::remove_all [#1887](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1887)\n   * ADDED: Minimum enclosing bounding box tool [#1887](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1887)\n   * ADDED: Use constrained flow speeds in bidirectional_astar.cc [#1907](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1907)\n   * ADDED: Bike Share Stations are now in the graph which should set us up to do multimodal walk/bike scenarios [#1852](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1852)\n\n## Release Date: 2019-7-18 Valhalla 3.0.7\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Fix pedestrian fork [#1886](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1886)\n\n## Release Date: 2019-7-15 Valhalla 3.0.6\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Admin name changes. [#1853](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1853) Ref: [#1854](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues/1854)\n   * FIXED: valhalla_add_predicted_traffic was overcommitted while gathering stats. Added a clear. [#1857](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1857)\n   * FIXED: regression in map matching when moving to valhalla v3.0.0 [#1863](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1863)\n   * FIXED: last step shape in osrm serializer should be 2 of the same point [#1867](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1867)\n   * FIXED: Shape trimming at the beginning and ending of the route to not be degenerate [#1876](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1876)\n   * FIXED: Duplicate waypoints in osrm serializer [#1880](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1880)\n   * FIXED: Updates for heading precision [#1881](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1881)\n   * FIXED: Map matching allowed untraversable edges at start of route [#1884](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1884)\n\n* **Enhancement**\n   * ADDED: Use the same protobuf object the entire way through the request process [#1837](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1837)\n   * ADDED: Enhanced turn lane processing [#1859](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1859)\n   * ADDED: Add global_synchronized_cache in valhalla_build_config [#1851](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1851)\n\n## Release Date: 2019-06-04 Valhalla 3.0.5\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Protect against unnamed rotaries and routes that end in roundabouts not turning off rotary logic [#1840](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1840)\n\n* **Enhancement**\n   * ADDED: Add turn lane info at maneuver point [#1830](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1830)\n\n## Release Date: 2019-05-31 Valhalla 3.0.4\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Improved logic to decide between bear vs. continue [#1798](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1798)\n   * FIXED: Bicycle costing allows use of roads with all surface values, but with a penalty based on bicycle type. However, the edge filter totally disallows bad surfaces for some bicycle types, creating situations where reroutes fail if a rider uses a road with a poor surface. [#1800](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1800)\n   * FIXED: Moved complex restrictions building to before validate. [#1805](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1805)\n   * FIXED: Fix bicycle edge filter when avoid_bad_surfaces = 1.0 [#1806](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1806)\n   * FIXED: Replace the EnhancedTripPath class inheritance with aggregation [#1807](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1807)\n   * FIXED: Replace the old timezone shape zip file every time valhalla_build_timezones is ran [#1817](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1817)\n   * FIXED: Don't use island snapped edge candidates (from disconnected components or low reach edges) when we rejected other high reachability edges that were closer [#1835](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1835)\n\n## Release Date: 2019-05-08 Valhalla 3.0.3\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Fixed a rare loop condition in route matcher (edge walking to match a trace).\n   * FIXED: Fixed VACUUM ANALYZE syntax issue.

[#1714](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1714)\n   * FIXED: Fixed osrm compatibility mode attributes.  [#1716](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1716)\n   * FIXED: Fixed rotary/roundabout issues in Valhalla OSRM compatibility.  [#1727](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1727)\n   * FIXED: Fixed the destinations assignment for exit names in OSRM compatibility mode. [#1732](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1732)\n   * FIXED: Enhance merge maneuver type assignment. [#1735](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1735)\n   * FIXED: Fixed fork assignments and on ramps for OSRM compatibility mode. [#1738](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1738)\n   * FIXED: Fixed cardinal direction on reference names when forward/backward tag is present on relations. Fixes singly digitized roads with opposing directional modifiers. [#1741](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1741)\n   * FIXED: Fixed fork assignment and narrative logic when a highway ends and splits into multiple ramps. [#1742](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1742)\n   * FIXED: Do not use any avoid edges as origin or destination of a route, matrix, or isochrone. [#1745](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1745)\n   * FIXED: Add leg summary and remove unused hint attribute for OSRM compatibility mode. [#1753](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1753)\n   * FIXED: Improvements for pedestrian forks, pedestrian roundabouts, and continue maneuvers. [#1768](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1768)\n   * FIXED: Added simplified overview for OSRM response and added use_toll logic back to truck costing. [#1765](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1765)\n   * FIXED: temp fix for location distance bug [#1774](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1774)\n   * FIXED: Fix pedestrian routes using walkway_factor [#1780](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1780)\n   * FIXED: Update the begin and end heading of short edges based on use [#1783](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1783)\n   * FIXED: GraphReader::AreEdgesConnected update.  If transition count == 0 return false and do not call transition function. [#1786](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1786)\n   * FIXED: Only edge candidates that were used in the path are send to serializer: [#1788](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1788)\n   * FIXED: Added logic to prevent the removal of a destination maneuver when ending on an internal edge [#1792](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1792)\n   * FIXED: Fixed instructions when starting on an internal edge [#1796](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1796)\n\n* **Enhancement**\n   * Add the ability to run valhalla_build_tiles in stages. Specify the begin_stage and end_stage as command line options. Also cleans up temporary files as the last stage in the pipeline.\n   * Add `remove` to `filesystem` namespace. [#1752](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1752)\n   * Add TaxiCost into auto costing options.\n   * Add `preferred_side` to allow per-location filtering of edges based on the side of the road the location is on and the driving side for that locale.\n   * Slightly decreased the internal side-walk factor to .90f to favor roads with attached sidewalks. This impacts roads that have added sidewalk:left, sidewalk:right or sidewalk:both OSM tags (these become attributes on each directedEdge). The user can then avoid/penalize dedicated sidewalks and walkways, when they increase the walkway_factor. Since we slightly decreased the sidewalk_factor internally and only favor sidewalks if use is tagged as sidewalk_left or sidewalk_right, we should tend to route on roads with attached sidewalks rather than separate/dedicated sidewalks, allowing for more road names to be called out since these are labeled more.\n   * Add `via` and `break_through` location types [#1737](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1737)\n   * Add `street_side_tolerance` and `search_cutoff` to input `location` [#1777](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1777)\n   * Return the Valhalla error `Path distance exceeds the max distance limit` for OSRM responses when the route is greater than the service limits. [#1781](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1781)\n\n## Release Date: 2019-01-14 Valhalla 3.0.2\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Transit update - fix dow and exception when after midnight trips are normalized [#1682](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1682)\n   * FIXED: valhalla_convert_transit segfault - GraphTileBuilder has null GraphTileHeader [#1683](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues/1683)\n   * FIXED: Fix crash for trace_route with osrm serialization. Was passing shape rather than locations to the waypoint method.\n   * FIXED: Properly set driving_side based on data set in TripPath.\n   * FIXED: A bad bicycle route exposed an issue with bidirectional A* when the origin and destination edges are connected. Use A* in these cases to avoid requiring a high cost threshold in BD A*.\n   * FIXED: x86 and x64 data compatibility was fixed as the structures weren't aligned.\n   * FIXED: x86 tests were failing due mostly to floating point issues and the aforementioned structure misalignment.\n* **Enhancement**\n   * Add a durations list (delta time between each pair of trace points), a begin_time and a use_timestamp flag to trace_route requests. This allows using the input trace timestamps or durations plus the begin_time to compute elapsed time at each edge in the matched path (rather than using costing methods).\n   * Add support for polyline5 encoding for OSRM formatted output.\n* **Note**\n   * Isochrones and openlr are both noted as not working with release builds for x86 (32bit) platforms. We'll look at getting this fixed in a future release\n\n## Release Date: 2018-11-21 Valhalla 3.0.1\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Fixed a rare, but serious bug with bicycle costing. ferry_factor_ in bicycle costing shadowed the data member in the base dynamic cost class, leading to an uninitialized variable. Occasionally, this would lead to negative costs which caused failures. [#1663](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1663)\n   * FIXED: Fixed use of units in OSRM compatibility mode. [#1662](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1662)\n\n## Release Date: 2018-11-21 Valhalla 3.0.0\n* **NOTE**\n   * This release changes the Valhalla graph tile formats to make the tile data more efficient and flexible. Tile data is incompatible with Valhalla 2.x builds, and code for 3.x is incompatible with data built for Valahalla 2.x versions. Valhalla tile sizes are slightly smaller (for datasets using elevation information the size savings is over 10%). In addition, there is increased flexibility for creating different variants of tiles to support different applications (e.g. bicycle only, or driving only).\n* **Enhancement**\n   * Remove the use of DirectedEdge for transitions between nodes on different hierarchy levels. A new structure, NodeTransition, is now used to transition to nodes on different hierarchy level. This saves space since only the end node GraphId is needed for the transitions (and DirectedEdge is a large data structure).\n   * Change the NodeInfo lat,lon to use an offset from the tile base lat,lon. This potentially allows higher precision than using float, but more importantly saves space and allows support for NodeTransitions as well as spare for future growth.\n   * Remove the EdgeElevation structure and max grade information into DirectedEdge and mean elevation into EdgeInfo. This saves space.\n   * Reduce wayid to 32 bits. This allows sufficient growth when using OpenStreetMap data and frees space in EdgeInfo (allows moving speed limit and mean elevation from other structures).\n   * Move name consistency from NodeInfo to DirectedEdge. This allows a more efficient lookup of name consistency.\n   * Update all path algorithms to use NodeTransition logic rather than special DirectedEdge transition types. This simplifies PathAlgorithms slightly and removes some conditional logic.\n   * Add an optional GraphFilter stage to tile building pipeline. This allows removal of edges and nodes based on access. This allows bicycle only, pedestrian only, or driving only datasets (or combinations) to be created - allowing smaller datasets for special purpose applications.\n* **Deprecate**\n   * Valhalla 3.0 removes support for OSMLR.\n\n## Release Date: 2018-11-20 Valhalla 2.7.2\n* **Enhancement**\n   * UPDATED: Added a configuration variable for max_timedep_distance. This is used in selecting the path algorithm and provides the maximum distance between locations when choosing a time dependent path algorithm (other than multi modal). Above this distance, bidirectional A* is used with no time dependencies.\n   * UPDATED: Remove transition edges from priority queue in Multimodal methods.\n   * UPDATED: Fully implement street names and exit signs with ability to identify route numbers. [#1635](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1635)\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: A timed-turned restriction should not be applied when a non-timed route is executed.  [#1615](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1615)\n   * FIXED: Changed unordered_map to unordered_multimap for polys. Poly map can contain the same key but different multi-polygons. For example, islands for a country or timezone polygons for a country.\n   * FIXED: Fixed timezone db issue where TZIDs did not exist in the Howard Hinnant date time db that is used in the date_time class for tz indexes.  Added logic to create aliases for TZIDs based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\n   * FIXED: Fixed the ramp turn modifiers for osrm compat [#1569](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1569)\n   * FIXED: Fixed the step geometry when using the osrm compat mode [#1571](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1571)\n   * FIXED: Fixed a data creation bug causing issues with A* routes ending on loops. [#1576](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1576)\n   * FIXED: Fixed an issue with a bad route where destination only was present. Was due to thresholds in bidirectional A*. Changed threshold to be cost based rather than number of iterations). [#1586](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1586)\n   * FIXED: Fixed an issue with destination only (private) roads being used in bicycle routes. Centralized some \"base\" transition cost logic in the base DynamicCost class. [#1587](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1587)\n   * FIXED: Remove extraneous ramp maneuvers [#1657](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1657)\n\n## Release Date: 2018-10-02 Valhalla 2.7.1\n* **Enhancement**\n   * UPDATED: Added date time support to forward and reverse isochrones. Add speed lookup (predicted speeds and/or free-flow or constrained flow speed) if date_time is present.\n   * UPDATED: Add timezone checks to multimodal routes and isochrones (updates localtime if the path crosses into a timezone different than the start location).\n* **Data Producer Update**\n   * UPDATED: Removed boost date time support from transit.  Now using the Howard Hinnant date library.\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: Fixed a bug with shortcuts that leads to inconsistent routes depending on whether shortcuts are taken, different origins can lead to different paths near the destination. This fix also improves performance on long routes and matrices.\n   * FIXED: We were getting inconsistent results between departing at current date/time vs entering the current date/time.  This issue is due to the fact that the iso_date_time function returns the full iso date_time with the timezone offset (e.g., 2018-09-27T10:23-07:00 vs 2018-09-27T10:23). When we refactored the date_time code to use the new Howard Hinnant date library, we introduced this bug.\n   * FIXED: Increased the threshold in CostMatrix to address null time and distance values occurring for truck costing with locations near the max distance.\n\n## Release Date: 2018-09-13 Valhalla 2.7.0\n* **Enhancement**\n   * UPDATED: Refactor to use the pbf options instead of the ptree config [#1428](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1428) This completes [#1357](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues/1357)\n   * UPDATED: Removed the boost/date_time dependency from baldr and odin. We added the Howard Hinnant date and time library as a submodule. [#1494](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1494)\n   * UPDATED: Fixed 'Drvie' typo [#1505](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1505) This completes [#1504](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues/1504)\n   * UPDATED: Optimizations of GetSpeed for predicted speeds [#1490](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues/1490)\n   * UPDATED: Isotile optimizations\n   * UPDATED: Added stats to predictive traffic logging\n   * UPDATED: resample_polyline - Breaks the polyline into equal length segments at a sample distance near the resolution. Break out of the loop through polyline points once we reach the specified number of samplesthen append the last\npolyline point.\n   * UPDATED: added android logging and uses a shared graph reader\n   * UPDATED: Do not run a second pass on long pedestrian routes that include a ferry (but succeed on first pass). This is a performance fix. Long pedestrian routes with A star factor based on ferry speed end up being very inefficient.\n* **Bug Fix**\n   * FIXED: A* destination only\n   * FIXED: Fixed through locations weren't honored [#1449](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1449)\n\n\n## Release Date: 2018-08-02 Valhalla 3.0.0-rc.4\n* **Node Bindings**\n   * UPDATED: add some worker pool handling\n   [#1467](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1467)\n\n## Release Date: 2018-08-02 Valhalla 3.0.0-rc.3\n* **Node Bindings**\n   * UPDATED: replaced N-API with node-addon-api wrapper and made the actor\n   functions asynchronous\n   [#1457](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1457)\n\n## Release Date: 2018-07-24 Valhalla 3.0.0-rc.2\n* **Node Bindings**\n   * FIXED: turn on the autocleanup functionality for the actor object.\n   [#1439](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1439)\n\n## Release Date: 2018-07-16 Valhalla 3.0.0-rc.1\n* **Enhancement**\n   * ADDED: exposed the rest of the actions to the node bindings and added tests. [#1415](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1415)\n\n## Release Date: 2018-07-12 Valhalla 3.0.0-alpha.1\n**NOTE**: There was already a small package named `valhalla` on the npm registry, only published up to version 0.0.3. The team at npm has transferred the package to us, but would like us to publish something to it ASAP to prove our stake in it. Though the bindings do not have all of the actor functionality exposed yet (just route), we are going to publish an alpha release of 3.0.0 to get something up on npm.\n* **Infrastructure**:\n   * ADDED: add in time dependent algorithms if the distance between locations is less than 500km.\n   * ADDED: TurnLanes to indicate turning lanes at the end of a directed edge.\n   * ADDED: Added PredictedSpeeds to Valhalla tiles and logic to compute speed based on predictive speed profiles.\n* **Data Producer Update**\n   * ADDED: is_route_num flag was added to Sign records. Set this to true if the exit sign comes from a route number/ref.\n   * CHANGED: Lower speeds on driveways, drive-thru, and parking aisle. Set destination only flag for drive thru use.\n   * ADDED: Initial implementation of turn lanes.\n  **Bug Fix**\n   * CHANGED: Fix destination only penalty for A* and time dependent cases.\n   * CHANGED: Use the distance from GetOffsetForHeading, based on road classification and road use (e.g. ramp, turn channel, etc.), within tangent_angle function.\n* **Map Matching**\n   * FIXED: Fixed trace_route edge_walk server abort [#1365](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/pull/1365)\n* **Enhancement**\n   * ADDED: Added post process for updating free and constrained speeds in the directed edges.\n   * UPDATED: Parse the json request once and store in a protocol buffer to pass along the pipeline.

Now when making a query for bicycle routing, a value of 0 for use_hills and use_roads produces low-stress biking routes, while a value of 1 for both provides more intense professional bike routes.\n  * Bike costing default values changed. use_roads and use_hills are now 0.25 by default instead of 0.5 and the default bike is now a hybrid bike instead of a road bike.\n  * Added logic to use station hierarchy from transitland.  Osm and egress nodes are connected by transitconnections.  Egress and stations are connected by egressconnections.  Stations and platforms are connected by platformconnections.

This improves handling of transitions between hierarchy levels.\n* **Graph Correlation Improvements**\n  * Add options to control both radius and reachability per input location (with defaults) to control correlation of input locations to the graph in such a way as to avoid routing between disconnected regions and favor more likely paths.\n\n## Release Date: 2017-05-08 Valhalla 2.2.0\n* **Guidance Improvements**\n  * Added Russian (ru-RU) narrative file.\n  * Updated Slovenian (sl-SI) narrative file.\n* **Data Producer Updates**\n  * Assign destination sign info on bidirectional ramps.\n  * Update ReclassifyLinks. Use a \"link-tree\" which is formed from the exit node and terminates at entrance nodes.

Prior to this, the highways were stored on all levels, they now exist only on the highway hierarchy. Similar changes were made for arterial level roads. This leads to about a 20% reduction in tile size.\n  * The tile redesign required changes to the path generation algorithms. They must now transition freely between levels, even for pedestrian and bicycle routes. To offset the extra transitions, the main algorithms were changed to expand nodes at each level that has directed edges, rather than adding the transition edges to the priority queue/adjacency list. This change helps performance. The hierarchy limits that are used to speed the computation of driving routes by utilizing the highway hierarchy were adjusted to work with the new path algorithms.\n  * Some changes to costing were also required, for example pedestrian and bicycle routes skip shortcut edges.\n  * Many tile data structures were altered to explicitly size different fields and make room for \"spare\" fields that will allow future growth. In addition, the tile itself has extra \"spare\" records that can be appended to the end of the tile and referenced from the tile header. This also will allow future growth without breaking backward compatibility.\n* **Guidance Improvement**\n  * Refactored trip path to use an enumerated `Use` for edge and an enumerated `NodeType` for node\n  * Fixed some wording in the Hindi narrative file\n  * Fixed missing turn maneuver by updating the forward intersecting edge logic\n* **Issues Fixed**\n  * Fixed an issue with pedestrian routes where a short u-turn was taken to avoid the \"crossing\" penalty.\n  * Fixed bicycle routing due to high penalty to enter an access=destination area. Changed to a smaller, length based factor to try to avoid long regions where access = destination. Added a driveway penalty to avoid taking driveways (which are often marked as access=destination).\n  * Fixed regression where service did not adhere to the list of allowed actions in the Loki configuration\n* **Graph Correlation**\n  * External contributions from Navitia have lead to greatly reduced per-location graph correlation. Average correlation time is now less than 1ms down from 4-9ms.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-10-17\n\n* **Guidance Improvement**\n  * Added the Hindi (hi-IN) narrative language\n* **Service Additions**\n  * Added internal valhalla error codes utility in baldr and modified all services to make use of and return as JSON response\n  * See documentation https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla-docs/blob/master/api-reference.md#internal-error-codes-and-conditions\n* **Time-Distance Matrix Improvement**\n  * Added a costmatrix performance fix for one_to_many matrix requests\n* **Memory Mapped Tar Archive - Tile Extract Support**\n  * Added the ability to load a tar archive of the routing graph tiles. This improves performance under heavy load and reduces the memory requirement while allowing multiple processes to share cache resources.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-09-19\n\n* **Guidance Improvement**\n  * Added pirate narrative language\n* **Routing Improvement**\n  * Added the ability to include or exclude stops, routes, and operators in multimodal routing.\n* **Service Improvement**\n  * JSONify Error Response\n\n## Release Date: 2016-08-30\n\n* **Pedestrian Routing Improvement**\n  * Fixes for trivial pedestrian routes\n\n## Release Date: 2016-08-22\n\n* **Guidance Improvements**\n  * Added Spanish narrative\n  * Updated the start and end edge heading calculation to be based on road class and edge use\n* **Bicycle Routing Improvements**\n  * Prevent getting off a higher class road for a small detour only to get back onto the road immediately.\n  * Redo the speed penalties and road class factors - they were doubly penalizing many roads with very high values.\n  * Simplify the computation of weighting factor for roads that do not have cycle lanes. Apply speed penalty to slightly reduce favoring\nof non-separated bicycle lanes on high speed roads.\n* **Routing Improvements**\n  * Remove avoidance of U-turn for pedestrian routes. This improves use with map-matching since pedestrian routes can make U-turns.\n  * Allow U-turns at dead-ends for driving (and bicycling) routes.\n* **Service Additions**\n  * Add support for multi-modal isochrones.\n  * Added base code to allow reverse isochrones (path from anywhere to a single destination).\n* **New Sources to Targets**\n  * Added a new Matrix Service action that allows you to request any of the 3 types of time-distance matrices by calling 1 action.  This action takes a sources and targets parameter instead of the locations parameter.  Please see the updated Time-Distance Matrix Service API reference for more details.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-08-08\n\n * **Service additions**\n  * Latitude, longitude bounding boxes of the route and each leg have been added to the route results.\n  * Added an initial isochrone capability. This includes methods to create an \"isotile\" - a 2-D gridded data set with time to reach each lat,lon grid from an origin location. This isoltile is then used to create contours at specified times. Interior contours are optionally removed and the remaining outer contours are generalized and converted to GeoJSON polygons. An initial version supporting multimodal route types has also been added.\n * **Data Producer Updates**\n  * Fixed tranist scheduling issue where false schedules were getting added.\n * **Tools Additionas**\n  * Added `valhalla_export_edges` tool to allow shape and names to be dumped from the routing tiles\n\n## Release Date: 2016-07-19\n\n * **Guidance Improvements**\n  * Added French narrative\n  * Added capability to have narrative language aliases - For example: German `de-DE` has an alias of `de`\n * **Transit Stop Update** - Return latitude and longitude for each transit stop\n * **Data Producer Updates**\n  * Added logic to use lanes:forward, lanes:backward, speed:forward, and speed:backward based on direction of the directed edge.\n  * Added support for no_entry, no_exit, and no_turn restrictions.\n  * Added logic to support country specific access. Based on country tables found here: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_tags_for_routing/Access-Restrictions\n\n## Release Date: 2016-06-08\n\n * **Bug Fix** - Fixed a bug where edge indexing created many small tiles where no edges actually intersected. This allowed impossible routes to be considered for path finding instead of rejecting them earlier.\n * **Guidance Improvements**\n  * Fixed invalid u-turn direction\n  * Updated to properly call out jughandle routes\n  * Enhanced signless interchange maneuvers to help guide users\n * **Data Producer Updates**\n  * Updated the speed assignment for ramp to be a percentage of the original road class speed assignment\n  * Updated stop impact logic for turn channel onto ramp\n\n## Release Date: 2016-05-19\n\n * **Bug Fix** - Fixed a bug where routes fail within small, disconnected \"islands\" due to the threshold logic in prior release. Also better logic for not-thru roads.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-05-18\n\n * **Bidirectional A* Improvements** - Fixed an issue where if both origin and destination locations where on not-thru roads that meet at a common node the path ended up taking a long detour. Not all cases were fixed though - next release should fix. Trying to address the termination criteria for when the best connection point of the 2 paths is optimal. Turns out that the initial case where both opposing edges are settled is not guaranteed to be the least cost path. For now we are setting a threshold and extending the search while still tracking best connections. Fixed the opposing edge when a hierarchy transition occurs.\n * **Guidance Globalization** -  Fixed decimal distance to be locale based.\n * **Guidance Improvements**\n  * Fixed roundabout spoke count issue by fixing the drive_on_right attribute.\n  * Simplified narative by combining unnamed straight maneuvers\n  * Added logic to confirm maneuver type assignment to avoid invalid guidance\n  * Fixed turn maneuvers by improving logic for the following:\n    * Internal intersection edges\n    * 'T' intersections\n    * Intersecting forward edges\n * **Data Producer Updates** - Fix the restrictions on a shortcut edge to be the same as the last directed edge of the shortcut (rather than the first one).\n\n## Release Date: 2016-04-28\n\n * **Tile Format Updates** - Separated the transit graph from the \"road only\" graph into different tiles but retained their interconnectivity. Transit tiles are now hierarchy level 3.\n * **Tile Format Updates** - Reduced the size of graph edge shape data by 5% through the use of varint encoding (LEB128)\n * **Tile Format Updates** - Aligned `EdgeInfo` structures to proper byte boundaries so as to maintain compatibility for systems who don't support reading from unaligned addresses.\n * **Guidance Globalization** -  Added the it-IT(Italian) language file. Added support for CLDR plural rules. The cs-CZ(Czech), de-DE(German), and en-US(US English) language files have been updated.\n * **Travel mode based instructions** -  Updated the start, post ferry, and post transit insructions to be based on the travel mode, for example:\n  * `Drive east on Main Street.`\n  * `Walk northeast on Broadway.`\n  * `Bike south on the cycleway.`\n\n## Release Date: 2016-04-12\n\n * **Guidance Globalization** -  Added logic to use tagged language files that contain the guidance phrases. The initial versions of en-US, de-DE, and cs-CZ have been deployed.\n * **Updated ferry defaults** -  Bumped up use_ferry to 0.65 so that we don't penalize ferries as much.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-03-31\n * **Data producer updates** - Do not generate shortcuts across a node which is a fork. This caused missing fork maneuvers on longer routes.  GetNames update (\"Broadway fix\").  Fixed an issue with looking up a name in the ref map and not the name map.  Also, removed duplicate names.  Private = false was unsetting destination only flags for parking aisles.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-03-30\n * **TripPathBuilder Bug Fix** - Fixed an exception that was being thrown when trying to read directed edges past the end of the list within a tile. This was due to errors in setting walkability and cyclability on upper hierarchies.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-03-28\n\n * **Improved Graph Correlation** -  Correlating input to the routing graph is carried out via closest first traversal of the graph's, now indexed, geometry. This results in faster correlation and guarantees the absolute closest edge is found.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-03-16\n\n * **Transit type returned** -  The transit type (e.g. tram, metro, rail, bus, ferry, cable car, gondola, funicular) is now returned with each transit maneuver.\n * **Guidance language** -  If the language option is not supplied or is unsupported then the language will be set to the default (en-US). Also, the service will return the language in the trip results.\n * **Update multimodal path algorithm** - Applied some fixes to multimodal path algorithm. In particular fixed a bug where the wrong sortcost was added to the adjacency list. Also separated \"in-station\" transfer costs from transfers between stops.\n * **Data producer updates** - Do not combine shortcut edges at gates or toll booths. Fixes avoid toll issues on routes that included shortcut edges.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-03-07\n\n * **Updated all APIs to honor the optional DNT (Do not track) http header** -  This will avoid logging locations.\n * **Reduce 'Merge maneuver' verbal alert instructions** -  Only create a verbal alert instruction for a 'Merge maneuver' if the previous maneuver is > 1.5 km.\n * **Updated transit defaults.  Tweaked transit costing logic to obtain better routes.** -  use_rail = 0.6, use_transfers = 0.3, transfer_cost = 15.0 and transfer_penalty = 300.0.  Updated the TransferCostFactor to use the transfer_factor correctly.  TransitionCost for pedestrian costing bumped up from 20.0f to 30.0f when predecessor edge is a transit connection.\n * **Initial Guidance Globalization** -  Partial framework for Guidance Globalization. Started reading some guidance phrases from en-US.json file.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-02-22\n\n * **Use bidirectional A* for automobile routes** - Switch to bidirectional A* for all but bus routes and short routes (where origin and destination are less than 10km apart). This improves performance and has less failure cases for longer routes. Some data import adjustments were made (02-19) to fix some issues encountered with arterial and highway hierarchies. Also only use a maximum of 2 passes for bidirecdtional A* to reduce \"long time to fail\" cases.\n * **Added verbal multi-cue guidance** - This combines verbal instructions when 2 successive maneuvers occur in a short amount of time (e.g., Turn right onto MainStreet. Then Turn left onto 1st Avenue).\n\n## Release Date: 2016-02-19\n\n * **Data producer updates** - Reduce stop impact when all edges are links (ramps or turn channels). Update opposing edge logic to reject edges that do no have proper access (forward access == reverse access on opposing edge and vice-versa). Update ReclassifyLinks for cases where a single edge (often a service road) intersects a ramp improperly causing the ramp to reclassified when it should not be. Updated maximum OSM node Id (now exceeds 4000000000). Move lua from conf repository into mjolnir.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-02-01\n\n * **Data producer updates** - Reduce speed on unpaved/rough roads. Add statistics for hgv (truck) restrictions.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-01-26\n\n * **Added capability to disable narrative production** - Added the `narrative` boolean option to allow users to disable narrative production. Locations, shape, length, and time are still returned. The narrative production is enabled by default. The possible values for the `narrative` option are: false and true\n * **Added capability to mark a request with an id** - The `id` is returned with the response so a user could match to the corresponding request.\n * **Added some logging enhancements, specifically [ANALYTICS] logging** - We want to focus more on what our data is telling us by logging specific stats in Logstash.\n\n## Release Date: 2016-01-18\n\n * **Data producer updates** - Data importer configuration (lua) updates to fix a bug where buses were not allowed on restricted lanes.  Fixed surface issue (change the default surface to be \"compacted\" for footways).\n\n## Release Date: 2016-01-04\n\n * **Fixed Wrong Costing Options Applied** - Fixed a bug in which a previous requests costing options would be used as defaults for all subsequent requests.\n\n## Release Date: 2015-12-18\n\n * **Fix for bus access** - Data importer configuration (lua) updates to fix a bug where bus lanes were turning off access for other modes.\n * **Fix for extra emergency data** - Data importer configuration (lua) updates to fix a bug where we were saving hospitals in the data.\n * **Bicycle costing update** - Updated kTCSlight and kTCFavorable so that cycleways are favored by default vs roads.\n\n## Release Date: 2015-12-17\n\n * **Graph Tile Data Structure update** - Updated structures within graph tiles to support transit efforts and truck routing. Removed TransitTrip, changed TransitRoute and TransitStop to indexes (rather than binary search). Added access restrictions (like height and weight restrictions) and the mode which they impact to reduce need to look-up.\n * **Data producer updates** - Updated graph tile structures and import processes.\n\n## Release Date: 2015-11-23\n\n * **Fixed Open App for OSRM functionality** - Added OSRM functionality back to Loki to support Open App.\n\n## Release Date: 2015-11-13\n\n * **Improved narrative for unnamed walkway, cycleway, and mountain bike trail** - A generic description will be used for the street name when a walkway, cycleway, or mountain bike trail maneuver is unnamed. For example, a turn right onto a unnamed walkway maneuver will now be: \"Turn right onto walkway.\"\n * **Fix costing bug** - Fix a bug introduced in EdgeLabel refactor (impacted time distance matrix only).\n\n## Release Date: 2015-11-3\n\n * **Enhance bi-directional A* logic** - Updates to bidirectional A* algorithm to fix the route completion logic to handle cases where a long \"connection\" edge could lead to a sub-optimal path. Add hierarchy and shortcut logic so we can test and use bidirectional A* for driving routes. Fix the destination logic to properly handle oneways as the destination edge. Also fix U-turn detection for reverse search when hierarchy transitions occur.\n * **Change \"Go\" to \"Head\" for some instructions** - Start, exit ferry.\n * **Update to roundabout instructions** - Call out roundabouts for edges marked as links (ramps, turn channels).\n * **Update bicycle costing** - Fix the road factor (for applying weights based on road classification) and lower turn cost values.\n\n## Data Producer Release Date: 2015-11-2\n\n * **Updated logic to not create shortcut edges on roundabouts** - This fixes some roundabout exit counts.\n\n## Release Date: 2015-10-20\n\n * **Bug Fix for Pedestrian and Bicycle Routes** - Fixed a bug with setting the destination in the bi-directional Astar algorithm. Locations that snapped to a dead-end node would have failed the route and caused a timeout while searching for a valid path. Also fixed the elapsed time computation on the reverse path of bi-directional algorithm.\n\n## Release Date: 2015-10-16\n\n * **Through Location Types** - Improved support for locations with type = \"through\". Routes now combine paths that meet at each through location to create a single \"leg\" between locations with type = \"break\". Paths that continue at a through location will not create a U-turn unless the path enters a \"dead-end\" region (neighborhood with no outbound access).\n * **Update shortcut edge logic** - Now skips long shortcut edges when close to the destination. This can lead to missing the proper connection if the shortcut is too long. Fixes #245 (thor).\n * **Per mode service limits** - Update configuration to allow setting different maximum number of locations and distance per mode.\n * **Fix shape index for trivial path** - Fix a bug where when building the the trip path for a \"trivial\" route (includes just one edge) where the shape index exceeded that size of the shape.\n\n## Release Date: 2015-09-28\n\n * **Elevation Influenced Bicycle Routing** - Enabled elevation influenced bicycle routing. A \"use-hills\" option was added to the bicycle costing profile that can tune routes to avoid hills based on grade and amount of elevation change.\n * **\"Loop Edge\" Fix** - Fixed a bug with edges that form a loop. Split them into 2 edges during data import.\n * **Additional information returned from 'locate' method** - Added information that can be useful when debugging routes and data. Adds information about nodes and edges at a location.\n * **Guidance/Narrative Updates** - Added side of street to destination narrative. Updated verbal instructions.\n"

          "content": "We welcome contributions to Valhalla. If you would like to report an issue, or even better fix an existing one, please use the [Valhalla issue tracker](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/issues) on GitHub.\n\nThere are many ways to make meaningful contributions to the project:\n- file issues & bugs with **clear and easily reproducible instructions**\n- contribute bug fixes\n- contribute feature implementations, for larger features/changes its best to **open an issue asking for feedback before starting implementation**\n- improve translations on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/valhalla/valhalla-phrases/locales-en-us-json--transifex/)\n\n## Code contributions\n\nWe appreciate the community picking up and fixing bugs or even implementing new features. There are a few things to follow/be aware of when working on Valhalla:\n- we currently use the C++17 standard\n- we use `pre-commit` to make sure commits are formatted & linted: run `./scripts/format.sh` once and it'll be installed\n- `clang-format`/`clang-tidy` is used to format/lint the C++ code, `black` & `flake8` format/lint Python code\n- [`ASan`](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) is run in CI, but without its integrated leak sanitizer due to platform issues\n- we ask for unit tests to demonstrate a working bug fix or feature implementation, please feel free to ask us for instructions in the PR\n\nBefore opening a PR we'd ask you to format & lint the code:\n```\n# installs the pre-commit hook\n./scripts/format.sh\npre-commit run --all-files\n\n# optionally run clang-tidy\n# needs the compile_commands.json, we have to rebuild Valhalla\ncmake -B build -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=On && make -C build\n./scripts/clang-tidy-only-diff.sh\n\n# optionally run with ASan\ncmake -B build -DENABLE_ADDRESS_SANITIZER=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug && make -C build\n# if the leak sanitizer is problematic, you can disable it with \nexport ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=0\n```\n\n### Unit/integration Tests\n\nWe highly encourage running and updating the tests to make sure no regressions have been made. We use the Google test suite and also created our own test framework called \"gurka\" (the Norsk counterpart to OSRM's \"cucumber\"), to easily test custom-built maps. Check out more information in the [test docs](test/gurka/README.md).\n\nTo build and run all tests:\n\n```\nmake check -j$(nproc)\n```\n\nTo run an individual test, first move into the `./build` directory (lots of paths in the tests are relative):\n\n```\ncd build\nmake run-<test name>\n```\n\nCoverage reports are automatically generated using `codecov` for each pull request, but you can also build them locally by passing `-DENABLE_COVERAGE=On` and running `make coverage`.\n\n### Performance tests\n\nThis will mostly be performed by the maintainers before we merge PRs which could have a significant impact on performance or quality.\n\n1. Take a giant file with routes with > 10k\n2. Spin up the service\n3. Run the requests with `./run_route_scripts/run_with_server.py`: we can alter the logic for the requests inside that script, depending what we want to test\n4. E.g. `./run_route_scripts/run_with_server.py --test-file auto.txt --url http://localhost:8002/route --concurrency 20 --format csv`\n\n\n## Translation contributions\n\nValhalla currently supports almost 30 languages with > 95% translation coverage. If you find that Valhalla's output instructions are not supported or not optimal in your favorite language, it'd be great if you took the time to contribute improvements. We're using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/valhalla/valhalla-phrases/locales-en-us-json--transifex/) to manage translations and try to download all improvements before each release.\n\nYou can find more information in the [dedicated README](locales/README.md).\n"

Valhalla also includes tools like time+distance matrix computation, isochrones, elevation sampling, map matching and tour optimization (Travelling Salesman).\n\n## Build Status\n\n| Linux | macOS | Windows | Code Coverage |\n| ----- | ----- | ------- | ------------- |\n| [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master) | [![macOS CI](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/actions/workflows/osx.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/actions/workflows/osx.yml) | [![Windows CI](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/actions/workflows/win.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/actions/workflows/win.yml) | [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/valhalla/valhalla/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/valhalla/valhalla) |\n\n\n## License\n\nValhalla, and all of the projects under the Valhalla organization, use the [MIT License](COPYING).  Avatar/logo by [Jordan](https://www.jaykaydraws.com/portfolio). \n\nOpenStreetMap data in the `./test/data` is licensed under [ODbL](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/) and [copyrighted](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright) by OSM contributors. Additional information on licenses and other requirements concerning the data sources most frequently used by Valhalla can be found in [the docs](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla/mjolnir/data_sources/).\n\n## Overview\n\nThere are several key features that we hope can differentiate the Valhalla project from other routing and network analysis engines. They are:\n\n- Open source software, on open source data with a very liberal license. Should allow for transparency in development, encourage contribution and community input, and foster use in other projects.\n- Tiled hierarchical data structure. Should allow users to have a small memory footprint on memory constrained devices, enable offline routing, provide a means for regional extracts and partial updates.\n- Dynamic, runtime costing of edges and vertices within the graph via a plugin architecture. Should allow for customization and alternate route generation.\n- C++ based API. Should allow for cross compilation of the various pieces to enable routing on offline portable devices.\n- A plugin based narrative and manoeuvre generation architecture. Should allow for generation that is customized either to the administrative area or to the target locale.\n- Multi-modal and time-based routes. Should allow for mixing auto, pedestrian, bike and public transportation in the same route or setting a time by which one must arrive at a location.\n\n## Demo Server\n\n[FOSSGIS e.V.](https://fossgis.de) hosts a demo server which is open to the public and includes a full planet graph with an [open-source web app](https://github.com/gis-ops/valhalla-app) on https://valhalla.openstreetmap.de. The HTTP API is accessible on a slightly different subdomain, e.g. https://valhalla1.openstreetmap.de/isochrone. Usage of the demo server follows the usual fair-usage policy as OSRM & Nominatim demo servers (somewhat enforced by [rate limits](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/discussions/3373#discussioncomment-1644713)).\n\n## Platform Compatibility\n\nValhalla is fully functional on many Linux and Mac OS distributions, and is also used on iOS and Android devices.\n\nFor Windows, not all functionality is fully supported yet. Building the Valhalla library works flawlessly, as well as the following application modules:\n\n- `TOOLS`: utilities to query and benchmark various components\n- `DATA_TOOLS`: utilities to build input data and handle transit\n- `PYTHON_BINDINGS`: use all actions (route, isochrones, matrix etc) via the Valhalla Python library (needs a full (i.e. development) Python distribution in the `PATH`)\n\n## Organization\n\nThe Valhalla organization is comprised of several library modules each responsible for a different function. The layout of the various modules is as follows:\n\n- [Midgard](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/midgard) - Basic geographic and geometric algorithms for use in the various other projects.\n- [Baldr](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/baldr) - The base data structures for accessing and caching tiled route data.\n- [Sif](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/sif) - Library used in costing of graph nodes and edges. This can be used as input to `loki` and `thor`.\n- [Skadi](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/skadi) - Library and service for accessing elevation data. This can be used as input to `mjolnir` or as a standalone service.\n- [Mjolnir](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/mjolnir) - Tools for turning open data into Valhalla graph tiles.\n- [Loki](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/loki) - Library used to search graph tiles and correlate input locations to an entity within a tile. This correlated entity (edge or vertex) can be used as input to `thor`.\n- [Meili](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/meili) - Library used to for map-matching.\n- [Thor](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/thor) - Library used to generate a path through the graph tile hierarchy.  This path and attribution along the path can be used as input to `odin`.\n- [Odin](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/odin) - Library used to generate manoeuvres and narrative based on a path. This set of directions information can be used as input to `tyr`.\n- [Tyr](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/valhalla/tyr) - Service used to handle http requests for a route communicating with all of the other valhalla APIs. The service will format output from `odin` and support json (and eventually protocol buffer) output.\n- [Tools](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/tree/master/src) - A set command line tools that exercise bits of functionality from the library components above and provide the basis for quality testing and performance benchmarking.\n- [Demos](https://github.com/valhalla/demos) - A set of demos which allows interacting with the service and APIs.\n\n## Documentation\n\nDocumentation is stored in the `docs/` folder in this GitHub repository. It can be viewed at [valhalla.github.io/valhalla](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla).\n\n## Installation\n\nTo run Valhalla locally or your own server, we recommend using our Docker image. Checkout our docker image here: https://github.com/orgs/valhalla/packages. Also, there's a [community Docker image](https://github.com/gis-ops/docker-valhalla) with more \"magic\" than the native one.\n\nIf you want to build Valhalla from source, follow the [documentation](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla/building/).\n\nFor more information on binaries, see [Command Line Tools](#command-line-tools) section below and the [docs](https://valhalla.github.io/valhalla).\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe :heart: contributions to Valhalla. They could be non-technical, e.g. translations into other languages via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/valhalla/valhalla-phrases/locales-en-us-json--transifex/) or documentation improvements, or technical ones like bug fixes or feature implementations. It's important to open an issue before setting out to work on a PR.\n\nIdeally, get familiar with our [Contribution guidelines](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nValhalla includes several microbenchmarks which you can build and run using:\n\n    make benchmarks\n    make run-benchmarks\n\nThey are enabled by the `-DENABLE_BENCHMARKS=On` CMake flag and are currently only available for\nLinux and MacOS.\n\n## Command Line Tools\n\n### `valhalla_service` aka one-shot mode\n\nIf you can't (e.g. Windows Server) or don't want to have the full-fledged HTTP API running, you can have the (almost) exact same behavior with the 'valhalla_service' executable in so-called \"one-shot\" mode. It's simple, just pass the config file, the action (route, isochrone, matrix etc) and the stringified JSON request (or alternatively a file containing the request to circumvent shell command length issues):\n\n```\nvalhalla_service valhalla.json isochrone '{\"locations\":[{\"lat\":42.552448,\"lon\":1.564865}],\"costing\":\"auto\",\"contours\":[{\"time\":10,\"color\":\"ff0000\"}], \"show_locations\":true}'\n# Alternatively you can pass a file with the same contents\nvalhalla_service valhalla.json isochrone isochrone_request.txt\n```\n\nIt's important to note that all Valhalla logs for one-shot mode are piped to `stderr` while the actual JSON response will be in `stdout`. To completely silence the logs, pass `type: \"\"` to `midgard.logging` in the config file.\n\n\n### Batch Script Tool\n\n- [Batch Run_Route](https://github.com/valhalla/valhalla/blob/master/run_route_scripts/README.md)\n\n## Related projects\n\nThe following projects are open-source and built with the intention to make it easier to use Valhalla and its features:\n\n- [**OpenStreetMapSpeeds**](https://github.com/OpenStreetMapSpeeds/): A project conflating open GPS data to improve Valhalla's speed classification. The current JSON is from early 2022 and can be downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenStreetMapSpeeds/schema/master/default_speeds.json) and used by setting the path in the `mjolnir.default_speeds_config` config option.\n- [**docker-valhalla**](https://github.com/gis-ops/docker-valhalla): An easy-to-use, relatively magical Docker image for Valhalla, which only requires setting a few environment variables in `docker-compose.yml` to get a full-featured Valhalla instance.\n- [**valhalla-operator**](https://github.com/itayankri/valhalla-operator): A k8s operator to deploy and manage Valhalla.\n- [**valhalla-app**](https://github.com/gis-ops/valhalla-app): A React based web app for Valhalla, powering https://valhalla.openstreetmap.de/.\n- [**valhalla-qgis-plugin**](https://github.com/gis-ops/valhalla-qgis-plugin): A QGIS plugin for Valhalla, also available in the [official QGIS plugin store](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/valhalla/). **Note**, it's almost deprecated and will be replaced with a much superior alternative.\n- [**routingpy**](https://github.com/gis-ops/routingpy): A Python client for most open-source routing engines, including Valhalla, with a common interface for all engines. Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/routingpy/).\n- [**routingjs**](https://github.com/gis-ops/routingjs): A TypeScript client for most open-source routing engines, including Valhalla, with a common interface for all engines. Available as engine-specific packages on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@routingjs/valhalla).\n- [**pyvalhalla**](https://github.com/gis-ops/pyvalhalla): Python bindings for Valhalla, so its APIs can be used from within Python without a HTTP service. Available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pyvalhalla/).\n- [**Valhalla_jll.jl**](https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/Valhalla_jll.jl): Valhalla binaries shipped for Julia.\n- [**valhalla-go**](https://github.com/pufferffish/valhalla-go): Valhalla Golang bindings via cgo\n"
