the terminal and the command per syntax highlighting is configurable in the preferences dialog; an embedded terminal is available on linux and mac os\n- Alignment of text, images, tables and codeboxes (left/center/right/fill)\n- Hyperlinks associated to text and images (links to webpages, links to nodes/nodes + anchors, links to files, links to folders)\n- Spell check (using gspell)\n- Intra application copy/paste: supported single images, single codeboxes, single tables and a compound selection of rich text, images, codeboxes and tables\n- Cross application copy/paste (tested with libreoffice and gmail): supported single images, single codeboxes, single tables and a compound selection of rich text, images, codeboxes and tables\n- Copying a list of files from the file manager and pasting in cherrytree will create a list of links to files, images are recognized and inserted in the text\n- Print & save as pdf file of a selection / node / node and subnodes / the whole tree\n- Export to html of a selection / node / node and subnodes / the whole tree\n- Export to plain text of a selection / node / node and subnodes / the whole tree\n- Toc generation for a node / node and subnodes / the whole tree, based on headers h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 and text sections between headers collapsible\n- Find a node, find in selected node, find in selected node and subnodes, find in all nodes\n- Replace in nodes names, replace in selected node, replace in selected node and subnodes, replace in all nodes\n- Iteration of the latest find, iteration of the latest replace, iteration of the latest applied text formatting\n- Import from html file, import from folder of html files\n- Import from plain text file, import from folder of plain text files\n- Import from basket, cherrytree, epim html, gnote, keepnote, keynote, knowit, mempad, notecase, rednotebook, tomboy, treepad lite, tuxcards, zim\n- Export to cherrytree file of a selection / node / node and subnodes / the whole tree\n- Password protection (using http://www.7-zip.org/) available only for storage as single file – NOTE: while a cherrytree password protected document is opened, an unprotected copy is extracted to a temporary -folder of the filesystem; this copy is removed when you close cherrytree\n- Tree nodes drag and drop\n- Automatic link to web page if writing the URL\n- Automatic link to node if writing node name surrounded by [[node name]]\n\n## Prebuilt binaries\nPrebuilt binaries can be found on [github.com/giuspen/cherrytree/releases](https://github.com/giuspen/cherrytree/releases) and [giuspen.net/cherrytree/#downl](https://www.giuspen.net/cherrytree/#downl).\n\n## How to build from source code\nIn order to build from the source code, please read [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).\n\n## Localization\nThe following languages are supported (If you want to help translating to your language write me):\n\n- Arabic (ar, Abdulrahman Karajeh, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Armenian (hy, Seda Stamboltsyan, up to date)\n- Bulgarian (bg, Iliya Nikolaev, up to date)\n- Chinese Simplified (zh_CN, Wang Yu, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Chinese Traditional (zh_TW, Emer Chen, up to date)\n- Croatian (hr, Filip Bakula, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Czech (cs, Pavel Fric, up to date)\n- Dutch (nl, up to date)\n- English (en, default)\n- French (fr, Francis Gernet, up to date)\n- Finnish (fi, Henri Kaustinen, TO BE UPDATED)\n- German (de, Matthias Hoffmann, up to date)\n- Greek (el, Asterios Siomos, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Hindi India (hi_IN, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Hungarian (hu, Stiener Norbert, up to date)\n- Italian (it, Vincenzo Reale, up to date)\n- Japanese (ja, Piyo, up to date)\n- Kazakh (kk_KZ, Viktor Polyanskiy, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Kazakh (kk_LA, Latin, Viktor Polyanskiy, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Korean (ko, Sean Lee, up to date)\n- Lithuanian (lt, up to date)\n- Persian (fa, Majid Abri, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Polish (pl, Mariusz Gasperaniec, up to date)\n- Portuguese (pt, Rui Santos, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Portuguese Brazil (pt_BR, Raysa Dutra, up to date)\n- Romanian (ro, Tudor Sprinceana, up to date)\n- Russian (ru, Viktor Polyanskiy, TO BE UPDATED)\n- Slovak (sk, Michal Fusatý, up to date)\n- Slovenian (sl, Erik Lovrič, up to date)\n- Spanish (es, up to date)\n- Swedish (sv, Åke Engelbrektson, up to date)\n- Turkish (tr, Ferhat Aydin, up to date)\n- Ukrainian (uk, Giuseppe Penone, up to date)\n\n## Programming with GTKmm3\nhttps://docs.huihoo.com/gtkmm/programming-with-gtkmm-3/3.8.0/en/\n\n## Third party Android project SourCherry\nOutstanding third party Android project: https://github.com/FFDA/SourCherry\n"
