Links to screen captures of what is \nobserved on screen or video of specific steps to produce the problem are very helpful.  \nThen we will try to reproduce the bugs and fix them.\nUnfortunately, bugs can sometimes only be reproduced in your own environment, \nso we cannot reproduce them. \nIf you believe you can fix the bug, please submit a pull request.\n\n## Features\n\nIf you had an idea about a new feature, please implement it and send a pull request to us.\nIf you cannot implement the feature, please open a topic on the [Google Group Page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opentoonz_en).\nIt enables us to discuss implementations of the feature there.\nFeature requests posted on GitHub without an active developer or funding will be closed \nto keep the issue tracker from becoming cluttered with unfulfilled feature requests.\n\n## Translations\n\nTranslation source (`.ts`) files for OpenToonz GUI are located in `toonz/sources/translations`.\nIf you create new `.ts` files for your language or update an existing one,\nplease send us those modifications as pull-requests.\n[Qt Linguist](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.6/linguist-translators.html) is useful for translating them.\n\nPlease send us Qt message (`.qm`) files with `.ts` files if you can make the following modifications.\n\nOpenToonz uses `.qm` files generated from `.ts` files.\nYou can generate `.qm` files by using [Qt Linguist](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.6/linguist-translators.html).\nPlease locate generated `.qm` files in `stuff/config/loc`.\nIt enables the OpenToonz installer to install them into the `stuff` directory.\n"
