The Free Translation Project is\na way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all\ntogether, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many\nlanguages.  A few packages already provide translations for their\nmessages.\n\n   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may\nassume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,\nitself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_\nneed to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using\nthis package with messages translated.\n\n   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also\nexplain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the\navailable translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and\nwork on translations can contact the appropriate team.\n\n   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be\nrelated to internationalization, you should tell about the version of\n`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the\n`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.\n\n1.1 Quick configuration advice\n==============================\n\nIf you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you\nshould configure it using\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n\nto force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this\npackage, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the\noperating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only\nthe `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as\nmany features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic\ncharset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.\nIt is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top\nof a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will\nvery likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea\nto change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.\n\n   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or\nyou have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the\nincluded `libintl'.\n\n1.2 INSTALL Matters\n===================\n\nSome packages are \"localizable\" when properly installed; the programs\nthey contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such\npackages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to\ninternationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.\n\n   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of\nmessages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already\nprovides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the included GNU\n`gettext' library will be used.  This library is wholly contained\nwithin this package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior\ninstallation of the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.\nInstallers may use special options at configuration time for changing\nthe default behaviour.  The commands:\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n     ./configure --disable-nls\n\nwill, respectively, bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the\ninternationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,\n_totally_ disable translation of messages.\n\n   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run\nconfigure without an option for your new package, `configure' will\nprobably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and\nwill decide to use this.  This might not be desirable.  You should use\nthe more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e. if the file\n`intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this package is\nmore recent, you should use\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n\nto prevent auto-detection.\n\n   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function\nand therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an\nemulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the\nextensions of the GNU `gettext' library.\n\n   Internationalized packages usually have many `po/LL.po' files, where\nLL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless\ntranslations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the\n`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed\ntogether with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'\nmay be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.\n`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter\ncodes, stating which languages are allowed.\n\n1.3 Using This Package\n======================\n\nAs a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you\nonly have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate\n`LL_CC' combination.  If you happen to have the `LC_ALL' or some other\n`LC_xxx' environment variables set, you should unset them before\nsetting `LANG', otherwise the setting of `LANG' will not have the\ndesired effect.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code, and\n`CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's\nsuppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell\nprompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),\n`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').\nThis can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for\nall.\n\n   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.\nBut in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For\nexample, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The\ncountry code serves to distinguish the dialects.\n\n   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the\nlanguage and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based\non GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are\nused, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of\nlocales supported by your system for your language by running the\ncommand `locale -a | grep '^LL''.\n\n   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an\nEnglish message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you\nunderstand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.\nThis is done through a different environment variable, called\n`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'\nfor the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'\nset to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the\nsystem libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather\nread translations in German than English for when Swedish is not\navailable, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.\n\n   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian\nbokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the\ntransition period, while some message catalogs for this language are\ninstalled under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended\nfor Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and\nolder translations are used.\n\n   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'\nenvironment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'\nto denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent\nto `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'\n(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.\n\n1.4 Translating Teams\n=====================\n\nFor the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested\npeople who like their own language and write it well, and who are also\nable to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.\nEach translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of\nteams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,\n`http://translationproject.org/', in the \"Teams\" area.\n\n   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you\nshould become a member of the translating team for your own language.\nThe subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has\n`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a\nmessage to `sv-request@li.org', having this message body:\n\n     subscribe\n\n   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate\n_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,\nrather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and\nyou want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to\nget started, please write to `coordinator@translationproject.org' to\nreach the coordinator for all translator teams.\n\n   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing\nthe terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skills are praised more than\nprogramming skills, here.\n\n1.5 Available Packages\n======================\n\nLanguages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following\nmatrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of May 2010.\nThe matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages PO\nfiles have been submitted to translation coordination, with a\ntranslation percentage of at least 50%.\n\n     Ready PO files       af am ar as ast az be be@latin bg bn_IN bs ca crh\n

This is because a few extra PO files are\nused for implementing regional variants of languages, or language\ndialects.\n\n   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to\nwhich it applies should also have been internationalized and\ndistributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable\nlag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a\ndistribution.\n\n   If May 2010 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of\nthis `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.

Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public\nLicense which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means\nin particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared\nlibrary, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static\nlibrary or use modified versions of `libintl'.\n\n   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle\nthe use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The\nFree Translation Project is also available for packages which are not\ndeveloped inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above\napplies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact\n`coordinator@translationproject.org' to make the `.pot' files available\nto the translation teams.\n\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.

It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Distribution Obligations.\n\n     3.1. Application of License.\n     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\n     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n     Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications.\n     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n          (a) Third Party Claims.\n          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\n          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n          distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Contributor APIs.\n          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n               (c)    Representations.\n          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n          this License.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices.\n     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n     terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works.\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n     understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions.\n     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised\n     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\n     will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n     Covered Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\n     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",\n     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\n     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\n     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\n     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\n     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\n     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n     this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n     shall survive.\n\n     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n     You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n     the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n     Participant.\n\n     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n     license.\n\n     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n     prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n     The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n     software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n     rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n     License.\n\n12.

See release\n          notes for examples. This problem reported by beccablain at OOo.\n        - ngram suggestions now are case insensitive (see `Permenant' bug in Issuezilla)\n        - weight ngram suggestions (with the longest common subsequent algorithm,\n          also considering lengths of bad word and suggestion, identical first\n          letters and almost completely identical character positions)\n        - set strict affix congruency in expand_rootword(). Now ngram suggestions\n          are good for languages with rich morphology and also better for English.\n          Rationale: affixed forms of the first ngram suggestion\n          very often suppress the second and subsequent root word suggestions. But\n          faults in affixes are more uncommon, and can be fix without suggestions.\n          We must prefer the more informative second and subsequent root word\n          suggestions instead of the suggestions for bad affixes.\n        - a better suggestion may not be substring of a less good suggestion\n\t  Rationale: Suggesting affixed forms of a root word is\n          unnecessary, when root word has got better weighted ngram value.\n          (Checking substrings is a good approximation for this refinement.)\n\t- lesser ngram suggestions (default 3 maximum instead of 10)\n          Rationale: For users need a big extra effort to check a lot of bad ngram\n          suggestions, nine times out of ten unnecessarily. It is very\n          distracting, because ngram suggestions could be very different.\n          Usually Myspell and Hunspell suggest one or two suggestions with\n          the old suggestion algorithms (maximum is 15), with ngram algorithm\n          often gives maximum number suggestions. With strict affix congruency\n          and other refinements, the good suggestion there is usually among the\n          first three elements.\n\t- new affix parameter: MAXNGRAMSUG\n\n        * src/hunspell/*: support agglutinative languages with rich prefix\n\t  morphology or with right-to-left writing system (for example, Turkic\n\t  and Austronesian languages with (modified) Arabic scripts).\n\t- new affix parameter: COMPLEXPREFIXES\n\t  Set twofold prefix stripping (but single suffix stripping)\n\t* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx:\n\t- speed up prefix loading with tree sorting algorithm.\n\t* tests/complexprefixes.*, tests/complexprefixesutf.*:\n\t  Coptic example posted by Moheb Mekhaiel\n\n\t* src/hunspell/hashmgr.cxx: check size attribute in dic file\n\t  suggested by Daniel Naber\n\t  Rationale: With missing size attribute Hunspell allocates too small and\n          more slower hash memory, and Hunspell can lose first dictionary word.\n\n\t* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: check stripping characters and condition\n\t  compatibility in affix rules (bugs detected in cs_CZ, es_ES, es_NEW,\n          es_MX, lt_LT, nn_NO, pt_PT, ro_RO and sk_SK dictionaries). See release\n          notes of Hunspell 1.0.9 in NEWS.\n\n\t* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: check unnecessary fields in affix rules\n          (bugs detected in ro_RO and sv_SE dictionaries). See release notes.\n\n\t* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: remove redundant condition checking\n\t  in affix rules with stripping characters (redundancy in OpenOffice.org\n\t  dictionaries reported by Eleonóra Goldman)\n          Rationale: this is a little optimization, but it was excellent for\n          detect the bad ngram affixation with bad or weak affix conditions.\n\n\t* tests/germancompounding.aff: improve compound definition\n\t- use dash prefix instead of language specific tokenizer\n          Rationale: Using uniform approach is the right way to check and analyze\n\t  compound words. Language specific word breaking is deprecated, need\n          a sophisticated grammar checking for word-like word pairs\n          (for example in Hungarian there is a substandard, but accepted\n          syntax with dash for word pairs: cats, dogs -> kutyák-macskák (like\n          cats/dogs in English).\n\n\t* test Hunspell with 54 OpenOffice.org dictionaries: see release notes\n\nbug fixes:\n\n\t* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.*: add time limit to exponential\n\t  algorithm of the related character map suggestion\n\t  Rationale: a long word in agglutinative languages or a special pattern\n          (for example a horizontal rule) made of map characters can `crash' the\n          spell checker.\n\n        * src/hunspell/affentry.cxx: add() functions: fix bad word generation\n          checking stripping characters (see similar bug in unmunch)\n\n\t* src/hunspell/affixmgr.cxx: parse_file(): fix unconditional getNext()\n\t  call for ~AffixMgr() when affix file is corrupt.\n\n\t* src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: AffixMgr(), parse_cpdsyllable(): fix missing\n\t  string duplications for ~AffixMgr() when affix file is corrupt.\n\n\t* src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: parse_affix(): fix fprintf() call when affix\n\t  file is corrupt. Bug reported by Daniel Naber.\n\n\t* suggestmgr.cxx: replace single usage of 'strdup' with 'mystrdup'\n\t  patch by Chris Halls (debian.org)\n\n\t* src/hunspell/makefile.mk: add makefile.mk for compiling in OpenOffice.org\n\t  See README in Hunspell UNO modul.\n\t  Problems with separated compiling reported by Rene Engelhard\n\n\t* src/hunspell/hunspell.cxx: fix pseudoroot support\n\t- search a not pseudoroot homonym in check()\n\t* tests/pseudoroot4.*: test this fix\n\n\t* src/tools/unmunch.c: fix bad word generation when conditions\n\t  are shorter or incompatible with stripping characters in affix rules\n\n\t* src/tools/unmunch.c: fix mychomp() for de_AT.dic and other dic files\n\t  without last new line character.\n\nother changes:\n\t* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.*: erase ACCENT suggestion\n\t  Rationale: ACCENT suggestion was the same as Kevin Hendrick's map\n\t  suggestion algorithm, but with a less good interface in affix file.\n\n\t* src/hunspell/suggestmgr.*: combine cycle number limit\n\t  in badchar(), and forgotchar() with a time limit.\n\n\t* src/hunspell/affixmgr.*: remove NOMAPSUGS affix parameter\n\n\t* src/hunspell/{suggestmgr,hunspell}.*: strip periods from\n\t  suggestions (restore MySpell's original behaviour)\n\t  Rationale: OpenOffice.org has an automatic period handling mechanism\n\t  and suggestions look better without periods.\n\t- new affix file parameter: SUGSWITHDOTS\n\t  Add period(s) to suggestions, if input word terminates in period(s).\n          (No need for OpenOffice.org dictionaries.)\n\n\t* tests/germancompounding.aff: improve bad german affix in affix example\n\t  (computeren->computern).

By adding balanced\n    multi-level time limits, now the guaranteed suggestion time is there\n    within half a second, not seconds (nor dozen of seconds or more\n    in extreme cases) for longer misspellings, too.\n\n  - add SPELLML support for run-time dictionary extension with optional\n    affixation of user words. See new \"Grammar By\" feature of\n    language-specific user dictionaries of LibreOffice 6.0:\n\n    News: https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleaseNotes/6.0#.E2.80.9CGrammar_By.E2.80.9D_spell_checking\n\n    Screencast with English example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsS3gaBTfOo\n\n    Screencast with German example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYVFDqCUb6I\n\n  - Improved, highly customizable suggestions on level of dictionary words:\n    Pronunciations and typical misspellings defined by optional \"ph:\" fields of\n    the dictionary words are used not only in n-gram suggestions, but as\n    elements of the REP replacement list getting the highest priority in normal\n    suggestions, also giving the best suggestions for short words, too.\n    More information: see \"ph:\" in man 5 hunspell.\n\n  - Handling multiple word suggestions is much more easier. Like in a\n    traditional spelling dictionary, for example, to get the correct suggestion\n    \"a lot\" for the typical misspelling \"alot\" at the first place, now it's\n    enough to put the following line to the dic(tionary) file:\n\n    a lot\n\n  - Limit compound overgeneration by dictionary based word pairs:\n    Now it's possible to filter bad compound words by listing\n    the correct word pairs with space in the dictionary, as in a traditional\n    spelling dictionary.\n\n  - clean-up suggestion:\n\n    - no n-gram and compound word suggestions, if \"good\" suggestion\n      exists, ie. uppercase, REP, ph: or dictionary word pair suggestions\n\n    - word pairs are always suggested, if they exist in the dic file\n\n    - word pairs have top priority in suggestions, and\n      these are the only suggestions if there is no other good suggestion.\n\n    - also dictionary word pairs separated by dash instead of space\n      are handled specially in two-word suggestion (depending from the\n      language)\n\n   - limit bad suggestions by improved n-gram suggestion rules:\n\n     don't suggest capitalized dictionary words for lower\n     case misspellings in n-gram suggestions, except\n\n     - PHONE usage, or\n     - in the case of German, where not only proper\n       nouns are capitalized, or\n     - the capitalized word has special pronunciation\n\n     and don't suggest if the difference of lengths of misspellings and\n     suggestions is 5 or more characters.\n\n  - Extend dotless i and dotted I rules to Crimean Tatar language\n    Allow dotted I in dictionary, and disable bad capitalization of i.\n\n  - BREAK: extended recursive word breaking algorithm to handle words or\n    words with suffixes when they already contain word break characters,\n    for example, \"e-mail\" is a dictionary word with a word break character, and\n    it wasn't accepted before in compounds in some languages.\n\n  - FORBIDDENWORD precedes BREAK: Now it's possible to forbid compound\n    forms recognized by BREAK word breaking by adding the bad compounds to\n    the dictionary with FORBIDDENWORD flags.\n\n  - lower limit for \"doubletwochars\" suggestion algorithm:\n    one of the typical misspellings recognized by Hunspell suggestion\n    mechanism is the syllable duplication. Along the old pattern\n    ABABA -> ABA, for example nutrITITIon -> nutrITIon, now also the\n    simpler ABAB -> AB pattern is recognized in non-starting position,\n    for example, regretTETEd -> regretTEd.\n\n  - lower limit for longswapchar and movechar: recognized only max.\n    4-character distances to avoid slow and bad suggestions.\n\n  - fix compound handling for new Hungarian orthography reform\n\n  - Allow suggestion search for prefix + *two suffixes*:\n    Remove artificial performance limit to get correct\n    suggestions for relatively simple misspellings in\n    Hungarian, etc., when the word form contains prefix\n    and both derivative and inflectional suffixes, too:\n\n    lefikszálása -> lefixálása\n\n  Improvements for command-line Hunspell:\n\n  - Remove false alarms during checking OpenDocument (ODF)\n    documents by ignoring <text:span> elements. (LibreOffice\n    creates a lot of <text:span> elements also within words\n    during text reediting, resulted often huge amount of broken\n    words before this fix.)\n\n  - List filenames during filtering multiple files in command-line:\n\n    Examples:\n\n    $ hunspell -l *.odt\n    a.odt: mispelling\n    b.odt: egzample\n\n    $ hunspell -l -G *.odt\n    a.odt: good\n    b.odt: words\n\n  - Dictionary search by option -D doesn't wait for the standard input\n    (fixed by Siva Mahadevan)\n\n  Other improvements:\n\n  - makealias dictionary compression: add option --minimize-diff\n    to reuse free positions of alias lists to create minimal and\n    readable diffs for alias compressed dictionaries stored in\n    revision control systems, as dictionaries of LibreOffice.\n\n  - Brazilian-Portuguese translation by Rafael Fontenelle\n\n  - Catalan translation by robert dot buj at gmail\n\n  - Minor bug fixes by several contributors, see git log\n\n2017-09-03: Hunspell 1.6.2 release:\n  - Library changes: no.

Example:\n\n  # Accepting de facto replacements of the Romanian comma acuted letters\n  SET UTF-8\n  ICONV 4\n  ICONV Å È\n  ICONV Å£ È\n  ICONV Å È\n  ICONV Å¢ È\n\n    Typical usage of ICONV/OCONV is to manage an inner format for a segmental\n    writing system, like the Ethiopic script of the Amharic language.\n\n  - Extended CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN to handle conpound word alternations, like\n    sandhi feature of Telugu and other writing systems.\n\n  - SIMPLIFIEDTRIPLE compound word feature: allow simplified Swedish and\n    Norwegian compound word forms, like tillÃ¥ta (till|lÃ¥ta) and\n    bussjÃ¥fÃ¸r (buss|sjÃ¥fÃ¸r)\n\n  - wordforms: word generator script for dictionary developers (Hunspell\n    version of unmunch).\n\n  - bug fixes\n\n2008-08-15: Hunspell 1.2.7 release:\n  - FULLSTRIP: new option for affix handling. With FULLSTRIP, affix rules can\n    strip full words, not only one less characters.\n  - COMPOUNDRULE works with all flag types. (COMPOUNDRULE is for pattern\n    matching. For example, en_US dictionary of OpenOffice.org uses COMPOUNDRULE\n    for ordinal number recognition: 1st, 2nd, 11th, 12th, 22nd, 112th, 1000122nd\n    etc.).\n  - optimized suggestions:\n    - modified 1-character distance suggestion algorithms: search a TRY character\n      in all position instead of all TRY characters in a character position\n      (it can give more readable suggestion order, also better suggestions\n      in the first positions, when TRY characters are sorted by frequency.)\n      For example, suggestions for \"moze\":\n      ooze, doze, Roze, maze, more etc. (Hunspell 1.2.6),\n      maze, more, mote, ooze, mole etc. (Hunspell 1.2.7).\n    - extended compound word checking for better COMPOUNDRULE related\n      suggestions, for example English ordinal numbers: 121323th -> 121323rd\n      (it needs also a th->rd REP definition).\n  - bug fixes\n\n2008-07-15: Hunspell 1.2.6 release:\n  - bug fix release (fix affix rule condition checking of sk_SK dictionary,\n    iconv support in stemming and morphological analysis of the Hunspell\n    utility, see also Changelog)\n\n2008-07-09: Hunspell 1.2.5 release:\n  - bug fix release (fix affix rule condition checking of en_GB dictionary,\n    also morphological analysis by dictionaries with two-level suffixes)\n\n2008-06-18: Hunspell 1.2.4-2 release:\n  - fix GCC compiler warnings\n\n2008-06-17: Hunspell 1.2.4 release:\n  - add free_list() for C, C++ interfaces to deallocate suggestion lists\n  \n  - bug fixes\n\n2008-06-17: Hunspell 1.2.3 release:\n  - extended XML interface to use morphological functions by standard\n    spell checking interface, spell() and suggest().

On other Unixes we\nneed to manually install them.\n\nFor Ubuntu:\n\n    sudo apt install autoconf automake autopoint libtool\n\nThen run the following commands:\n\n    autoreconf -vfi\n    ./configure\n    make\n    sudo make install\n    sudo ldconfig\n\nFor dictionary development, use the `--with-warnings` option of\nconfigure.\n\nFor interactive user interface of Hunspell executable, use the\n`--with-ui` option.\n\nOptional developer packages:\n\n  - ncurses (need for --with-ui), eg. libncursesw5 for UTF-8\n  - readline (for fancy input line editing, configure parameter:\n    --with-readline)\n\nIn Ubuntu, the packages are:\n\n    libncurses5-dev libreadline-dev\n\n# Compiling on OSX and macOS\n\nOn macOS for compiler always use `clang` and not `g++` because Homebrew\ndependencies are build with that.\n\n    brew install autoconf automake libtool gettext\n    brew link gettext --force\n\nThen run:\n\n    autoreconf -vfi\n    ./configure\n    make\n\n# Compiling on Windows\n\n## Compiling with Mingw64 and MSYS2\n\nDownload Msys2, update everything and install the following\n    packages:\n\n    pacman -S base-devel mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain mingw-w64-x86_64-libtool\n\nOpen Mingw-w64 Win64 prompt and compile the same way as on Linux, see\nabove.\n\n## Compiling in Cygwin environment\n\nDownload and install Cygwin environment for Windows with the following\nextra packages:\n\n  - make\n  - automake\n  - autoconf\n  - libtool\n  - gcc-g++ development package\n  - ncurses, readline (for user interface)\n  - iconv (character conversion)\n\nThen compile the same way as on Linux. Cygwin builds depend on\nCygwin1.dll.\n\n# Debugging\n\nIt is recommended to install a debug build of the standard library:\n\n    libstdc++6-6-dbg\n\nFor debugging we need to create a debug build and then we need to start\n`gdb`.\n\n    ./configure CXXFLAGS='-g -O0 -Wall -Wextra'\n    make\n    ./libtool --mode=execute gdb src/tools/hunspell\n\nYou can also pass the `CXXFLAGS` directly to `make` without calling\n`./configure`, but we don't recommend this way during long development\nsessions.\n\nIf you like to develop and debug with an IDE, see documentation at\nhttps://github.com/hunspell/hunspell/wiki/IDE-Setup\n\n# Testing\n\nTesting Hunspell (see tests in tests/ subdirectory):\n\n    make check\n\nor with Valgrind debugger:\n\n    make check\n    VALGRIND=[Valgrind_tool] make check\n\nFor example:\n\n    make check\n    VALGRIND=memcheck make check\n\n# Documentation\n\nfeatures and dictionary format:\n\n    man 5 hunspell\n    man hunspell\n    hunspell -h\n\nhttp://hunspell.github.io/\n\n# Usage\n\nAfter compiling and installing (see INSTALL) you can run the Hunspell\nspell checker (compiled with user interface) with a Hunspell or Myspell\ndictionary:\n\n    hunspell -d en_US text.txt\n\nor without interface:\n\n    hunspell\n    hunspell -d en_GB -l <text.txt\n\nDictionaries consist of an affix (.aff) and dictionary (.dic) file, for\nexample, download American English dictionary files of LibreOffice\n(older version, but with stemming and morphological generation) with\n\n    wget -O en_US.aff  https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/plain/en/en_US.aff?id=a4473e06b56bfe35187e302754f6baaa8d75e54f\n    wget -O en_US.dic https://cgit.freedesktop.org/libreoffice/dictionaries/plain/en/en_US.dic?id=a4473e06b56bfe35187e302754f6baaa8d75e54f\n\nand with command line input and output, it's possible to check its work quickly,\nfor example with the input words \"example\", \"examples\", \"teached\" and\n\"verybaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad\":\n\n    $ hunspell -d en_US\n    Hunspell 1.7.0\n    example\n    *\n\n    examples\n    + example\n\n    teached\n    & teached 9 0: taught, teased, reached, teaches, teacher, leached, beached\n\n    verybaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad\n    # verybaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad 0\n\nWhere in the output, `*` and `+` mean correct (accepted) words (`*` = dictionary stem,\n`+` = affixed forms of the following dictionary stem), and\n`&` and `#` mean bad (rejected) words (`&` = with suggestions, `#` = without suggestions)\n(see man hunspell).\n\nExample for stemming:\n\n    $ hunspell -d en_US -s\n    mice\n    mice mouse\n\nExample for morphological analysis (very limited with this English dictionary):\n\n    $ hunspell -d en_US -m\n    mice\n    mice  st:mouse ts:Ns\n\n    cats\n    cats  st:cat ts:0 is:Ns\n    cats  st:cat ts:0 is:Vs\n\n# Other executables\n\nThe src/tools directory contains the following executables after compiling.\n\n  - The main executable:\n      - hunspell: main program for spell checking and others (see\n        manual)\n  - Example tools:\n      - analyze: example of spell checking, stemming and morphological\n        analysis\n      - chmorph: example of automatic morphological generation and\n        conversion\n      - example: example of spell checking and suggestion\n  - Tools for dictionary development:\n      - affixcompress: dictionary generation from large (millions of\n        words) vocabularies\n      - makealias: alias compression (Hunspell only, not back compatible\n        with MySpell)\n      - wordforms: word generation (Hunspell version of unmunch)\n      - hunzip: decompressor of hzip format\n      - hzip: compressor of hzip format\n      - munch (DEPRECATED, use affixcompress): dictionary generation\n        from vocabularies (it needs an affix file, too).\n      - unmunch (DEPRECATED, use wordforms): list all recognized words\n        of a MySpell dictionary\n\nExample for morphological generation:\n\n    $ ~/hunspell/src/tools/analyze en_US.aff en_US.dic /dev/stdin\n    cat mice\n    generate(cat, mice) = cats\n    mouse cats\n    generate(mouse, cats) = mice\n    generate(mouse, cats) = mouses\n\n# Using Hunspell library with GCC\n\nIncluding in your program:\n\n    #include <hunspell.hxx>\n\nLinking with Hunspell static library:\n\n    g++ -lhunspell-1.7 example.cxx\n    # or better, use pkg-config\n    g++ $(pkg-config --cflags --libs hunspell) example.cxx\n\n# Installing Hunspell (vcpkg)\n\nAlternatively, you can build and install hunspell using [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/) dependency manager:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n    cd vcpkg\n    ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh\n    ./vcpkg integrate install\n    ./vcpkg install hunspell\n\nThe hunspell port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft team members and community contributors.

Specifically Geoff's use of a \nconds[] array that makes it easy to check if the conditions \nrequired for a particular affix are present was very \ningenious! Kudos to Geoff.  Very nicely done.  \nBTW: ispell is available under a BSD style license \nfrom Geoff Kuennings ispell website:\nhttp://www.cs.ucla.edu/ficus-members/geoff/ispell.html \n\n\nKevin Hendricks <kevin.hendricks@sympatico.ca> is the original \nauthor and now maintainer of the MySpell codebase.  Recent \nadditions include ngram support, and related character maps \nto help improve and create suggestions for very poorly \nspelled words. \n\nPlease send any and all contributions or improvements\nto him or to dev@lingucomponent.openoffice.org.\n\n\nDavid Einstein (Deinst@world.std.com) developed an almost\ncomplete rewrite of MySpell for use by the Mozilla project.\nDavid and I are now working on parallel development tracks \nto help our respective projects (Mozilla and OpenOffice.org) \nand we will maintain full affix file and dictionary file \ncompatibility and work on merging our versions of MySpell \nback into a single tree. David has been a significant help \nin improving MySpell.\n\n\nNémeth László <nemethl@gyorsposta.hu> is the author of \nthe Hungarian dictionary and he developed and contributed\nextensive changes to MySpell including ... \n  * code to support compound words in MySpell\n  * fixed numerous problems with encoding case conversion tables. \n  * designed/developed replacement tables to improve suggestions\n  * changed affix file parsing to trees to greatly speed loading\n  * removed the need for malloc/free pairs in suffix_check which\n      speeds up spell checking in suffix rich languages by 20%\n\nDavide Prina <davideprina@uahoo.com>, Giuseppe Modugno \n<gppe.modugno@libero.it>, Gianluca Turconi <luctur@comeg.it> \nall from the it_IT OpenOffice.org team performed an \nextremely  detailed code review of MySpell and generated\nfixes for bugs, leaks, and speedup improvements. \n\nSimon Brouwer <simon.oo.o@xs4all.nl> for fixes and enhancements\nthat have greatly improved MySpell auggestions\n  * n-gram suggestions for an initcap word have an init. cap. \n  * fix for too many n-gram suggestions from specialized dictionary,\n  * fix for long suggestions rather than close ones in case of \n      dictionaries with many compound words (kompuuter)\n  * optionally disabling split-word suggestions (controlled \n      by NOSPLITSUGS line in affix file)\n\n\nSpecial Thanks to all others who have either contributed ideas or\ntesting for MySpell\n\n\nThanks,\n\nKevin Hendricks\nkevin.hendricks@sympatico.ca\n"
