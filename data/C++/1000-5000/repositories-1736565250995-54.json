          "content": "------ current release ---------------------------\n\n- Sync now supports AWS S3 as a backend.\n- A new `task import-v2` command allows importing Taskwarrior-2.x\n  data files directly.\n\n3.3.0 -\n\nThanks to the following people for contributions to this release:\n\n - Chongyun Lee\n - David Tolnay\n - Dustin J. Mitchell\n - Felix Schurk\n - geoffpaulsen\n - Kalle Kietäväinen\n - Kursat Aktas\n - Scott Mcdermott\n - Thomas Lauf\n\n------ old releases ------------------------------\n\n3.2.0 -\n\n - Support for the journal in `task info` has been restored (#3671) and the\n   task info output no longer contains `tag_` values (#3619).\n - The `rc.weekstart` value now affects calculation of week numbers in\n   expressions like `2013-W49` (#3654).\n - Build-time flag `ENABLE_TLS_NATIVE_ROOTS` will cause `task sync` to use the\n   system TLS roots instead of its built-in roots to authenticate the server (#3660).\n - The output from `task undo` is now more human-readable. The `undo.style`\n   configuraiton option, which has had no effect since 3.0.0, is now removed (3672).\n - Fetching pending tasks is now more efficient (#3661).\n\nThanks to the following people for contributions to this release:\n\n - Denis Zh.\n - Dustin J. Mitchell\n - Fredrik Lanker\n - Gagan Nagaraj\n - Jan Christian Grünhage\n - Scott Mcdermott\n - Thomas Lauf\n - Tobias Predel\n\n3.1.0 -\n\n - Support for `task purge` has been restored, and new support added for automatically\n   expiring old tasks. (#3540, #3546, #3556)\n - `task news` is now better behaved, and can be completely disabled.\n - Multiple imports of the same UUID will now generate a warning. (#3560)\n - The `sync.server.url` config replaces `sync.server.origin` and allows a URL\n   containing a path. (#3423)\n - The new `bubblegum-256.theme` has improved legibility and contrast over\n   others. (#3505)\n - Warnings regarding `.data` files are only show for reports. (#3473)\n - Inherited urgency is correctly calculated to make parents more urgent than\n   children (#2941)\n - Task completion commands no longer trigger hooks (#3133)\n\nThanks to the following people for contributions to this release:\n\n - Adrian Galilea\n - Adrian Sadłocha\n - Andonome\n - Christian Clauss\n - Dominik Rehák\n - Dustin J. Mitchell\n - Felix Schurk\n - Hector Dearman\n - Joseph Coffa\n - koleesch\n - Maarten Aertsen\n - mattsmida\n - Philipp Oberdiek\n - Sebastian Carlos\n - sleepy_nols\n - Steve Dondley\n - Will R S Hansen\n\n3.0.2 -\n\n- Fix an accidentally-included debug print which polluted output of\n  reports with the Taskwarrior version (#3389)\n\n3.0.1 -\n\n- Fix an error in creation of the 3.0.0 tarball which caused builds to fail (#3302)\n- Improvements to `task news`, including notes for the 3.0.0 release\n- Minor improvements to documentation and error handling\n- Fix incorrect task ID of 0 when using hooks (#3339)\n- Issue a warning if .data files remain (#3321)\n\n3.0.0 -\n\n- [BREAKING CHANGE] the sync functionality has been rewritten entirely, and\n  no longer supports taskserver/taskd. Instead, the recommended solution is\n  a cloud-storage backend, although `taskchampion-sync-server` is also\n  available.\n\n  See https://taskwarrior.org/docs/upgrade-3/ for information on upgrading to\n  Taskwarrior 3.0.\n\n  The following config options are no longer supported:\n  - `debug.tls`\n  - `taskd.ca`\n  - `taskd.certificate`\n  - `taskd.ciphers`\n  - `taskd.credentials`\n  - `taskd.key`\n  - `taskd.server`\n  - `taskd.trust`\n\n  The Taskwarrior build no longer requires GnuTLS. The build option\n  `ENABLE_SYNC=OFF` is also no longer supported; sync support is always built\n  in.\n\n  Deep thanks to the following for contributions to this work:\n\n  - Akash Shanmugaraj\n  - Andrew Savchenko\n  - Dathan Bennett\n  - Dustin Mitchell\n  - dbr/Ben\n  - Felix Schurk\n  - Isaac Wyatt\n  - Nathan Luong\n  - Nikos Koukis\n  - Pablo Baeyens\n  - Ravi Sawlani\n  - ryneeverett\n  - Simon Fraser\n\n- TW #2732 Fix urgency inheritance for negative-urgency tasks.\n          Thanks to Jackson Abascal for contributing.\n- TW #2763 `task show` now shows `hooks.location.\n           Thanks to rollniak for reporting and sec65 for contributing.\n- TW #2765 Fix leading space before urgency value in `task info`.\n           Thanks to Dominik Rehák for contributing.\n- TW #2780 Fix formatting of countdown-style dates\n           Thanks to Dominik Rehák for contributing.\n- TW #2826 Fix issue with filter not applied correctly during `task _tags` command\n           Thanks to Nikos Koukis for contributing.\n- TW #3052 Parsing of timestamp values now uses 64-bit integers, avoiding\n           issues in the year 2032.\n           Thanks to Bernhard M.

          "content": "Installation Instructions\n-------------------------\n\nPlease follow the instructions below to build and install Taskwarrior from\nsource.\n\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nYou will need the CMake 3.0+ build system installed in order to build Taskwarrior\nfrom source. More information on CMake can be obtained at https://cmake.org\n\nYou will also need:\n  - make\n\nYou will need a C++ compiler that supports full C++17, which includes:\n  - gcc 7.1   (released 2017-05-02)\n  - clang 5.0 (released 2017-09-07)\n\nYou will need the following libraries:\n  - libuuid (not needed for OSX)\n\nYou will need a Rust toolchain of the Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV):\n  - rust 1.81.0\n\nBasic Installation\n------------------\n\nBriefly, these shell commands will unpack, build and install Taskwarrior:\n\n  $ tar xzf task-X.Y.Z.tar.gz                        [1]\n  $ cd task-X.Y.Z                                    [2]\n  $ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release . [3]\n  $ cmake --build build                              [4]\n  $ sudo cmake --install build                       [5]\n  $ cd .. ; rm -r task-X.Y.Z                         [6]\n\nThese commands are explained below:\n\n  1. Unpacks the source tarball.  This creates the directory task-X.Y.Z,\n     containing all the code.\n\n  2. Change directory to the root of the distribution.\n\n  3. Invokes CMake to scan for dependencies and machine-specific details, then\n     generate the makefiles.  Requests an optimized build, which will run faster\n     and be more compact.  This may take a minute.\n\n  4. Builds Taskwarrior.  This may take a minute.\n\n  5. Installs the program, documentation and other data files.\n\n  6. Removes the temporary directory.\n\n\nBuild and configurations options\n--------------------------------\n\nYou can customize the configuration run with cmake variables. This will modify\nthe installation process:\n\nTo change the installation directory you use the following configuration\nvariable:\n\n  $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<path-to-installation-dir> .\n\ncmake configuration variables are applied with the -D option and consist of a\n<name> and a <value>:\n\n  $ cmake -D<name>=<value> .\n\nFour more variables can customize the installation process. The following table\nlists them and their defaults plus the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:\n\n  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX  /usr/local\n  TASK_BINDIR           bin\n  TASK_DOCDIR           share/doc/task\n  TASK_RCDIR            share/doc/task/rc\n  TASK_MAN1DIR          share/man/man1\n  TASK_MAN5DIR          share/man/man5\n\nThe corresponding TASK_* variables will be combined with CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to\nget absolute installation directories:\n\n  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASK_BINDIR   /usr/local/bin\n  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASK_DOCDIR   /usr/local/share/doc/task\n  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASK_RCDIR    /usr/local/share/doc/task/rc\n  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASK_MAN1DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man1\n  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX/TASK_MAN5DIR  /usr/local/share/man/man5\n\nThe following variables control aspects of the build process:\n\n  SYSTEM_CORROSION - Use system provided corrosion instead of vendored version\n  ENABLE_TLS_NATIVE_ROOTS - Use the system's TLS root certificates\n\n\nUninstallation\n--------------\n\nThere is no uninstall option in CMake makefiles. This is a manual process.\n\nTo uninstall Taskwarrior, remove the files listed in the install_manifest.txt\nfile that was generated when you built Taskwarrior.\n\n\nTaskwarrior Build Notes\n-----------------------\n\nTaskwarrior has dependencies that are detected by CMake in almost all cases, but\nthere are situations and operating systems that mean you will need to offer a\nlittle help.\n\nIf Taskwarrior will not build on your system, first take a look at the Operating\nSystem notes below.  If this doesn't help, then go to the Troubleshooting\nsection, which includes instructions on how to contact us for help.\n\nOffline Build Notes\n-------------------\n\nIt is common for packaging systems (e.g. NixOS, FreeBSD Ports Collection, pkgsrc, etc)\nto disable networking during builds.  This restriction requires all distribution files\nto be prepositioned after checksum verification as a prerequisite for the build.  The\nfollowing steps have been successful in allowing Taskwarrior to be built in this\nenvironment:\n\n1. Extract all crates in a known location, e.g. ${WRKDIR}/cargo-crates\nThis includes crates needed for corrosion (search for Cargo.lock files)\n\n2. Create .cargo-checksum.json for each crate\nFor example:\nprintf '{\"package\":\"%s\",\"files\":{}}' $(sha256 -q ${DISTDIR}/rayon-core-1.12.1.tar.gz) \\\n        > ${WRKDIR}/cargo-crates/rayon-core-1.12.1/.cargo-checksum.json\n\n3. Create a custom config.toml file\nFor example, ${WRKDIR}/.cargo/config.toml\n[source.cargo]\ndirectory = '${WRKDIR}/cargo-crates'\n[source.crates-io]\nreplace-with = 'cargo'\n\n4. After running cmake, configure cargo\nFor example:\ncd ${WRKSRC} && ${SETENV} ${MAKE_ENV} ${CARGO_ENV} \\\n  /usr/local/bin/cargo update \\\n  --manifest-path ${WRKDIR}/.cargo/config.toml \\\n  --verbose\n\n5. Set CARGO_HOME in environment\nFor example\nCARGO_HOME=${WRKDIR}/.cargo\n\nThe build and installation steps should be the same as a standard build\nat this point.\n\nOperating System Notes\n----------------------\n\nCygwin\n  If 'make install' fails when writing to the /usr/local/share/ directory,\n  this may be because your current login doesn't have permission to write\n  to the Windows directory containing your Cygwin installation. Either\n  login to Windows as an Administrator and try the 'make install' process\n  again, or reinstall Cygwin under your normal Windows login.\n\n\nDarwin, 32bit\n  Taskwarrior needs to be built from source, and use this configure command:\n\n    cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-m32 -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-m32 -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=-m32 .\n\n  See:\n    https://taskwarrior.org/issues/817\n    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3261909/build-32bit-on-64-bit-linux-using-a-configure-script\n    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2617508/cmake-gcc-cuda-and-m32-wtf\n    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6077414/cmake-how-to-set-the-ldflags-in-cmakelists-txt\n\n\nOpenBSD\n  In order to build Taskwarrior 2.4.2+, you might need to install a newer GCC\n  version from ports or packages.\n\n  Afterwards, run\n    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=eg++ .\n\n  and build normally.\n\n  See: https://github.com/GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior/issues/1605\n\nWASM\n  Using the Emscripten compiler, you can achieve it like this:\n\n    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=emcc -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DENABLE_WASM=ON \\\n          -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS=\"-m32 -s NO_DYNAMIC_EXECUTION=1 -s WASM=1 -s NO_EXIT_RUNTIME=1 -s INVOKE_RUN=0\" \\\n          -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS_RELEASE=\"-O2 -m32\"\n\n  This will produce an optimized WASM with a main() that is callable multiple times.\n\nTroubleshooting\n---------------\n\nIf you've recently made changes to dependencies (by reinstalling them, for\nexample) be sure to rerun 'cmake .' before trying to execute 'make' again.\n\nCMake will run and locate all the necessary pieces for the build, and create\na Makefile.  There may be errors and warnings when running CMake, or there\nmay be compiler errors and warnings when running 'make'.  Sometimes you will run\nCMake with no reported problems, and the build will fail later.  This is\nalmost always because CMake is mistaken about some assumption.\n\nIf a build does not succeed, please send the contents of the 'CMakeCache.txt'\nand 'CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log' files to support@gothenburgbitfactory.org.\n\nIf CMake runs but Taskwarrior does not build, please send the contents of the\nabove files as well as a transcript from the build, which is not written to a\nfile and must be captured from the terminal.\n\n---\n"
