          "content": "# Hi!\n\nThis is it. Pretty much a history of Farbrausch tools 2001-2011. We've been\nmeaning to release all this for ages, in various forms, and always ended up\nnot doing it because \"we'd just have to clean it up a bit first...\".\n\nNo more. This is **not** cleaned up. This is the raw deal, some from old hard\ndrives, some fresh from various SVN repositories. This is code written for\na bunch of different versions of Visual Studio. Some of it is really tricky\nto compile, some really easy. There's some nice clean stuff there, other parts\nare just a complete mess.\n\nThe original unmodified code (with a few bug fixes) is archived under the\n\"original\" tag, in case there's historical interest, but as of April 16, 2012\nthe master branch of this repository contains code that builds with Visual\nStudio 2010 (which is presumably more useful to people). We originally\nanticipated that getting everything to work with a recent compiler would\nprove difficult, but it turned out to be fairly easy and required only small\nchanges to the code base, so there's little value in keeping the two branches\nseparate.\n\nAll of this is released either under a BSD license or put in the public\ndomain (stated per project). Not that you're likely to want to use most of\nthis code, but if you want to, we see no reason to keep you.\n\nSo what do we have in here? Here's the basic directory structure:\n\n```\n  altona_wz4/           - Altona and Werkkzeug4. Our most recent code foundation and tool.\n    altona/             - The framework libraries (includes base Werkkzeug4 GUI).\n    wz4/                - Wz4FRlib (demo ops) and Wz4Player.\n  altona2/              - successor of altona\n    altona2/            - The framework libraries (Werkkzeug5 is not yet released)\n  genthree/             - GenThree. Used for Candytron and nothing else.\n    data/               - Candytron data files.\n  kkrunchy/             - kkrunchy 0.23alpha code (latest we could find)\n  kkrunchy_k7/          - kkrunchy_k7 0.23a4/asm07 (most recent version)\n  ktg/                  - OpenKTG texture generator. See below.\n  lekktor/              - May summon Eldritch Abominations. Handle with care.\n  RG2/                  - RauschGenerator 2. Used for several 64k intros.\n    dopplerdefekt/      - data files for fr-029: dopplerdefekt\n    einschlag/          - data files for fr-022: ein.schlag\n    flybye/             - data files for fr-013: flybye\n    welcome_to/         - data files for fr-024: welcome to...\n  v2/                   - V2 synthesizer system. Used for all our intros, kkrieger and debris.\n  werkkzeug3/           - Werkkzeug3. Used for tons of demos and intros.\n    data/               - Source data for kkrieger and some test projects.\n      debris/           - Source data for fr-041: debris.\n      theta/            - Source data for fr-038: theta.\n    w3texlib/           - Werkkzeug 3 texture lib. Used for fr-033.\n    wz_mobile/          - Werkkzeug Mobile. Never got used for anything.\n  werkkzeug3_kkrieger/  - kkrieger branch. Game mode in here might work. :)\n```\n\nSo, here's the sightseeing tips:\n\n* \"ktg\" is OpenKTG, a proposal for a simple but relatively powerful and\n  orthogonal subset of texture generation functions - designed around 2007.\n  This is really nice, clean code. If you want to generate textures for WebGL\n  or something like that, turning this into pixel shaders+JS code should work\n  quite well. (There's no nice editor for it, though)\n* GenThree contains a bunch of text files in German with various ideas, from\n  the Candytron timeframe - mostly written by Chaos. Interesting bit of\n  history :)\n* werkkzeug3 is a mess, but come on, debris - you know you want to... :)\n* werkkzeug3_kkrieger is from a branch called \"kkrieger\" in our SVN repository.\n  It's not the actual kkrieger code, and incorporates changes that were done\n  more than one year after the original kkrieger release. It was, however,\n  branched off before we started not caring about breaking kkrieger\n  compatibility when making changes. You have a better chance of building the\n  game from there than you do from the \"regular\" werkkzeug3 tree - though both\n  are unlikely to work.\n  If someone really wants a close-to-original werkkzeug3 kkrieger tree, it should\n  be possible to dig up something from 2004 :)\n* altona_wz4 should actually be fully functional. It has been tested and there are\n  binaries which should function as fully-featured demomaker without the need to\n  touch any code. Also it's a good foundation to write your own engine or game\n  or tool or whatever. This stuff has seen heavy duty use in several companies and\n  went through several actual QA departments. It works.\n\nContributors (in alphabetical order):\n\n* Fabian \"ryg\" Giesen: GenThree, kkrunchy, kkrunchy_k7, ktg, lekktor, RG2,\n  werkkzeug3, werkkzeug3_kkrieger, altona, werkkzeug4\n* Sebastian \"Wayfinder\" Grillmaier: RG2, dopplerdefekt, ein.schlag, debris,\n  kkrieger\n* Tammo \"kb\" Hinrichs: V2, RG2, altona, werkkzeug4, flybye, \"welcome to\", easterparty\n* Thomas \"fiver2\" / \"theunitedstatesofamerica\" Mahlke: werkkzeug3, werkkzeug4,\n  debris, kkrieger.\n* Christoph \"giZMo\" Muetze: genthree, Candytron, RG2, flybye, \"welcome to\",\n  werkkzeug3, wz_mobile, debris, kkrieger.\n* Dierk \"Chaos\" Ohlerich: GenThree, lekktor, werkkzeug3, werkkzeug3_kkrieger,  \n  wz_mobile, altona, werkkzeug4\n* Kai \"cp\" Poethkow: dopplerdefekt, ein.schlag, theta.\n* Ronny Pries: debris.\n* Dennis \"Exoticorn\" Ranke: RG2, flybye, werkkzeug3_kkrieger.\n* Leonard \"paniq\" Ritter: V2, theta.\n* Bastian \"Tron\" Zuehlke: werkkzeug3, werkkzeug4\n\nBoth altona_wz5 and altona2 contain various of the stb_??? libraries from Sean\nBarret, nothings.org.\n\nHave fun!\n(released April 2012)\n(updated October 2014 for Altona2)\n"
