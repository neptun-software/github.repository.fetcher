          "content": "Contributing to GraphScope\n==========================\n\nGraphScope has been developed by an active team of software engineers and\nresearchers. Any contributions from the open-source community to improve this\nproject are welcome!\n\nGraphScope is licensed under [Apache License 2.0][1].\n\nNewcomers to GraphScope\n-----------------------\n\nFor newcomers to GraphScope, you could find instructions about how to build\nand run applications using GraphScope in [README][2].\n\nGraphScope is hosted on GitHub, and use GitHub issues as the bug tracker.\nyou can [file an issue][3] when you meets trouble when working with GraphScope.\n\nBefore creating a new bug entry, we recommend you first [search][4] among existing\nGraphScope bugs to see if it has already been resolved.\n\nWhen creating a new bug entry, please provide necessary information of your\nproblem in the description , such as operating system version, GraphScope\nversion, and other system configurations to help us diagnose the problem.\n\nWe also welcome any help on GraphScope from the community, including but not\nlimited to fixing bugs and adding new features. Note that you will be required to\nsign the [CLA][5] before submitting patches to us.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nGraphScope documentation is generated using Doxygen and sphinx. Users can build\nthe documentation in the build directory using:\n\n    make graphscope-docs\n\nThe HTML documentation will be available under `docs/_build/html`:\n\n    open docs/index.html\n\nThe latest version of online documentation can be found at [https://graphscope.io/docs][6].\n\nGraphScope provides comprehensive documents to explain the underlying\ndesign and implementation details. The documentation follows the syntax\nof Doxygen and sphinx markup. If you find anything you can help, submit \npull request to us. Thanks for your enthusiasm!\n\nBuild Python Wheels\n-------------------\n\nThe GraphScope python package is built using the [manylinux2010][7] environments.\nPlease refer to [./docs/developer_guide.rst][8] for more detail instructions. \n\nWorking Convention\n------------------\n\n### Code format\n\nGraphScope follows the [Google C++ Style Guide][9] for C++ code, and the [black][10] code\nstyle for Python code. When submitting patches to GraphScope, please format your code\nwith clang-format by the Makefile command `make graphscope_clformat`, and make sure\nyour code doesn't break the cpplint convention using the Makefile command `make graphscope_cpplint`.\n\n### Open a pull request\n\nWhen opening issues or submitting pull requests, we'll ask you to prefix the\npull request title with the issue number and the kind of patch (`BUGFIX` or `FEATURE`)\nin brackets, for example, `[BUGFIX-1234] Fix bug in SSSP on property graph`\nor `[FEATURE-2345] Support loading empty graphs`.\n\n### Git workflow for newcomers\n\nYou generally do NOT need to rebase your pull requests unless there are merge\nconflicts with the main. When GitHub complaining that \"Can’t automatically merge\"\non your pull request, you'll be asked to rebase your pull request on top of\nthe latest main branch, using the following commands:\n\n+ First rebasing to the most recent main:\n\n        git remote add upstream https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope.git\n        git fetch upstream\n        git rebase upstream/main\n\n+ Then git may show you some conflicts when it cannot merge, say `conflict.cpp`,\n  you need\n  - Manually modify the file to resolve the conflicts\n  - After resolved, mark it as resolved by\n\n        git add conflict.cpp\n\n+ Then you can continue rebasing by\n\n        git rebase --continue\n\n+ Finally push to your fork, then the pull request will be got updated:\n\n        git push --force\n\n[1]: https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/LICENSE\n[2]: https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/blob/main/README.md\n[3]: https://github.com/v6d-io/v6d/issues/new/new\n[4]: https://github.com/v6d-io/v6d/pulls\n[5]: https://cla-assistant.io/alibaba/GraphScope\n[6]: https://graphscope.io/docs\n[7]: https://github.com/pypa/manylinux\n[8]: ./docs/developer_guide.rst\n[9]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html\n[10]: https://github.com/psf/black\n"

Thus, the Jupyter\nsource code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or\ninstitution.  Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter\nDevelopment Team.  If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what\nchanges/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate\ntheir copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the\nchange to one of the Jupyter repositories.\n\nWith this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file\nto indicate the copyright and license terms:\n\n    # Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.\n    # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPackage Title: isort (5.10.1)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nwhich is available under license(s):\nMIT\n\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Timothy Edmund Crosley\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\nDEFINITIONS\n\"Font Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.\n\"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).\n\"Original Version\" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\n\"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.\n\"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\nPERMISSION & CONDITIONS\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:\n   1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\n   2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.\n   4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.\n   5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.\nTERMINATION\nThis license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.\nDISCLAIMER\nTHE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.\nSection 1 – Definitions.\n   a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n   b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n   c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.\n   d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.\n   e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n   f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.\n   g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n   h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.\n   i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.\n   j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n   k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\nSection 2 – Scope.\n   a. License grant.\n      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n         A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and\n         B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n      2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.\n      3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).\n      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted Material.\n      5. Downstream recipients.\n         A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n         B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed Material.\n      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n   b. Other rights.\n      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.\n      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.\n      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\nSection 3 – License Conditions.\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.\n   a. Attribution.\n      1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n         A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the Licensed Material:\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if designated);\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent reasonably practicable;\n         B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n         C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public License.\n      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes the required information.\n      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying with this Public License.\nSection 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;\n   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\nSection 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n   a. Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.\n   b. To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.\n   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\nSection 6 – Term and Termination.\n   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n   c. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.\n   d. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n   e. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\nSection 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\nSection 8 – Interpretation.\n   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.\n   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public licenses. Notwithstanding, Creative Commons may elect to apply one of its public licenses to material it publishes and in those instances will be considered the \"Licensor.\" Except for the limited purpose of indicating that material is shared under a Creative Commons public license or as otherwise permitted by the Creative Commons policies published at creativecommons.org/policies, Creative Commons does not authorize the use of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any other trademark or logo of Creative Commons without its prior written consent including, without limitation, in connection with any unauthorized modifications to any of its public licenses or any other arrangements, understandings, or agreements concerning use of licensed material.

These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n   1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n      i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n      iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n      v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n      vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n   2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n   4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n      d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.\n\n* GPL-1.0-or-later *\n\nCopyright (C) 2002 Cynthia Brewer, Mark Harrower, and The Pennsylvania\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; version 1 or any later version.\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.\nDEFINITIONS\n\"Font Software\" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may include source files, build scripts and documentation.\n\"Reserved Font Name\" refers to any names specified as such after the copyright statement(s).\n\"Original Version\" refers to the collection of Font Software components as distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).\n\"Modified Version\" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting, or substituting — in part or in whole — any of the components of the Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a new environment.\n\"Author\" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.\nPERMISSION & CONDITIONS\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the following conditions:\n   1) Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.\n   2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.\n   3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.\n   4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with their explicit written permission.\n   5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the Font Software.\nTERMINATION\nThis license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.\nDISCLAIMER\nTHE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR OTHER RIGHT.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

NSDI 2021录用。还有其它围绕 GraphScope 的十多项研究成果发表在领域顶级的学术会议或期刊上，如 TODS、SIGMOD、VLDB、KDD等。\r\n\r\n欢迎访问我们的网站 [graphscope.io](https://graphscope.io) 了解更多信息。\r\n\r\n## 快速开始\r\n\r\n我们提供了一个基于 JupyterLab 的 [Playground](https://try.graphscope.io)，您可以从浏览器中在线试用 GraphScope。\r\n\r\nGraphScope 支持本地运行，或在 [Kubernetes (k8s)](https://kubernetes.io/) 管理的集群上运行。为了快速上手，我们先从本地部署的方式开始。\r\n\r\n\r\n### 本地安装\r\n\r\n使用 `pip` 安装 GraphScope。\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install graphscope\r\n```\r\n\r\n注意 `graphscope` 的版本要求，需要 `Python` >= 3.7 及 `pip` >= 19.0.\r\n\r\nGraphScope 包在大多数流行的Linux发行版 (Ubuntu 20.04+ / Centos 7+) 与 macOS 12+ (Intel/Apple silicon) 上测试通过，对于 Windows 用户，需要在 WSL2 上安装 Ubuntu 来使用 GraphScope。\r\n\r\n接下来我们会用一个具体的例子，来演示 GraphScope 如何帮助数据科学家高效的分析、处理大规模图数据。\r\n\r\n## 示例: 论文引用网络中的节点分类任务\r\n\r\n[`ogbn-mag`](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-mag) 是由微软学术关系图（Microsoft Academic Graph）的子集组成的异构图网络。该图中包含4种类型的实体（即论文、作者、机构和研究领域），以及连接两个实体的四种类型的有向关系边。\r\n\r\n我们需要处理的任务是，给出异构的 `ogbn-mag` 数据，在该图上预测每篇论文的类别。这是一个节点分类任务，该任务可以归类在各个领域、各个方向或研究小组的论文，通过对论文属性和引用图上的结构信息对论文进行分类。在该数据中，每个论文节点包含了一个从论文标题、摘要抽取的 128 维 word2vec 向量作为表征，该表征是经过预训练提前获取的；而结构信息是在以下过程中即时计算的。\r\n\r\n\r\n### 载图\r\n\r\nGraphScope 以属性图（property graph）建模图数据。属性图中，点和边都有一个标签（label），不同的标签有不同的属性（property）。\r\n以 `ogbn-mag` 为例，下图展示了属性图的模型。\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://graphscope.io/docs/_images/sample_pg.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"sample-of-property-graph\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n该图具有四种顶点，分别标记为“论文”、“作者”、“机构”和“研究领域”。有四种连接它们的边，\r\n每种边都有一个标签，并且边的两端顶点的标签也是确定的。\r\n例如，“引用”这种标签的边连接两个“论文”顶点。另一个例子是标记为“撰写”的边，\r\n它要求该起始点的标记为“作者”，终止点的标记为“论文”。\r\n所有的顶点和边都可以具有属性。 例如，“论文”顶点具有诸如发布年份、主题标签等属性。\r\n\r\n执行如下命令载图，GraphScope 会自动下载数据：\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport graphscope\r\nfrom graphscope.dataset import load_ogbn_mag\r\n\r\ng = load_ogbn_mag()\r\n```\r\n\r\n我们提供了一组工具函数来载入 [ogb](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/dataset_overview/) 和 [snap](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) 中的数据集. 这里可以看到所有目前支持的数据集 [here](https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/tree/main/python/graphscope/dataset). 如果你想要使用自己的数据，请参考 [这篇文档](https://graphscope.io/docs/loading_graph.html).\r\n\r\n\r\n### 交互式查询\r\n\r\n交互式查询允许用户以“探索性”方式来探索、查看和显示图数据，以方便的定位和洞察特定的深入信息。GraphScope 采用称为 [Gremlin](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/) 的高级语言进行图遍历，并提供大规模的[高效执行](interactive_engine/benchmark/)。\r\n\r\n在此示例中，我们使用图遍历来查看两位给定作者共同撰写的论文数量。为了简化查询，我们假设作者可以分别由ID `2` 和 `4307` 唯一标识。\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# get the endpoint for submitting Gremlin queries on graph g.\r\ninteractive = graphscope.gremlin(g)\r\n\r\n# count the number of papers two authors (with id 2 and 4307) have co-authored\r\npapers = interactive.execute(\"g.V().has('author', 'id', 2).out('writes').where(__.in('writes').has('id', 4307)).count()\").one()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 图分析\r\n\r\n图分析是在真实场景中被广泛使用的一类图计算。事实证明，许多算法（例如社区检测，路径和连接性，集中性）在各种业务中都非常有效。GraphScope 内建了一组[预置常用算法](https://graphscope.io/docs/analytics_engine.html#built-in-algorithms)，方便用户可以轻松分析图数据。\r\n\r\n继续我们的示例，下面我们首先通过在特定周期内从全图中提取论文（使用Gremlin！）来导出一个子图，然后运行 k-core 分解和三角形计数以生成每个论文节点的结构特征。\r\n\r\n请注意，许多算法可能仅适用于 **同构图**（只有一类点和一类边而不区分标签），因此，要在属性图上使用这些算法，我们首先需要将其投影到一个简单的同构图中。\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# extract a subgraph of publication within a time range\r\nsub_graph = interactive.subgraph(\"g.V().has('year', gte(2014).and(lte(2020))).outE('cites')\")\r\n\r\n# project the projected graph to simple graph.\r\nsimple_g = sub_graph.project(vertices={\"paper\": []}, edges={\"cites\": []})\r\n\r\nret1 = graphscope.k_core(simple_g, k=5)\r\nret2 = graphscope.triangles(simple_g)\r\n\r\n# add the results as new columns to the citation graph\r\nsub_graph = sub_graph.add_column(ret1, {\"kcore\": \"r\"})\r\nsub_graph = sub_graph.add_column(ret2, {\"tc\": \"r\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\n此外，用户还可以在 GraphScope 中编写自己的算法。当前，GraphScope 支持用户以 Pregel 模型和 PIE 模型自定义图算法。\r\n\r\n### 图神经网络 (GNNs)\r\n\r\n图神经网络（GNN）结合了图结构和机器学习的优势，可以将图中的结构信息和属性信息压缩为每个节点上的低维嵌入向量。这些嵌入和表征可以进一步输入到下游的机器学习任务中。\r\n\r\n在我们的示例中，我们训练了 GCN 模型，将节点（论文）分类为349个类别，每个类别代表一个出处（例如预印本和会议）。为此，首先我们接着上一步，启动学习引擎并构建一个具有特征的数据图。\r\n\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# define the features for learning\r\npaper_features = [f\"feat_{i}\" for i in range(128)]\r\n\r\npaper_features.append(\"kcore\")\r\npaper_features.append(\"tc\")\r\n\r\n# launch a learning engine.\r\nlg = graphscope.graphlearn(sub_graph, nodes=[(\"paper\", paper_features)],\r\n                  edges=[(\"paper\", \"cites\", \"paper\")],\r\n                  gen_labels=[\r\n                      (\"train\", \"paper\", 100, (0, 75)),\r\n                      (\"val\", \"paper\", 100, (75, 85)),\r\n                      (\"test\", \"paper\", 100, (85, 100))\r\n                  ])\r\n```\r\n\r\n然后我们定义一个训练过程并执行。\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Note: Here we use

集群上处理大规模图\r\n\r\nGraphScope 是为处理超大图设计，而单机的内存通常不能够容纳超大图的数据。通过 [Vineyard](https://github.com/v6d-io/v6d) 提供的分布式内存数据管理服务，GraphScope 支持在 Kubernetes 集群上运行。\r\n\r\n为了继续本篇教程，请确保你拥有一个 k8s 集群与相应的安全证书 （比如，k8s API 服务器的地址，一般存储在 `~/.kube/config` 文件中）\r\n\r\n另外，你也可以使用 [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) 部署一个本地的 k8s 集群，Kind 的安装和部署可以参考官网的 [Quick Start](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/)。\r\n\r\n如果你没有安装 `graphscope` 包，这里可以只安装客户端的包。\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install graphscope-client\r\n```\r\n\r\n接下来，我们在集群的环境下，回顾这个例子。\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://graphscope.io/docs/_images/how-it-works.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"how-it-works\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n上图表示了用户通过 Python 客户端调用 GraphScope 解决该问题的工作流程。\r\n\r\n- *步骤 1*. 建立一个会话（session），为 GraphScope 创建一个工作空间；\r\n- *步骤 2 - 步骤 5*. 载图，查询，分析与执行基于图数据的机器学习任务；这些任务与本机安装的方式相同，因此用户在分布式集群上处理大规模图数据的体验与在单机处理小规模图的体验基本一致。(其中 `graphscope.gremlin` 与 `graphscope.graphlearn` 要分别改为 `sess.gremlin` 与 `sess.graphlearn`，`sess` 为用户创建的 `Session` 的名字)\r\n- *步骤 6*. 关闭会话。\r\n\r\n### 创建会话\r\n\r\n使用 GraphScope 的第一步，我们需要在 Python 中创建一个会话（session）。\r\n\r\n为了方便起见，我们提供了若干示例数据集，可通过设置参数 `with_dataset` 来挂载这些数据集到集群上，挂载路径是 Pod 中 `/dataset`。如果你想使用自己的数据集，请参考 [这篇文档](docs/zh/deployment.rst)\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport graphscope\r\n\r\nsess = graphscope.session(with_dataset=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\n对于 macOS，创建会话需要使用 LoadBalancer 服务类型（默认是 NodePort）。\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsess = graphscope.session(with_dataset=True, k8s_service_type=\"LoadBalancer\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n会话的建立过程中，首选会在背后尝试拉起一个 `coordinator` 作为后端引擎的入口。\r\n该 `coordinator` 负责管理该次会话的所有资源（k8s pods），以及交互式查询、图分析、图学习引擎的生命周期。\r\n在 `coordinator` 后续拉起的其他每个 pod 中，都有一个 vineyard 实例作为内存管理层，分布式的管理图数据。\r\n\r\n### 载图与执行计算任务\r\n\r\n与本地安装的模式类似，我们可以使用工具函数来方便的载入图。\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom graphscope.dataset import load_ogbn_mag\r\n\r\n# 我们在上面的步骤中将数据集挂载到了 /dataset 目录，其中\r\n# 有若干数据集，包括 ogbn_mag_small。\r\n# 用户可以登录到container中并查看 /dataset 目录\r\ng = load_ogbn_mag(sess, \"/dataset/ogbn_mag_small\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n请注意，这里的 `g` 已经是一个分布式存储在 vineyard 中的图。图数据分布在这个会话背后拉起的 k8s pods中。\r\n\r\n接下来，我们可以和单机模式中一样，执行 Gremlin 查询，各种各样的图算法，或者运行图神经网络任务。\r\n\r\n我们不在这里重复代码，用户可以在[node_classification_on_citation.ipynb](tutorials/zh/10_node_classification_on_citation.ipynb) 了解详细的步骤和代码。\r\n\r\n### 关闭会话\r\n\r\n最后，当我们完成所有的计算过程后，关闭当前的会话。该步骤会告知背后的 `Coordinator` 和引擎，释放当前所有的资源。\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsess.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\n请注意当前发布的版本没有包含一些例如鉴权、加密之类的安全功能，暂时不推荐在生产环境使用。我们后续会有一些安全性更新，请您持续关注。\r\n\r\n## 开发\r\n\r\n### 在本地构建\r\n\r\n为了构建 graphscope Python 包以及引擎，你需要安装一些依赖和构建工具。\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 gsctl.py install-deps dev\r\n\r\n# 如果在中国，加入参数 `--cn` 来加速下载\r\npython3 gsctl.py install-deps dev --cn\r\n```\r\n\r\n现在你可以使用 `make` 来构建 GraphScope\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 编译所有组件，包括 Python 包和引擎可执行文件\r\nsudo make install\r\n\r\n# 或者只编译指定的引擎\r\n# make interactive\r\n# make analytical\r\n# make learning\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 构建 Docker 镜像\r\n\r\nGraphScope 包含一个 [Dockerfile](k8s/graphscope.Dockerfile)，可以构建 Docker 映像。 这些映像会在单独的构建镜像上构建，完成后再复制生成的二进制文件到运行时基础镜像，进行分发。构建镜像和运行时基础镜像都预装了所有所需的第三方依赖和环境。要构建最新的 GraphScope 镜像，在 `k8s/internal` 目录运行此命令。\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# 默认情况下，产出的镜像 tag 为 graphscope/graphscope:SHORTSHA\r\n# cd k8s\r\nmake graphscope\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 构建客户端 Python 包\r\n\r\nGraphScope Python 包与 GraphScope docker 镜像是独立构建的。\r\n如果您正在开发 Python 客户端且未修改 protobuf 文件，则 GraphScope docker 镜像不需要重新构建。您只需要在本地重新安装 Python 客户端。\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake client\r\n```\r\n\r\n请注意，图学习引擎的客户端具有 C/C++ 扩展模块，并需要额外的构建环境。\r\n默认情况下，本地构建的客户端库不包含对图学习引擎的支持。如果需要构建包含图学习引擎的 Python 包，请参阅 [构建 Python Wheels](https://graphscope.io/docs/developer_guide.html#build-python-wheels).\r\n\r\n### 测试\r\n\r\n为了验证您所开发功能的正确性，您所做的代码更改应通过我们的测试。通过以下脚本执行测试流程。\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake test\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 文档\r\n\r\nGraphScope 的文档构建依赖 Sphinx。您可以自己通过以下命令构建一份完整的文档。\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# build the docs\r\nmake graphscope-docs\r\n\r\n# to open preview on local\r\nopen docs/_build/html/index.html\r\n```\r\n或者最新版的文档也可以查阅这里 https://graphscope.io/docs\r\n\r\n\r\n## 许可协议\r\n\r\nGraphScope 遵循 [Apache

[Try GraphScope](https://try.graphscope.io) straight away in your browser!\r\n\r\nGraphScope supports running in standalone mode or on clusters managed by [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) within containers. For quickly getting started,\r\nlet's begin with the standalone mode.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Installation for Standalone Mode\r\n\r\nGraphScope pre-compiled package is distributed as a python package and can be easily installed with `pip`.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npip3 install graphscope\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `graphscope` requires `Python` >= `3.8` and `pip` >= `19.3`. The package is built for and tested on the most popular Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ / CentOS 7+) and macOS 12+ (Intel/Apple silicon) distributions. For Windows users, you may want to install Ubuntu on WSL2 to use this package.\r\n\r\nNext, we will walk you through a concrete example to illustrate how GraphScope can be used by data scientists to effectively analyze large graphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Demo: Node Classification on Citation Network\r\n\r\n[`ogbn-mag`](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-mag) is a heterogeneous network composed of a subset of the Microsoft Academic Graph. It contains 4 types of entities(i.e., papers, authors, institutions, and fields of study), as well as four types of directed relations connecting two entities.\r\n\r\nGiven the heterogeneous `ogbn-mag` data, the task is to predict the class of each paper. Node classification can identify papers in multiple venues, which represent different groups of scientific work on different topics. We apply both the attribute and structural information to classify papers. In the graph, each paper node contains a 128-dimensional word2vec vector representing its content, which is obtained by averaging the embeddings of words in its title and abstract. The embeddings of individual words are pre-trained. The structural information is computed on-the-fly.\r\n\r\n### Loading a graph\r\n\r\nGraphScope models graph data as property graph, in which the edges/vertices are labeled and have many properties.\r\nTaking `ogbn-mag` as example, the figure below shows the model of the property graph.\r\n\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n    <img src=\"https://graphscope.io/docs/_images/sample_pg.png\" width=\"600\" alt=\"sample-of-property-graph\" />\r\n</div>\r\n\r\nThis graph has four kinds of vertices, labeled as `paper`, `author`, `institution` and `field_of_study`. There are four kinds of edges connecting them, each kind of edges has a label and specifies the vertex labels for its two ends. For example, `cites` edges connect two vertices labeled `paper`. Another example is `writes`, it requires the source vertex is labeled `author` and the destination is a `paper` vertex. All the vertices and edges may have properties. e.g., `paper`  vertices have properties like features, publish year, subject label, etc.\r\n\r\nTo load this graph to GraphScope with our retrieval module, please use these code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport graphscope\r\nfrom graphscope.dataset import load_ogbn_mag\r\n\r\ng = load_ogbn_mag()\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe provide a set of functions to load graph datasets from [ogb](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/dataset_overview/) and [snap](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html) for convenience. Please find all the available graphs [here](https://github.com/alibaba/GraphScope/tree/docs/python/graphscope/dataset). If you want to use your own graph data, please refer [this doc](https://graphscope.io/docs/loading_graph.html) to load vertices and edges by labels.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Interactive query\r\n\r\nInteractive queries allow users to directly explore, examine, and present graph data in an *exploratory* manner in order to locate specific or in-depth information in time.\r\nGraphScope adopts a high-level language called [Gremlin](http://tinkerpop.apache.org/) for graph traversal, and provides [efficient execution](interactive_engine/benchmark/) at scale.\r\n\r\nIn this example, we use graph traversal to count the number of papers two given authors have co-authored. To simplify the query, we assume the authors can be uniquely identified by ID `2` and `4307`, respectively.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# get the endpoint for submitting Gremlin queries on graph g.\r\ninteractive = graphscope.gremlin(g)\r\n\r\n# count the number of papers two authors (with id 2 and 4307) have co-authored\r\npapers = interactive.execute(\"g.V().has('author', 'id', 2).out('writes').where(__.in('writes').has('id', 4307)).count()\").one()\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Graph analytics\r\n\r\nGraph analytics is widely used in real world. Many algorithms, like community detection, paths and connectivity, centrality are proven to be very useful in various businesses.\r\nGraphScope ships with a set of [built-in algorithms](https://graphscope.io/docs/analytics_engine.html#built-in-algorithms), enables users easily analysis their graph data.\r\n\r\nContinuing our example, below we first derive a subgraph by extracting publications in specific time out of the entire graph (using Gremlin!), and then run k-core decomposition and triangle counting to generate the structural features of each paper node.\r\n\r\nPlease note that many algorithms may only work on *homogeneous* graphs, and therefore, to evaluate these algorithms over a property graph, we need to project it into a simple graph at first.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# extract a subgraph of publication within a time range\r\nsub_graph = interactive.subgraph(\"g.V().has('year', gte(2014).and(lte(2020))).outE('cites')\")\r\n\r\n# project the projected graph to simple graph.\r\nsimple_g = sub_graph.project(vertices={\"paper\": []}, edges={\"cites\": []})\r\n\r\nret1 = graphscope.k_core(simple_g, k=5)\r\nret2 = graphscope.triangles(simple_g)\r\n\r\n# add the results as new columns to the citation graph\r\nsub_graph = sub_graph.add_column(ret1, {\"kcore\": \"r\"})\r\nsub_graph = sub_graph.add_column(ret2, {\"tc\": \"r\"})\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, users can write their own algorithms in GraphScope.\r\nCurrently, GraphScope supports users to write their own algorithms\r\nin Pregel model and PIE model.\r\n\r\n### Graph neural networks (GNNs)\r\n\r\nGraph neural networks (GNNs) combines superiority of both graph analytics and machine learning. GNN algorithms can compress both structural and attribute information in a graph into low-dimensional embedding vectors on each node. These embeddings can be further fed into downstream machine learning tasks.\r\n\r\nIn our example, we train a GCN model to classify the nodes (papers) into 349 categories,\r\neach of which represents a venue (e.g. pre-print and conference).\r\nTo achieve this, first we launch a learning engine and build a graph with features\r\nfollowing the last step.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n\r\n# define the features for learning\r\npaper_features = [f\"feat_{i}\" for i in range(128)]\r\n\r\npaper_features.extend([\"kcore\", \"tc\"])\r\n\r\n# launch a learning engine.\r\nlg = graphscope.graphlearn(sub_graph, nodes=[(\"paper\", paper_features)],\r\n                  edges=[(\"paper\", \"cites\", \"paper\")],\r\n                  gen_labels=[\r\n                      (\"train\", \"paper\", 100, (0, 75)),\r\n                      (\"val\", \"paper\", 100, (75, 85)),\r\n                      (\"test\", \"paper\", 100, (85, 100))\r\n                  ])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we define the training process, and run it.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# Note: Here we use tensorflow as NN backend to train GNN model. so please\r\n# install tensorflow.\r\ntry:\r\n    # https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/migrate\r\n    import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf\r\n    tf.disable_v2_behavior()\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    import tensorflow as tf\r\n\r\nimport graphscope.learning\r\nfrom graphscope.learning.examples import EgoGraphSAGE\r\nfrom graphscope.learning.examples import EgoSAGESupervisedDataLoader\r\nfrom graphscope.learning.examples.tf.trainer import LocalTrainer\r\n\r\n# supervised GCN.\r\ndef train_gcn(graph, node_type, edge_type, class_num, features_num,\r\n              hops_num=2, nbrs_num=[25, 10], epochs=2,\r\n              hidden_dim=256, in_drop_rate=0.5, learning_rate=0.01,\r\n):\r\n    graphscope.learning.reset_default_tf_graph()\r\n\r\n    dimensions = [features_num] + [hidden_dim] * (hops_num -

When users run code in the python client, it will:\r\n\r\n- *Step 1*. Create a session or workspace in GraphScope.\r\n- *Step 2 - Step 5*. Load a graph, query, analysis and run learning task on this graph via Python interface. These steps are the same to local mode, thus users process huge graphs in a distributed setting just like analysis a small graph on a single machine.(Note that `graphscope.gremlin` and `graphscope.graphlearn` need to be changed to `sess.gremlin` and `sess.graphlearn`, respectively. `sess` is the name of the `Session` instance user created.)\r\n- *Step 6*. Close the session.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating a session\r\n\r\nTo use GraphScope in a distributed setting, we need to establish a session in a python interpreter.\r\n\r\nFor convenience, we provide several demo datasets, and an option `with_dataset` to mount the dataset in the graphscope cluster. The datasets will be mounted to `/dataset` in the pods. If you want to use your own data on k8s cluster, please refer to [this](docs/deployment.rst).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport graphscope\r\n\r\nsess = graphscope.session(with_dataset=True)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor macOS, the session needs to establish with the LoadBalancer service type (which is NodePort by default).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport graphscope\r\n\r\nsess = graphscope.session(with_dataset=True, k8s_service_type=\"LoadBalancer\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nA session tries to launch a `coordinator`, which is the entry for the back-end engines. The coordinator manages a cluster of resources (k8s pods), and the interactive/analytical/learning engines ran on them. For each pod in the cluster, there is a vineyard instance at service for distributed data in memory.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Loading a graph and processing computation tasks\r\n\r\nSimilar to the standalone mode, we can still use the functions to load a graph easily.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom graphscope.dataset import load_ogbn_mag\r\n\r\n# Note we have mounted the demo datasets to /dataset,\r\n# There are several datasets including ogbn_mag_small,\r\n# User can attach to the engine container and explore the directory.\r\ng = load_ogbn_mag(sess, \"/dataset/ogbn_mag_small/\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, the `g` is loaded in parallel via vineyard and stored in vineyard instances in the cluster managed by the session.\r\n\r\nNext, we can conduct graph queries with Gremlin, invoke various graph algorithms, or run graph-based neural network tasks like we did in the standalone mode.\r\nWe do not repeat code here, but a `.ipynb` processing the classification task on k8s is available on the [Playground](https://try.graphscope.io/).\r\n\r\n### Closing the session\r\n\r\nAnother additional step in the distribution is session close. We close the session after processing all graph tasks.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nsess.close()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis operation will notify the backend engines and vineyard\r\nto safely unload graphs and their applications,\r\nThen, the coordinator will release all the applied resources in the k8s cluster.\r\n\r\nPlease note that we have not hardened this release for production use and it lacks important security features such as authentication and encryption, and therefore **it is NOT recommended for production use (yet)!**\r\n\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n### Building on local\r\n\r\nTo build graphscope Python package and the engine binaries, you need to install some dependencies and build tools.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython3 gsctl.py install-deps dev\r\n\r\n# With argument --cn to speed up the download if you are in China.\r\npython3 gsctl.py install-deps dev --cn\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you can build GraphScope with pre-configured `make` commands.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# to make graphscope whole package, including python package + engine binaries.\r\nsudo make install\r\n\r\n# or make the engine components\r\n# make interactive\r\n# make analytical\r\n# make learning\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building Docker images\r\n\r\nGraphScope ships with a [Dockerfile](k8s/dockerfiles/graphscope-dev.Dockerfile) that can build docker images for releasing. The images are built on a `builder` image with all dependencies installed and copied to\r\na `runtime-base` image. To build images with latest version of GraphScope, go to the `k8s/internal` directory under root directory and run this command.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# by default, the built image is tagged as graphscope/graphscope:SHORTSHA\r\n# cd k8s\r\nmake graphscope\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Building client library\r\n\r\nGraphScope python interface is separate with the engines image.\r\nIf you are developing python client and not modifying the protobuf files, the engines\r\nimage doesn't require to be rebuilt.\r\n\r\nYou may want to re-install the python client on local.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake client\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the learning engine client has C/C++ extensions modules and setting up the build\r\nenvironment is a bit tedious. By default the locally-built client library doesn't include\r\nthe support for learning engine. If you want to build client library with learning engine\r\nenabled, please refer [Build Python Wheels](https://graphscope.io/docs/developer_guide.html#build-python-wheels).\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nTo verify the correctness of your developed features, your code changes should pass our tests.\r\n\r\nYou may run the whole test suite with commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake test\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nDocumentation can be generated using Sphinx. Users can build the documentation using:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n# build the docs\r\nmake graphscope-docs\r\n\r\n# to open preview on local\r\nopen docs/_build/latest/html/index.html\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe latest version of online documentation can be found at https://graphscope.io/docs\r\n\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGraphScope is released under [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
