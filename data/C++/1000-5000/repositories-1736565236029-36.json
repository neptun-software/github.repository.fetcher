This was just a hack to trigger it using rqt_reconfigure.\n- Removed area_recorder and corresponding configs\n- Added SensorFusion with imu_filter_madgwick, you need to set your mag biases in the global settings file now\n\n##### Features\n\n- Added UI Board integration to LowLevel Firmware\n- Added service to start and pause mowing as well as start area recording mode\n- Added area recording behavior to main logic, so that we don't need an additional launch file for it\n- Added a mower_logic/current_state topic which has the identifier of the current high level state.\n- mower_comms now listens for UI button messages and calls the high level control service accordingly.\n- Added support for LAT/LNG coordinates instead of relative coordinates. Set **OM_USE_RELATIVE_POSITION** to **false** for this and provide an origin for your local coordinate space using **OM_DATUM_LAT** and **OM_DATUM_LONG** in your local config file.\n- Added the mag_calibration node to help magnetometer calibration without manually recording and copying files.\n\n##### Small Fixes\n\n- Changed planner logic, so that it starts with innermost outlines\n\n- We can now configure arbitrarily many outlines\n- Motor temperatures can be configured\n- Added safety offset parameter to the outline (i.e. shrink area without rerecording the areas)\n- Added vesc_msgs to mower_msgs to resolve a dependency issue\n\n\n\n"

For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.

The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c.

No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties, including when\n          the Licensed Material is used other than for NonCommercial\n          purposes.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-NC-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database for NonCommercial purposes\n     only;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Basically all of these bots drive in a random direction until they hit the border of the lawn, rotate for a randomized duration and repeat. **I think we can do better!**\n\n\nTherefore, we have disassembled the cheapest off-the-shelf robotic mower  we could find (YardForce Classic 500) and were surprised that the hardware itself is actually quite decent:\n- Geared sensored brushless motors for the wheels\n- A sensored brushless motor for the mower motor itself\n- The whole construction seems robust, waterproof and all in all thought through\n- All components are connected using standard connectors, therefore upgrading the hardware is easily possible.\n\nThe bottom line is: The bot itself is surprisingly high quality and doesn't need to be changed at all. **We just need some better software in there**.\n\n\n\n## Project Goals\n\nHere is a quick overview of this project's goals:\n\n:heavy_check_mark: **Autonomous Lawn Mowing:** Obviously, the device should be able to mow the lawn automatically.\n\n:heavy_check_mark: **Good Safety:** The device must be safe, e.g. emergency stop if lifted or crashed.\n\n:heavy_check_mark: **No Perimeter Wire Needed:** We want to be flexible and support multiple mowing areas.\n\n:heavy_check_mark: **Low Cost:** It should be cheaper than a mid range off-the-shelf product\n\n:heavy_check_mark: **Open:** I want to share knowledge and enable others to build an OpenMower as well.\n\n:heavy_check_mark: **Nice to Look At:** You should not be ashamed to have an OpenMower mowing your lawn.\n\n:heavy_check_mark: **Avoid Obstacles:** The mower should detect obstacles and avoid them during mowing.\n\n:heavy_check_mark: **Rain Detection:** The device should be able to detect bad weather conditions and pause mowing until they improve.\n\n\n\n# Open Mower App\n\n![Open Mower App 1](./img/open_mower_app_1.jpg)\n\n![Open Mower App 2](./img/open_mower_app_2.jpg)\n\n\n\n## Current State\n\nThe basic mowing function finally works! As you can see in the video, map teaching and mowing work as expected. It even returns to the docking station automatically as soon as the battery gets low and continues once it's recharged.\n\nAt this point I can recommend that brave tech savvy users can build one for themselves! Since it's quite an expensive and complex project, please don't be shy and ask if you have any questions. I'm glad to help 🙂\n\n\n\n### Hardware\n\nBy now we have a stable revision of the mainboard as well as two motor controllers to go with it. The [xESC mini](https://github.com/clemensElflein/xesc) and the [xESC 2040](https://github.com/clemensElflein/xesc2040). I'm currently using the xESC mini for my builds and it works very well. The problem with this controller is, its parts are currently hard to source. That's why we created the xESC 2040 based on the RP2040 chip. This is the low-cost variant and its support is currently experimental.\n\n#### Hardware To-Do:\n\n- [x] Low Level Firmware Implementation\n  - [x] Voltage / Current Sense\n  - [x] Emergency Stop Button tracking\n  - [x] IMU Communication\n  - [x] Rain Sensor\n  - [x] Charging State\n  - [x] Sound Module\n  - [x] UI Board Communication\n  - [ ] Discharge current for more accurate battery charge estimation\n- [X] ROS Hardware Interface\n\n\n\n### Software\n\nThe basic software is basically done; Our prototype works as intended (but is not able to avoid obstacles yet).\n\nThe software for the robot can be found in a separate repository: https://github.com/ClemensElflein/open_mower_ros\n\n#### Software To-Do:\n\n- [x] Mowing State Machine (Docking / Mowing, ...)\n- [x] Path Planning\n- [ ] Obstacle Avoidance\n- [x] App / Visualization\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nIf you want to read how to get started building a robot for yourself, check the [OpenMower Website](https://openmower.de). There you can find information on which parts to buy, how to install the software and so on. If you find anything missing, please join the Discord server and ask there. Also there's the [OpenMower Wiki](https://wiki.openmower.de) which is written by the community. It has some additional guides and information.\n\n\n\n# How You Can Help\n\nYou can help by starting an OpenMower build of your own. This helps to validate the concept and helps to create useful documentation for new users.\n\nAdditionally, you can help by starring 🌟 and watching 👀 this repository, since it will help with visibility. You can also subscribe to my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/ClemensElflein).\n\n\n\n## Compatible Robotic Mowers\n\nWhile disassembling the bot, I wondered about its mainboard: Instead of \"YardForce\" it read \"GForce\". After checking the internet for \"GForce\" robots, I found that that very similar looking robotic mowers are sold under the Herkules brand. Naturally I tried to dig deeper and actually found evidence that the mainboard is manufactured by some chinese company (SUMEC Hardware).\n\n\n\n![GForce Robot Mower Mainboard](./img/mainboard.jpg)\n\n\n\nIt is therefore quite safe to assume that many robot mowers are basically the same device in a different case. This would be a huge win for the community, since this would mean that by making one of those robots smarter, we could upgrade lots of robots.\n\nTherefore it might be a good idea to start a list of compatible devices. So if you have a cheap robotic lawn mower, you can check, if it was already disassembled in the list below. If it's not there, it would be nice of you to check, if it contains the same mainboard as ours and add your robot to the list with some some pictures / model numbers.\n\n\n\n### List of Compatible Mowers\n\nBy now, some guys have disassembled their mowers and it doesn't look as good as I initially hoped. The GForce boards are basically just used by YardForce and some rebranded versions for the EU market. My exact hardware was only found in the mower I'm using (YardForce Classic 500) and in recently manufactured SA650 ECOs. The SA650 has a different chassis and we don't have a way of mounting the GPS antenna yet. Therefore at the moment, the only compatible mower is mine (the YardForce Classic 500). \n\nIf you want to have a look at the disassembled mowers, check the Google Docs [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BX0-KEs5v-VED8-RA4BLE-wRdXHtlmcKy4n9K5vJVAA)\n\n\n\n# More Infos\n\nThis page only contains the basic overview of the project.
