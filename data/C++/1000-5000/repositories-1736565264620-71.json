There are\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\nNOTE: If you are new to GitHub, please start by reading [Pull Request\nhowto](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;\nthis simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as\npart of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see\nyour current agreements on file or to sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n## Guidelines for Pull Requests\n\n*  All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review.\n   We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult\n   [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more\n   information on using pull requests.\n\n*  If you are a Googler, it is preferable to first create an internal CL and\n   have it reviewed and submitted. The code propagation process will deliver\n   the change to GitHub.\n\n*  Create **small PRs** that are narrowly focused on **addressing a single concern**.\n   When PRs try to fix several things at a time, if only one fix is considered\n   acceptable, nothing gets merged and both author's & review's time is wasted.\n   Create more PRs to address different concerns and everyone will be happy.\n\n*  Provide a good **PR description** as a record of **what** change is being\n   made and **why** it was made. Link to a GitHub issue if it exists.\n\n*  Don't fix code style and formatting unless you are already changing that line\n   to address an issue. Formatting of modified lines may be done using\n   `git clang-format`. PRs with irrelevant changes won't be merged. If you do\n   want to fix formatting or style, do that in a separate PR.\n\n*  Unless your PR is trivial, you should expect there will be reviewer comments\n   that you'll need to address before merging. We expect you to be reasonably\n   responsive to those comments, otherwise the PR will be closed after 2-3 weeks\n   of inactivity.\n\n*  Maintain **clean commit history** and use **meaningful commit messages**.\n   PRs with messy commit history are difficult to review and won't be merged.\n   Use `rebase -i upstream/master` to curate your commit history and/or to\n   bring in latest changes from master (but avoid rebasing in the middle of a\n   code review).\n\n*  Keep your PR up to date with upstream/master (if there are merge conflicts,\n   we can't really merge your change).\n\n*  **All tests need to be passing** before your change can be merged. We\n   recommend you **run tests locally** (see below)\n\n*  Exceptions to the rules can be made if there's a compelling reason for doing\n   so. That is - the rules are here to serve us, not the other way around, and\n   the rules need to be serving their intended purpose to be valuable.\n\n## TCMalloc Committers\n\nThe current members of the TCMalloc engineering team are the only committers at\npresent.\n\n## Community Guidelines\n\nThis project follows\n[Google's Open Source Community Guidelines](https://opensource.google.com/conduct/).\n"

This also covers important operating system-level properties for\n    improving TCMalloc performance.\n*   The [TCMalloc Design Doc](docs/design.md) covers how TCMalloc works\n    underneath the hood, and why certain design choices were made. Most\n    developers will not need this level of implementation detail.\n*   The [TCMalloc Compatibility Guide](docs/compatibility.md) which documents\n    our expectations for how our APIs are used.\n\n## License\n\nThe TCMalloc library is licensed under the terms of the Apache license.
