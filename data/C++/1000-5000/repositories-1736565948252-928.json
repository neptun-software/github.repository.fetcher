The Free Translation Project is a\nway to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all\ntogether, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many\nlanguages.  A few packages already provide translations for their\nmessages.\n\n   If you found this 'ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may\nassume that the distributed package does use GNU 'gettext' internally,\nitself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_\nneed to install GNU 'gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using\nthis package with messages translated.\n\n   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also\nexplain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the\navailable translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and\nwork on translations can contact the appropriate team.\n\n1.1 INSTALL Matters\n===================\n\nSome packages are \"localizable\" when properly installed; the programs\nthey contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such\npackages use GNU 'gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to\ninternationalization, predating GNU 'gettext'.\n\n   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of\nmessages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already\nprovides the GNU 'gettext' functions.  Installers may use special\noptions at configuration time for changing the default behaviour.  The\ncommand:\n\n     ./configure --disable-nls\n\nwill _totally_ disable translation of messages.\n\n   When you already have GNU 'gettext' installed on your system and run\nconfigure without an option for your new package, 'configure' will\nprobably detect the previously built and installed 'libintl' library and\nwill decide to use it.  If not, you may have to to use the\n'--with-libintl-prefix' option to tell 'configure' where to look for it.\n\n   Internationalized packages usually have many 'po/LL.po' files, where\nLL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless\ntranslations have been forbidden at 'configure' time by using the\n'--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed\ntogether with the package.  However, the environment variable 'LINGUAS'\nmay be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.\n'LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter\ncodes, stating which languages are allowed.\n\n1.2 Using This Package\n======================\n\nAs a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you\nonly have to set the 'LANG' environment variable to the appropriate\n'LL_CC' combination.  If you happen to have the 'LC_ALL' or some other\n'LC_xxx' environment variables set, you should unset them before setting\n'LANG', otherwise the setting of 'LANG' will not have the desired\neffect.  Here 'LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code, and 'CC' is\nan ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's suppose that\nyou speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell prompt, merely\nexecute 'setenv LANG de_DE' (in 'csh'), 'export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in\n'sh') or 'export LANG=de_DE' (in 'bash').  This can be done from your\n'.login' or '.profile' file, once and for all.\n\n   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.\nBut in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For\nexample, 'de_AT' is used for Austria, and 'pt_BR' for Brazil.  The\ncountry code serves to distinguish the dialects.\n\n   The locale naming convention of 'LL_CC', with 'LL' denoting the\nlanguage and 'CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based\non GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are used,\nsuch as 'LL' or 'LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of locales\nsupported by your system for your language by running the command\n'locale -a | grep '^LL''.\n\n   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an\nEnglish message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you\nunderstand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.\nThis is done through a different environment variable, called\n'LANGUAGE'.  GNU 'gettext' gives preference to 'LANGUAGE' over 'LANG'\nfor the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have 'LANG'\nset to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the\nsystem libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather read\ntranslations in German than English for when Swedish is not available,\nset 'LANGUAGE' to 'sv:de' while leaving 'LANG' to 'sv_SE'.\n\n   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian\nbokma*l changed from 'no' to 'nb' recently (in 2003).  During the\ntransition period, while some message catalogs for this language are\ninstalled under 'nb' and some older ones under 'no', it's recommended\nfor Norwegian users to set 'LANGUAGE' to 'nb:no' so that both newer and\nolder translations are used.\n\n   In the 'LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the 'LANG'\nenvironment variable, 'LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as 'LL' to\ndenote the language's main dialect.  For example, 'de' is equivalent to\n'de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and 'pt' to 'pt_PT' (Portuguese\nas spoken in Portugal) in this context.\n\n1.3 Translating Teams\n=====================\n\nFor the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested\npeople who like their own language and write it well, and who are also\nable to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.\nEach translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of\nteams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,\n'http://translationproject.org/', in the \"Teams\" area.\n\n   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you\nshould become a member of the translating team for your own language.\nThe subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has\n'-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a\nmessage to 'sv-request@li.org', having this message body:\n\n     subscribe\n\n   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate _actively_\nin translations, or at solving translational difficulties, rather than\nmerely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and you want to\nstart one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to get started,\nplease write to 'coordinator@translationproject.org' to reach the\ncoordinator for all translator teams.\n\n   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing\nthe terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skills are praised more than\nprogramming skills, here.\n\n1.4 Available Packages\n======================\n\nLanguages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following\nmatrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of Jun 2014.\nThe matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages PO\nfiles have been submitted to translation coordination, with a\ntranslation percentage of at least 50%.\n\n     Ready PO files       af am an ar as ast az be bg bn bn_IN bs ca crh cs\n

Of course you have to respect the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense which covers the use of the GNU 'gettext' library.  This means\nin particular that even non-free programs can use 'libintl' as a shared\nlibrary, whereas only free software can use 'libintl' as a static\nlibrary or use modified versions of 'libintl'.\n\n   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle\nthe use of 'gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The\nFree Translation Project is also available for packages which are not\ndeveloped inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above\napplies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact\n'coordinator@translationproject.org' to make the '.pot' files available\nto the translation teams.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that\nyou can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a\nfile `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for\ndebugging `configure').\n\n   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'\nand enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves\nthe results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  (Caching is\ndisabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale\ncache files.)\n\n   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try\nto figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail\ndiffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can\nbe considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at\nsome point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you\nmay remove or edit it.\n\n   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create\n`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You only need\n`configure.ac' if you want to change it or regenerate `configure' using\na newer version of `autoconf'.\n\nThe simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're\n     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type\n     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute\n     `configure' itself.\n\n     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some\n     messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n  2. Type `make' to compile the package.\n\n  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with\n     the package.\n\n  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and\n     documentation.\n\n  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the\n     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the\n     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for\n     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is\n     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly\n     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get\n     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came\n     with the distribution.\n\nCompilers and Options\n=====================\n\n   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that\nthe `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'\nfor details on some of the pertinent environment variables.\n\n   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters\nby setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here\nis an example:\n\n     ./configure CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix\n\n   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.\n\nCompiling For Multiple Architectures\n====================================\n\n   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the\nsame time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their\nown directory.  To do this, you must use a version of `make' that\nsupports the `VPATH' variable, such as GNU `make'.  `cd' to the\ndirectory where you want the object files and executables to go and run\nthe `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the\nsource code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.\n\n   If you have to use a `make' that does not support the `VPATH'\nvariable, you have to compile the package for one architecture at a\ntime in the source code directory.  After you have installed the\npackage for one architecture, use `make distclean' before reconfiguring\nfor another architecture.\n\nInstallation Names\n==================\n\n   By default, `make install' will install the package's files in\n`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/man', etc.  You can specify an\ninstallation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving `configure' the\noption `--prefix=PATH'.\n\n   You can specify separate installation prefixes for\narchitecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you\ngive `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will use\nPATH as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.\nDocumentation and other data files will still use the regular prefix.\n\n   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give\noptions like `--bindir=PATH' to specify different values for particular\nkinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories\nyou can set and what kinds of files go in them.\n\n   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed\nwith an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the\noption `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.\n\nOptional Features\n=================\n\n   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to\n`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.\nThey may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE\nis something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The\n`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the\npackage recognizes.\n\n   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually\nfind the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,\nyou can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and\n`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.\n\nSpecifying the System Type\n==========================\n\n   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out\nautomatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package\nwill run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the\n_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints\na message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the\n`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system\ntype, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:\n\n     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM\n\nwhere SYSTEM can have one of these forms:\n\n     OS KERNEL-OS\n\n   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If\n`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't\nneed to know the machine type.\n\n   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should\nuse the `--target=TYPE' option to select the type of system they will\nproduce code for.\n\n   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a\nplatform different from the build platform, you should specify the\n\"host\" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will\neventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.\n\nSharing Defaults\n================\n\n   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,\nyou can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives\ndefault values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.\n`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then\n`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the\n`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.\nA warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.\n\nDefining Variables\n==================\n\n   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the\nenvironment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run\nconfigure again during the build, and the customized values of these\nvariables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set\nthem in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:\n\n     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc\n\nwill cause the specified gcc to be used as the C compiler (unless it is\noverridden in the site shell script).\n\n`configure' Invocation\n======================\n\n   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it\noperates.\n\n`--help'\n`-h'\n     Print a summary of the options to `configure', and exit.\n\n`--version'\n`-V'\n     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'\n     script, and exit.\n\n`--cache-file=FILE'\n     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,\n     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to\n     disable caching.\n\n`--config-cache'\n`-C'\n     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.\n\n`--quiet'\n`--silent'\n`-q'\n     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To\n     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error\n     messages will still be shown).\n\n`--srcdir=DIR'\n     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually\n     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.\n\n`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run\n`configure --help' for more details.\n\n"

          "content": "The Qalculate! developer(s) are thankful for every possible translation and willing to answer any questions or help with any problems you may have as a translator. Please read through this document before starting the translation.\n\nQalculate! is split up into one library package (libqalculate, which also includes the text interface) and GUI packages (currently only qalculate-gtk).\n\nThe GUI packages contain translations for the GUI text as usual in the po directory. The libqalculate translations are split up into two -- translation of error messages, type information and the text interface in po, and translation of definitions of functions, variables, units, etc. in po-defs (merged with the data files in data).\n\nThe source packages for libqalculate and qalculate-gtk do not include any .pot files. Instead the pot file is created with \"intltool-update --pot\". You can then run \"msginit --locale=??\" or just copy the pot-file to ??.po. The translation file is updated with \"intltool-update language code\" (ex. intltool-update sv, for the Swedish translation) from the po directories. intltool-update is distributed with intltool.\n\nThe translation of the libqalculate message strings in po-defs requires some further knowledge. These are merged with the xml data files in libqalculate/data. The different types of message strings in these files are:\n\nData objects: Values of text properties\nData sets: Categories, titles, names, descriptions, property titles, property names and property descriptions\nFunctions: Categories, titles, names, descriptions and argument titles\nVariables/constants: Categories, titles and names\nUnits: Categories, titles and names\nCurrencies: Categories, titles, countries, and names\nPrefixes: Names\n\nTo distinguish equal text strings with different meanings (for example \"Mercury\" as a planet and as a chemical element), some text strings are preceded by \"!type!\" (for example \"!units!\" for units). Everything between and including a exclamation mark in the beginning and the second exclamation mark is not displayed in the application. Translators do not need to include \"!type!\" in the translation.\n\nNames require some special considerations from the translator. The names are used to reference an object in a mathematical expression and to display them in a result. An object can have any number of names but each must be fully unique, with the exception that functions can have names used by other types of objects (for example \"min\" is used as a name for the minute unit but also for a function returning smallest value in a vector). The translation does not need to have the same number of names as the untranslated object.\n\nThere are some characters which are reserved for other purposes (mainly mathematical operators) and may not be included in names. These are\n- ~ + - * / ^ & | ! <> = ' @ ? \\ { } \" . , ; : ( ) [ ],\n- spaces, tabs and newline characters, and\n- unicode signs for operators.\n\nNo name may begin with a digit and units are not allowed to contain a digit anywhere.\n\nAll names of a object are contained in one text string. The names are separated by commas (','). The order of names decides their priority, which name is by default used for display and input. Each name may be preceded by a number of properties before a colon (':'). The format of the names strings is thus [properties1:]name1,[properties2:]name2,... The possible properties are\n- 'a': the name is an abbreviation,\n- 'c': the name is case-sensitive,\n- 'i': the name should not be presented to the user for input (but looks good for display),\n- 'o': the name is appropriate for completion, but should never be presented to the user,\n- 'p': the name is in plural form,\n- 'r': the name is used as reference,\n- 's': the name ends with a suffix (the text after the last '_' will displayed as subscript with the '_' removed, often used in combination with 'i'), and\n- 'u': the name contains a unicode sign.\n\nAll properties are off by default, except for names with only one sign which are interpreted as abbreviations by default, and for abbreviations which by default are case-sensitive. A property can be turned off by preceding it with a minus '-'.\n\nThe reference property tells that the name will be available to all users regardless of the language used. If a reference name is not included in the translated list of names, it is appended at the end by the program. The translator can include the reference names to select the position of the name and change all properties except 'r', 'c' and 'u'. All untranslated first names have the reference property explicitly specified, so names can easily be distinguished from other text strings by the preceding properties and colon.\n\nMost functions and variables have only one name. Units usually have an abbreviated name, a normal name and a name in plural form. Units should always have a name in plural form if it differs from the singular form.\n\nProperty names work like the names described above except that 'r' for reference is the only possible property.\n\nBelow follow some examples from the Swedish translation.\n\nmsgid \"ar:m,meter,p:meters,metre,p:metres\"\nmsgstr \"a:m,meter\"\nThe meter unit has the abbreviated reference name \"m\" (case-sensitive), a normal name \"meter\" and a plural form \"meters\". Meter does also in addition have a different spelling in English. The Swedish name for meter is the same as in English but the plural form is the same as the singular, and no alternative spelling exist.\n\nmsgid \"r:mean\"\nmsgstr \"medel\"\nThe name of the mean function is translated to \"medel\", but since \"mean\" is specified as a reference name it is appended by the program as the second name (results in \"medel,r:mean\").\n\nmsgid \"ar:SEK\"\nmsgstr \"a-c:kr,a:SEK,krona,p:kronor\"\nThe English version can only use the three character code for the Swedish currency since the other names can be used for other currencies, but the translation can assume that the user refers to the local currency.\n\nmsgid \"-r:billion\"\nmsgstr \"miljard,p:miljarder\"\nThe constants for large numbers follows two different systems in different countries. With the \"short scale\" billion means 1e9, while it with the \"long scale\" means 1e12. Therefore, these constants do not have any reference name. The short scale is used in most English-speaking countries, while in Sweden the long scale is used.\n\nqalc commands and options to commands in libqalculate/po/ follows the same principles as reference names, meaning that the untranslated message string is kept in addition to the translated.\n"
