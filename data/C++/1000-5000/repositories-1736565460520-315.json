For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b.

Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\nas contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.

          "content": "Vulkan tutorial\n===============\n\nThis repository hosts the contents of [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com).\nThe website itself is based on [daux.io](https://github.com/dauxio/daux.io),\nwhich supports [GitHub flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).\nThe actual site runs daux.io with a custom theme and a few modifications (https://github.com/Overv/daux.io) and this is built into a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/overv/vulkan-tutorial).\n\nUse issues and pull requests to provide feedback related to the website. If you\nhave a problem with your code, then use the comments section in the related\nchapter to ask a question. Please provide your operating system, graphics card,\ndriver version, source code, expected behaviour and actual behaviour.\n\nE-book\n------\n\nThis guide is now available in e-book formats as well:\n\n* EPUB ([English](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/resources/vulkan_tutorial_en.epub), [French](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/resources/vulkan_tutorial_fr.epub))\n* PDF ([English](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/resources/vulkan_tutorial_en.pdf), [French](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/resources/vulkan_tutorial_fr.pdf))\n\nThe e-book can be built from the existing content by running:\n\n     python3 build_ebook.py\n\nThis script depends on the following utilities being available on the path:\n\n* `inkscape`: SVG to PNG conversion (tested with version 1.0.2)\n* `pandoc`: Building a PDF and EPUB from the Markdown code (tested with version 2.13)\n\nYou also need to install a LaTeX distribution for PDF generation.\n\nChanging code across chapters\n-----------------------------\n\nIt is sometimes necessary to change code that is reused across many chapters,\nfor example a function like `createBuffer`. If you make such a change, then you\nshould update the code files using the following steps:\n\n* Update any chapters that reference the modified code.\n* Make a copy of the first file that uses it and modify the code there, e.g.\n`base_code_fixed.cpp`.\n* Create a patch using\n`diff -Naur base_code.cpp base_code_fixed.cpp > patch.txt`.\n* Apply the patch to the specified code file and all files in later chapters\nusing the `incremental_patch.sh` script. Run it like this:\n`./incremental_patch.sh base_code.cpp patch.txt`.\n* Clean up the `base_code_fixed.cpp` and `patch.txt` files.\n* Commit.\n\nRendering the tutorial\n-----------------------------\n\nTo render the tutorial (i.e. convert the markdown to html), you have two options:\n\n1. Serve rendered files on the fly using a web server that has php installed\n2. Generate static html files that you can view locally or put on a server\n\nFor either of these options, you'll need php and a patch'ed daux.\n\n### PHP\n\n1. Make sure [PHP](http://php.net/downloads.php) is installed (Daux is written\n   in PHP)\n    1. Both the `php_mbstring` and `php_openssl` extensions need to be enabled\n    2. The `phar.readonly` setting needs to be set to `Off` (to be able to\n       rebuild Daux)\n2. Make sure [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is installed, a php dependency\n   manager that Daux uses\n\n### Clone, patch, and rebuild daux\n\n1. Clone [daux](https://github.com/dauxio/daux.io)\n    * `git clone https://github.com/dauxio/daux.io.git`\n2. Make a new branch at the older revision that the VulkanTutorial patch is\n   against:\n    * `git checkout d45ccff -b vtpatch`\n    * Making a new branch isn't strictly necessary, as you could reset `master`,\n      but this keeps master intact.\n3. Copy over the `daux.patch` file into the daux.io directory, make sure line\n   endings are UNIX style (in case you're using Windows), and apply the patch.\n   It should apply cleanly.\n    * `git am daux.patch`\n4. Run composer in the daux.io directory so that it downloads the dependencies\n   Daux needs in order to be built\n    * `composer install`\n5. Rebuild Daux\n    * `php bin/compile` (this can take a while)\n    * A newly made `daux.phar` will now be in your base directory\n\n### Using Daux to serve rendered files on the fly\n\nOnce you've completed the above, follow the instructions on the daux site\nfor how to [run daux using a web server](https://github.com/dauxio/daux.io/blob/master/README.md#running-remotely).\n\nAs a simple option considering you have php installed, you can also use php's\nbuilt in development web server if you just need to locally see what things\nlook like:\n\n1. In the `daux.io` directory, edit `global.json` so that the `docs_directory`\n   option points at your VulkanTutorial directory\n    * `\"docs_directory\": \"../VulkanTutorial\",`\n2. In the `daux.io` directory, run\n    * ` php -S localhost:8080 index.php`\n3. Type `localhost:8080` in your web browser URL bar and hit enter. You should\n   now see the VulkanTutorial front page.\n\n### Using Daux to statically generate html files\n\nBefore we generate the static files, we need to tweak daux and the tutorial\nsetup to prevent it from trying to load a few outside resources (which will\nstall your browser when trying to load the otherwise static page)\n\n1. In the `VulkanTutorial` directory, edit `config.json` and remove the\n   `google_analytics` line so daux doesn't try to load that.\n2. In the `daux.io` directory, edit `themes/daux/config.json` and remove the\n   `font` line so that daux doesn't try to load an external font.\n3. Rebuild daux according to the earlier instructions so it picks up the theme\n   changes.\n\nWe're working on improvements so in the future the above steps won't be\nnecessary.\n\nNow with the above done, we can generate the static files. Asuming the daux.io\nand VulkanTutorial directories are next to each other, go into the `daux.io`\ndirectory and run a command similar to:\n`php generate -s ../VulkanTutorial -d ../VulkanTutorial/out`.\n\n`-s` tells it where to find the documentation, while `-d` tells it where to put\nthe generated files.\n\nNote: if you want to generate the docs again, delete the `out` directory first\nor daux will make a new `out` directory within the existing `out` directory.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe contents of this repository are licensed as [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/),\nunless stated otherwise.
