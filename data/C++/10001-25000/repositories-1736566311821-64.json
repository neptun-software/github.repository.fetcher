          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWe're always looking for your help to improve the product (bug fixes, new features, documentation, etc).\n\n## Contribute a code change\n\n* Start by reading the [Engineering Design](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/reference/high-level-design.html). More documentation can be found in the [repo docs folder](./docs/) and [on the repo wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/wiki), as well as the user facing docs on the [ONNX Runtime website](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs).\n* If your change is non-trivial or introduces new public facing APIs (discussed in more detail below) please use the [feature request issue template](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) to discuss it with the team and get consensus on the basic design and direction first. For all other changes, you can directly create a pull request (PR) and we'll be happy to take a look.\n* Make sure your PR adheres to the [PR Guidelines](./docs/PR_Guidelines.md) and [Coding Conventions and Standards](./docs/Coding_Conventions_and_Standards.md) established by the team.\n* If you're unsure about any of the above and want to contribute, you're welcome to [start a discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/discussions) with the team.\n\n## Propose a new public API\n\n ONNX Runtime has a collection of [public APIs](./README.md#api-documentation).  Some of these APIs make their way back into the Windows OS.  We make compatibility commitments for these APIs and follow a structured process when adding to them.  Please use the [Feature Request issue template](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) before starting any PRs that affect any of the public APIs.\n\n If your proposal contributes the Windows Machine Learning WinRT API and will affect the Windows.AI.MachineLearning namespace, please review [Windows ML main principles](./docs/WinML_principles.md) before you submit your request.\n\n## Process details\n\nPlease search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues) for a similar idea first: there may already be an issue you can contribute to.\n\n1. **Create Issue**\nTo propose a new feature or API please start by filing a new issue in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues).\nInclude as much detail as you have. It's fine if it's not a complete design: just a summary and rationale is a good starting point.\n\n2. **Discussion**\nWe'll keep the issue open for community discussion until it has been resolved or is deemed no longer relevant.\nNote that if an issue isn't a high priority or has many open questions then it might stay open for a long time.\n\n3. **Owner Review**\nThe ONNX Runtime team will review the proposal and either approve or close the issue based on whether it broadly aligns with the [Onnx Runtime Roadmap - High Level Goals section](./docs/Roadmap.md) and contribution guidelines.\n\n4. **API Review**\nIf the feature adds new APIs then we'll start an API review. All new public APIs must be reviewed before merging.\nFor making changes to the C API refer to guidance [here](./docs/C_API_Guidelines.md).\nFor making changes to the Windows Machine Learning WinRT API, please label your request as *api:WinML*, and someone from the Windows ML team will work with you.\n\n5. **Implementation**\n* A feature can be implemented by you, the ONNX Runtime team, or other community members.  Code contributions are greatly appreciated: feel free to work on any reviewed feature you proposed, or choose one in the backlog and send us a PR. If you are new to the project and want to work on an existing issue, we recommend starting with issues that are tagged with “good first issue”. Please let us know in the issue comments if you are actively working on implementing a feature so we can ensure it's assigned to you.\n* Unit tests: New code *must* be accompanied by unit tests.\n* Documentation and sample updates: If the PR affects any of the documentation or samples then include those updates in the same PR.\n* Build instructions are [here](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/build/).\n* Once a feature is complete and tested according to the contribution guidelines follow these steps:\n  * Follow the [standard GitHub process to open a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests)\n  * Add reviewers who have context from the earlier discussion. If you can't find a reviewer, add 'microsoft/onnxruntime'.\n* Binaries: We periodically produce signed prerelease binaries from the master branch to validate new features and APIs.  After the feature has been sufficiently validated as part of a prerelease package we will include it in the next stable binary release.\n* Note: After creating a pull request, you might not see a build getting triggered right away. One of the\nonnxruntime team members will trigger the build for you.\n\n## Contribute to ONNX Runtime docs\n\nTutorials, how-to guides and API reference docs for ONNX Runtime are published at https://onnxruntime.ai/docs.\n\nThe html docs are generated from markdown using Jekyll and published using GitHub Pages.\n\nTo update the docs, create a Pull Request against the [gh-pages](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/tree/gh-pages) branch of the [ONNX Runtime repo](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime).\n\nTo preview your changes, you can push to the gh-pages branch in your fork and this will publish a staged version of your changes to <github user name>.github.io/onnxruntime/docs.\n\nOnce your PR is approved and merged, your changes will be automatically published to https://onnxruntime.ai/docs.\n\nNote: technical reference docs for developers of ONNX Runtime source code can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/docs)\n\n## Licensing guidelines\n\nThis project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to\nagree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to,\nand actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit\nhttps://cla.microsoft.com.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need\nto provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the\ninstructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using our CLA.\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).\nFor more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/)\nor contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## Report a security issue\n\nSecurity issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security\nResponse Center (MSRC) at [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

All code authors, and representatives of the companies\nthey work for, have signed affidavits dedicating their contributions to the\npublic domain and originals of those signed affidavits are stored in a firesafe\nat the main offices of Hwaci. Anyone is free to copy, modify, publish, use,\ncompile, sell, or distribute the original SQLite code, either in source code\nform or as a compiled binary, for any purpose, commercial or non-commercial,\nand by any means.\n\nThe previous paragraph applies to the deliverable code and documentation in\nSQLite - those parts of the SQLite library that you actually bundle and ship\nwith a larger application. Some scripts used as part of the build process (for\nexample the \"configure\" scripts generated by autoconf) might fall under other\nopen-source licenses. Nothing from these build scripts ever reaches the final\ndeliverable SQLite library, however, and so the licenses associated with those\nscripts should not be a factor in assessing your rights to copy and use the\nSQLite library.\n\nAll of the deliverable code in SQLite has been written from scratch. No code\nhas been taken from other projects or from the open internet. Every line of\ncode can be traced back to its original author, and all of those authors have\npublic domain dedications on file. So the SQLite code base is clean and is\nuncontaminated with licensed code from other projects.\n\n_____\n\ngoogle/XNNPACK\n\nBSD License\n\nFor XNNPACK software\n\nCopyright (c) Facebook, Inc. and its affiliates.
