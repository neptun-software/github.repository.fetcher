LGTM scores us flawless A+ from having zero CodeQL alerts and we compile with pedantic warning levels.\n\n\n### :arrow_forward: Rapid scripting\nµWebSockets is written entirely in C & C++ but has a seamless integration for Node.js backends. This allows for rapid scripting of powerful apps, using widespread competence. See <a href=\"https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js\">µWebSockets.js</a>.\n\n### :crossed_swords: Battle proven\nWe've been fully standards compliant with a perfect Autobahn|Testsuite score since 2016<sup><a href=\"https://unetworking.github.io/uWebSockets.js/report.pdf\">2</a></sup>. µWebSockets powers many of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world, handling trade volumes of multiple billions of USD every day. If you trade crypto, chances are you do so via µWebSockets.\n\n### :battery: Batteries included\nDesigned around a convenient URL router with wildcard & parameter support - paired with efficient pub/sub features for WebSockets. µWebSockets should be the obvious, complete starting point for any real-time web project with high demands.\n\nStart building your Http & WebSocket apps in no time; <a href=\"https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets/blob/master/misc/READMORE.md\">read the user manual</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets/tree/master/examples\">see examples</a>.

There are currently five event-loop integrations; libuv, ASIO, GCD and raw epoll/kqueue.\n\nIn a nutshell:\n\n* `WITH_WOLFSSL=1 WITH_LIBUV=1 make examples` builds examples utilizing WolfSSL and libuv\n* `WITH_OPENSSL=1 make examples` builds examples utilizing OpenSSL and the native kernel\n\nSee µSockets for an up-to-date list of flags and a more detailed explanation.\n\n### :handshake: Permissively licensed\nIntellectual property, all rights reserved.\n\nWhere such explicit notice is given, source code is licensed Apache License 2.0 which is a permissive OSI-approved license with very few limitations.
