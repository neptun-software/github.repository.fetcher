          "content": "# Changelog\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.\nEach release should have the following subsections, if entries exist, in the\ngiven order: `Breaking`, `Build`, `Deprecated`, `Removed`, `Added`, `Changed`,\n`Fixed`, `Security`.\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),\nand this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).\n\n## [Unreleased]\n### Added\n- An option `unmute-on-scroll` for `internal/pulseaudio` and `internal/alsa` to unmute audio when the user scrolls on the widget.\n- `internal/battery`: Added `ramp-charging` tag.\n([`#3172`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3172))\nby [@stringlapse](https://github.com/stringlapse).\n- Added tray-reversed = false option to tray module. Makes tray icons order reversed. ([`#3181`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/discussions/3181))\n\n### Changed\n- `internal/pulseaudio`: Volume adjustments now preserve balance instead of volume ratios ([`#3123`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3123), [`#3169`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3169)) by [`@parmort`](https://github.com/parmort)\n- When the `-r` flag is provided, and RandR reports zero connected active screens, polybar will not restart. This fixes polybar dying on some laptops when the lid is closed. ([`#3078`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3078))).\n\n## [3.7.2] - 2024-08-17\n### Fixed\n- `custom/script`: When a script with `tail = true` received multiple lines quickly, only the first would get displayed ([`#3117`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3117), [`#3119`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3119)) by [@Isak05](https://github.com/Isak05)\n-  Token min-length calculations would behave differently when non-ASCII characters appear in the token ([`#3074`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3074), [`#3087`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3087)) by [@nklloyd](https://github.com/nklloyd)\n-  i3: Fix duplicated rendering for non-full-width bars ([`#3091`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3091), [`#3060`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3060))\n- `internal/backlight`: Module could display the literal `%percentage%` token if the backlight reports a value of 0 at startup ([`#3081`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3081)) by [@unclechu](https://github.com/unclechu)\n- `internal/tray`: Fix crash during restarting, when tray icons were not removed proberly ([`#3111`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3111), [`#3112`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3112))\n- `custom/ipc`: Module would display the literal `%output%` token before the initial hook finished executing ([`#3131`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3131), [`#3140`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3140))\n- renderer: Pseudo-transparency rendering artifacts when wallpaper does not fill entire screen ([`#3096`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3096), [`#3041`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3041))\n\n## [3.7.1] - 2023-11-27\n### Build\n- Fixed missing header when using `libc++` in clang 15 and below\n\n### Changed\n- `internal/tray`: The module must use the `<tray>` tag (this is the default) ([`#3037`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3037))\n\n### Fixed\n- Modules did not validate that all tags (e.g. `<label>`) used in a format were valid for that format ([`#3043`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3043), [`#3045`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3045))\n- `internal/tray`: Fixed `module-margin` and `separator` being applied to completely empty tray module ([`#3036`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/3036), [`#3037`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3037))\n\n## [3.7.0] - 2023-11-05\n### Breaking\n- `custom/script`:\n  - No longer hides the module if the `exec` command failed and did not change the output from the previous run ([`#2636`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2636)). Somewhat similar original behaviour can be imitated with `format-fail`, if necessary.\n  - If the `exec` command produced no output and exited with a non-zero exit code the module is no longer completely empty, but just has an empty `%output%` token. If you relied on this behavior to hide the module under certain circumstances, make sure the script exits with an exit code of zero. ([`#2857`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/discussions/2857), [`#2861`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2861))\n\n### Build\n- Respect `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` when installing default config ([`#2770`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2770), [`#2917`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2917))\n- Change default `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to `/usr`. Installations with default flags will now go into `/usr` instead of `/usr/local` ([`#2917`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2917))\n- Bump C++ version to C++17 ([`#2847`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2847))\n\n### Deprecated\n- `custom/text`: The `content` setting and all its properties are deprecated in favor of `format` with the same functionality. ([`#2676`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2676))\n- tray: All tray-related settings in the bar section are deprecated. They are replaced by the new tray module ([`#3002`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3002))\n  - `tray-position`, `tray-detached`, `tray-maxsize`, `tray-scale`, `tray-transparent`, `tray-background`, `tray-foreground`, `tray-padding`, `tray-offset-x`, `tray-offset-y`\n\n### Added\n- A tray module with type `internal/tray` for positioning the tray like a module ([`#2689`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2689))\n- `internal/temperature`: `%temperature-k%` token displays the temperature in Kelvin ([`#2774`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/discussions/2774), [`#2784`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2784))\n- `internal/pulseaudio`: `reverse-scroll` option ([`#2664`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2664))\n- `custom/script`: Repeat interval for script failure (`interval-fail`) and `exec-if` (`interval-if`) ([`#943`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/943), [`#2606`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2606), [`#2630`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2630))\n- `custom/ipc`:\n  - Added support for `<label>` in `format` ([`#2841`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2841)) by [@madhavpcm](https://github.com/madhavpcm).\n  - Added support for `format-i` for each defined `hook-i` ([`#2775`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2775), [`#2810`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2810)) by [@madhavpcm](https://github.com/madhavpcm).\n- `custom/text`: Loads the `format` setting, which supports the `<label>` tag, if the deprecated `content` is not defined ([`#1331`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/1331), [`#2673`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2673), [`#2676`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2676))\n- `internal/backlight`:\n  - `scroll-interval` option ([`#2696`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2696), [`#2700`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2700))\n  - `poll-interval` setting controls how often the module is updated (in case it does not happen when the brightness changes) ([`#2835`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2835), [`#3028`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/3028))\n- `internal/temperature`: Added `zone-type` setting ([`#2572`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2572), [`#2752`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2752)) by [@xphoniex](https://github.com/xphoniex)\n- `internal/xwindow`: `%class%` and `%instance%` tokens, which show the contents of the `WM_CLASS` property of the active window ([`#2830`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2830))\n- Added `enable-struts` option in bar section to enable/disable struts ([`#2769`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2769), [`#2844`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2844)) by [@VanillaViking](https://github.com/VanillaViking).\n- `wm-restack`:\n  - `bottom`: lowers polybar to the bottom of the window stack (same as the previous behavior of `generic`) ([`#2961`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2961))\n  - `ewmh`: Tries to use the `_NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK` hint to position the bar ([`#2961`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2961))\n- `internal/xworkspaces`: `group-by-monitor` setting to decide whether `_NET_DESKTOP_VIEWPORT` should be used to group workspaces by monitor; ([`#2603`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2603), [`#2926`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2926)) by [@slotThe](https://github.com/slotThe/).\n\n### Changed\n- `custom/script`:\n  - No longer produces a completely empty module if the `exec` command failed. It only produces an empty module if the script had a zero exit code. ([`#2857`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/discussions/2857), [`#2861`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2861))\n  - Bumped the script polling interval (not related to the `interval` setting) to decrease wakeups.

This means that the literal backslash character now has special meaning in configuration files, therefore if you want to use it in a value as a literal backslash, you need to escape it with the backslash escape character. The parser logs an error if any unescaped backslashes are found in a value. This affects you only if you are using two consecutive backslashes in a config value, which will now be interpreted as a single literal backslash. ([`#2354`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2354))\n- We rewrote our formatting tag parser. This shouldn't break anything, if you experience any problems, please let us know. The new parser now gives errors for certain invalid tags where the old parser would just silently ignore them. Adding extra text to the end of a valid tag now produces an error. For example, tags like `%{T-a}`, `%{T2abc}`, `%{rfoo}`, and others will now start producing errors. This does not affect you unless you are producing your own invalid formatting tags (for example in a script).\n- For security reasons, the named pipe at `/tmp/polybar_mqueue.<PID>` had its permission bits changed from `666` to `600` to prevent sending ipc messages to polybar processes running under a different user.\n- Also for security reasons, the `polybar-msg` command will now only send messages to polybar processes running under the same user. See the [IPC documentation](https://polybar.readthedocs.io/user/ipc.html) for what exactly this means.\n\n### Build\n- New dependency: [libuv](https://github.com/libuv/libuv). At least version 1.3 is required.\n- Bump the minimum cmake version to 3.5\n- The `BUILD_IPC_MSG` option has been renamed to `BUILD_POLYBAR_MSG`\n- Building the documentation is now enabled by default and not just when `sphinx-build` is found.\n- Users can control exactly which targets should be available with the following cmake options (together with their default value):\n  - `BUILD_POLYBAR=ON` - Builds the `polybar` executable\n  - `BUILD_POLYBAR_MSG=ON` - Builds the `polybar-msg` executable\n  - `BUILD_TESTS=OFF` - Builds the test suite\n  - `BUILD_DOC=ON` - Builds the documentation\n  - `BUILD_DOC_HTML=BUILD_DOC` - Builds the html documentation (depends on `BUILD_DOC`)\n  - `BUILD_DOC_MAN=BUILD_DOC` - Builds the manpages (depends on `BUILD_DOC`)\n  - `BUILD_CONFIG=ON` - Generates the default config\n  - `BUILD_SHELL=ON` - Generates shell completion files\n  - `DISABLE_ALL=OFF` - Disables all above targets by default. Individual targets can still be enabled explicitly.\n- The documentation can no longer be built by directly configuring the `doc` directory.\n- The `POLYBAR_FLAGS` cmake variable can be used to pass extra C++ compiler flags.\n- The sample config file has been removed.\n- Polybar now ships a default config that is installed to `/etc/polybar/config.ini`, it lives in `doc/config.ini`. It will also be placed in the `examples` directory in the documentation folder. ([`#2405`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/2405))\n- The `userconfig` target has been removed, you can no longer use `make userconfig`. As an alternative, you can copy the default config from `/etc/polybar/config.ini`.\n- The `DEBUG_SHADED` cmake variable and its associated functionality has been removed.\n\n### Deprecated\n- `[settings]`: `throttle-output` and `throttle-output-for` have been removed. The new event loop already does a similar thing where it coalesces update triggers if they happen directly after one another, leading to only a single bar update.\n- When not specifying the config file with `--config`, naming your config file `config` is deprecated. Rename your config file to `config.ini`.\n- Directly writing ipc messages to `/tmp/polybar_mqueue.<PID>` is deprecated, users should always use `polybar-msg`. As a consequence the message format used for IPC is deprecated as well.\n- `polybar-msg hook` is deprecated in favor of using the hook action. `polybar-msg` will tell you the correct command to use.\n\n### Added\n- Support `px` and `pt` units everyhwere where before only a number of spaces or pixels could be specified. ([`#2578`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2578), [`#1651`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/1651), [`#951`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/951))\n- `internal/alsa`: Right and middle click settings.

This shouldn't change any behavior for the user, but be on the lookout for X events, click events, or ipc messages not arriving and the bar not shutting down/restarting properly and let us know if you find any issues. ([`#2384`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/2384))\n- Slight changes to the value ranges the different ramp levels are responsible for in the cpu, memory, fs, and battery modules. The first level is used for everything at and below the start of the value range and the last level for everything at and above the end of the value range.

          "content": "# Contributing\n\nFirst of all, thank you very much for considering contributing to polybar. You\nare awesome! :tada:\n\n**Table of Contents:**\n* [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)\n* [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)\n  + [Testing](#testing)\n  + [Changelog](#changelog)\n  + [Documentation](#documentation)\n  + [Style](#style)\n* [Donations](#donations)\n\n## Bug Reports\n\nBugs should be reported at the polybar issue tracker, using the [bug report\ntemplate](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).\nMake sure you fill out all the required sections.\n\nBefore opening a bug report, please search our [issue\ntracker](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and [known\nissues page](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Known-Issues) for your\nproblem to avoid duplicates.\n\nIf your issue has already been reported but is already marked as fixed and the\nversion of polybar you are using includes this supposed fix, feel free to open a\nnew issue.\n\nYou should also go through our [debugging\nguide](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki/Debugging-your-Config) to confirm\nwhat you are experiencing is indeed a polybar bug and not an issue with your\nconfiguration.\nThis will also help you narrow down the issue which, in turn, will help us\nresolve it, if it turns out to be a bug in polybar.\n\nIf this bug was not present in a previous version of polybar and you know how\nto, doing a `git bisect` and providing us with the commit ID that introduced the\nissue would be immensely helpful.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nIf you want to start contributing to polybar, a good place to start are issues\nlabeled with\n[help wanted](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/labels/help%20wanted)\nor\n[good first issue](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/labels/good%20first%20issue).\n\nExcept for small changes, PRs should always address an already open and accepted\nissue.\nOtherwise you run the risk of spending time implementing something and then the\nPR being rejected because the feature you implemented was not actually something\nwe want in polybar.\n\nIssues with any of the following labels are generally safe to start working on,\nunless they also have the `needs confirmation` label or someone else has\nalready claimed them:\n\n* [bug](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/labels/bug)\n* [confirmed](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/labels/confirmed)\n* [good first issue](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n* [help wanted](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/labels/help%20wanted)\n* [hacktoberfest](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/labels/Hacktoberfest) (can also be worked on outside of October :wink:)\n\nFor anything else, it's a good idea to first comment under the issue to ask\nwhether it is something that can/should be worked on right now.\nThis is especially true for issues labeled with `feature` (and none of the\nlabels listed above), here a feature may depend on some other things being\nimplemented first or it may need to be split into many smaller features, because\nit is too big otherwise.\nIn particular, this means that you should not open a feature request and\nimmediately start working on that feature, unless you are very sure it will be\naccepted or accept the risk of it being rejected.\n\nThings like documentation changes or refactorings, don't necessarily need an\nissue associated with them.\nThese changes are less likely to be rejected since they don't change the\nbehavior of polybar.\nNevertheless, for bigger changes or when in doubt, open an issue and ask whether\nsuch changes would be desirable.\n\nTo claim an issue, comment under it to let others know that you are working on\nit.\n\nFeel free to ask for feedback about your changes at any time.\nEspecially when implementing features, this can be very useful because it allows\nus to make sure you are going in the direction we had envisioned for that\nfeature and you don't lose time on something that ultimately has to be\nrewritten.\nIn that case, a [draft PR](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/)\nis a useful tool.\n\nWhen creating a PR, please fill out the PR template.\n\n### Testing\n\nYour PR must pass all existing tests.\nIf possible, you should also add tests for the things you write.\nHowever, this is not always possible, for example when working on modules.\nBut at least isolated components should be tested.\n\nSee the [testing\npage](https://polybar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/testing.html) in the\ndocumentation.\nAlso don't hesitate to ask for help, testing isn't that mature in polybar yet\nand some things may be harder/impossible to test right now.\n\n### Changelog\n\nWe use the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format for\nkeeping track of changes in a release.\n\nIf your PR introduces notable changes to polybar, please add them the correct\nsubsection in the `Unreleased` section in the `CHANGELOG.md` file at the root\nof this repository.\nNotable changes are any user-visible changes, like bug fixes, new config\noptions, changes to the build, etc., but not, for example, code cleanup that\ndoesn't change polybar's behavior or minor documentation changes.\nOne thing that also should not be added to the changelog are bugfixes for\nunreleased features.\n\nAn entry in the changelog should include a link to the issue(s) that the PR\naddresses, to the PR itself, and to your username:\n\n```\n- A short description of the change\n  ([`#XYZ`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/issues/XYZ),\n  [`#UVW`](https://github.com/polybar/polybar/pull/UVW))\n  by [@yourname](https://github.com/yourname).\n```\n\nYou will first need to open the PR before you can link to it though :wink:.\n\n\nIf you are unsure whether something is a notable change, just add it to the\nchangelog and we can determine whether it is a notable change when reviewing.\n\n### Documentation\n\nRight now, documentation for polybar lives in two places: The GitHub wiki and\nthe git repo itself.\n\nUltimately, most of the documentation is supposed to live in the repo itself.\n\nFor now, if your PR requires documentation changes in the repo, those changes\nneed to be in the PR as well.\n\nChanges on the wiki should not be made right away because the wiki should\nreflect the currently released version and not the development version.\nIn that case, outline the documentation changes that need to be made (for\nexample, which new config options are available).\nIf your PR would introduce a lot of new documentation on the wiki, let us know\nand we can decide if we want to put some of the documentation directly into the\nrepo.\n\n### Style\n\nPlease read our [style\nguide](https://polybar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/style-guide.html).\n\n## Donations\n\nDonations support the sustained development of polybar.\nWe accept donations through [our open collective page](\nhttps://opencollective.com/polybar).\nThis can be either a one time or a recurring donation.\n\nOur [blog post](https://polybar.github.io/2020/12/21/Polybar-Funding.html) lays\nout the why and how behind our decision to accept donations.\n"
