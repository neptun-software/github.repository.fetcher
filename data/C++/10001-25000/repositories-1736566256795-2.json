          "content": "## 0. Formatting\n\n**GOLDEN RULE**: Follow the style of the existing code when you make changes.\n\n1. Use tabs for leading indentation:\n   - tab stops are every 4 characters (only relevant for line length).\n   - one indentation level -> exactly one byte (i.e. a tab character) in the source file.\n2. Line widths:\n   - Lines should be at most 99 characters wide to make diff views readable and reduce merge conflicts.\n   - Lines of comments should be formatted according to ease of viewing, but simplicity is to be preferred over beauty.\n3. Single-statement blocks should not have braces, unless required for clarity.\n4. Never place condition bodies on same line as condition.\n5. Space between keyword and opening parenthesis, but not following opening parenthesis or before final parenthesis.\n6. No spaces for unary operators, `->` or `.`.\n7. No space before `:` but one after it, except in the ternary operator: one on both sides.\n8. Add spaces around all other operators.\n9. Braces, when used, always have their own lines and are at same indentation level as \"parent\" scope.\n10. If lines are broken, a list of elements enclosed with parentheses (of any kind) and separated by a separator (of any kind) are formatted such that there is exactly one element per line, followed by the separator, the opening parenthesis is on the first line, followed by a line break and the closing parenthesis is on a line of its own unindented). See example below.\n\nYes:\n```cpp\nif (a == b[i])\n    printf(\"Hello\\n\"); // NOTE spaces used instead of tab here for clarity - first byte should be '\\t'.\nfoo->bar(\n    someLongVariableName,\n    anotherLongVariableName,\n    anotherLongVariableName,\n    anotherLongVariableName,\n    anotherLongVariableName\n);\ncout <<\n    \"some very long string that contains completely irrelevant \" <<\n    \"text that talks about this and that and contains the words \" <<\n    \"\\\"lorem\\\" and \\\"ipsum\\\"\" <<\n    endl;\n```\n\nNo:\n```cpp\nif( a==b[ i ] ) { printf (\"Hello\\n\"); }\nfoo->bar(someLongVariableName,\n         anotherLongVariableName,\n         anotherLongVariableName,\n         anotherLongVariableName,\n         anotherLongVariableName);\ncout << \"some very long string that contains completely irrelevant text that talks about this and that and contains the words \\\"lorem\\\" and \\\"ipsum\\\"\" << endl;\n```\n\nTo set indentation and tab width settings uniformly, the repository contains an [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) [`.editorconfig`](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/blob/develop/.editorconfig) file, which describes some of the styles used and which is recognized by many IDE's and editors.\n\n## 1. Namespaces\n\n1. No `using namespace` declarations in header files.\n2. `using namespace solidity;` and other project local namespaces is fine in cpp files, and generally encouraged.\n3. Avoid `using namespace` at file level for third party libraries, such as boost, ranges, etc.\n4. All symbols should be declared in a namespace except for final applications.\n5. Use anonymous namespaces for helpers whose scope is a cpp file only.\n6. Preprocessor symbols should be prefixed with the namespace in all-caps and an underscore.\n\nOnly in the header:\n```cpp\n#include <cassert>\nnamespace myNamespace\n{\nstd::tuple<float, float> meanAndSigma(std::vector<float> const& _v);\n}\n```\n\n## 2. Preprocessor\n\n1. File comment is always at top, and includes:\n   - Copyright\n   - License (e.g. see COPYING)\n2. Never use `#ifdef`/`#define`/`#endif` file guards. Prefer `#pragma` once as first line below file comment.\n3. Prefer static constexpr variables to value macros.\n4. Prefer inline constexpr functions to function macros.\n5. Split complex macro on multiple lines with `\\`.\n\n## 3. Capitalization\n\n**GOLDEN RULE**: Preprocessor: `ALL_CAPS`; C++: `camelCase`.\n\n1. Use camelCase for splitting words in names, except where obviously extending STL/boost functionality in which case follow those naming conventions.\n2. The following entities' first alpha is upper case:\n   - Type names\n   - Template parameters\n   - Enum members\n   - static const variables that form an external API.\n3. All preprocessor symbols (macros, macro arguments) in full uppercase with underscore word separation.\n\nAll other entities' first alpha is lower case.\n\n## 4. Variable prefixes\n\n1. Leading underscore \"_\" to parameter names:\n   - Exception: \"o_parameterName\" when it is used exclusively for output. See 6(f).\n   - Exception: \"io_parameterName\" when it is used for both input and output. See 6(f).\n2. Leading \"g_\" to global (non-const) variables.\n3. Leading \"s_\" to static (non-const, non-global) variables.\n\n## 5. Assertions\n\nUse `solAssert` and `solUnimplementedAssert` generously to check assumptions that span across different parts of the code base, for example before dereferencing a pointer.\n\n## 6. Declarations\n\n1. {Typename} + {qualifiers} + {name}.\n2. Only one per line.\n3. Associate */& with type, not variable (at ends with parser, but more readable, and safe if in conjunction with (b)).\n4. Favour declarations close to use; do not habitually declare at top of scope ala C.\n5. Pass non-trivial parameters as const reference, unless the data is to be copied into the function, then either pass by const reference or by value and use std::move.\n6. If a function returns multiple values, use std::tuple (std::pair acceptable) or better introduce a struct type. Do not use */& arguments.\n7. Use parameters of pointer type only if ``nullptr`` is a valid argument, use references otherwise. Often, ``std::optional`` is better suited than a raw pointer.\n8. Never use a macro where adequate non-preprocessor C++ can be written.\n9. Only use ``auto`` if the type is very long and rather irrelevant.\n10. Do not pass bools: prefer enumerations instead.\n11. Prefer enum class to straight enum.\n12. Always initialize POD variables, even if their value is overwritten later.\n\nYes:\n```cpp\nenum class Accuracy\n{\n\tApproximate,\n\tExact\n};\nstruct MeanSigma\n{\n\tfloat mean = 0.0f;\n\tfloat standardDeviation = 1.0f;\n};\ndouble const d = 0;\nint i = 0;\nint j = 0;\nchar* s = nullptr;\nMeanAndSigma ms meanAndSigma(std::vector<float> const& _v, Accuracy _a);\nDerived* x = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(base);\nfor (auto i = x->begin(); i != x->end(); ++i) {}\n```\n\nNo:\n```cpp\nconst double d = 0;\nint i, j;\nchar *s;\nfloat meanAndSigma(std::vector<float> _v, float* _sigma, bool _approximate);\nDerived* x(dynamic_cast<Derived*>(base));\nfor (map<ComplexTypeOne, ComplexTypeTwo>::iterator i = l.begin(); i != l.end(); ++l) {}\n```\n\n## 7. Structs & classes\n\n1. Structs to be used when all members public and no virtual functions:\n   - In this case, members should be named naturally and not prefixed with `m_`.\n2. Classes to be used in all other circumstances.\n\n## 8. Members\n\n1. One member per line only.\n2. Private, non-static, non-const fields prefixed with `m_`.\n3. Avoid public fields, except in structs.\n4. Use override, final and const as much as possible.\n5. No implementations with the class declaration, except:\n   - template or force-inline method (though prefer implementation at bottom of header file).\n   - one-line implementation (in which case include it in same line as declaration).\n6. For a property `foo`\n   - Member: `m_foo`\n   - Getter: `foo()` [ also: for booleans, `isFoo()` ]\n   - Setter: `setFoo()`\n\n## 9. Naming\n\n1. Avoid unpronounceable names.\n2. Names should be shortened only if they are extremely common, but shortening should be generally avoided\n3. Avoid prefixes of initials (e.g. do not use `IMyInterface`, `CMyImplementation`)\n4. Find short, memorable & (at least semi-) descriptive names for commonly used classes or name-fragments:\n   - A dictionary and thesaurus are your friends;\n   - Spell correctly;\n   - Think carefully about the class's purpose;\n   - Imagine it as an isolated component to try to decontextualise it when considering its name;\n   - Don't be trapped into naming it (purely) in terms of its implementation.\n\n## 10. Type definitions\n\n1. Prefer `using` to `typedef`. e.g. `using ints = std::vector<int>;` rather than typedef `std::vector<int> ints;`\n2. Generally avoid shortening a standard form that already includes all important information:\n   - e.g. stick to `shared_ptr<X>` rather than shortening to `ptr<X>`.\n3. Where there are exceptions to this (due to excessive use and clear meaning), note the change prominently and use it consistently:\n   - e.g. `using Guard = std::lock_guard<std::mutex>;` ///< Guard is used throughout the codebase since it is clear in meaning and used commonly.\n4. In general expressions should be roughly as important/semantically meaningful as the space they occupy.\n5. Avoid introducing aliases for types unless they are very complicated. Consider the number of items a brain can keep track of at the same time.\n\n## 11. Commenting\n\n1. Comments should be doxygen-compilable, using @notation rather than \\notation.\n2. Document the interface, not the implementation:\n   - Documentation should be able to remain completely unchanged, even if the method is reimplemented;\n   - Comment in terms of the method properties and intended alteration to class state (or what aspects of the state it reports);\n   - Be careful to scrutinise documentation that extends only to intended purpose and usage;\n   - Reject documentation that is simply an English transaction of the implementation.\n3. Avoid in-code comments. Instead, try to extract blocks of functionality into functions. This often already eliminates the need for an in-code comment.\n\n## 12. Include Headers\n\n1. Includes should go in increasing order of generality (`libsolidity` -> `libevmasm` -> `libsolutil` -> `boost` -> `STL`).\n2. The corresponding `.h` file should be the first include in the respective `.cpp` file.\n3.

experimental support to import EVM assembly in the format used by ``--asm-json``.\n * TypeChecker: Comparison of internal function pointers now yields a warning, as it can produce unexpected results with the legacy pipeline enabled.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * AST import: Fix bug when importing inline assembly with empty ``let`` variable declaration.\n\n\n### 0.8.23 (2023-11-08)\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n * Optimizer: Fix block deduplicator bug which led to blocks which are identical apart from the contents of ``verbatim`` instructions to be treated as equivalent and thus collapsed into a single one.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Commandline Interface: An empty ``--yul-optimizations`` sequence can now be always provided.\n * Standard JSON Interface: An empty ``optimizerSteps`` sequence can now always be provided.\n\n\n### 0.8.22 (2023-10-25)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Allow defining events at file level.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Code Generator: Remove redundant overflow checks of certain ``for`` loops when the counter variable cannot overflow.\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--no-import-callback`` option that prevents the compiler from loading source files not given explicitly on the

Explicit initialization is no longer mandatory.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--ast-compact-json`` output in assembler mode.\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--ir-ast-json`` and ``--ir-optimized-ast-json`` outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.\n * Commandline Interface: Respect ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` in compiler mode and accept them in assembler mode as well. ``--optimize --no-optimize-yul`` combination now allows enabling EVM assembly optimizer without enabling Yul optimizer.\n * EWasm: Remove EWasm backend.\n * Parser: Introduce ``pragma experimental solidity``, which will enable an experimental language mode that in particular has no stability guarantees between non-breaking releases and is not suited for production use.\n * SMTChecker: Add ``--model-checker-print-query`` CLI option and ``settings.modelChecker.printQuery`` JSON option to output the SMTChecker queries in the SMTLIB2 format. This requires using ``smtlib2`` solver only.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``ast`` file-level output for Yul input.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add ``irAst`` and ``irOptimizedAst`` contract-level outputs for Solidity input, providing AST in compact JSON format for IR and optimized IR.\n * Yul Optimizer: Remove experimental ``ReasoningBasedSimplifier`` optimization step.\n * Yul Optimizer: Stack-to-memory mover is now enabled by default whenever possible for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Code Generator: Disallow complex expressions whose results are types, built-ins, modules or some unassignable functions.

The choice of C++ compiler in some cases would result in different (but equivalent) bytecode (especially from native binaries vs emscripten binaries).\n * Commandline Interface: Fix internal error when using ``--stop-after parsing`` and requesting some of the outputs that require full analysis or compilation.\n * Commandline Interface: It is no longer possible to specify both ``--optimize-yul`` and ``--no-optimize-yul`` at the same time.\n * SMTChecker: Fix encoding of side-effects inside ``if`` and ``ternary conditional``statements in the BMC engine.\n * SMTChecker: Fix false negative when a verification target can be violated only by trusted external call from another public function.\n * SMTChecker: Fix generation of invalid SMT-LIB2 scripts in BMC engine with trusted mode for external calls when CHC engine times out.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by incorrectly classifying external function call using function pointer as a public getter.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by using external identifier to encode member access to functions that take an internal function as a parameter.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Fix an incomplete AST being returned when analysis is interrupted by certain kinds of fatal errors.\n * Type Checker: Disallow using certain unassignable function types in complex expressions.\n * Type Checker: Function declaration types referring to different declarations are no longer convertible to each other.\n * Yul Optimizer: Ensure that the assignment of memory slots for variables moved to memory does not depend on AST IDs that may depend on whether additional files are included during compilation.\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix ``FullInliner`` step not ignoring code that is not in expression-split form.\n * Yul Optimizer: Fix optimized IR being unnecessarily passed through the Yul optimizer again before bytecode generation.\n\n\nAST Changes:\n * AST: Add the ``experimentalSolidity`` field to the ``SourceUnit`` nodes, which indicate whether the experimental parsing mode has been enabled via ``pragma experimental solidity``.\n\n\n### 0.8.20 (2023-05-10)\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Assembler: Use ``push0`` for placing ``0`` on the stack for EVM versions starting from \"Shanghai\". This decreases the deployment and runtime costs.\n * EVM: Set default EVM version to \"Shanghai\".\n * EVM: Support for the EVM Version \"Shanghai\".\n * NatSpec: Add support for NatSpec documentation in ``enum`` definitions.\n * NatSpec: Add support for NatSpec documentation in ``struct`` definitions.\n * NatSpec: Include NatSpec from events that are emitted by a contract but defined outside of it in userdoc and devdoc output.\n * Optimizer: Re-implement simplified version of ``UnusedAssignEliminator`` and ``UnusedStoreEliminator``. It can correctly remove some unused assignments in deeply nested loops that were ignored by the old version.\n * Parser: Unary plus is no longer recognized as a unary operator in the AST and triggers an error at the parsing stage (rather than later during the analysis).\n * SMTChecker: Add CLI option ``--model-checker-bmc-loop-iterations`` and a JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.bmcLoopIterations`` that specify how many loop iterations the BMC engine should unroll. Note that false negatives are possible when unrolling loops. This is due to the possibility that bmc loop iteration setting is less than actual number of iterations needed to complete a loop.\n * SMTChecker: Group all messages about unsupported language features in a single warning. The CLI option ``--model-checker-show-unsupported`` and the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showUnsupported`` can be enabled to show the full list.\n * SMTChecker: Properties that are proved safe are now reported explicitly at the end of analysis. By default, only the number of safe properties is shown. The CLI option ``--model-checker-show-proved-safe`` and the JSON option ``settings.modelChecker.showProvedSafe`` can be enabled to show the full list of safe properties.\n * Standard JSON Interface: Add experimental support for importing ASTs via Standard JSON.\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: If available, use ``push0`` instead of ``codesize`` to produce an arbitrary value on stack in order to create equal stack heights between branches.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * ABI: Include events in the ABI that are emitted by a contract but defined outside of it.\n * Immutables: Disallow initialization of immutables in try/catch statements.\n * SMTChecker: Fix false positives in ternary operators that contain verification targets in its branches, directly or indirectly.\n\n\nAST Changes:\n * AST: Add the ``internalFunctionIDs`` field to the AST nodes of contracts containing IDs of functions that may be called via the internal dispatch. The field is a map from function AST IDs to internal dispatch function IDs. These IDs are always generated, but they are only used in via-IR code generation.\n * AST: Add the ``usedEvents`` field to ``ContractDefinition`` which contains the AST IDs of all events emitted by the contract as well as all events defined and inherited by the contract.\n\n\n### 0.8.19 (2023-02-22)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Allow defining custom operators for user-defined value types via ``using {f as +} for T global`` syntax.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * SMTChecker: New trusted mode that assumes that any compile-time available code is the actual used code even in external calls. This can be used via the CLI option ``--model-checker-ext-calls trusted`` or the JSON field ``settings.modelChecker.extCalls: \"trusted\"``.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Assembler: Avoid duplicating subassembly bytecode where possible.\n * Code Generator: Avoid including references to the deployed label of referenced functions if they are called right away.\n * ContractLevelChecker: Properly distinguish the case of missing base constructor arguments from having an unimplemented base function.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error caused by unhandled ``z3`` expressions that come from the solver when bitwise operators are used.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using the custom NatSpec annotation to abstract free functions.\n * TypeChecker: Also allow external library functions in ``using for``.\n\n\nAST Changes:\n * AST: Add ``function`` field to ``UnaryOperation`` and ``BinaryOperation`` AST nodes. ``functionList`` in ``UsingForDirective`` AST nodes will now contain ``operator`` and ``definition`` members instead of ``function`` when the list entry defines an operator.\n\n\n### 0.8.18 (2023-02-01)\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Allow named parameters in mapping types.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Commandline Interface: Add ``--no-cbor-metadata`` that skips CBOR metadata from getting appended at the end of the bytecode.\n * Commandline Interface: Return exit code ``2`` on uncaught exceptions.\n * EVM: Deprecate ``block.difficulty`` and disallow ``difficulty()`` in inline assembly for EVM versions >= paris. The change is due to the renaming introduced by [EIP-4399](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4399).\n * EVM: Introduce ``block.prevrandao`` in Solidity and ``prevrandao()`` in inline assembly for EVM versions >= paris.\n * EVM: Set the default EVM version to \"Paris\".\n * EVM: Support for the EVM version \"Paris\".\n * Language Server: Add basic document hover support.\n * Natspec: Add event Natspec inheritance for devdoc.\n * Optimizer: Added optimization rule ``and(shl(X, Y), shl(X, Z)) => shl(X, and(Y, Z))``.\n * Parser: More detailed error messages about invalid version pragmas.\n * SMTChecker: Make ``z3`` the default solver for the BMC and CHC engines instead of all solvers.\n * SMTChecker: Support Eldarica as a Horn solver for the CHC engine when using the CLI option ``--model-checker-solvers eld``. The binary ``eld`` must be available in the system.\n * Solidity Upgrade Tool: Remove ``solidity-upgrade`` tool.\n * Standard JSON: Add a boolean field ``settings.metadata.appendCBOR`` that skips CBOR metadata from getting appended at the end of the bytecode.\n * TypeChecker: Warn when using deprecated builtin ``selfdestruct``.\n * Yul EVM Code Transform: Generate more optimal code for user-defined functions that always terminate a transaction. No return labels will be pushed for calls to functions that always terminate.\n * Yul Optimizer: Allow replacing the previously hard-coded cleanup sequence by specifying custom steps after a colon delimiter (``:``) in the sequence string.\n * Yul Optimizer: Eliminate ``keccak256`` calls if the value was already calculated by a previous call and can be reused.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Parser: Disallow several ``indexed`` attributes for the same event parameter.\n * Parser: Disallow usage of the ``indexed`` attribute for modifier parameters.\n * SMTChecker: Fix display error for negative integers that are one more than powers of two.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on chain assignments using static fully specified state variables.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error on multiple wrong SMTChecker natspec entries.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when a public library function is called internally.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when deleting struct member of function type.\n * SMTChecker: Fix internal error when using user-defined types as mapping indices or struct members.\n * SMTChecker: Improved readability for large integers that are powers of two or almost powers of two in error messages.\n * TypeChecker: Fix bug where private library functions could be attached with ``using for`` outside of their declaration scope.\n * Yul Optimizer: Hash hex and decimal literals according to their value instead of their representation, improving the detection of equivalent functions.\n\n\n### 0.8.17 (2022-09-08)\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n * Yul Optimizer: Prevent the incorrect removal of storage writes before calls to Yul functions that conditionally terminate the external EVM call.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Code Generator: More efficient overflow checks for multiplication.\n * Language Server: Analyze all files in a project by default (can be customized by setting ``'file-load-strategy'`` to ``'directly-opened-and-on-import'`` in LSP settings object).\n * Yul Optimizer: Simplify the starting offset of zero-length operations to zero.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Type Checker: Fix internal compiler error on tuple assignments with invalid left-hand side.\n * Yul IR Code Generation: Fix internal compiler error when accessing the ``.slot`` member of a mapping through a storage reference in inline assembly.\n\n\nBuild System:\n * Allow disabling pedantic warnings and do not treat warnings as errors during compiler build when ``-DPEDANTIC=OFF`` flag is passed to CMake.\n * Update emscripten to version 3.1.19.\n\n\n### 0.8.16 (2022-08-08)\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n * Code Generation: Fix data corruption that affected ABI-encoding of calldata values represented by tuples: structs at any nesting level; argument lists of external functions, events and errors; return value lists of external functions. The 32 leading bytes of the first dynamically-encoded value in the tuple would get zeroed when the last component contained a statically-encoded array.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Code Generator: More efficient code for checked addition and subtraction.\n * TypeChecker: Support using library constants in initializers of other constants.\n * Yul IR Code Generation: Improved copy routines for arrays with packed storage layout.\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to convert ``mod(add(X, Y), A)`` into ``addmod(X, Y, A)``, if ``A`` is a power of two.\n * Yul Optimizer: Add rule to convert ``mod(mul(X, Y), A)`` into ``mulmod(X, Y, A)``, if ``A`` is a power of two.\n\n\nBugfixes:\n * Commandline Interface: Disallow the following options outside of the compiler mode: ``--via-ir``,``--metadata-literal``, ``--metadata-hash``, ``--model-checker-show-unproved``, ``--model-checker-div-mod-no-slacks``, ``--model-checker-engine``, ``--model-checker-invariants``, ``--model-checker-solvers``, ``--model-checker-timeout``, ``--model-checker-contracts``, ``--model-checker-targets``.\n * Type Checker: Fix compiler crash on tuple assignments involving certain patterns with unary tuples on the left-hand side.\n * Type Checker: Fix compiler crash when ``abi.encodeCall`` received a tuple expression instead of an inline tuple.\n * Type Checker: Fix null dereference in ``abi.encodeCall`` type checking of free function.\n\n\n### 0.8.15 (2022-06-15)\n\nImportant Bugfixes:\n * Code Generation: Avoid writing dirty bytes to storage when copying ``bytes`` arrays.\n * Yul Optimizer: Keep all memory side-effects of inline assembly blocks.\n\n\nLanguage Features:\n * Add `E.selector` for a non-anonymous event `E` to access the 32-byte selector topic.\n\n\nCompiler Features:\n * Language Server: Add rudimentary support for semantic highlighting.\n * Language Server: Adds support for configuring ``include-paths`` JSON settings object that can be passed during LSP configuration stage.\n * Language Server: Always add ``{project_root}/node_modules`` to include search paths.\n * Type Checker: Warn about assignments involving multiple pushes to storage ``bytes`` that may invalidate references.\n * Yul Optimizer: Improve inlining heuristics for via IR code generation and pure Yul compilation.\n\nBugfixes:\n * ABI Encoder: When encoding an empty string coming from storage do not add a superfluous empty slot for data.\n * Common Subexpression Eliminator: Process assembly items in chunks with maximum size of 2000. It helps to avoid extremely time-consuming searches during code optimization.\n * DocString Parser: Fix ICE caused by an immutable struct with mapping.\n * Yul IR Code Generation: More robust cleanup in corner cases during memory to storage copies.\n * Yul Optimizer: Do not remove ``returndatacopy`` in cases in which it might perform out-of-bounds reads that unconditionally revert as out-of-gas.

Note that ``external`` functions require parameters with a data location of ``calldata``.\n * Explicitly convert values of contract type to addresses before using an ``address`` member. Example: if ``c`` is a contract, change ``c.transfer(...)`` to ``address(c).transfer(...)``.\n * Declare variables and especially function arguments as ``address payable``, if you want to call ``transfer`` on them.\n\nBreaking Changes:\n * ABI Encoder: Properly pad data from calldata (``msg.data`` and external function parameters). Use ``abi.encodePacked`` for unpadded encoding.\n * C API (``libsolc`` / raw ``soljson.js``): Removed the ``version``, ``license``, ``compileSingle``, ``compileJSON``, ``compileJSONCallback`` methods\n   and replaced them with the ``solidity_license``, ``solidity_version`` and ``solidity_compile`` methods.\n * Code Generator: Signed right shift uses proper arithmetic shift, i.e. rounding towards negative infinity. Warning: this may silently change the semantics of existing code!\n * Code Generator: Revert at runtime if calldata is too short or points out of bounds. This is done inside the ``ABI decoder`` and therefore also applies to ``abi.decode()``.\n * Code Generator: Use ``STATICCALL`` for ``pure`` and ``view`` functions. This was already the case in the experimental 0.5.0 mode.\n * Commandline interface: Remove obsolete ``--formal`` option.\n * Commandline interface: Rename the ``--julia`` option to ``--yul``.\n * Commandline interface: Require ``-`` if standard input is used as source.\n * Commandline interface: Use hash of library name for link placeholder instead of name itself.\n * Compiler interface: Disallow remappings with empty prefix.\n * Control Flow Analyzer: Consider mappings as well when checking for uninitialized return values.\n * Control Flow Analyzer: Turn warning about returning uninitialized storage pointers into an error.\n * General: ``continue`` in a ``do...while`` loop jumps to the condition (it used to jump to the loop body).

It is still possible to use it via inline assembly.\n * General: Disallow ``var`` keyword.\n * General: Disallow ``sha3`` and ``suicide`` aliases.\n * General: Disallow the ``throw`` statement.

This was already the case in the experimental 0.5.0 mode.\n * General: Disallow combining hex numbers with unit denominations (e.g. ``0x1e wei``).

The most important change is that you have\nto explicitly specify if functions can receive ether via the ``payable``\nmodifier. Furthermore, more situations cause exceptions to be thrown.\n\nMinimal changes to be made for upgrade:\n - Add ``payable`` to all functions that want to receive Ether\n   (including the constructor and the fallback function).\n - Change ``_`` to ``_;`` in modifiers.\n - Add version pragma to each file: ``pragma solidity ^0.4.0;``\n\nBreaking Changes:\n\n * Source files have to specify the compiler version they are\n   compatible with using e.g. ``pragma solidity ^0.4.0;`` or\n   ``pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.4.8;``\n * Functions that want to receive Ether have to specify the\n   new ``payable`` modifier (otherwise they throw).\n * Contracts that want to receive Ether with a plain \"send\"\n   have to implement a fallback function with the ``payable``\n   modifier. Contracts now throw if no payable fallback\n   function is defined and no function matches the signature.\n * Failing contract creation through \"new\" throws.\n * Division / modulus by zero throws.\n * Function call throws if target contract does not have code\n * Modifiers are required to contain ``_`` (use ``if (false) _`` as a workaround if needed).\n * Modifiers: return does not skip part in modifier after ``_``.\n * Placeholder statement `_` in modifier now requires explicit `;`.\n * ``ecrecover`` now returns zero if the input is malformed (it previously returned garbage).\n * The ``constant`` keyword cannot be used for constructors or the fallback function.\n * Removed ``--interface`` (Solidity interface) output option\n * JSON AST: General cleanup, renamed many nodes to match their C++ names.\n * JSON output: ``srcmap-runtime`` renamed to ``srcmapRuntime``.\n * Moved (and reworked) standard library contracts from inside the compiler to github.com/ethereum/solidity/std\n   (``import \"std\";`` or ``import owned;`` do not work anymore).\n * Confusing and undocumented keyword ``after`` was removed.\n * New reserved words: ``abstract``, ``hex``, ``interface``, ``payable``, ``pure``, ``static``, ``view``.\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Hexadecimal string literals: ``hex\"ab1248fe\"``\n * Internal: Inline assembly usable by the code generator.\n * Commandline interface: Using ``-`` as filename allows reading from stdin.\n * Interface JSON: Fallback function is now part of the ABI.\n * Interface: Version string now *SemVer* compatible.\n * Code generator: Do not provide \"new account gas\" if we know the called account exists.\n\nBugfixes:\n\n * JSON AST: Nodes were added at wrong parent\n * Why3 translator: Crash fix for exponentiation\n * Commandline Interface: linking libraries with underscores in their name.\n * Type Checker: Fallback function cannot return data anymore.\n * Code Generator: Fix crash when ``sha3()`` was used on unsupported types.\n * Code Generator: Manually set gas stipend for ``.send(0)``.\n\nLots of changes to the documentation mainly by voluntary external contributors.\n\n### 0.3.6 (2016-08-10)\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Formal verification: Take external effects on a contract into account.\n * Type Checker: Warning about unused return value of low-level calls and send.\n * Output: Source location and node id as part of AST output\n * Output: Source location mappings for bytecode\n * Output: Formal verification as part of json compiler output.\n\nBugfixes:\n\n * Commandline Interface: Do not crash if input is taken from stdin.\n * Scanner: Correctly support unicode escape codes in strings.\n * JSON output: Fix error about relative / absolute source file names.\n * JSON output: Fix error about invalid utf8 strings.\n * Code Generator: Dynamic allocation of empty array caused infinite loop.\n * Code Generator: Correctly calculate gas requirements for memcpy precompile.\n * Optimizer: Clear known state if two code paths are joined.\n\n### 0.3.5 (2016-06-10)\n\nFeatures:\n\n * Context-dependent path remappings (different modules can use the same library in different versions)\n\nBugfixes:\n\n * Type Checking: Dynamic return types were removed when fetching data from external calls, now they are replaced by an \"unusable\" type.\n * Type Checking: Overrides by constructors were considered making a function non-abstract.\n\n### 0.3.4 (2016-05-31)\n\nNo change outside documentation.\n\n### 0.3.3 (2016-05-27)\n\n * Allow internal library functions to be called (by \"inlining\")\n * Fractional/rational constants (only usable with fixed point types, which are still in progress)\n * Inline assembly has access to internal functions (as jump labels)\n * Running `solc` without arguments on a terminal will print help.\n * Bugfix: Remove some non-determinism in code generation.\n * Bugfix: Corrected usage of not / bnot / iszero in inline assembly\n * Bugfix: Correctly clean bytesNN types before comparison\n\n### 0.3.2 (2016-04-18)\n\n * Bugfix: Inline assembly parser: `byte` opcode was unusable\n * Bugfix: Error reporting: tokens for variably-sized types were not converted to string properly\n * Bugfix: Dynamic arrays of structs were not deleted correctly.\n * Bugfix: Static arrays in constructor parameter list were not decoded correctly.\n\n### 0.3.1 (2016-03-31)\n\n * Inline assembly\n * Bugfix: Code generation: array access with narrow types did not clean higher order bits\n * Bugfix: Error reporting: error reporting with unknown source location caused a crash\n\n### 0.3.0 (2016-03-11)\n\nBREAKING CHANGES:\n\n * Added new keywords `assembly`, `foreign`, `fixed`, `ufixed`, `fixedNxM`, `ufixedNxM` (for various values of M and N), `timestamp`\n * Number constant division does not round to integer, but to a fixed point type (e.g. `1 / 2 != 1`, but `1 / 2 == 0.5`).\n * Library calls now default to use DELEGATECALL (e.g. called library functions see the same value as the calling function for `msg.value` and `msg.sender`).\n * `<address>.delegatecall` as a low-level calling interface\n\nBugfixes:\n * Fixed a bug in the optimizer that resulted in comparisons being wrong.\n\n\n### 0.2.2 (2016-02-17)\n\n * Index access for types `bytes1`, ..., `bytes32` (only read access for now).\n * Bugfix: Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor parameters.\n\n### 0.2.1 (2016-01-30)\n\n * Inline arrays, i.e. `var y = [1,x,f()];` if there is a common type for `1`, `x` and `f()`. Note that the result is always a fixed-length memory array and conversion to dynamic-length memory arrays is not yet possible.\n * Import similar to ECMAScript6 import (`import \"abc.sol\" as d` and `import {x, y} from \"abc.sol\"`).\n * Commandline compiler solc automatically resolves missing imports and allows for \"include directories\".\n * Conditional: `x ? y : z`\n * Bugfix: Fixed several bugs where the optimizer generated invalid code.\n * Bugfix: Enums and structs were not accessible to other contracts.\n * Bugfix: Fixed segfault connected to function parameter types, appeared during gas estimation.\n * Bugfix: Type checker crash for wrong number of base constructor parameters.\n * Bugfix: Allow function overloads with different array types.\n * Bugfix: Allow assignments of type `(x) = 7`.\n * Bugfix: Type `uint176` was not available.\n * Bugfix: Fixed crash during type checking concerning constructor calls.\n * Bugfix: Fixed crash during code generation concerning invalid accessors for struct types.\n * Bugfix: Fixed crash during code generating concerning computing a hash of a struct type.\n\n### 0.2.0 (2015-12-02)\n\n * **Breaking Change**: `new ContractName.value(10)()` has to be written as `(new ContractName).value(10)()`\n * Added `selfdestruct` as an alias for `suicide`.\n * Allocation of memory arrays using `new`.\n * Binding library functions to types via `using x for y`\n * `addmod` and `mulmod` (modular addition and modular multiplication with arbitrary intermediate precision)\n * Bugfix: Constructor arguments of fixed array type were not read correctly.\n * Bugfix: Memory allocation of structs containing arrays or strings.\n * Bugfix: Data location for explicit memory parameters in libraries was set to storage.\n\n### 0.1.7 (2015-11-17)\n\n * Improved error messages for unexpected tokens.\n * Proof-of-concept transcompilation to why3 for formal verification of contracts.\n * Bugfix: Arrays (also strings) as indexed parameters of events.\n * Bugfix: Writing to elements of `bytes` or `string` overwrite others.\n * Bugfix: \"Successor block not found\" on Windows.\n * Bugfix: Using string literals in tuples.\n * Bugfix: Cope with invalid commit hash in version for libraries.\n * Bugfix: Some test framework fixes on windows.\n\n### 0.1.6 (2015-10-16)\n\n * `.push()` for dynamic storage arrays.\n * Tuple expressions (`(1,2,3)` or `return (1,2,3);`)\n * Declaration and assignment of multiple variables (`var (x,y,) = (1,2,3,4,5);` or `var (x,y) = f();`)\n * Destructuring assignment (`(x,y,) = (1,2,3)`)\n * Bugfix: Internal error about usage of library function with invalid types.\n * Bugfix: Correctly parse `Library.structType a` at statement level.\n * Bugfix: Correctly report source locations of parenthesized expressions (as part of \"tuple\" story).\n\n### 0.1.5 (2015-10-07)\n\n * Breaking change in storage encoding: Encode short byte arrays and strings together with their length in storage.\n * Report warnings\n * Allow storage reference types for public library functions.\n * Access to types declared in other contracts and libraries via `.`.\n * Version stamp at beginning of runtime bytecode of libraries.\n * Bugfix: Problem with initialized string state variables and dynamic data in constructor.\n * Bugfix: Resolve dependencies concerning `new` automatically.\n * Bugfix: Allow four indexed arguments for anonymous events.\n * Bugfix: Detect too large integer constants in functions that accept arbitrary parameters.\n\n### 0.1.4 (2015-09-30)\n\n * Bugfix: Returning fixed-size arrays.\n * Bugfix: combined-json output of solc.\n * Bugfix: Accessing fixed-size array return values.\n * Bugfix: Disallow assignment from literal strings to storage pointers.\n * Refactoring: Move type checking into its own module.\n\n### 0.1.3 (2015-09-25)\n\n * `throw` statement.\n * Libraries that contain functions which are called via CALLCODE.\n * Linker stage for compiler to insert other contract's addresses (used for libraries).\n * Compiler option to output runtime part of contracts.\n * Compile-time out of bounds check for access to fixed-size arrays by integer constants.\n * Version string includes libevmasm/libethereum's version (contains the optimizer).\n * Bugfix: Accessors for constant public state variables.\n * Bugfix: Propagate exceptions in clone contracts.\n * Bugfix: Empty single-line comments are now treated properly.\n * Bugfix: Properly check the number of indexed arguments for events.\n * Bugfix: Strings in struct constructors.\n\n### 0.1.2 (2015-08-20)\n\n * Improved commandline interface.\n * Explicit conversion between `bytes` and `string`.\n * Bugfix: Value transfer used in clone contracts.\n * Bugfix: Problem with strings as mapping keys.\n * Bugfix: Prevent usage of some operators.\n\n### 0.1.1 (2015-08-04)\n\n * Strings can be used as mapping keys.\n * Clone contracts.\n * Mapping members are skipped for structs in memory.\n * Use only a single stack slot for storage references.\n * Improved error message for wrong argument count.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n\n"

Questions, feedback, and suggestions are welcome!\n\nSolidity is a statically-typed, contract-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.\n\nFor a good overview and starting point, please check out the official [Solidity Language Portal](https://soliditylang.org).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Background](#background)\n- [Build and Install](#build-and-install)\n- [Example](#example)\n- [Documentation](#documentation)\n- [Development](#development)\n- [Maintainers](#maintainers)\n- [License](#license)\n- [Security](#security)\n\n## Background\n\nSolidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts\nthat run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Smart contracts are programs that are executed inside a peer-to-peer\nnetwork where nobody has special authority over the execution, and thus they allow anyone to implement tokens of value,\nownership, voting, and other kinds of logic.\n\nWhen deploying contracts, you should use the latest released version of\nSolidity. This is because breaking changes, as well as new features and bug fixes, are\nintroduced regularly. We currently use a 0.x version\nnumber [to indicate this fast pace of change](https://semver.org/#spec-item-4).\n\n## Build and Install\n\nInstructions about how to build and install the Solidity compiler can be\nfound in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/installing-solidity.html#building-from-source).\n\n\n## Example\n\nA \"Hello World\" program in Solidity is of even less use than in other languages, but still:\n\n```solidity\n// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0;\n\ncontract HelloWorld {\n    function helloWorld() external pure returns (string memory) {\n        return \"Hello, World!\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo get started with Solidity, you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), which is a\nbrowser-based IDE. Here are some example contracts:\n\n1. [Voting](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#voting)\n2. [Blind Auction](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#blind-auction)\n3. [Safe remote purchase](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#safe-remote-purchase)\n4. [Micropayment Channel](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/solidity-by-example.html#micropayment-channel)\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe Solidity documentation is hosted using [Read the Docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org).\n\n## Development\n\nSolidity is still under development. Contributions are always welcome!\nPlease follow the\n[Developer's Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contributing.html)\nif you want to help.\n\nYou can find our current feature and bug priorities for forthcoming\nreleases in the [projects section](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/projects).\n\n## Maintainers\nThe Solidity programming language and compiler are open-source community projects governed by a core team.\nThe core team is sponsored by the [Ethereum Foundation](https://ethereum.foundation/).\n\n## License\nSolidity is licensed under [GNU General Public License v3.0](LICENSE.txt).\n\nSome third-party code has its [own licensing terms](cmake/templates/license.h.in).\n\n## Security\n\nThe security policy may be [found here](SECURITY.md).\n"

Commit it.\n - [ ] Update the changelog to include a release date.\n - [ ] Run ``scripts/update_bugs_by_version.py`` to regenerate ``bugs_by_version.json`` from the changelog and ``bugs.json``.\n       Make sure that the resulting ``bugs_by_version.json`` has a new, empty entry for the new version.\n - [ ] Commit changes, create a pull request and wait for the tests. Then merge it.\n - [ ] Copy the changelog into the release blog post.\n\n### Create the Release\n - [ ] Create a [release on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/new).\n       Set the target to the ``develop`` branch and the tag to the new version, e.g. ``v0.8.5``.\n       Include the following warning: ``**The release is still in progress. You may see broken links and binaries may not yet be available from all sources.**``.\n       Do not publish it yet - click the ``Save draft`` button instead.\n - [ ] Thank voluntary contributors in the GitHub release notes.\n       Use ``scripts/list_contributors.sh v<previous version>`` to get initial list of names.\n       Remove different variants of the same name manually before using the output.\n - [ ] Check that all tests on the latest commit in ``develop`` are green.\n - [ ] Click the ``Publish release`` button on the release page, creating the tag.\n       **Important: Must not be done before all the PRs, including changelog cleanup and date, are merged.**\n - [ ] Wait for the CI runs on the tag itself.\n\n### Upload Release Artifacts and Publish Binaries\n - [ ] Switch to the tag that archives have to be created for.\n - [ ] Create the ``prerelease.txt`` file: (``echo -n > prerelease.txt``).\n - [ ] Run ``scripts/create_source_tarball.sh`` while being on the tag to create the source tarball. This will create the tarball in a directory called ``upload``.\n - [ ] Take the tarball from the upload directory (its name should be ``solidity_x.x.x.tar.gz``, otherwise ``prerelease.txt`` was missing in the step before) and upload the source tarball to the release page.\n - [ ] Take the ``github-binaries.tar`` tarball from ``c_release_binaries`` run of the tagged commit in circle-ci and add all binaries from it to the release page.\n       Make sure it contains four binaries: ``solc-windows.exe``, ``solc-macos``, ``solc-static-linux`` and ``soljson.js``.\n - [ ] Take the ``solc-bin-binaries.tar`` tarball from ``c_release_binaries`` run of the tagged commit in circle-ci and add all binaries from it to solc-bin.\n - [ ] Run ``npm install`` if you've got a clean checkout of the solc-bin repo.\n - [ ] Run ``npm run update -- --reuse-hashes`` in ``solc-bin`` and verify that the script has updated ``list.js``, ``list.txt`` and ``list.json`` files correctly and that symlinks to the new release have been added in ``solc-bin/wasm/`` and ``solc-bin/emscripten-wasm32/``.\n - [ ] Create a pull request in solc-bin and merge.\n\n### Homebrew and MacOS\n - [ ] Update the version and the hash (``sha256sum solidity_$VERSION.tar.gz``) in the [``solidity`` formula in Homebrew core repository](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/s/solidity.rb).\n\n### Docker\n - [ ] Run ``./scripts/docker_deploy_manual.sh v$VERSION``.\n\n### PPA\n - [ ] Create ``.release_ppa_auth`` at the root of your local Solidity checkout and set ``LAUNCHPAD_EMAIL`` and ``LAUNCHPAD_KEYID`` to your key's email and key id.\n - [ ] Double-check that the ``DISTRIBUTIONS`` list in ``scripts/release_ppa.sh`` and ``scripts/deps-ppa/static_z3.sh`` contains the most recent versions of Ubuntu.\n - [ ] Make sure the [``~ethereum/cpp-build-deps`` PPA repository](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/cpp-build-deps) contains ``libz3-static-dev`` builds for all current versions of Ubuntu.\n       Note that it may be included in the ``z3-static`` multipackage (follow the ``View package details`` link to check).\n       If not present, run ``scripts/deps-ppa/static_z3.sh`` and wait for the builds to succeed before continuing.\n - [ ] Run ``scripts/release_ppa.sh v$VERSION`` to create the PPA release.\n       This will create a single package containing static binary for older Ubuntu versions in the [``~ethereum/ethereum-static`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum-static)\n       and separate packages with dynamically-linked binaries for recent versions (those listed in ``DISTRIBUTIONS``) in the [``~ethereum/ethereum`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum).\n - [ ] Wait for the build to be finished and published for *all architectures* (currently we only build for ``amd64``, but we may add ``arm`` in the future).\n       **SERIOUSLY: DO NOT PROCEED EARLIER!!!**\n - [ ] *After* the package with the static build is *published*, use it to create packages for older Ubuntu versions.\n       Copy the static package to the [``~ethereum/ethereum`` PPA](https://launchpad.net/~ethereum/+archive/ubuntu/ethereum)\n       for the destination series ``Trusty``, ``Xenial`` and ``Bionic`` while selecting ``Copy existing binaries``.\n\n### Release solc-js\n - [ ] Wait until solc-bin was properly deployed. You can test this via remix - a test run through remix is advisable anyway.\n - [ ] Increment the version number, create a pull request for that, merge it after tests succeeded.\n - [ ] Create a tag using ``git tag --annotate v$VERSION`` and push it with ``git push --tags``.\n - [ ] Wait for the CI runs on the tag itself.\n - [ ] Take the ``solc-x.y.z.tgz`` artifact from ``build-package`` run on the tagged commit in circle-ci.\n       Inspect the tarball to ensure that it contains an up-to-date compiler binary (``soljson.js``).\n - [ ] Run ``npm publish solc-x.y.z.tgz`` to publish the newly created tarball.\n\n### Post-release\n - [ ] Make sure the documentation for the new release has been published successfully.\n       Go to the [documentation status page at ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/solidity/) and verify that the new version is listed, works and is marked as default.\n - [ ] Remove \"still in progress\" warning from the [release notes](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases).\n - [ ] Merge the [blog posts](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-website/pulls) related to the release.\n - [ ] Create a commit to increase the version number on ``develop`` in ``CMakeLists.txt`` and add a new skeleton changelog entry.\n - [ ] Update the release information section [in the source of soliditylang.org](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity-website/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx).\n - [ ] Announce on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/solidity_lang), including links to the release and the blog post.\n - [ ] Announce on [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/@solidity/), including links to the release and the blog post.\n - [ ] Share the announcement on Reddit in [``/r/ethdev``](https://reddit.com/r/ethdev/), cross-posted to [``/r/ethereum``](https://reddit.com/r/ethereum/).\n - [ ] Share the announcement on the [Solidity forum](https://forum.soliditylang.org) in the ``Announcements`` category.\n - [ ] Share the announcement on [Project Updates](https://discord.com/channels/420394352083337236/798974456704925696)\n - [ ] Share the announcement on [`#solidity` channel on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ethereum_solidity:gitter.im)\n - [ ] Share the announcement on [`#solc-tooling`](https://matrix.to/#/#solc-tooling:matrix.org)\n - [ ] If anything went wrong this time, mention it in [Learning from Past Releases](https://notes.ethereum.org/@solidity/release-mistakes).\n - [ ] Lean back, wait for bug reports and repeat from step 1 :).\n"

          "content": "# PR Review Checklist\nThe Solidity compiler is a critical piece of infrastructure in the Ethereum ecosystem.\nFor this reason, our review process is quite strict and all PRs have to fulfill certain quality\nexpectations and guidelines.\nThe list below is meant to reduce the workload on the core team by helping contributors self-identify\nand solve common issues before they are pointed out in the review.\nIt is also meant to serve as a final checklist for reviewers to go through before approving a PR.\n\n## Before You Submit a PR\n- [ ] **Do you have any other open PRs?**\n    Work on a PR is not done until it is merged or closed.\n    Our reviewing capacity is limited, so we require that external contributors work on **no more than one PR at a time**.\n    - If your PR is not getting reviewed, feel free to bring it to our attention on the [#solidity-dev](https://gitter.im/ethereum/solidity-dev) channel.\n    - Unless they were requested, we are going to close any excess PRs, leaving only the earliest one open.\n        You may reopen them, one at a time, when your current PR is done.\n- [ ] **Is the issue ready to be worked on?**\n    - If the issue does not have a desirability label (`nice to have`, `should have`,\n        `must have eventually`, `must have`, `roadmap`) we have not yet decided whether to implement it.\n    - If the issue has the `needs design` label, we have not yet decided how it should be implemented.\n    - `good first issue candidate` means that the issue will potentially be a `good first issue`\n        eventually but at the moment it is not yet ready to be worked on.\n- [ ] **Is this a breaking change?** Breaking changes should be based on the `breaking` branch rather than on the `develop` branch.\n- [ ] **Does the PR actually address the issue?**\n    - [ ] Mention the issue number in the PR description.\n        If the PR solves it completely, use the `Fixes #<issue number>` form so that Github will close the issue automatically.\n    - [ ] Do not include the issue number in the PR title, branch name or commit description.\n- [ ] When submitting a PR from a fork **create a branch and give it a descriptive name.**\n    E.g. `fix-array-abi-encoding-bug`.\n    Do not submit PRs directly from the `develop` branch of your fork since it makes rebasing and fetching new changes harder.\n- [ ] **Does the PR depend on other PRs?**\n    - [ ] If the PR has dependencies, mention them in bold in the description.\n    - [ ] Avoid basing PRs from forks on branches other than `develop` or `breaking` because\n        GitHub closes them when the base branch gets merged.\n        Do this only for PRs created directly in the main repo.\n- [ ] **Does the PR update test expectations to match the modified code?** If not, your PR will not pass some of the `_soltest_`,  jobs in CI.\n    In many cases the expectations can be updated automatically:\n    - `cmdlineTests.sh --update` for command-line tests.\n    - `isoltest --enforce-gas-cost --accept-updates` for soltest-based tests.\n        - If your PR affects gas costs, an extra run of `isoltest --enforce-gas-cost --optimize --accept-updates` is needed to update gas expectations with optimizer enabled.\n    - Review updated files before committing them.\n        **Are expectations correct and do updated tests still serve their purpose?**\n\n## Abandoned PRs\n- [ ] **Is the submitter still responsive?**\n    - If the PR had no activity from the submitter in the last 2 weeks (despite receiving reviews and our prompts) we consider it abandoned.\n- [ ] **Is the abandoned PR easy to finish or relevant?**\n    - Apply the `takeover` label if the PR can be finished without significant effort or is something that actually needs to be done right now.\n        Otherwise close it.\n        It can still be taken over later or reopened by the submitter but until then we should not be getting sidetracked by it.\n\n## Light Review\nBefore an in-depth review, it is recommended to give new PRs a quick, superficial review, which\nis not meant to provide complete and detailed feedback, but instead give the submitter a rough idea\nif the PR is even on the right track and let them solve the obvious problems on their own.\n\nLight review should focus on the following three areas:\n- [ ] **Are there any obvious mistakes?** Style issues, bad practices, easy to identify bugs, etc.\n- [ ] **Is there anything missing?** Tests (of the right kind), documentation, etc. Does it address the whole issue?\n- [ ] **Is it the right solution?** Are there better ways to do this? Is the change even necessary?\n\nIf the answers above are \"Yes, Yes, No\", thank the contributor for their effort and **close the PR**.\n\n## Coding Style and Good Practices\n- [ ] Does the PR follow our [coding style](CODING_STYLE.md)?\n\n### Reliability\n- [ ] **Use assertions liberally.** If you are certain your assumption will not be broken, prove it with `solAssert()`.\n- [ ] **Validate inputs and handle errors**. Note that assertions are **not** validation.\n\n### Readability\n- [ ] **Choose good names.**\n    - [ ] Is the name straightforward to understand?\n        Do you feel the need to jump back to the definition and remind yourself what it was whenever you see it?\n    - [ ] Is the name unambiguous in the context where it is used?\n    - [ ] Avoid abbreviations.\n- [ ] **Source files, classes and public functions should have docstrings.**\n- [ ] **Avoid code duplication.** But not fanatically. Minimal amounts of duplication are acceptable if it aids readability.\n- [ ] **Do not leave dead or commented-out code behind.** You can still see old code in history.\n      If you really have a good reason to do it, always leave a comment explaining what it is and why it is there.\n- [ ] **Mark hacks as such.** If you have to leave behind a temporary workaround, make\n    sure to include a comment that explains why and in what circumstances it can be removed.\n    Preferably link to an issue you reported upstream.\n- [ ] **Avoid obvious comments.**\n- [ ] **Do include comments when the reader may need extra context to understand the code.**\n\n### Commits and PRs\n- [ ] **Avoid hiding functional changes inside refactors.**\n    E.g. when fixing a small bug, or changing user-visible behavior, put the change in a separate commit.\n    Do not mix it with another change that renames things or reformats the code around, making the fix itself hard to identify.\n- [ ] **Whenever possible, split off refactors or unrelated changes into separate PRs.**\n    Smaller PRs are easier and quicker to review.\n    Splitting off refactors helps focus on the main point of the PR.\n\n### Common Pitfalls\nThe following points are all covered by the coding style but come up so often that it is worth singling them out here:\n- [ ] **Always initialize value types in the definition,** even if you are sure you will assign them later.\n- [ ] **Use \"east const\" style.** I.e. `T const*`, not `const T *`.\n- [ ] **Keep indentation consistent.** See our [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig).\n    - [ ] Tabs for C++. But use them for indentation only. Any whitespace later on the line must consist of spaces.\n    - [ ] 4 spaces for most other file types.\n- [ ] **Use `auto` sparingly.** Only use it when the actual type is very long and complicated or when it is\n    already used elsewhere in the same expression.\n- [ ] **Indent braces and parentheses in a way that makes nesting clear.**\n- [ ] **Use `using namespace` only in `.cpp` files.** Use it for `std` and our own modules.\n    Avoid unnecessary `std::` prefix in `.cpp` files (except for `std::move` and `std::forward`).\n- [ ] **Use range-based loops and destructuring.**\n- [ ] **Include any headers you use directly,** even if they are implicitly included through other headers.\n\n## Documentation\n- [ ] **Does the PR update relevant documentation?**\n\n### Documentation Style and Good Practices\n- [ ] **Use double backticks in RST (``` ``x`` ```). Prefer single backticks in Markdown (`` `x` ``),**\n    but note that double backticks are valid too and we use them in some cases for legacy reasons.\n- [ ] **Always start a new sentence on a new line.**\n    This way you do not have to rewrap the surrounding text when you rewrite the sentence.\n    This also makes changes actually easier to spot in the diff.\n\n## Testing\n\n### What to Test\n- [ ] **Is newly added code adequately covered by tests?** Have you considered all the important corner cases?\n- If it is a bugfix:\n    - [ ] **The PR must include tests that reproduce the bug.**\n    - [ ] **Are there gaps in test coverage of the buggy feature?** Fill them by adding more tests.\n    - [ ] **Try to break it.** Can you think of any similar features that could also be buggy?\n        Play with the repro and include prominent variants as separate test cases, even if they don't trigger a bug.\n- [ ] **Positive cases (code that compiles) should have a semantic test.**\n- [ ] **Negative cases (code with compilation errors) should have a syntax test.**\n- [ ] **Avoid mixing positive and negative cases in the same syntax test.**\n    If the test produces an error, we stop at the analysis stage and we will not detect\n    problems that only occur in code generation, optimizer or assembler.\n    - [ ] If you have to do it, at least mark positive cases inside the file with a short comment.\n        - This way, when the test is updated, it is easier to verify that these cases still do not trigger an error.\n- [ ] New syntax: **does it have an [`ASTJSON`](test/libsolidity/ASTJSON/) test?**\n- [ ] New CLI or StandardJSON option:\n    - [ ] **Does it have a [command-line test](test/cmdlineTests/)?**\n    - [ ] **Is the option listed for every input mode in [`CommandLineParser` tests](test/solc/CommandLineParser.cpp)?**\n- [ ] **Did you consider interactions with other language features?**\n    - [ ] Are all types covered? Structs? Enums? Contracts/libraries/interfaces? User-defined value types?\n        Value types: integers, fixed bytes, `address`, `address payable`, `bool`? Function pointers?\n        Static and dynamic arrays? `string` and `bytes`? Mappings?\n        Values of types that cannot be named: literals, tuples, array slices, storage references?\n    - [ ] If it accepts a function, does it also accept an event or an error? These have function types but are not functions.\n    - [ ] If it affects free functions, what about internal library functions?\n    - [ ] Attached library functions? Functions attached with `using for`?\n    - [ ] Possible combinations of `storage`, `memory`, `calldata`, `immutable`, `constant`?\n        Remember that internal functions can take `storage` arguments.\n    - [ ] Does it work at construction time as well? What if you store it at construction time and read after deployment?\n    - [ ] What about importing it from a different module or inheriting it?\n    - [ ] Have you tested it with the ternary operator?\n\n### Test Style and Good Practices\n- [ ] **Make test case file names long and specific enough** so that it is easy to guess what is inside.\n    When checking if we have the case already covered the name is usually the only clue we see.\n    - [ ] Place them in the right subdirectory.\n    - [ ] **Avoid simply appending numbers to the name to distinguish similar cases.**\n        Coming up with good names is hard but figuring out if any of hundreds of tests with names that\n        match your search actually fits your case is even harder.\n- [ ] **Do not include version pragma and the SPDX comment in semantic and syntax test cases**.\n    In other test types include them if necessary to suppress warnings.\n- [ ] **If you have to use a version pragma, avoid hard-coding version.** Use `pragma solidity *`.\n- [ ] **When writing StandardJSON command-line tests, use `urls` instead of `content`** and put\n    the Solidity or Yul code in a separate file.\n\n## Compiler-specific\n- [ ] **Are error messages sensible and understandable to users?**\n- [ ] **Are error codes consistent?**\n    - [ ] Avoid randomly changing or reassigning error codes.\n    - [ ] Avoid defining separate codes for trivial variants of the same issue.\n        Make it easy for tools to consistently refer to the same error with the same code.\n- [ ] **Error messages should end with a full stop.**\n- [ ] **Prefer Ranges v3 to Boost where possible.**\n\n## Take a Step Back\n- [ ] **Do you fully understand what the PR does and why?**\n- [ ] **Are you confident that the code works and does not break unrelated functionality?**\n- [ ] **Is this a reasonable way to achieve the goal stated in the issue?**\n- [ ] **Is the code simple?** Does the PR achieve its objective at the cost of significant\n    complexity that may be a source of future bugs?\n- [ ] **Is the code efficient?** Does the PR introduce any major performance bottlenecks?\n- [ ] **Does the PR introduce any breaking changes beyond what was agreed in the issue?**\n\n## Final Checks Before Merging\n- [ ] **Is the PR rebased on top of the `develop` branch** (or `breaking` if it is a breaking change)?\n- [ ] **Did all CI checks pass?**\n    - Note that we have a few jobs that tend to randomly fail due to outside factors, especially external tests (with `_ext_` in the name).\n        If these fail, rebase on latest `develop` (or `breaking`) and try rerunning them.\n        Note also that not all of these checks are required for the PR to be merged.\n- [ ] If the change is visible to users, **does the PR have a [changelog](Changelog.md) entry?**\n    - [ ] Is the changelog entry in the right section?\n        Make sure to move it up if there was a release recently.\n- [ ] **Is commit history simple and understandable?**\n    - [ ] Each commit should be a self-contained, logical step leading the goal of the PR, without going back and forth.\n        In particular, review fixups should be squashed into the commits they fix.\n    - [ ] Do not include any merge commits in your branch. Please use rebase to keep up to date with the base branch.\n- [ ] **Is the PR properly labeled?**\n    - Use `external contribution` label to mark PRs not coming from the core team.\n    - If the PR depends on other PRs, use `has dependencies` and set the base branch accordingly.\n    - Labels like `documentation` or `optimizer` are helpful for filtering PRs.\n"
