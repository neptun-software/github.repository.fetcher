Catch2 now behaves as a normal\nlibrary, with multiple headers and separately compiled implementation.\n\nThe documentation is slowly being updated to take these changes into\naccount, but this work is currently still ongoing.\n\nFor migrating from the v2 releases to v3, you should look at [our\ndocumentation](docs/migrate-v2-to-v3.md#top). It provides a simple\nguidelines on getting started, and collects most common migration\nproblems.\n\nFor the previous major version of Catch2 [look into the `v2.x` branch\nhere on GitHub](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x).\n\n\n## How to use it\nThis documentation comprises these three parts:\n\n* [Why do we need yet another C++ Test Framework?](docs/why-catch.md#top)\n* [Tutorial](docs/tutorial.md#top) - getting started\n* [Reference section](docs/Readme.md#top) - all the details\n\n\n## More\n* Issues and bugs can be raised on the [Issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/issues)\n* For discussion or questions please use [our Discord](https://discord.gg/4CWS9zD)\n* See who else is using Catch2 in [Open Source Software](docs/opensource-users.md#top)\nor [commercially](docs/commercial-users.md#top).\n"
