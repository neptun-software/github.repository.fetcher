It supports all major platforms allowing games to be quickly released for the web, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, and various mini-game platforms. Millions of developers have built 2D / 3D experiences, from hardcore games to web instant entertainment. A pure JavaScript-developed engine runtime is available on the web and mini-game platforms for better performance and smaller packages. On other native platforms, C++ is used to implement the underlying framework, providing greater operational efficiency. The engine is completely [open source][13], and retains the advantages of Cocos2d-x which includes high performance, customizability, ease for debugging, easy to learn, and small package size.\n\nTherefore, we no longer recommend new users to start with Cocos2d-x. Instead, please use the brand-new [Cocos Creator][12] for project development to enjoy the best editor and 3D support.\n\n[1]: https://www.cocos.com/en/cocos2d-x \"cocos2d-x\"\n[4]: https://cocos2d-x.org/download/version#Cocos2d-x\n[5]: http://www.box2d.org \"Box2D\"\n[6]: http://www.chipmunk-physics.net \"Chipmunk2D\"\n[7]: http://esotericsoftware.com/ \"http://esotericsoftware.com/\"\n[8]: https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/blob/v3/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[9]: https://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/c/cocos2d-x/21\n[10]: https://forum.cocos.org/c/cocos2d-x/16\n[12]: https://www.cocos.com/en/creator\n[13]: https://github.com/cocos/cocos-engine\n"

So we will add environment variable in the same sequence.\nWhich means that\n* add environment variables into ~/.bash_profile if it exists\n* otherwise it will the add environment variables into ~/.bash_login if it exists\n* otherwise it will the add environment variables into ~/.profile if it exists\n\nWill create ~/.bash_profile when none of them exist, and add environment variables into it.\n'''\n\nimport os\nimport sys\nimport fileinput\nimport shutil\nimport subprocess\nfrom optparse import OptionParser\n\nCOCOS_CONSOLE_ROOT = 'COCOS_CONSOLE_ROOT'\nCOCOS_X_ROOT = 'COCOS_X_ROOT'\nCOCOS_TEMPLATES_ROOT = 'COCOS_TEMPLATES_ROOT'\nNDK_ROOT = 'NDK_ROOT'\nANDROID_SDK_ROOT = 'ANDROID_SDK_ROOT'\n\n\ndef _check_python_version():\n    major_ver = sys.version_info[0]\n    if major_ver > 2:\n        print (\"The python version is %d.%d.
