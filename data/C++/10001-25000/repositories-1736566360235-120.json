          "content": "# Contributing\n\n**Drogon** is an open source project at its heart and every contribution is\nwelcome. By participating in this project you agree to stick to common sense and\ncontribute in an overall positive way.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. Fork, then clone the repository: `git clone\n   git@github.com:your-username/drogon.git`\n1. Follow the [official installation steps on\n   Github](https://drogonframework.github.io/drogon-docs/#/ENG-02-Installation). It’s best to\n   make sure to have the `drogon_ctl` executable in your shell’s `PATH`\n   environment variable in case you use a terminal.\n\nNow you can create branches, start adding features & bugfixes to the code, and\n[create pull requests](https://github.com/an-tao/drogon/compare).\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nFeel free to [create a pull request](https://github.com/an-tao/drogon/compare)\nif you think you can contribute to the project. You will be listed as a\n[contributor](https://github.com/an-tao/drogon/graphs/contributors), agree to\nthis document, and the\n[LICENSE](https://github.com/an-tao/drogon/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\nThere are also some recommendations you can follow. These aren’t requirements,\nbut they will make the development more straightforward:\n\n1. If you are unsure about a specific change, have questions, or want to get\n   feedback about a feature you want to introduce, [open a new\n   issue](https://github.com/an-tao/drogon/issues) (please make sure that there\n   is no previous issue about a similar topic).\n1. You should branch off the current state of the `master` branch, and also\n   merge it into your local branch before creating a pull request if there were\n   other changes introduced in the meantime.\n1. You can use the following branch names to make your intent clearer:\n    * `bugfix/123-fix-template-parser` when you want to fix a bug in the\n      template parser.\n    * `feature/123-add-l10n-and-i18n` if you want to add localization (l10n) and\n      internationalization (i18n) as a new feature to the project.\n    * If there’s no open issue and no need to open one you can skip the number,\n      and just use the descriptive part: `bugfix/fix-typo-in-docs`.\n1. Write a brief, but good, and descriptive commit message / pull request title in English,\n   e. g. “Added Internationalization and Localization”.\n\nIf you follow these recommendations your pull request will have more success:\n\n1. Keep the style consistent to the project, when in doubt refer to the [Google\n   C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#C++_Version).\n1. Please write all comments in English. Comments for new public API introduced by\n   your pull request must be added and written in [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) format.\n1. Format the code with `clang-format` (>= 8.0.0). The configuration is already\n   provided in the `.clang-format` file, just run the `./format.sh` script\n   before submitting your pull request.\n1. Install [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest), and write a test\n   case.\n    1. In case it is a bugfix, it’s best to write a test that breaks in the old\n       version, but works in the new one. This way regressions can be tracked\n       over time.\n    1. If you add a feature, it is best to write the test as if it would be an\n       example how to use the newly introduced feature and to test all major,\n       newly introduced code.\n\n## Project Maintainers & Collaborators\n\nIn addition to the guidelines mentioned above, collaborators with write access\nto the repository should also follow these guidelines:\n\n1. If there are new tests as part of the pull request, you should make sure that\n   they succeed.\n1. When merging **Pull Requests** you should use the option *Squash & Merge* and\n   chose a descriptive commit message for the bugfix / feature (if not already\n   done by the individual contributor).\n\n    This way the history in the `master` branch will be free of small\n    corrections and easier to follow for people who aren’t engaged in the\n    project on a day-to-day basis.\n"

Drogon can be used to easily build various types of web application server programs using C++. **Drogon** is the name of a dragon from the American TV series *Game of Thrones*, which I really enjoy.\n\nDrogon is a cross-platform framework, It supports Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, HaikuOS, and Windows. Its main features are as follows:\n\n* Use a non-blocking I/O network lib based on epoll (kqueue under macOS/FreeBSD) to provide high-concurrency, high-performance network IO, please visit the [TFB Tests Results](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19&hw=ph&test=composite) for more details;\n* Provide a completely asynchronous programming mode;\n* Support Http1.0/1.1 (server side and client side);\n* Based on template, a simple reflection mechanism is implemented to completely decouple the main program framework, controllers and views.\n* Support cookies and built-in sessions;\n* Support back-end rendering, the controller generates the data to the view to generate the Html page. Views are described by CSP template files, C++ codes are embedded into Html pages through CSP tags. And the drogon command-line tool automatically generates the C++ code files for compilation;\n* Support view page dynamic loading (dynamic compilation and loading at runtime);\n* Provide a convenient and flexible routing solution from the path to the controller handler;\n* Support filter chains to facilitate the execution of unified logic (such as login verification, Http Method constraint verification, etc.) before handling HTTP requests;\n* Support https (based on OpenSSL);\n* Support WebSocket (server side and client side);\n* Support JSON format request and response, very friendly to the Restful API application development;\n* Support file download and upload;\n* Support gzip, brotli compression transmission;\n* Support pipelining;\n* Provide a lightweight command line tool, drogon_ctl, to simplify the creation of various classes in Drogon and the generation of view code;\n* Support non-blocking I/O based asynchronously reading and writing database (PostgreSQL and MySQL(MariaDB) database);\n* Support asynchronously reading and writing sqlite3 database based on thread pool;\n* Support Redis with asynchronous reading and writing;\n* Support ARM Architecture;\n* Provide a convenient lightweight ORM implementation that supports for regular object-to-database bidirectional mapping;\n* Support plugins which can be installed by the configuration file at load time;\n* Support AOP with built-in joinpoints.\n* Support C++ coroutines\n\n## A very simple example\n\nUnlike most C++ frameworks, the main program of the drogon application can be kept clean and simple. Drogon uses a few tricks to decouple controllers from the main program. The routing settings of controllers can be done through macros or configuration file.\n\nBelow is the main program of a typical drogon application:\n\n```c++\n#include <drogon/drogon.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nint main()\n{\n    app().setLogPath(\"./\")\n         .setLogLevel(trantor::Logger::kWarn)\n         .addListener(\"0.0.0.0\", 80)\n         .setThreadNum(16)\n         .enableRunAsDaemon()\n         .run();\n}\n```\n\nIt can be further simplified by using configuration file as follows:\n\n```c++\n#include <drogon/drogon.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nint main()\n{\n    app().loadConfigFile(\"./config.json\").run();\n}\n```\n\nDrogon provides some interfaces for adding controller logic directly in the main() function, for example, user can register a handler like this in Drogon:\n\n```c++\napp().registerHandler(\"/test?username={name}\",\n                    [](const HttpRequestPtr& req,\n                       std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback,\n                       const std::string &name)\n                    {\n                        Json::Value json;\n                        json[\"result\"]=\"ok\";\n                        json[\"message\"]=std::string(\"hello,\")+name;\n                        auto resp=HttpResponse::newHttpJsonResponse(json);\n                        callback(resp);\n                    },\n                    {Get,\"LoginFilter\"});\n```\n\nWhile such interfaces look intuitive, they are not suitable for complex business logic scenarios. Assuming there are tens or even hundreds of handlers that need to be registered in the framework, isn't it a better practice to implement them separately in their respective classes? So unless your logic is very simple, we don't recommend using above interfaces. Instead, we can create an HttpSimpleController as follows:\n\n```c++\n/// The TestCtrl.h file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpSimpleController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nclass TestCtrl:public drogon::HttpSimpleController<TestCtrl>\n{\npublic:\n    void asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr& req, std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback) override;\n    PATH_LIST_BEGIN\n    PATH_ADD(\"/test\",Get);\n    PATH_LIST_END\n};\n\n/// The TestCtrl.cc file\n#include \"TestCtrl.h\"\nvoid TestCtrl::asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr& req,\n                                      std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback)\n{\n    //write your application logic here\n    auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpResponse();\n    resp->setBody(\"<p>Hello, world!</p>\");\n    resp->setExpiredTime(0);\n    callback(resp);\n}\n```\n\n**Most of the above programs can be automatically generated by the command line tool `drogon_ctl` provided by drogon** (The command is `drogon_ctl create controller TestCtrl`). All the user needs to do is add their own business logic. In the example, the controller returns a `Hello, world!` string when the client accesses the `http://ip/test` URL.\n\nFor JSON format response, we create the controller as follows:\n\n```c++\n/// The header file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpSimpleController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nclass JsonCtrl : public drogon::HttpSimpleController<JsonCtrl>\n{\n  public:\n    void asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback) override;\n    PATH_LIST_BEGIN\n    //list path definitions here;\n    PATH_ADD(\"/json\", Get);\n    PATH_LIST_END\n};\n\n/// The source file\n#include \"JsonCtrl.h\"\nvoid JsonCtrl::asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr &req,\n                                      std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback)\n{\n    Json::Value ret;\n    ret[\"message\"] = \"Hello, World!\";\n    auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpJsonResponse(ret);\n    callback(resp);\n}\n```\n\nLet's go a step further and create a demo RESTful API with the HttpController class, as shown below (Omit the source file):\n\n```c++\n/// The header file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nnamespace api\n{\nnamespace v1\n{\nclass User : public drogon::HttpController<User>\n{\n  public:\n    METHOD_LIST_BEGIN\n    //use METHOD_ADD to add your custom processing function here;\n    METHOD_ADD(User::getInfo, \"/{id}\", Get);                  //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}\n    METHOD_ADD(User::getDetailInfo, \"/{id}/detailinfo\", Get);  //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}/detailinfo\n    METHOD_ADD(User::newUser, \"/{name}\", Post);                 //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}\n    METHOD_LIST_END\n    //your declaration of processing function maybe like this:\n    void getInfo(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, int userId) const;\n    void getDetailInfo(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, int userId) const;\n    void newUser(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, std::string &&userName);\n  public:\n    User()\n    {\n        LOG_DEBUG << \"User constructor!\";\n    }\n};\n} // namespace v1\n} // namespace api\n```\n\nAs you can see, users can use the `HttpController` to map paths and parameters at the same time. This is a very convenient way to create a RESTful API application.\n\nIn addition, you can also find that all handler interfaces are in asynchronous mode, where the response is returned by a callback object. This design is for performance reasons because in asynchronous mode the drogon application can handle a large number of concurrent requests with a small number of threads.\n\nAfter compiling all of the above source files, we get a very simple web application. This is a good start. **For more information, please visit the [documentation](https://drogonframework.github.io/drogon-docs/#/) on GitHub**.\n\n## Cross-compilation\n\nDrogon supports cross-compilation, you should define the `CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME` in toolchain file, for example:\n    \n```cmake\nset(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)\nset(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)\n```\n\nYou can disable building options for examples and drogon_ctl by settings `BUILD_EXAMPLES` and `BUILD_CTL` to `OFF` in the toolchain file.\n\n## Building options\n\nDrogon provides some building options, you can enable or disable them by setting the corresponding variables to `ON` or `OFF` in the cmake command line, cmake file etc...\n\n| Option name | Description | Default value |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| BUILD_CTL | Build drogon_ctl | ON |\n| BUILD_EXAMPLES | Build examples | ON |\n| BUILD_ORM | Build orm | ON |\n| COZ_PROFILING | Use coz for profiling | OFF |\n| BUILD_SHARED_LIBS | Build drogon as a shared lib | OFF |\n| BUILD_DOC | Build Doxygen documentation | OFF |\n| BUILD_BROTLI | Build Brotli | ON |\n| BUILD_YAML_CONFIG | Build yaml config | ON |\n| USE_SUBMODULE | Use trantor as a submodule | ON |\n\n\n## Contributions\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute code. \n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/drogonframework/drogon/graphs/contributors\"><img src=\"https://contributors-svg.opencollective.com/drogon/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false\" alt=\"Code contributors\" /></a>\n\nEvery contribution is welcome.

[繁體中文](./README.zh-TW.md)\n\n**Drogon**是一个基于C++17/20的Http应用框架，使用Drogon可以方便的使用C++构建各种类型的Web应用服务端程序。\n本版本库是github上[Drogon工程](https://github.com/an-tao/drogon)的镜像库。**Drogon**是作者非常喜欢的美剧《权力的游戏》中的一条龙的名字(汉译作卓耿)，和龙有关但并不是dragon的误写，为了不至于引起不必要的误会这里说明一下。\n\nDrogon是一个跨平台框架，它支持Linux，也支持macOS、FreeBSD，OpenBSD，HaikuOS，和Windows。它的主要特点如下：\n\n* 网络层使用基于epoll(macOS/FreeBSD下是kqueue)的非阻塞IO框架，提供高并发、高性能的网络IO。详细请见[TFB Tests Results](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19&hw=ph&test=composite)；\n* 全异步编程模式；\n* 支持Http1.0/1.1(server端和client端)；\n* 基于template实现了简单的反射机制，使主程序框架、控制器(controller)和视图(view)完全解耦；\n* 支持cookies和内建的session；\n* 支持后端渲染，把控制器生成的数据交给视图生成Html页面，视图由CSP模板文件描述，通过CSP标签把C++代码嵌入到Html页面，由drogon的命令行工具在编译阶段自动生成C++代码并编译；\n* 支持运行期的视图页面动态加载(动态编译和加载so文件)；\n* 非常方便灵活的路径(path)到控制器处理函数(handler)的映射方案；\n* 支持过滤器(filter)链，方便在控制器之前执行统一的逻辑(如登录验证、Http Method约束验证等)；\n* 支持https(基于OpenSSL实现);\n* 支持websocket(server端和client端);\n* 支持Json格式请求和应答, 对Restful API应用开发非常友好;\n* 支持文件下载和上传,支持sendfile系统调用；\n* 支持gzip/brotli压缩传输；\n* 支持pipelining；\n* 提供一个轻量的命令行工具drogon_ctl，帮助简化各种类的创建和视图代码的生成过程；\n* 基于非阻塞IO实现的异步数据库读写，目前支持PostgreSQL和MySQL(MariaDB)数据库；\n* 基于线程池实现sqlite3数据库的异步读写，提供与上文数据库相同的接口；\n* 支持Redis异步读写；\n* 支持ARM架构；\n* 方便的轻量级ORM实现，支持常规的对象到数据库的双向映射操作；\n* 支持插件，可通过配置文件在加载期动态拆装；\n* 支持内建插入点的AOP\n* 支持C++协程\n\n## 一个非常简单的例子\n\n不像大多数C++框架那样，drogon的主程序可以保持非常简单。 Drogon使用了一些小技巧使主程序和控制器解耦合. 控制器的路由设置可以在控制器类中定义或者配置文件中完成.\n\n下面是一个典型的主程序的样子:\n\n```c++\n#include <drogon/drogon.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nint main()\n{\n    app().setLogPath(\"./\")\n         .setLogLevel(trantor::Logger::kWarn)\n         .addListener(\"0.0.0.0\", 80)\n         .setThreadNum(16)\n         .enableRunAsDaemon()\n         .run();\n}\n```\n\n如果使用配置文件，可以进一步简化成如下的样子:\n\n```c++\n#include <drogon/drogon.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nint main()\n{\n    app().loadConfigFile(\"./config.json\").run();\n}\n```\n\n当然，Drogon也提供了一些接口，使用户可以在main()函数中直接添加控制器逻辑，比如，用户可以注册一个lambda处理器到drogon框架中，如下所示：\n\n```c++\napp().registerHandler(\"/test?username={name}\",\n                    [](const HttpRequestPtr& req,\n                       std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback,\n                       const std::string &name)\n                    {\n                        Json::Value json;\n                        json[\"result\"]=\"ok\";\n                        json[\"message\"]=std::string(\"hello,\")+name;\n                        auto resp=HttpResponse::newHttpJsonResponse(json);\n                        callback(resp);\n                    },\n                    {Get,\"LoginFilter\"});\n```\n\n\n这看起来是很方便，但是这并不适用于复杂的应用，试想假如有数十个或者数百个处理函数要注册进框架，main()函数将膨胀到不可读的程度。显然，让每个包含处理函数的类在自己的定义中完成注册是更好的选择。所以，除非你的应用逻辑非常简单，我们不推荐使用上述接口，更好的实践是，我们可以创建一个HttpSimpleController对象，如下：\n\n\n```c++\n/// The TestCtrl.h file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpSimpleController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nclass TestCtrl:public drogon::HttpSimpleController<TestCtrl>\n{\npublic:\n    void asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr& req, std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback) override;\n    PATH_LIST_BEGIN\n    PATH_ADD(\"/test\",Get);\n    PATH_LIST_END\n};\n\n/// The TestCtrl.cc file\n#include \"TestCtrl.h\"\nvoid TestCtrl::asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr& req,\n                                      std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback)\n{\n    //write your application logic here\n    auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpResponse();\n    resp->setBody(\"<p>Hello, world!</p>\");\n    resp->setExpiredTime(0);\n    callback(resp);\n}\n```\n\n**上面程序的大部分代码都可以由`drogon_ctl`命令创建**（这个命令是`drogon_ctl create controller TestCtr`）。用户所需做的就是添加自己的业务逻辑。在这个例子中，当客户端访问URL`http://ip/test`时，控制器简单的返回了一个`Hello, world!`页面。\n\n对于JSON格式的响应，我们可以像下面这样创建控制器：\n\n```c++\n/// The header file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpSimpleController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nclass JsonCtrl : public drogon::HttpSimpleController<JsonCtrl>\n{\n  public:\n    void asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback) override;\n    PATH_LIST_BEGIN\n    //list path definitions here;\n    PATH_ADD(\"/json\", Get);\n    PATH_LIST_END\n};\n\n/// The source file\n#include \"JsonCtrl.h\"\nvoid JsonCtrl::asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr &req,\n                                      std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback)\n{\n    Json::Value ret;\n    ret[\"message\"] = \"Hello, World!\";\n    auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpJsonResponse(ret);\n    callback(resp);\n}\n```\n\n让我们更进一步，通过HttpController类创建一个RESTful API的例子，如下所示（忽略了实现文件）：\n\n```c++\n/// The header file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nnamespace api\n{\nnamespace v1\n{\nclass User : public drogon::HttpController<User>\n{\n  public:\n    METHOD_LIST_BEGIN\n    //use METHOD_ADD to add your custom processing function here;\n    METHOD_ADD(User::getInfo, \"/{id}\", Get);                  //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}\n    METHOD_ADD(User::getDetailInfo, \"/{id}/detailinfo\", Get);  //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}/detailinfo\n    METHOD_ADD(User::newUser, \"/{name}\", Post);                 //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}\n    METHOD_LIST_END\n    //your declaration of processing function maybe like this:\n    void getInfo(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, int userId) const;\n    void getDetailInfo(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, int userId) const;\n    void newUser(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, std::string &&userName);\n  public:\n    User()\n    {\n        LOG_DEBUG << \"User constructor!\";\n    }\n};\n} // namespace v1\n} // namespace api\n```\n\n如你所见，通过`HttpController`类，用户可以同时映射路径和路径参数，这对RESTful API应用来说非常方便。\n\n另外，你可以发现前面所有的处理函数接口都是异步的，处理器的响应是通过回调对象返回的。这种设计是出于对高性能的考虑，因为在异步模式下，可以使用少量的线程（比如和处理器核心数相等的线程）处理大量的并发请求。\n\n编译上述的所有源文件后，我们得到了一个非常简单的web应用程序，这是一个不错的开始。**请访问GitHub上的[文档](https://drogonframework.github.io/drogon-docs/#/CHN/CHN-01-%E6%A6%82%E8%BF%B0)**\n\n##

繁體中文\n\n**Drogon**是一個基於C++17/20的Http應用框架，使用Drogon可以方便的使用C++構建各種類型的Web App伺服器程式。\n本版本庫是github上[Drogon](https://github.com/an-tao/drogon)的鏡像庫。 **Drogon**是作者非常喜歡的美劇《冰與火之歌：權力遊戲》中的一條龍的名字(漢譯作卓耿)，和龍有關但並不是dragon的誤寫，為了不至於引起不必要的誤會這裡說明一下。\n\nDrogon是一個跨平台框架，它支援Linux，也支援macOS、FreeBSD/OpenBSD、HaikuOS和Windows。它的主要特點如下：\n\n* 網路層使用基於epoll(macOS/FreeBSD下是kqueue)的非阻塞IO框架，提供高並發、高性能的網路IO。詳細請見[TFB Tests Results](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r19&hw=ph&test=composite)；\n* 全異步程式設計；\n* 支援Http1.0/1.1(server端和client端)；\n* 基於模板(template)實現了簡單的反射機制，使主程式框架、控制器(controller)和視圖(view)完全去耦；\n* 支援cookies和內建的session；\n* 支援後端渲染，把控制器生成的數據交給視圖生成Html頁面，視圖由CSP模板文件描述，通過CSP標籤把C++程式碼嵌入到Html頁面，由drogon的指令列工具在編譯階段自動生成C++程式碼並編譯；\n* 支援運行期的視圖頁面動態加載(動態編譯和載入so文件)；\n* 非常方便靈活的路徑(path)到控制器處理函數(handler)的映射方案；\n* 支援過濾器(filter)鏈，方便在控制器之前執行統一的邏輯(如登錄驗證、Http Method約束驗證等)；\n* 支援https(基於OpenSSL);\n* 支援websocket(server端和client端);\n* 支援Json格式的請求和回應, 方便開發Restful API;\n* 支援文件下載和上傳,支援sendfile系統呼叫；\n* 支援gzip/brotli壓縮傳輸；\n* 支援pipelining；\n* 提供一個輕量的指令列工具drogon_ctl，幫助簡化各種類的創造和視圖程式碼的生成過程；\n* 非同步的讀寫資料庫，目前支援PostgreSQL和MySQL(MariaDB)資料庫；\n* 支援異步讀寫Redis;\n* 基於執行序池實現sqlite3資料庫的異步讀寫，提供與上文資料庫相同的接口；\n* 支援ARM架構；\n* 方便的輕量級ORM實現，一般物件到資料庫的雙向映射；\n* 支援外掛，可通過設定文件在載入時動態載入；\n* 支援內建插入點的AOP\n* 支援C++ coroutine\n\n## 一個非常簡單的例子\n\n不像大多數C++框架那樣，drogon的主程式可以非常簡單。 Drogon使用了一些小技巧使主程式和控制器去耦. 控制器的路由設定可以在控制器類別中定義或者設定文件中完成.\n\n下面是一個典型的主程式的樣子:\n\n```c++\n#include <drogon/drogon.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nint main()\n{\n    app().setLogPath(\"./\")\n         .setLogLevel(trantor::Logger::kWarn)\n         .addListener(\"0.0.0.0\", 80)\n         .setThreadNum(16)\n         .enableRunAsDaemon()\n         .run();\n}\n```\n\n如果使用設定文件，可以進一步簡化成這樣:\n\n```c++\n#include <drogon/drogon.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nint main()\n{\n    app().loadConfigFile(\"./config.json\").run();\n}\n```\n\n當然，Drogon也提供了一些函數，使使用者可以在main()函數中直接添​​加控制器邏輯，比如，使用者可以註冊一個lambda處理器到drogon框架中，如下所示：\n\n```c++\napp().registerHandler(\"/test?username={name}\",\n                    [](const HttpRequestPtr& req,\n                       std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback,\n                       const std::string &name)\n                    {\n                        Json::Value json;\n                        json[\"result\"]=\"ok\";\n                        json[\"message\"]=std::string(\"hello,\")+name;\n                        auto resp=HttpResponse::newHttpJsonResponse(json);\n                        callback(resp);\n                    },\n                    {Get,\"LoginFilter\"});\n```\n\n\n這看起來是很方便，但是這並不適用於復雜的場景，試想假如有數十個或者數百個處理函數要註冊進框架，main()函數將膨脹到不可讀的程度。顯然，讓每個包含處理函數的類在自己的定義中完成註冊是更好的選擇。所以，除非你的應用邏輯非常簡單，我們不推薦使用上述接口，更好的實踐是，我們可以創造一個HttpSimpleController類別，如下：\n\n\n```c++\n/// The TestCtrl.h file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpSimpleController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nclass TestCtrl:public drogon::HttpSimpleController<TestCtrl>\n{\npublic:\n    void asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr& req, std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback) override;\n    PATH_LIST_BEGIN\n    PATH_ADD(\"/test\",Get);\n    PATH_LIST_END\n};\n\n/// The TestCtrl.cc file\n#include \"TestCtrl.h\"\nvoid TestCtrl::asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr& req,\n                                      std::function<void (const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback)\n{\n    //write your application logic here\n    auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpResponse();\n    resp->setBody(\"<p>Hello, world!</p>\");\n    resp->setExpiredTime(0);\n    callback(resp);\n}\n```\n\n**上面程式的大部分程式碼都可以由`drogon_ctl`指令創造**（這個指令是`drogon_ctl create controller TestCtr`）。使用者所需做的就是添加自己的業務邏輯。在這個例子中，當客戶端訪問URL`http://ip/test`時，控制器簡單的回傳了一個`Hello, world!`頁面。\n\n對於JSON格式的回應，我們可以像下面這樣創造控制器：\n\n```c++\n/// The header file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpSimpleController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nclass JsonCtrl : public drogon::HttpSimpleController<JsonCtrl>\n{\n  public:\n    void asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback) override;\n    PATH_LIST_BEGIN\n    //list path definitions here;\n    PATH_ADD(\"/json\", Get);\n    PATH_LIST_END\n};\n\n/// The source file\n#include \"JsonCtrl.h\"\nvoid JsonCtrl::asyncHandleHttpRequest(const HttpRequestPtr &req,\n                                      std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback)\n{\n    Json::Value ret;\n    ret[\"message\"] = \"Hello, World!\";\n    auto resp = HttpResponse::newHttpJsonResponse(ret);\n    callback(resp);\n}\n```\n\n讓我們更進一步，通過HttpController類別創造一個RESTful API的例子，如下所示（忽略了實做文件）：\n\n```c++\n/// The header file\n#pragma once\n#include <drogon/HttpController.h>\nusing namespace drogon;\nnamespace api\n{\nnamespace v1\n{\nclass User : public drogon::HttpController<User>\n{\n  public:\n    METHOD_LIST_BEGIN\n    //use METHOD_ADD to add your custom processing function here;\n    METHOD_ADD(User::getInfo, \"/{id}\", Get);                  //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}\n    METHOD_ADD(User::getDetailInfo, \"/{id}/detailinfo\", Get);  //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}/detailinfo\n    METHOD_ADD(User::newUser, \"/{name}\", Post);                 //path is /api/v1/User/{arg1}\n    METHOD_LIST_END\n    //your declaration of processing function maybe like this:\n    void getInfo(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, int userId) const;\n    void getDetailInfo(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, int userId) const;\n    void newUser(const HttpRequestPtr &req, std::function<void(const HttpResponsePtr &)> &&callback, std::string &&userName);\n  public:\n    User()\n    {\n        LOG_DEBUG << \"User constructor!\";\n    }\n};\n} // namespace v1\n} // namespace api\n```\n\n如你所見，通過`HttpController`類別，使用者可以同時映射路徑和路徑參數，這對RESTful API應用來說非常方便。\n\n另外，你可以發現前面所有的處理函數接口都是異步的，處理器的回應是通過回調對象回傳的。這種設計是出於對高性能的考慮，因為在異步模式下，可以使用少量的執行序（比如和處理器核心數相等的執行序）處理大量的並發請求。\n\n編譯上述的所有源文件後，我們得到了一個非常簡單的web應用程式，這是一個不錯的開始。
