          "content": "1 Notes on the Free Translation Project\n***************************************\n\nFree software is going international!  The Free Translation Project is\na way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all\ntogether, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many\nlanguages.  A few packages already provide translations for their\nmessages.\n\n   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may\nassume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,\nitself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_\nneed to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using\nthis package with messages translated.\n\n   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also\nexplain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the\navailable translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and\nwork on translations can contact the appropriate team.\n\n   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be\nrelated to internationalization, you should tell about the version of\n`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the\n`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.\n\n1.1 Quick configuration advice\n==============================\n\nIf you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you\nshould configure it using\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n\nto force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this\npackage, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the\noperating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only\nthe `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as\nmany features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic\ncharset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.\nIt is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top\nof a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will\nvery likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea\nto change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.\n\n   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or\nyou have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the\nincluded `libintl'.\n\n1.2 INSTALL Matters\n===================\n\nSome packages are \"localizable\" when properly installed; the programs\nthey contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such\npackages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to\ninternationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.\n\n   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of\nmessages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already\nprovides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the included GNU\n`gettext' library will be used.  This library is wholly contained\nwithin this package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior\ninstallation of the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.\nInstallers may use special options at configuration time for changing\nthe default behaviour.  The commands:\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n     ./configure --disable-nls\n\nwill, respectively, bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the\ninternationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,\n_totally_ disable translation of messages.\n\n   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run\nconfigure without an option for your new package, `configure' will\nprobably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and\nwill decide to use this.  This might not be desirable.  You should use\nthe more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e. if the file\n`intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this package is\nmore recent, you should use\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n\nto prevent auto-detection.\n\n   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function\nand therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an\nemulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the\nextensions of the GNU `gettext' library.\n\n   Internationalized packages usually have many `po/LL.po' files, where\nLL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless\ntranslations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the\n`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed\ntogether with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'\nmay be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.\n`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter\ncodes, stating which languages are allowed.\n\n1.3 Using This Package\n======================\n\nAs a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you\nonly have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate\n`LL_CC' combination.  If you happen to have the `LC_ALL' or some other\n`LC_xxx' environment variables set, you should unset them before\nsetting `LANG', otherwise the setting of `LANG' will not have the\ndesired effect.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code, and\n`CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's\nsuppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell\nprompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),\n`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').\nThis can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for\nall.\n\n   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.\nBut in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For\nexample, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The\ncountry code serves to distinguish the dialects.\n\n   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the\nlanguage and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based\non GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are\nused, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of\nlocales supported by your system for your language by running the\ncommand `locale -a | grep '^LL''.\n\n   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an\nEnglish message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you\nunderstand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.\nThis is done through a different environment variable, called\n`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'\nfor the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'\nset to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the\nsystem libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather\nread translations in German than English for when Swedish is not\navailable, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.\n\n   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian\nbokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the\ntransition period, while some message catalogs for this language are\ninstalled under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended\nfor Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and\nolder translations are used.\n\n   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'\nenvironment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'\nto denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent\nto `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'\n(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.\n\n1.4 Translating Teams\n=====================\n\nFor the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested\npeople who like their own language and write it well, and who are also\nable to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.\nEach translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of\nteams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,\n`http://translationproject.org/', in the \"Teams\" area.\n\n   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you\nshould become a member of the translating team for your own language.\nThe subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has\n`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a\nmessage to `sv-request@li.org', having this message body:\n\n     subscribe\n\n   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate\n_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,\nrather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and\nyou want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to\nget started, please write to `coordinator@translationproject.org' to\nreach the coordinator for all translator teams.\n\n   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing\nthe terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skills are praised more than\nprogramming skills, here.\n\n1.5 Available Packages\n======================\n\nLanguages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following\nmatrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of November\n2007.  The matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages\nPO files have been submitted to translation coordination, with a\ntranslation percentage of at least 50%.\n\n     Ready PO files

This is because a few extra PO files are\nused for implementing regional variants of languages, or language\ndialects.\n\n   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to\nwhich it applies should also have been internationalized and\ndistributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable\nlag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a\ndistribution.\n\n   If November 2007 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy\nof this `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.  The most\nup-to-date matrix with full percentage details can be found at\n`http://translationproject.org/extra/matrix.html'.\n\n1.6 Using `gettext' in new packages\n===================================\n\nIf you are writing a freely available program and want to\ninternationalize it you are welcome to use GNU `gettext' in your\npackage.  Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public\nLicense which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means\nin particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared\nlibrary, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static\nlibrary or use modified versions of `libintl'.\n\n   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle\nthe use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The\nFree Translation Project is also available for packages which are not\ndeveloped inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above\napplies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact\n`coordinator@translationproject.org' to make the `.pot' files available\nto the translation teams.\n\n"

Dependency versions are\n    now pinned to those used in Ubuntu 20.04.\n  * Linux: added an optional dependency on gtksourceview4\n* Added PDF text selection tools (#1745, #3326, #4362)\n  * Two new tools have been introduced, \"Select Linear PDF Text\" and \"Select PDF\n    Text In Rectangle\", used for selecting text on background PDFs. The tools\n    support \"linear\" and \"area\" selection modes. Double/triple clicking enables\n    line and paragraph selection, respectively.\n  * The toolbox has buttons that allow a user to: 1) copy the selected text,\n    2) generate a highlight stroke over the selected text; 3) generate a stroke\n    to strike-through the text; 4) generate a stroke to underline the text;\n    and 5) toggle between linear and rectangle selection.\n  * Clicking on a link with one of the text selection tools will open a popup\n    that can be used to navigate to the corresponding PDF page (if it exists) or\n    display a clickable URL (#1027, #4412, #4673).\n  * Pressing `Ctrl+C` will copy the selected text to the clipboard (#4436,\n    #4784).\n* Added Setsquare Tool and Compass Tool\n  * The Setsquare Tool toggles a virtual setsquare, which can be used for\n    measurements and as a guide for drawing straight lines (#3082, #3882,\n    #4211, #4532, #4422).\n  * The Compass Tool toggles a virtual compass, which can be used for drawing\n    circles, arcs, and radial line segments (#4443, #4422).\n  * Mouse, stylus, and touchscreen input can be used to interact with the\n    Setsquare and Compass Tools.\n  * See the website for more information.\n* Colors\n  * Added new custom color palette support (#2379). A custom color palette can\n    be created in `.gpl` format in the Xournal++ config folder. See the website\n    guide for information on how to create a `.gpl` file.\n  * Changed the color picker so that it opens with the currently selected color\n    by default (#4569, #4575).\n  * Fixed the color picker dialog appearing on a different screen in\n    multi-screen setups (#4519, #4543).\n* Image Tool\n  * Added support for loading any image format supported by GDK Pixbuf (#3782).\n    For backwards compatibility, images are still saved in PNG format.\n  * Fixed some bugs with copying and pasting images (#4466).\n  * Fixed image orientation data not being handled properly (#4577, #4583).\n* Text Tool\n  * Added functionality to automatically select the currently editing text if\n    switching to a selection tool (#1169, #4315).\n  * Fixed some bugs when handling IM input, improving compatibility for some\n    IMEs such as `gcin` (#3841, #4937).\n  * Fixed text input remaining active after changing pages (#4027).\n  * Fixed bold toggle also removing italics (#4417).\n  * Fixed pasted text not using the color of the text tool (#4466).\n  * Fixed an issue where `Ctrl+Alt+Left` (or right) would cause the layer to\n    change instead of selecting the previous (or next) word (#977, #4797).\n* Hand Tool\n  * Changed selections to hide the controls when the Hand Tool is selected (\n    #4419).\n  * Added capability to interact with links on the background PDF (#1027,\n    #4412, #4673)\n* Stroke and eraser tools\n  * Added a system cursor option (#3540).\n  * Added stroke cap styles to the file format (#3326).\n  * Added a \"double ended arrow\" stroke style (#2362, #3946).\n  * Added a Preferences setting for setting the minimum size of the shape\n    recognizer (#4283).\n  * Added a toolbar item for changing fill opacity (#4263).\n  * Added each line style as a new, individual toolbar item that can be added\n    in toolbar customization (#4565).\n  * Added a Preferences setting to set the visibility of a stylus-activated\n    eraser (#4665).\n  * Improved minor graphical aspects of the fill opacity dialog (#3515).\n  * Improved performance by rendering strokes with integer coordinates (#4080).\n  * Improved the arrow stroke style by scaling the arrow head by line length\n    for small arrows (#4055).\n  * Rewrote the stroke rendering code to fix bugs and improve performance\n    (#3480, #3580, #4304).\n  * Rewrote the Eraser tool to be faster and more reliable (#3532, #997, #949,\n    #3537).\n  * Rewrote the ellipse stroke type to reduce the number of points while\n    (roughly) maintaining the same look (#4137, #4320).\n  * Fixed a bug where stroke stabilization could produce NaN pressure values,\n    causing them to become invisible when exported to PDF (#4381, #4401).\n  * Fixed issues involving documents that contain strokes with negative or NaN\n    pressure values (#4354, #4401). When such documents are now loaded, points\n    with NaN pressure values will automatically be removed.\n  * Fixed a bug in the stroke stabilizer where the stroke pressure value may\n    sometimes not be set on the last point (#4676).\n* Toolbars\n  * Added new \"Export as PDF\" toolbar item (#3508). It and the \"Print\" toolbar\n    item have also been added to the default layouts.\n  * Added \"Spacer\" and \"Separator\" toolbar items for creating extra space in\n    toolbars (#4644, #4674).\n  * Fixed a crash that occurs if the application is closed while toolbar\n    customization is open (#4559).\n  * Updated the default `toolbar.ini` (#4670).\n* Layers\n  * Added a context menu for the layer sidebar preview (#3204).\n  * Added a feature for merging layers down.

Notably,\n    plugins will also be searched for in the `plugins` folder contained in the\n    user's config directory (see the \"File Locations\" section of the\n    website/guide for where to find this folder).\n  * Added an `ACTION_TOGGLE_PAIRS_PARITY` used for programmatically changing\n    between single and paired page mode. This is currently only accessible\n    through the plugin API (#4424).\n  * Added a new feature to `app.registerUI` to register custom toolbar items\n    (#2431, #2936, #4669, #4671).\n  * QuickScreenshot plugin: added `maim` and `xclip` program support (#3718).\n  * Improved error handling so that the plugin API returns actual Lua errors\n    (#4652).\n  * Fixed several issues with plugin-disabled builds (#4726, #4728, #4746).\n* Audio recordings\n  * All elements without audio now become faded when the Play Object tool is\n    used (#2874).\n  * Windows: fixed issues with saving/loading audio files with unicode\n    characters in their names (#3783).\n* Vertical Spacing Tool\n  * Added capability to move elements above the line by holding Ctrl (#3334).\n  * Improved performance (#3334, #4306).\n* TeX Tool\n  * Reimplemented the LaTeX editor using the gtksourceview library (#2809),\n    enabling multiline input, syntax highlighting, undo/redo, word wrap, and a\n    resizable code editor.\n  * Added a tab for viewing the output of the TeX command (#2809).\n  * Added Preferences settings for changing the syntax highlighting theme, word\n    wrap settings, font, default formula, and other settings (#2809, #4264).\n  * Changed the TeX background color to become dark when a light font color is\n    selected (#2809).\n  * Fixed a bug where editing existing TeX will cause its position to change\n    (#4415, #4430).\n  * Fixed a memory leak (#4088)\n* PDF support\n  * Added \"Xournal++\" as the \"Creator\" in exported PDF metadata (#3523).\n  * Added button to propose replacement background PDF if it is missing and a\n    file with a similar name is found in the same folder as the `.xopp` file\n    (#4165)\n  * Added a \"default PDF export name\" setting that is used when exporting PDFs\n    to support wildcards/placeholders for name, date, and time (#2897, #4599,\n    #4854).\n  * Minor performance improvements (#4004, #4704).\n  * Fixed a crash that occurs when exporting to PDF from the command line, but\n    the background PDF does not exist (#4584, #4681).\n* Floating toolbox\n  * Added capability to open the floating toolbox with a secondary button\n    (#3270).\n* View modes (#4514)\n  * The individual default, fullscreen, and presentation modes have been\n    reorganized into a \"View Modes\" setting in Preferences.\n  * The \"Hide menu bar\" and \"Hide sidebar\" settings now work correctly\n    with these view modes (#2773).\n  * Changed the `F5` shortcut so that it can also be used to leave presentation\n    mode. Removed the `ESC` shortcut to leave presentation mode, which\n    conflicts with cancelling a selection (#4480).\n* Optimizations\n  * Refactored the rendering system, leading to performance improvements, bug\n    fixes, and code that is easier to extend with new features (#1795, #4051,\n    #3480, #3503, #3969, #3985, #3990, #4304, #4137, #4417, #4158, #4159,\n    #4687, #4442, #4271).\n

keys 0-9 (#2007, #4416).\n  * Added vim keybindings `Shift+j` and `Shift+k` for page scrolling (#4573).\n  * Refactored key event handling such that key-press and key-release events\n    are first propogated to the focus window and up the focus chain container,\n    thus allowing for plugins using keyboard shortcuts that would otherwise\n    conflict with the text tool (#4797, #4811).\n  * Added a new setting for automatically appending a new page to the document\n    when scrolling to the last page (#1343, #4311).\n  * Added page numbers to the sidebar page previews, which can be configured\n    in the Preferences (#4624, #4693).\n  * Changed version numbers in About window to be selectable text (#4152).\n  * Changed the About dialog to hide the Git commit info if it is not found\n    (#4537).\n  * Changed the autosave directory from the user config folder to the user cache\n    folder (#3587).\n  * Changed the \"Apply to current page\" button so that it is disabled in the\n    page type dropdown menu when \"Copy current page\" is selected (#4142, #4255).\n    This helps to ensure that the corrupt \"Copy\" page background type cannot\n    actually be produced in a document (see #4127).\n  * Fixed the cursor highlight clipping when the sum of the radius and border\n    width exceed 60 pixels (#3023).\n  * Fixed the cursor highlight not showing with \"None\" cursor type (#3023).\n  * Fixed the cursor not immediately changing when activating the vertical space\n    tool (#4851, #4864).\n  * Fixed a scrolling bug when undoing page insertion (#2757,

item not being updated correctly when selecting\n    existing stroke elements (#3793, #4089).\n  * Fixed a crash that occurs when using Annotate PDF to open a non-PDF file\n    (#3368, #4526).\n  * Fixed potential race conditions (#4533).\n  * Fixed a potential crash that can occur when adding a color selection\n    toolbar item to a side toolbar (#4505, #4535).\n  * Fixed an issue where failing to create a backup during saving would silently\n    abort saving instead of informing the user (#4675, #4715).\n  * Fixed a bug where undo/redo would not deselect the current selection (#4609,\n    #4725).\n  * Added undo/redo for selections moved via keyboard (#4835, #4842).\n  * Fixed a bug with changing linestyle via toolbar or plugins not working\n    properly (#4831, #4827, #4823).\n  *

versions as well as\n    every log message issued via g_message, g_critical, g_debug and so on (#4848).\n  * Fixed a mismatch between the app id the window sets and the name of the desktop\n    file, leading to the Wayland icon being shown instead of the Xournal++ icon.\n    The program name and StarupWMClass were therefore changed from xournalpp to\n    com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp (#4870, #4887).\n  * Replaced deprecated icons, which are missing on newer versions of GNOME as\n    well as Windows and macOS builds (#3945, #4544).\n  * macOS: fixed clipboard image paste not working (#3455, #4489).\n  * macOS: fixed audio recording by compiling libsndfile with external libraries\n    (#4656, #4371).\n  * Removed old MIME types from XDG desktop metadata files (#4130).\n  * Fixed header includes for compiling with GCC 13 (#4912).\n  * Define MAX_PATH if undefined to address Hurd build failure (#4962).\n  * Other minor code cleanup and improvements.\n  * Initial preparatory work to migrate to GTK4 (#4441, #4448).\n  * Updated translations.\n\n## 1.1.3\n\n* Fixed a crash that occurs when trying to add/edit/test LaTeX if LaTeX is not found (#4334, #4345)\n* Fixed a crash that could occur when quitting when using a touchscreen device (#4343, #4373)\n* Fixed a bug that closed text fields immediately after creating them with a secondary mouse or stylus button (#3983, #4309)\n* Added a setting in the preferences to disable Gtk inertial scrolling, avoiding weird scrolling on some devices (#4013, #4420)\n* Linux: added an Ubuntu 22.04 release build (#4411)\n\n## 1.1.2\n\nBugfixes from various community contributors.\n\n* Fixed application window being dragged unintentionally when dragging from\n  toolbox or menu bars (#3901, #3907).\n* Fixed CLI export

bug fixes thanks to over one year's worth of contributions from the\ncommunity.\n\n* **Breaking changes**:\n  * Xournal++ now follows the [XDG Base Directory\n      Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html)\n      (#1101, #1384). The configuration files will now be stored in an\n      appropriate platform-specific user data folder. Old configuration files\n      will be copied automatically if the new user data folder does not exist.\n  * For users that have non-default DPI settings, text elements in old\n      documents may be displayed with incorrect sizes/positions. A new plugin is\n      included to fix the positioning of these text elements. See the relevant\n      bug in the \"Text tool\" section below.\n  * The old input system has been removed, which may affect some users.\n  * Windows: The installer has been updated, fixing many issues such as:\n      incorrectly set up registry keys, missing uninstaller entry, missing\n      entries in Open With context menu in Explorer, missing icons, etc. (#2606,\n      #2585, #2387, #2141, #2036, #1903, #2666, #3215). When upgrading from\n      1.0.18, you **must not run the uninstaller**; instead, run the updated\n      installer, which will clean up files from the old install and fix the\n      registry key entries. **If you are downgrading from 1.1.0 to 1.0.18 or\n      older, you must run the uninstaller first.**\n  * Linux: Support for Ubuntu 16.04 (and older distros) has been dropped.\n      Please use a distro from 2018 or later, such as Ubuntu 18.04 or Debian\n      Buster.

See the \"Breaking change\" below.\n\nWe now officially support packaging Xournal++ using CMake. This allows users to\ngenerate DEB and tar packages. See `readme/linux.md` for more details.\n\n* **Breaking change**: the desktop and icon files were renamed from `xournalpp`\n  to `com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp` to be more in line with the AppStream\n  specification. This change should only affect users that install with `make\n  install`; these users must run `make uninstall` with a cloned version of\n  _Xournal++ 1.0.12_ first. We recommend migrating to another installation\n  format, such as Flatpak, AppImage, or tarball. Refer to [this\n  issue](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/1442#issuecomment-524566511)\n  for more details on how to uninstall if `make uninstall` is unavailable.

          "content": "# Contributing to Xournal++\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing to Xournal++! The project is run\ncompletely by volunteers in their spare time, so any contribution--no matter how\nsmall--is greatly appreciated. In this file, we'll outline how you can\ncontribute to the project.\n\nIf you have questions after reading this file, feel free to ask them on our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/xournalpp/xournalpp).\n\n## Overview\n\nSeveral of the main ways that you can contribute to the project include:\n\n* Updating the [website](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp.github.io)\n* [Contributing translation improvements](#contributing-translation-improvements)\n* [Contributing code improvements](#contributing-code-improvements)\n\n## Contributing website improvements\n\nFor making changes to the website, please go to [xournalpp/xournalpp.github.io](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp.github.io).\n\n## Contributing translation improvements\n\nIf you would like to contribute translations, you can submit improvements to\n[our project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/xournalpp). The Crowdin\ntranslations are merged back into the main code periodically, after which they\nbecome available available in the nightly builds.\n\n## Contributing code improvements\n\nXournal++ development primarily occurs on GitHub at the [xournalpp/xournalpp\nrepository](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp). As a contributor, you\nprobably have a particular bug or feature that you are interested in working on.\nBefore you start, you should first look in the [issue\ntracker](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues) to see if anyone has\nreported your bug or has a similar idea for a feature. If not, you should first\nsubmit a new issue detailing what you are about to do. This will allow you to\nget feedback and ensure that you do not end up duplicating work. You can obtain\nadditional help by contacting community members through one of our [official\ncommunication channels](https://xournalpp.github.io/community/help).\n\nThe process for contributing code changes works as follows:\n\n1. Fork the main xournalpp repository and create commits on your own feature\n   branch.\n2. Submit a pull request (PR).\n3. Wait for maintainers to review the PR and address the relevant feedback.\n4. After receiving maintainer approval, the PR is merged after a short grace\n   period.\n\n### Creating a fork\n\nTo make a code change, you'll need to first fork the repository on GitHub, if\nyou haven't already. To do so, click the \"Fork\" button in the top right corner\nof the repository's web page.\n\nWe assume that you are already familiar with Git, which we use to track changes.\nAn excellent resource for Git is the _Pro Git_ book by Scott Chacon and Ben\nStraub, which is available online for free\n[here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).\n\nYou should try to first clone your fork and then compile it manually. The\ninstructions for compiling Xournal++ depend on your operating system:\n\n* [`LinuxBuild.md`](readme/LinuxBuild.md)\n* [`MacBuild.md`](readme/MacBuild.md),\n* [`WindowsBuild.md`](readme/WindowsBuild.md)\n\n### Code conventions and guidelines\n\nHere are some of the _guidelines_ that we follow when working on the Xournal++\ncodebase. We emphasize _guidelines_ because these are ideal points that we'd\nlike to see in contributions, but we understand that perfectly following all\npoints is very difficult in practice.\n\nGeneral contribution guidelines:\n\n* **The code is best developed on Linux, followed by Windows, followed by\n  MacOS**. Most contributors are using some Linux distribution, so the support\n  and tooling on Linux is the most mature. Windows is also supported as a\n  development environment via MSYS2, but the setup is less documented and\n  potentially more complicated than on Linux. The project is set up to _build_\n  on MacOS, but there is no documentation regarding development on there.\n  Contributions to the tooling, development setup, and documentation are\n  welcome!\n* **Please accompany your code changes with documentation**. Because many\n  contributors come and go, it is important to communicate the context of your\n  contributions (e.g., issues being solved, why designed in a particular way,\n  etc.) to future contributors. Documentation includes in-code doc comments, git\n  commit messages, and/or detailed PR descriptions.\n* Pull requests should be broken up into a series of small, \"atomic\" commits.\n  Larger contributions should be broken up into multiple pull requests. This\n  should be done to the extent that it makes it easier for maintainers to review\n  contributions and keep track of changes.\n  * By \"atomic\" commits, we mean self-contained commits that compile\n    independently. For example, if a commit fixes a bug and _also_ incidentally\n    refactors the surrounding logic without changing behavior, it should first\n    be broken up into a refactor followed by a bugfix. If the refactor is\n    _necessary_ for the bugfix, then the necessary parts should be kept together\n    in the same commit, and the other parts should be extracted into a separate\n    commit (but kept in the same PR).\n  * Pull requests should target a single concern, e.g. \"Fix text rendering bug\"\n    or \"Implement PDF text selection\". If a PR involves several large, unrelated\n    changes, then it should probably be broken up.\n  * Note that these are guidelines--there is no hard or fast rule that\n    determines how commits or pull requests should be broken up.\n\nMechanical issues:\n\n* Xournal++ is a mixture of C++ and C code. This is unavoidable because we rely on\n  many C libraries (e.g. GTK). Prefer C++ when possible, however.\n* Although we do not have a strong opinion on code style, we use `clang-format`\n  to enforce a _consistent_ code style. Feel free to write your code in whatever\n  style you prefer, as long as you run `clang-format` to format your code\n  afterwards.\n  * The code style will be automatically checked by the CI system. PRs that are\n    not formatted correctly will fail to build; to remedy this, the \"Clang\n    Format Applied\" check will also provide a patch that can be applied to fix\n    the formatting.\n  * This reduces the number of changed lines due to different code styles.\n    Therefore we have fewer merge conflicts and the code is also easier to read\n    and review.\n* **Optimize your code for clarity and readability, but do not be overly\n  verbose**.\n  * Use meaningful variable names whenever possible, e.g. use `centerX = (posRect.x2 - posRect.x1) / 2` instead of `a = (r.x2 - r.x1) / 2`.\n  * However, if it is clear from the context what the meaning of a variable is,\n    prefer using a short name, e.g. `cx = (pos.x2 - pos.x1) / 2`.\n  * If the type of a variable in a variable declaration is clear from the\n    context, use `auto`:\n    `auto foo = createFoo();`\n* Follow modern C++ best practices as listed in the [C++ Core\n  Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines).\n  * In particular, make variables `const` by default, always use smart pointers\n    instead of `new`/`delete`, and prefer `std::optional` over null pointers.\n  * A useful tool to help you to fulfill those rules is `clang-tidy`. It can be\n    found on almost all distro package managers.\n* When working with code that interfaces with C libraries (GLib and GTK in\n  particular), you should be extra careful with reference counting and memory\n  management.\n  * If you see a frequently occurring ref counting pattern, it might be helpful\n    to create your own memory managing RAII ref count wrapper. This will also\n    reduce the time others must spend to verify your code because it is correct\n    by design.\n\nSee [the corresponding Wiki article](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/wiki/Coding-conventions) for more details on coding conventions.\n\n### Sending your contributions for review\n\nWhen you feel like you are ready to submit your code changes to be integrated\ninto the main Xournal++ repository or require some feedback on your work, you\nwill want to submit a pull request (PR). The steps to do so are outlined below.\n\n1. Push your changes on to a branch of your fork in GitHub.\n2. Hit the \"New pull request\" button on the\n   [main repository's PR tracker](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/pulls).\n   Select the branch you want to contribute, and then press \"Create pull\n   request.\" If you feel like your work isn't quite ready, feel free to submit\n   your PR as a draft.\n3. Write a short description of what your changes are and why you are making\n   them. Please include any relevant issue numbers that your PR will fix, as\n   well as a short description of what your changes are and why you are making\n   them. Feel free to also include questions or comments about code snippets you\n   may be unsure about. For examples of PR descriptions, take a look at some of\n   the past PRs listed in the PR tracker.\n\n### The review process\n\nTo maintain the quality of contributions, we typically require a PR to meet the\nfollowing requirements before it is merged.\n\n* **The PR is reviewed by at least one maintainer**, and the relevant feedback is\n  addressed.\n* The code **successfully compiles** and passes all tests on our automated testing\n  infrastructure.\n* The code **passes the automated formatting check**. If the code does not pass,\n  you can copy and paste the required changes from the Azure Pipelines page that\n  has details on how the check failed.\n* Before the PR is merged, a grace period of at least 24 hours has passed since\n  the last maintainer has approved the PR. This allows time for objections or\n  last-minute feedback. Larger or more complicated PRs may take a longer grace\n  period.\n\nOnce a PR is ready to merge, we typically ask submitters to rebase or squash\ntheir commits in order to keep the change history cleaner. If you do not know\nhow to do this, feel free to ask for help.\n"

Also note that\n# the size of a graph can be further restricted by MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH.\n# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 10000, default value: 50.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES    = 50\n\n# The MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH tag can be used to set the maximum depth of the graphs\n# generated by dot. A depth value of 3 means that only nodes reachable from the\n# root by following a path via at most 3 edges will be shown. Nodes that lay\n# further from the root node will be omitted. Note that setting this option to 1\n# or 2 may greatly reduce the computation time needed for large code bases. Also\n# note that the size of a graph can be further restricted by\n# DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES. Using a depth of 0 means no depth restriction.\n# Minimum value: 0, maximum value: 1000, default value: 0.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nMAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH    = 0\n\n# Set the DOT_TRANSPARENT tag to YES to generate images with a transparent\n# background. This is disabled by default, because dot on Windows does not seem\n# to support this out of the box.\n#\n# Warning: Depending on the platform used, enabling this option may lead to\n# badly anti-aliased labels on the edges of a graph (i.e. they become hard to\n# read).\n# The default value is: NO.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOT_TRANSPARENT        = NO\n\n# Set the DOT_MULTI_TARGETS tag to YES to allow dot to generate multiple output\n# files in one run (i.e. multiple -o and -T options on the command line). This\n# makes dot run faster, but since only newer versions of dot (>1.8.10) support\n# this, this feature is disabled by default.\n# The default value is: NO.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOT_MULTI_TARGETS      = NO\n\n# If the GENERATE_LEGEND tag is set to YES doxygen will generate a legend page\n# explaining the meaning of the various boxes and arrows in the dot generated\n# graphs.\n# The default value is: YES.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nGENERATE_LEGEND        = YES\n\n# If the DOT_CLEANUP tag is set to YES, doxygen will remove the intermediate dot\n# files that are used to generate the various graphs.\n# The default value is: YES.\n# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.\n\nDOT_CLEANUP            = YES\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License."

The web app is no longer available.\nYou can still check out the [separate repository on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/TheOneWithTheBraid/xournalpp_mobile) or\n[Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=online.xournal.mobile)\n\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n\n## GNU/Linux\n\n<img src=\"readme/main.png\" width=100% title=\"Xournal++ on GNU/Linux\"/>\n\n</td><td>\n\n## Windows 10\n\n<img src=\"readme/main-win.png\" width=100% title=\"Xournal++ on Windows 10\"/>\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n\n## macOS Catalina\n\n<img src=\"readme/main-mac.png\" width=100% title=\"Xournal++ on macOS Catalina\"/>\n\n</td><td>\n\n## Xournal++ Mobile on Chromium OS\n\n<img src=\"https://gitlab.com/TheOneWithTheBraid/xournalpp_mobile/-/raw/master/fastlane/metadata/android/en_US/images/tenInchScreenshots/03.png\" width=100% title=\"Xournal++ Mobile on Chromium OS\"/>\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n\n## Toolbar / Page Background / Layer\n\nMultiple page background, easy selectable on the toolbar\n<img src=\"readme/background.png\" width=100% title=\"Changing the page background in Xournal++\"/>\n\n</td><td>\n\n## Layer sidebar and advanced layer selection\n\n<img src=\"readme/layer.png\" width=100% title=\"Layers in Xournal++\"/>\n\n</td></tr><tr><td>\n\n## Multiple predefined and fully customizable toolbars\n\n<img src=\"readme/toolbar.png\" width=100% title=\"Custom toolbars in Xournal++\"/>\n\n</td></tr></table>\n\n## User Manual and FAQ\n\nFor general usage, consult the [User\nManual](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/wiki/User-Manual). Answers to\nsome common questions can be found in the\n[FAQ](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions-&-Problem-Solving).\n\n## Experimental Features\n\nSometimes a feature is added that might not be rock solid, or the developers aren't sure if it is useful.\nTry these out and give us some feedback.\n\nHere are a few under development that you can play with now:\n\n- <img src=\"readme/floatingtoolboxmbmenu.png\"  title=\"Xournal++\"/> Assign a mouse button or stylus button to bring up a toolbox of toolbars right under the cursor. You can also modify what is in the toolbox through the usual View → Toolbars → Customize although **it won't appear unless you've assigned a button in preferences: mouse or stylus** (or selected a toolbar configuration that uses it).\n\n  - This is an experimental feature because not everything you can put in the toolbox behaves. So be aware.\n\n    <img src=\"readme/floatingtoolbox.png\" width=25% />\n\n* Keep your eyes out for other experimental features in preferences as seen here:\n\n  DrawingTools: When drawing a box, circle etc, simulate ctrl or shift modifiers by the initial direction you move the mouse.\n\n  Action on Tool Tap: Allow a brief tap on the screen to bring up the floating toolbox and/or select an object. May work with pen and highlighter only.\n\n   <img src=\"readme/moreexperimentals.png\" width=50% />\n\n## Installing\n\nThe official releases of Xournal++ can be found on the\n[Releases](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/releases) page. We provide\nbinaries for Debian (Buster), Ubuntu (16.04), MacOS (10.15 and newer), and\nWindows. For other GNU/Linux distributions (or older/newer ones), we also provide an\nAppImage that is binary compatible with any distribution released around or\nafter Ubuntu 16.04. For installing Xournal++ Mobile on handheld devices, please check out [Xournal++ Mobile's instructions](https://gitlab.com/TheOneWithTheBraid/xournalpp_mobile#try-it-out)\n\n**A note for Ubuntu/Debian users**: The official binaries that we provide are\nonly compatible with the _specific version of Debian or Ubuntu_ indicated by the\nfile name. For example, if you are on Ubuntu 20.04, the binary whose name\ncontains `Ubuntu-bionic` is _only_ compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. If your system\nis not one of the specific Debian or Ubuntu versions that are supported by the\nofficial binaries, we recommend you use either the PPA (Ubuntu only), the Flatpak, or the\nAppImage.\n\nThere is also an _unstable_, [automated nightly\nrelease](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/releases/tag/nightly) that\nincludes the very latest features and bug fixes.\n\nWith the help of the community, Xournal++ is also available on official repositories\nof some popular GNU/Linux distros and platforms.\n\n### Debian\n\nOn Debian bookworm and Debian sid the `xournalpp` package (stable version) is contained in the official repositories. Simply install via\n\n```sh\nsudo apt install xournalpp\n```\n\nThere are also the official [Stable releases](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/releases) and\n_unstable_ [automated nightly releases](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/releases/tag/nightly).\n\n### Ubuntu and derivatives\n\nOn distros based on Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy Jellyfish (and later) the `xournalpp` package (stable version) is contained in the official repositories.\nSimply install via\n\n```sh\nsudo apt install xournalpp\n```\n\n#### Stable PPA\nThe latest stable version is available via the following [_unofficial_ PPA](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/1013#issuecomment-692656810):\n\n```sh\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:apandada1/xournalpp-stable\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install xournalpp\n```\n\n#### Unstable PPA\nAn _unstable_, nightly release is available for Ubuntu-based distributions via the following PPA:\n\n```sh\nsudo add-apt-repository ppa:andreasbutti/xournalpp-master\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install xournalpp\n```\n\nThis PPA is provided by the Xournal++ team. While it has the latest features and\nbug fixes, it has also not been tested thoroughly and may break periodically (we\ntry our best not to break things, though).\n\n### Fedora\n\nThe [released version of\nxournalpp](https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/xournalpp) is available in the\n[main repository](https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=xournalpp)\nvia _Software_ application or the following command:\n\n```sh\nsudo dnf install xournalpp\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\npkcon install xournalpp\n```\n\nThe bleeding edge packages synced to xournalpp git master on a daily basis are available from [COPR luya/xournalpp](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/luya/xournalpp/).\n[![Copr build status](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/luya/xournalpp/package/xournalpp/status_image/last_build.png)](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/luya/xournalpp/package/xournalpp/)\n\n### openSUSE\n\nOn openSUSE Tumbleweed, the released version of Xournal++ is available from the\nmain repository:\n\n```sh\nsudo zypper in xournalpp\n```\n\nFor openSUSE Leap 15.0 and earlier, use the install link from\n[X11:Utilities](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=X11%3AUtilities&package=xournalpp).\n\nFor all versions of openSUSE, bleeding edge packages synced to xournalpp git\nmaster on a weekly basis are available from\n[home:badshah400:Staging](https://software.opensuse.org//download.html?project=home%3Abadshah400%3AStaging&package=xournalpp).\n\n### Arch Linux\n\nThe latest stable release is available [in the [extra]\nrepository](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/xournalpp/).\n\nTo build the latest state of the master branch yourself, use [this AUR\npackage](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/xournalpp-git/).\n\n### Solus\n\nThe latest stable release is available in the main repository:\n\n```sh\nsudo eopkg it xournalpp\n```\n\n### Flatpak\n\nThe Xournal++ team officially supports a [FlatHub\nrelease](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp), which\ncan be installed with\n\n```sh\nflatpak install flathub com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp\n```\n\nNote that for Xournal++ to work properly, you must have at least one GTK theme\nand one icon theme installed on Flatpak. To enable LaTeX support, you will also\nneed to install the TeX Live extension:\n\n```sh\nflatpak install flathub org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.texlive\n```\n\nThe Flatpak manifest can be found at the [Xournal++ Flatpak packaging\nrepository](https://github.com/flathub/com.github.xournalpp.xournalpp), and all\nFlatpak-related packaging issues should be reported there.\n\n### Android and Chrome OS\n\nAndroid is supported by Xournal++ Mobile. It can be downloaded either on the [Tags page](https://gitlab.com/TheOneWithTheBraid/xournalpp_mobile/-/tags) or [from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=online.xournal.mobile).\n\n### iOS\n\nUnfortunately, the iOS app is not published yet in the Apple App Store. See [here](#mobile--web-app) to learn, why. Anyway, in the [Building section](#building) you can learn how to build an early preview.\n\n### Windows\n\nOfficial Windows releases are provided on the [Releases\npage](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/releases).\n\n### Mac OS X\n\nMac OS X releases are provided on the [Releases\npage](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/releases).\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- There have been compatibility problems with Mac OS X Catalina regarding both\n  file permissions and stylus support\n  ([#1772](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/1772) and\n  [#1757](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/1757)). Unfortunately,\n  we don't have the resources to adequately support Catalina at this time. Help\n  would be appreciated!\n- Xournal++ will be delivered with a patched GTK. Else, pressure sensitivity will not work on Mac\n  [#569](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/569).\n\n## Building\n\n[GNU/Linux Build](readme/LinuxBuild.md)\n\n[Mac Build](readme/MacBuild.md)\n\n[Windows Build](readme/WindowsBuild.md)\n\n[Android Build](https://gitlab.com/TheOneWithTheBraid/xournalpp_mobile#getting-started)\n\n[iOS Build](https://gitlab.com/TheOneWithTheBraid/xournalpp_mobile#getting-started)\n\n## File format\n\nThe file extension `.xopp` is a gzipped XML file. PDFs are not embedded into the file, so if the PDF is deleted, the background is lost. `.xopp` is basically the same file format as `.xoj`, which is used by Xournal. Therefore, Xournal++ is able to read `.xoj` files, and can also export to `.xoj`. As soon as notes are exported to a `.xoj` file, all Xournal++ specific extensions like additional background types, are lost.\n\n`.xopp` files can theoretically be read by Xournal, as long as you do not use any new features. Xournal does not open files that contain new attributes or unknown values, so Xournal++ will add the extension `.xopp` to all saved files to indicate the potential presence of Xournal++-only features.\n\nAll new files will be saved as `.xopp`. If an `.xoj` file that was created by Xournal is opened, the Save-As dialog will be displayed on save. If the `.xoj` file was created by Xournal++, the file will be overwritten on save and the file extension will not change.\n\n**We are currently introducing a new file format that can efficiently store attached PDF files and other attachments internally. We will still allow for attachments that are linked to external files. Please refer to [#937](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/issues/937) for further details.**\n\n## Building\n\nWe support building on three operating systems:\n\n- [Linux](readme/LinuxBuild.md)\n- [MacOS](readme/MacBuild.md)\n- [Windows](readme/WindowsBuild.md)\n\n## Contributing\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\n"

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\n contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\n acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\n such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\n making the Licensed Material available under these terms and\n conditions.\n .\n .\n Section 1 -- Definitions.\n .\n a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n    Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n    and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n    arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n    permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n    Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n    Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n    Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n    synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n .\n b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright\n    and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in\n    accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n .\n c. BY-SA Compatible License means a license listed at\n    creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses, approved by Creative\n    Commons as essentially the equivalent of this Public License.\n .\n d. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n    closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n    performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n    Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n    categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n    specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n    Rights.\n .\n e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n    absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n    fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n    Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n    agreements.\n .\n f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n    any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n    that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n .\n g. License Elements means the license attributes listed in the name\n    of a Creative Commons Public License. The License Elements of this\n    Public License are Attribution and ShareAlike.\n .\n h. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n    or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n    License.\n .\n i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n    terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n    all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n    Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n .\n j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n    under this Public License.\n .\n k. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n    process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n    as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n    dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n    available to the public including in ways that members of the\n    public may access the material from a place and at a time\n    individually chosen by them.\n .\n l. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n    resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n    the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n    as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n    equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n .\n m. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n    under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n .\n .\n Section 2 -- Scope.\n .\n a. License grant.\n .\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n .\n             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n                in part; and\n .\n             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n .\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n .\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n .\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n .\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n .\n             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n                Public License.\n .\n             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n .\n             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n                Material.\n .\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n .\n b. Other rights.\n .\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n .\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n .\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n .\n .\n Section 3 -- License Conditions.\n .\n Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\n following conditions.\n .\n a. Attribution.\n .\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n .\n             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n                with the Licensed Material:\n .\n                i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                   Material and any others designated to receive\n                   attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                   the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                   designated);\n .\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n .\n                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n .\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                   warranties;\n .\n                v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                   extent reasonably practicable;\n .\n             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n .\n             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n                hyperlink to, this Public License.\n .\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n .\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n .\n b. ShareAlike.\n .\n    In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n    Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n .\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n .\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n .\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n .\n .\n Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n .\n Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\n apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n .\n a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n    to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n    portion of the contents of the database;\n .\n b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n    contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n    Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n    Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n .\n    including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n    all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n .\n For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\n replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\n Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n .\n .\n Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n .\n a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n    EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n    AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n    ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n    IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n    WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n    KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n    ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n .\n b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n    TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n    NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n    COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n    USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n    ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n    DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n    IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n .\n c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n    above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n    possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n    waiver of all liability.\n .\n .\n Section 6 -- Term and Termination.\n .\n a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n    Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n    this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n    terminate automatically.\n .\n b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n    Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n .\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n .\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n .\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n    right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n    of this Public License.\n .\n c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n    Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n    distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n    will not terminate this Public License.\n .\n d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n    License.\n .\n .\n Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n .\n a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n    terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n .\n b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n    Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n    independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n .\n .\n Section 8 -- Interpretation.\n .\n a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n    shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n    conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n    be made without permission under this Public License.\n .\n b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n    deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n    minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n    without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n    conditions.\n .\n c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n    failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n    Licensor.\n .\n d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n    as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n    that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n    processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n .\n .\n =======================================================================\n .\n Creative Commons is not a party to its public\n licenses.
