Also some things are simply not fixable due to whatever\n   technical reason.\n - Sometimes we don't fix a bug because the user's vision of how QGIS should\n   behave doesn't match ours. Hey we are all humans it can happen...\n - Always check that your bug has not already been filed by someone else since\n   dealing with duplicate tickets causes a lot of time wasting.\n - Be prepared to provided further feedback after the initial triage.\n - Don't be offended if we don't see tickets as having the same priority as you\n   do. While we appreciate it's inconvenient if some issue prevents you doing\n   your work, we need to take the big picture view of things and focus on\n   things that affect the largest proportion of our user base.\n"

[fork the project](https://help.github.com/forking/)\n1. make your changes\n1. commit to your repository\n1. and then [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).\n\n The development team can then review your contribution and commit it upstream as appropriate.\n\nIf you commit a new feature, add `[FEATURE]` to your commit message AND give a clear description of the new feature. The label `Needs documentation` will be added by maintainers and will automatically create an issue on the QGIS-Documentation repo, where you or others should write documentation about it.\n\nFor large-scale changes, you can open a [QEP (QGIS Enhancement Proposal)](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals). QEPs are used in the process of creating and discussing new enhancements or policy for QGIS.\n\n## Translations\n\nPlease help translate QGIS to your language. At this moment about forty languages are already available in the Desktop user interface and about eighty languages are available in transifex ready to be translated.\n\nThe [translation](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/documentation_guidelines/do_translations.html) process is managed by the [Translation Team](https://qgis.org/community/organisation/#translation) and all the activities are done under the [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/qgis/) platform.\n\n## Other ways to contribute\n\nIf you are not a developer, there are many other possibilities that do not require programming skills to help QGIS to evolve. Check our [project homepage for more information](https://qgis.org/community/involve/).\n"

This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nIn addition, as a special exception, the QGIS Development Team gives\npermission to link the code of this program with the Qt library,\nincluding but not limited to the following versions (both free and\ncommercial): Qt/Non-commercial Windows, Qt/Windows, Qt/X11, Qt/Mac, and\nQt/Embedded (or with modified versions of Qt that use the same license\nas Qt), and distribute linked combinations including the two. You must\nobey the GNU General Public License in all respects for all of the code\nused other than Qt. If you modify this file, you may extend this\nexception to your version of the file, but you are not obligated to do\nso. If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from\nyour version.\n\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

Nevertheless,\nmistakes concerning the content are possible. Therefore, all data are not\nliable to any duties or guarantees. The editors and publishers do not take\nany responsibility or liability for failures and their consequences. You are\nalways welcome for indicating possible mistakes.\n\nBecause the code of QGIS evolves from release to release, These instructions are\nregularly updated to match the corresponding release. Instructions for the current\nmaster branch are available at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL.md.\nIf you wish to build another version of QGIS, ensure to checkout the appropriate\nrelease branch. The QGIS source code can be found [in the repository](https://github.com/qgis/QGIS).\n\nPlease visit https://qgis.org for information on joining our mailing lists\nand getting involved in the project further.\n\n**Note to document writers:** Please use this document as the central\nplace for describing build procedures. Please do not remove this notice.\n\n# 2. Overview\n\nQGIS, like a number of major projects (e.g., KDE 4.0),\nuses [CMake](https://www.cmake.org) for building from source.\n\nFollowing a summary of the required dependencies for building:\n\nRequired build tools:\n\n* CMake >= 3.12.0\n* Flex >= 2.5.6\n* Bison >= 2.4\n* Python >= 3.7\n\nRequired build dependencies:\n\n* Qt >= 5.15.2\n* Proj >= 7.2.0\n* GEOS >= 3.9\n* Sqlite3 >= 3.0.0\n* SpatiaLite >= 4.2.0\n* libspatialindex\n* GDAL/OGR >= 3.2.0\n* Qwt >= 5.0 & (< 6.1 with internal QwtPolar)\n* expat >= 1.95\n* QScintilla2\n* QCA\n* qtkeychain (>= 0.5)\n* libzip\n\nOptional dependencies:\n\n* for GRASS providers and plugin - GRASS >= 7.0.0.\n* for georeferencer - GSL >= 1.8\n* for PostGIS support - PostgreSQL >= 8.0.x\n* for gps plugin - gpsbabel\n* for mapserver export and PyQGIS - Python >= 3.6\n* for python support - SIP >= 4.12, PyQt >= 5.3 must match Qt version, Qscintilla2\n* for qgis mapserver - FastCGI\n* for oracle provider - Oracle OCI library\n\nIndirect dependencies:\n\nSome proprietary formats (e.g., ECW and MrSid) supported by GDAL require\nproprietary third party libraries.  QGIS doesn't need any of those itself to\nbuild, but will only support those formats if GDAL is built accordingly.  Refer\nto [format list](https://gdal.org/index.html) for instructions how to include\nthose formats in GDAL.\n\n# 3. Building on GNU/Linux\n\n## 3.1. Building QGIS with Qt 5.x\n\n**Requires:** Ubuntu / Debian derived distro\n\n**Note:** Refer to the section [Building Debian packages](#310-building-debian-packages)\nfor building debian packages. Unless you plan to develop on QGIS, that is\nprobably the easiest option to compile and install QGIS.\n\nThese notes are for Ubuntu - other versions and Debian derived distros may\nrequire slight variations in package names.\n\nThese notes are for if you want to build QGIS from source. One of the major\naims here is to show how this can be done using binary packages for ***all***\ndependencies - building only the core QGIS stuff from source. I prefer this\napproach because it means we can leave the business of managing system packages\nto apt and only concern ourselves with coding QGIS!\n\nThis document assumes you have made a fresh install and have a 'clean' system.\nThese instructions should work fine if this is a system that has already been\nin use for a while, you may need to just skip those steps which are irrelevant\nto you.\n\n## 3.2. Prepare apt\n\nYou will need a recent enough distribution in order for all dependencies\nto be met. The supported distributions are listed in the following section.\n\nNow update your local sources database:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\n```\n\n## 3.3. Install build dependencies\n\n|Distribution|Install command for packages|\n|------------|----------------------------|\n| bullseye | ``apt-get install bison build-essential ca-certificates ccache

`debian/`)\n\nSee [debian-ubuntu](https://qgis.org/resources/installation-guide/#debianubuntu) for\ncurrently supported distributions (plain xenial's GDAL for instance is too old\nand we build with GDAL2 from ubuntugis).\n\nTo build [QGIS server landing page/catalog webapp](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/server_manual/catalog.html) additional dependencies are required:\n\n* Node.js (current LTS recommended): https://nodejs.org/en/download/\n* Yarn Package Manager: https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install\n\nAdditionally, the cmake flag `WITH_SERVER_LANDINGPAGE_WEBAPP` needs to be turned on.\n\n## 3.4. Setup ccache (Optional, but recommended)\n\nYou should also setup ccache to speed up compile times:\n\n```bash\ncd /usr/local/bin\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/ccache gcc\nsudo ln -s /usr/bin/ccache g++\n```\n\nor simply add `/usr/lib/ccache` to your `PATH`.\n\n## 3.5. Prepare your development environment\n\nAs a convention I do all my development work in $HOME/dev/<language>, so in\nthis case we will create a work environment for C++ development work like\nthis:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ${HOME}/dev/cpp\ncd ${HOME}/dev/cpp\n```\n\nThis directory path will be assumed for all instructions that follow.\n\n## 3.6. Check out the QGIS Source Code\n\nThere are two ways the source can be checked out. Use the anonymous method\nif you do not have edit privileges for the QGIS source repository, or use\nthe developer checkout if you have permissions to commit source code\nchanges.\n\n1. Anonymous Checkout\n\n```bash\ncd ${HOME}/dev/cpp\ngit clone https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git\n```\n\n2. Developer Checkout\n\n```bash\ncd ${HOME}/dev/cpp\ngit clone git@github.com:qgis/QGIS.git\n```\n\n## 3.7. Starting the compile\n\nI compile my development version of QGIS into my ~/apps directory to avoid\nconflicts with Ubuntu packages that may be under /usr. This way for example\nyou can use the binary packages of QGIS on your system along side with your\ndevelopment version. I suggest you do something similar:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ${HOME}/apps\n```\n\nNow we create a build directory and run ccmake:\n\n```bash\ncd QGIS\nmkdir build-master\ncd build-master\nccmake ..\n```\n\nWhen you run ccmake (note the .. is required!), a menu will appear where\nyou can configure various aspects of the build:\n\n* If you want QGIS to have debugging capabilities then set `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` to `Debug`.\n* If you do not have root access or do not want to overwrite existing QGIS\n  installs (by your package manager for example), set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`\n  to somewhere you have write access to (For example `${HOME}/apps`).\n\nNow press 'c' to configure, 'e' to dismiss any error messages that may appear.\nand 'g' to generate the make files. Note that sometimes 'c' needs to\nbe pressed several times before the 'g' option becomes available.\nAfter the 'g' generation is complete, press 'q' to exit the ccmake\ninteractive dialog.\n\n**Warning:** Make sure that your build directory is completely empty when you\nenter the command. Do never try to \"re-use\" an existing **Qt5** build directory.\nIf you want to use `ccmake` or other interactive tools, run the command in\nthe empty build directory once before starting to use the interactive tools.\n\nNow on with the build:\n```bash\nmake -jX\n```\n\nwhere X is the number of available cores. Depending on your platform,\nthis can speed up the build time considerably.\n\nThen you can directly run from the build directory:\n```bash\n./output/bin/qgis\n```\nAnother option is to install to your system:\n```bash\nmake install\n```\n\nAfter that you can try to run QGIS:\n```bash\n$HOME/apps/bin/qgis\n```\nIf all has worked properly the QGIS application should start up and appear\non your screen. If you get the error message \"error while loading shared libraries\",\nexecute this command in your shell.\n```bash\nsudo ldconfig\n```\nIf that doesn't help add the install path to LD_LIBRARY_PATH:\n```bash\nexport LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:${HOME}/apps/lib/\n```\nOptionally, if you already know what aspects you want in your custom build\nthen you can skip the interactive ccmake .. part by using the cmake -D\noption for each aspect, e.g.:\n```bash\ncmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/apps ..\n```\nAlso, if you want to speed your build times, you can easily do it with ninja,\nan alternative to make with similar build options.\n\nFor example, to configure your build you can do either one of:\n```bash\nccmake -G Ninja ..\ncmake -G Ninja -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${HOME}/apps ..\n```\nBuild and install with ninja:\n```bash\nninja   # (uses all cores by default; also supports the above described -jX option)\nninja install\n```\nTo build even faster, you can build just the targets you need using, for example:\n```bash\nninja qgis\nninja pycore\n# if it's on desktop related code only:\nninja qgis_desktop\n```\n\n### 3.7.1 Available compilation flags\n\nQGIS build is tunable according to your needs. Many flags are available to activate or deactivate some functionalities, here is a subset:\n\n* `BUILD_WITH_QT6`: Enable (experimental) Qt6 support\n* `WITH_3D`: Determines whether QGIS 3D library should be built\n* `WITH_ANALYSIS`: Determines whether QGIS analysis library should be built\n* `WITH_AUTH`: Determines whether QGIS authentication methods should be built\n* `WITH_BINDINGS`: Determines whether Python bindings should be built\n* `WITH_COPC`: Determines whether Cloud Optimized Point Cloud (COPC) support should be built\n* `WITH_DESKTOP`: Determines whether QGIS desktop should be built\n* `WITH_EPT`: Determines whether Entwine Point Cloud (EPT) support should be built\n* `WITH_GRASS${GRASS_CACHE_VERSION}`: Determines whether GRASS ${GRASS_SEARCH_VERSION} plugin should be built\n* `WITH_GUI`: Determines whether QGIS GUI library (and everything built on top of it) should be built\n* `WITH_HANA`: Determines whether SAP HANA Spatial support should be built\n* `WITH_ORACLE`: Determines whether Oracle support should be built\n* `WITH_PDAL`: Determines whether PDAL support should be built\n* `WITH_POSTGRESQL`: Determines whether POSTGRESQL support should be built\n* `WITH_QGIS_PROCESS`: Determines whether the standalone \\\"qgis_process\\\" tool should be built\n* `WITH_QSPATIALITE`: Determines whether QSPATIALITE sql driver should be built\n* `WITH_SERVER`: Determines whether QGIS server should be built\n* `WITH_SPATIALITE`: Determines whether Spatialite support should be built (required for spatialite, virtual, wfs providers)\n\nA complete list can been extracted from the source code with the following command line:\n\n```bash\ncmake .. -N -LH | grep -B1 WITH_\n```\n\n## 3.8. Compiling with 3D\n\nIn the cmake, you need to enable:\n```bash\nWITH_3D=True\n```\n\n### 3.8.1. Compiling with 3D on old Debian based distributions\n\nQGIS 3D requires Qt53DExtras. These headers have been removed\nfrom Qt upstream on Debian Buster and Ubuntu focal (20.04) based distributions.\nA copy has been made in the QGIS repository in `external/qt3dextra-headers`.\nTo compile with 3D enabled on these distributions, you need to add some cmake options:\n\n```bash\nCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH={path to QGIS Git repo}/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake\nQT5_3DEXTRA_INCLUDE_DIR={path to QGIS Git repo}/external/qt3dextra-headers\nQT5_3DEXTRA_LIBRARY=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt53DExtras.so\nQt53DExtras_DIR={path to QGIS Git repo}/external/qt3dextra-headers/cmake/Qt53DExtras\n```\n\nAbove instructions do not apply to newer versions of Debian and Ubuntu.\n\n## 3.9. Building different branches\n\nBy using `git worktree`, you can switch between different branches to use\nseveral sources in parallel, based on the same Git configuration.\nWe recommend you to read the documentation about this Git command:\n\n```bash\ngit commit\ngit worktree add ../my_new_functionality\ncd ../my_new_functionality\ngit fetch qgis/master\ngit rebase -i qgis/master\n# only keep the commits to be pushed\ngit push -u my_own_repo my_new_functionality\n```\n\n## 3.10. Building Debian packages\n\nInstead of creating a personal installation as in the previous step you can\nalso create debian package. This is done from the QGIS root directory, where\nyou'll find a debian directory.\n\nFirst setup a changelog entry for your distribution. For example for Debian Bookworm:\n\n```bash\ndch -l ~bookworm --force-distribution --distribution bookworm \"bookworm build\"\n```\n\nYou also need to install the [build dependencies](#33-install-build-dependencies).\nAlternatively use:\n\n```bash\ndebian/rules templates\nsudo mk-build-deps -i\n```\n\nThe QGIS packages will be created with:\n\n```bash\ndpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b\n```\n\n**Note:** Install `devscripts` to get `dch` and `mk-build-deps`.\n\n**Note:** If you have `libqgis1-dev` installed, you need to remove it first\nusing `dpkg -r libqgis1-dev`.  Otherwise `dpkg-buildpackage` will complain about a\nbuild conflict.\n\n**Note:** By default tests are run in the process of building and their\nresults are uploaded to https://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS.\nYou can turn the tests off using `DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=nocheck` in front of the\nbuild command. The upload of results can be avoided with `DEB_TEST_TARGET=test`.\n\nThe packages are created in the parent directory (ie. one level up).\nInstall them using `dpkg`.  E.g.:\n\n```bash\nsudo debi\n```\n\n### 3.10.1. Building packages with Oracle support\n\nTo build packages with Oracle support you need the Oracle libraries (currently\n21.11) as additional build dependencies:\n\n```bash\ncurl -JLO https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/2111000/oracle-instantclient-devel-21.11.0.0.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm\ncurl -JLO https://download.oracle.com/otn_software/linux/instantclient/2111000/oracle-instantclient-basiclite-21.11.0.0.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm\nsudo apt install alien\nfakeroot alien oracle-instantclient-devel-21.11.0.0.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm oracle-instantclient-basiclite-21.11.0.0.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm\nsudo dpkg -i oracle-instantclient-devel_21.11.0.0.0-2_amd64.deb oracle-instantclient-basiclite_21.11.0.0.0-2_amd64.deb\n```\n\n(if the client version changes it's necessary to adapt `ORACLE_INCLUDEDIR` and `ORACLE_LIBDIR` in `debian/rules` accordingly)\n\nThe packaging files enable Oracle support if the distribution contains `-oracle`:\n\n```bash\ndch -l ~sid~oracle --force-distribution --distribution sid-oracle \"sid build with oracle\"                                                                                                                      │\ndpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b\n```\n\n## 3.11. On Fedora Linux\n\nWe assume that you have the source code of QGIS ready and created a\nnew subdirectory called `build` or `build-qt5` in it.\n\n### 3.11.1.

Building on Windows\n\n## 4.1. Building with Microsoft Visual Studio\n\nThis section describes how to build QGIS using Visual Studio (MSVC) 2019 on Windows.\nThe official Windows packages are built using OSGeo4W.\n\nThis section describes the setup required to allow Visual Studio to be used to\nbuild QGIS.\n\n### 4.1.1. Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition\n\nDownload and install the [free (as in free beer) Community installer](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/68d6b204-9df0-4fcc-abcc-08ee0eff9cb2/b029547488a9383b0c8d8a9c813e246feb3ec19e0fe55020d4878fde5f0983fe/vs_Community.exe)\n\nSelect \"Desktop Development with C++\"\n\n### 4.1.2. Other tools and dependencies\n\nDownload and install following packages:\n\n* [CMake](https://cmake.org/files/v3.12/cmake-3.12.3-win64-x64.msi)\n* GNU flex, GNU bison and GIT with [cygwin 64bit](https://cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe)\n* [OSGeo4W](https://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/v2/osgeo4w-setup.exe)\n* [ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases/download/v1.7.2/ninja-win.zip): Copy the `ninja.exe` to `C:\\OSGeo4W\\bin\\`\n\nFor the QGIS build you need to install following packages from cygwin:\n\n* bison\n* flex\n* git (even if you already have Git for Windows installed)\n\nand from OSGeo4W (select *Advanced Install*):\n\n* qgis-dev-deps\n\n  * This will also select packages the above packages depend on.\n\n  * Note: If you install other packages, this might cause issues. Particularly, make sure\n    **not** to install the msinttypes package. It installs a stdint.h file in\n    `OSGeo4W\\include`, that conflicts with Visual Studio own stdint.h, which for\n    example breaks the build of the virtual layer provider.\n\nIf you intend to also build all the dependencies, you can refer to [the OSGeo4W repository](https://github.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W).\n\n### 4.1.3. Clone the QGIS Source Code\n\nChoose a directory to store the QGIS source code.\nFor example, to put it in the OSGeo4W install, navigate there:\n\n```cmd\ncd C:\\OSGeo4W\n```\n\nThis directory will be assumed for all instructions\nthat follow.\n\nOn the command prompt clone the QGIS source from\ngit to the source directory `QGIS`:\n\n```cmd\ngit clone git://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git\n```\n\nThis requires Git. If you have Git for Windows on your PATH already,\nyou can do this from a normal command prompt. If you do not, you can\nuse the Git package that was installed as part of Cygwin by opening\na Cygwin[64] Terminal\n\nAnd, to avoid Git in Windows reporting changes to files not actually modified:\n\n```cmd\ncd QGIS\ngit config core.filemode false\n```\n\n### 4.1.4. OSGeo4W\n\nThe official Windows packages are made in OSGeo4W.  Also standalone MSI\ninstallers are also produced using the packages from OSGeo4W.\n\nThe nightly build of master (package qgis-dev) is made with the [OSGeo4W build\nrecipe](https://github.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W/blob/master/src/qgis-dev/osgeo4w/package.sh).\n\nThere are others for the long-term release build (qgis-ltr), the nightly of the\nnext long-term point release (qgis-ltr-dev), the latest release (qgis), the\nnightly build of the next point release (qgis-rel-dev).  All of those are\ncurrently based on Qt5.  A build recipe for master with Qt6 is available as\nqgis-qt6-dev.\n\nTo setup a build environment (including Visual C++ if not already installed) and to\nbuild the nightly run in a command line (cmd):\n\n```cmd\nmkdir osgeo4w-build\ncd osgeo4w-build\ncurl -JLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W/refs/heads/master/bootstrap.cmd\ncurl -JLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W/refs/heads/master/bootstrap.sh\nbootstrap.cmd qgis-dev\n```\n\nTo build other packages you can simply replace qgis-dev with other packages.\nCalling `bootstrap.cmd` without any arguments will build all packages\n(including all dependencies).\n\nAfter the build is succeeded the OSGeo4W packages will be in `x86_64/`.\n\nTo install the package you can add the `osgeo4w-build` directory as `User URL`\nin the OSGeo4W installer and select your `qgis-dev` package.\n\nThe MSIs are created with `scripts\\msis.sh` (actually `scripts/creatmsi.pl`).\n\n\n## 4.2. Building on Linux with mingw64\n\nWith this approach you can cross build a Windows binary on Linux using mingw64\nin a Docker container.\n\nTo build on Linux from your QGIS sources directory, launch:\n\n```cmd\nms-windows/mingw/build.sh\n```\n\nAfter a successful build, you will find two packages in the QGIS sources\ndirectory:\n\n- qgis-portable-win64.zip (QGIS for Windows 64bit)\n- qgis-portable-win64-debugsym.zip (debug symbols)\n\nThis method is also used in the continuous integrations process. After each pull\nrequest the two packages mentioned above are stored as GitHub actions artifacts\nand are available for download making it possible to quickly test changes on Windows.\n\n### 4.2.1. Building with Docker\n\nThis is the simplest way, but you need to have Docker installed\non your system.\n\nYou can use a Docker image to cross build QGIS by calling\nthe script ms-windows/mxe/build.sh from the root directory of QGIS repository.\n\n=== Building without Docker ====\n\nThis requires to install mxe toolchain on your system and build\nall dependencies by yourself.\n\n#### 4.2.1.1. Initial setup\n\nPlease follow the instructions on mxe website to setup your building toolchain http://mxe.cc/,\ntake note of the path where you have installed mxe.\n\n#### 4.2.1.2. Building the dependencies\n\nPlease see README.md under ms-windows/mxe for detailed instructions and for the\nlist of dependencies that need to be built in mxe before attempting to build QGIS.\n\n#### 4.2.1.3. Cross-Building QGIS\n\nEdit the build-mxe.sh script and optionally adjust the path where your mxe installation is located, you\ncan also change the build and release directories.\n\n### 4.2.2. Testing QGIS\n\nCopy and unzip on the Windows machine package produced by the build and launch the qgis binary: no installation\nis required.\n\n## 4.3 Building on Windows with vcpkg\n\nVcpkg is a free and open source cross platform ecosystem for libraries.\nIt provides precise control over the versions of dependencies that are used.\n\n### 4.3.1 Install Build Tools\n\n1. Download and install the free (as in free beer) [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&channel=Release&version=VS2022).\n2. Obtain [winflexbison](https://github.com/lexxmark/winflexbison/releases).\n\n### 4.3.2 Build QGIS\n\nThere are two ways, to build with vcpkg. Either you download an sdk, which allows you\nto reuse dependencies that are already built. This is generally easier and recommended.\nIt is also possible to build all dependencies yourself, which gives you more control\nover the dependencies.\n\n#### 4.3.2.1 Build with an SDK\n\n1. Download and unzip SDK. Get the latest [QGIS master SDK](https://nightly.link/qgis/QGIS/workflows/windows-qt6/master/qgis-sdk-x64-windows.zip).\n2. Build\n\nWe will now configure QGIS.\n\nOpen a _Developer PowerShell for VS 2022_\n\n```ps\n# We assume you have a copy of the QGIS source code available\n# and have changed the working directory into it\n\n# Configure\ncmake -S . `\n      -B build `\n      -DSDK_PATH=\"path/to/vcpkg-export-[date]\" `\n      -DBUILD_WITH_QT6=ON `\n      -DWITH_QTWEBKIT=OFF `\n      -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-release `\n      -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE=\"path/to/flex-executable\" `\n      -DBISON_EXECUTABLE=\"path/to/bison-executable\"\n```\n\nThis will provide you with a configured project. You can either build it directly\nfrom the command line.\n\n```ps\n# Build\n# Note: you can also use RelWithDebInfo to have debug symbols in your build\ncmake --build build --config Release\n```\n\nOr you can open the generated `.sln` file in the `build` folder with Visual Studio.\nThis will allow you to use all the tools that this IDE has to offer.\n\n#### 4.3.2.1 Build all the dependencies locally\n\nIt is also possible to build all the dependencies locally.\nThis will require some time, cpu and disk space.\n\n```ps\n# We assume you have a copy of the QGIS source code available\n# and have changed the working directory into it\n\n# Configure\ncmake -S . `\n      -B build `\n      -D WITH_VCPKG=ON `\n      -D BUILD_WITH_QT6=ON `\n      -D WITH_QTWEBKIT=OFF `\n      -D VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=x64-windows-release `\n      -D VCPKG_HOST_TRIPLET=x64-windows-release\n```\n\n**Manage dependency versions**\n\nThe dependencies are defined in the file `vcpkg/vcpkg.json`.\nThis file defines which versions of registries are used.\nTo update to the most recent version, you can use the command `vcpkg x-update-baseline --x-manifest-root=vcpkg`.\nIf you want to patch or update a specific dependency, you can copy the port for this\ndependency into the folder `vcpkg/ports`. Whenever the build is reconfigured, it will check for dependencies that need to be rebuilt.\n\n\n# 5. Building on MacOS X\n\nIf you want to test QGIS, easiest option is to download and install all-in-one self-containing bundle directly from\n\nhttps://download.qgis.org/downloads/macos/\n\nIf you want to build or develop QGIS on your own, you need a set of dependencies and tools.\nYou can use\n\n- the same set of dependencies that are used for all-in-one QGIS bundle\n- vcpkg based dependencies for building with Qt6\n- with Homebrew, MacPorts or Conda dependencies (not covered in this guide)\n\n## 5.1. Building with Mac Packager\n\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Mac-Packager\n\nIncluded are notes for building on latest Mac OS X with latest updates installed.\nThe build uses clang compiler.\n\nParallel Compilation: On multiprocessor/multicore Macs, it's possible to\nspeed up compilation, but it's not automatic.  Whenever you type \"make\" (but\nNOT \"make install\"), instead type:\n\n```bash\nmake -j [#cpus]\n```\n\nReplace [#cpus] with the number of cores and/or processors your Mac has.\nTo find out how many CPUs you have available, run the following in Terminal:\n\n```bash\n/usr/sbin/sysctl -n hw.ncpu\n```\n\n### 5.1.1. Install Developer Tools\n\nDeveloper tools are not a part of a standard OS X installation.\nAs minimum you require command line tools\n\n```bash\nsudo xcode-select --install\n```\n\nbut installation of Xcode from the App Store is recommended too.\n\n### 5.1.2. Install CMake and other build tools\n\nFor example install Homebrew\n\n```bash\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\n```\n\nand these development/build tools\n\n```bash\nbrew install git cmake ninja pkg-config wget bash-completion curl gnu-sed coreutils ccache libtool astyle help2man autoconf automake pandoc\n```\n\nif you have these tools installed from MacPorts or Conda, it is the same, but we will need to be able to\nrun `cmake` and others from Terminal in the following steps\n\n### 5.1.3. Install Qt5 and QGIS-Deps\n\nTo build QGIS, we need Qt5 and FOSS dependencies on hand. The Qt5 version ideally should match the version that was\nused to build dependency package.\n\nDownload the latest QGIS-Deps install script, qt package and QGIS-Deps packages from\n\nhttps://download.qgis.org/downloads/macos/deps\n\nYou should have one bash script and two tar archive in your download folder.\nRun the install script to install Qt and QGIS-Deps to `/opt/` area. You need\nroot privileges or have write access to `/opt/Qt` and `/opt/QGIS`.\n\nAlternatively you can download and install Qt Open Source for MacOS from the\n\nhttps://www.qt.io/\n\nin the same version as referenced in the install script. It must be installed in `/opt/Qt`\n\nNote that the QGIS-Deps package is not yet signed, so you may need to add Terminal\nto System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Privacy -> Developer Tools or manually accept usage\nof the libraries when asked by system.\n\n### 5.1.4. QGIS source\n\nUnzip the QGIS source to a working folder of your choice.\nIf you are reading this from the source, you've already done this.\n\nIf you want to experiment with the latest development sources, go to the github\nQGIS project page:\n\nhttp://github.com/qgis/QGIS\n\nIt should default to the master branch.  Click the Downloads button and\nselect Download .tar.gz. Double-click the tarball to unzip it.\n\n*Alternatively*, use git and clone the repository by\n```bash\ngit clone git://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git\n```\n\n### 5.1.5. Configure the build\n\nCMake supports out of source build so we will create a 'build' dir for the\nbuild process. OS X uses `${HOME}/Applications` as a standard user app folder (it\ngives it the system app folder icon).  If you have the correct permissions you\nmay want to build straight into your `/Applications` folder. The instructions\nbelow assume you are building into a `${HOME}/Applications` directory.\n\nIn a Terminal cd to the qgis source folder previously downloaded, then:\n\n```bash\ncd ..\nmkdir build\ncd build\n\nQGIS_DEPS_VERSION=0.9;\\\nQT_VERSION=5.15.2;\\\nPATH=/opt/QGIS/qgis-deps-${QGIS_DEPS_VERSION}/stage/bin:$PATH;\\\ncmake \\\n  -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/Applications \\\n  -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \\\n  -D QGIS_MAC_DEPS_DIR=/opt/QGIS/qgis-deps-${QGIS_DEPS_VERSION}/stage \\\n  -D CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/Qt/${QT_VERSION}/clang_64 \\\n  ../QGIS\n```\n\nNote: Don't forget the `../QGIS` on the last line, which tells CMake to look for the source files.\n\nNote: Double check on the screen output that all libraries are picked from QGIS-Deps `/opt/QGIS`\nand not from system `/usr/lib` or Homebrew's `/usr/local/` or system Frameworks `/Library/Frameworks/`.\nEspecially check Proj, GDAL, sqlite3 and Python paths.\n\nAfter the initial Terminal configure, you can use ccmake to make further changes:\n\n```bash\ncd build\nccmake ../QGIS\n```\n\n### 5.1.6. Building\n\nNow we can start the build process (remember the parallel compilation note at\nthe beginning, this is a good place to use it, if you can):\n\n```bash\nmake -j [#cpus]\n```\n\nNow you can run the QGIS from build directory by `./output/bin/QGIS.app/Contents/MacOS/QGIS`\n\nIf all built without errors you can then install it:\n\n```bash\nmake install\n```\n\nor, for an /Applications build:\n\n```bash\nsudo make install\n```\n\nFor running the installed QGIS, you need to keep the dependencies in `/opt/` folder in place.\nIf you want to create bundle that runs without these dependencies, please read the documentation in project\n\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Mac-Packager\n\n## 5.2. Building with vcpkg\n\nWith [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/) you can develop QGIS using\nQt6.\n\nInstall and initialize vcpkg\n\n```sh\n. <(curl https://aka.ms/vcpkg-init.sh -L)\n```\n\nInstall build tools using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)\n\n```sh\nbrew install git cmake flex bison automake autoconf libtool nasm ninja\n```\n\nGet the QGIS source code\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:qgis/QGIS.git\n```\n\nPrepare the env for homebrew tools\n\n```sh\nexport PATH=$(brew --prefix bison)/bin:$(brew --prefix flex)/bin:$(brew --prefix libtool)/bin:$PATH\n```\n\nSelect the target architecture (arm64 is for M series processors).\nWe will assume that you build for the same architecture that you build on.\nIf that is not the case (e.g. you build for x64 on a arm64 machine), adjust\nthe `HOST_TRIPLET` in the next step.\n\n```sh\nTRIPLET=arm64-osx-dynamic-release\n# TRIPLET=x64-osx-dynamic-release\n```\n\nConfigure\n\n```sh\ncmake -S . \\\n      -G Ninja \\\n      -B build \\\n      -D WITH_VCPKG=ON \\\n      -D BUILD_WITH_QT6=ON \\\n      -D WITH_QTWEBKIT=OFF \\\n      -D WITH_BINDINGS=ON \\\n      -D QGIS_MACAPP_FRAMEWORK=OFF \\\n      -D VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=\"$TRIPLET\" \\\n      -D VCPKG_HOST_TRIPLET=\"$TRIPLET\" \\\n      -D CREATE_MACOSX_BUNDLE=OFF\n```\n\nBuild (switch the target to `Release` if you do not want to debug)\n\n```sh\ncmake --build build --target RelWithDebInfo\n```\n\n# 6. Setting up the WCS test server on GNU/Linux\n\n**Requires:** Ubuntu / Debian derived distro\n\nThese notes are for Ubuntu - other versions and Debian derived distros may\nrequire slight variations in package names.\n\n## 6.1. Preparation\n\nNote the git repo below will change to the default QGIS repo once this work\nis integrated into master.\n\n```bash\ngit remote add blazek git://github.com/blazek/Quantum-GIS.git\ngit fetch blazek\ngit branch --track wcs2 blazek/wcs2\ngit checkout wcs2\ncd /var/www/\nsudo mkdir wcs\nsudo chown timlinux wcs\ncd wcs/\nmkdir cgi-bin\ncd cgi-bin/\n```\n\n## 6.2. Setup mapserver\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get install cgi-mapserver\n```\n\nSet the contents of `/var/www/wcs/cgi-bin/wcstest-1.9.0` to:\n\n```bash\n#! /bin/sh\nMS_MAPFILE=/var/www/wcs/testdata/qgis-1.9.0/raster/wcs.map\nexport MS_MAPFILE\n/usr/lib/cgi-bin/mapserv\n```\n\nThen do:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x var/www/wcs/cgi-bin/wcstest-1.9.0\nmkdir -p /var/www/wcs/testdata/qgis-1.9.0/raster/\ncd /var/www/wcs/testdata/qgis-1.9.0/raster/\ncp -r /home/timlinux/QGIS/tests/testdata/raster/* .\n```\n\nEdit `/var/www/wcs/testdata/qgis-1.9.0/raster/wcs.map` and set the shapepath to this:\n\n```bash\nSHAPEPATH \"/var/www/wcs/testdata/qgis-1.9.0/raster\"\n```\n\nThen create `/var/www/wcs/7-wcs.example.com.conf` setting the contents to this:\n\n```bash\n<VirtualHost*:80>\nServerName wcs.example.com\nServerAdmin wcs-admin@example.com\n\nLogLevel warn\nLogFormat \"%h %l %u %t \\\"%r\\\" %>s %b \\\"%{Referer}i\\\" \\\"%{User-Agent}i\\\" \\\"%{forensic-id}n\\\"\" combined\nCustomLog /var/log/apache2/wcs_example.com/access.log combined\nErrorLog /var/log/apache2/wcs_example.com/error.log\n\nDocumentRoot /var/www/wcs/html\n\nScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/wcs/cgi-bin/\n<Directory \"/var/www/wcs/cgi-bin\">\n\tAllowOverride None\n\tOptions +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch\n\tOrder allow,deny\n\tAllow from all\n</Directory>\n\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteRule /1.9.0/wcs /cgi-bin/wcstest-1.9.0 [PT]\n\n</VirtualHost>\n```\n\n\n## 6.3. Create a home page\n\n```bash\nmkdir html\nvim html/index.html\n```\n\nSet the contents to:\n```\nThis is the test platform for QGIS' wcs client. You can use these services\nfrom QGIS directly (to try out WCS for example) by pointing your QGIS to:\nhttp://wcs.example.com/1.9.0/wcs\n```\n\n## 6.4. Now deploy it\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir /var/log/apache2/wcs_example.com\nsudo chown www-data /var/log/apache2/wcs_example.com\ncd /etc/apache2/sites-available/\nsudo ln -s /var/www/wcs/7-wcs.example.com.conf .\ncd /var/www/wcs/\nsudo a2ensite 7-wcs.example.com.conf\nsudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload\n```\n\n## 6.5. Debugging\n\n```bash\nsudo tail -f /var/log/apache2/wcs_example.com/error.log\n```\n\n# 7. Setting up a Jenkins Build Server\n\n**Assumption:** You know how to make a working build environment and want to\ndeploy it under Jenkins for continuous integration testing now.\n\nThese notes are terse, I will expand on them later as the need arises. The\nprocedure is:\n\n* Install Jenkins and get it configured according to your own preferences\n* Make sure you have the git, github, junit etc plugins installed. A complete\nlist of the plugins I have installed follows (note that you almost certainly\ndon't need evey plugin listed here):\n  * External Monitor Job Type Plugin\n  * LDAP Plugin\n  * pam-auth\n  * javadoc\n  * ant\n  * Jenkins Subversion Plug-in\n  * Git Plugin\n  * Maven 2 Project Plugin\n  * Jenkins SLOCCount Plug-in\n  * Jenkins Sounds plugin\n  * Jenkins Translation Assistance plugin\n  * ruby-runtime\n  * Jenkins CVS Plug-in\n  * Coverage/Complexity Scatter Plot PlugIn\n  * Status Monitor Plugin\n  * Git Parameter Plug-In\n  * github-api\n  * GitHub plugin\n  * Jenkins Violations plugin\n  * git-notes Plugin\n  * Twitter plugin\n  * Jenkins Cobertura Plugin\n  * Jenkins Gravatar plugin\n  * Jenkins SSH Slaves plugin\n* Create a Job called 'QGIS'\n* Use the following options for your job:\n  * Job Name: QGIS\n  * Job Type: Build a free-style software project\n  * Tick enable project based security (you need to elsewhere configure your\nJenkins security to per project settings)\n  * Allow Anonymous user Read and Discover access\n  * Set the github project to https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/\n  * Set source code management to Git\n  * Set repository url to git://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git\n  * In advanced repository url settings set refspec to `+refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master`\n  * Set branch to build to master\n  * Repository Browser: Auto\n  * Build triggers: set to Poll SCM and set schedule to `*****` (polls every minute)\n  * Build - Execute shell and set shell script to:\n\n```bash\ncd build\ncmake ..\nxvfb-run --auto-servernum --server-num=1 \\\n  --server-args=\"-screen 0 1024x768x24\" \\\n  make Experimental || true\nif [ -f Testing/TAG ] ; then\n  xsltproc ../tests/ctest2junix.xsl \\\n    Testing/`head -n 1 < Testing/TAG`/Test.xml > \\\n    CTestResults.xml\nfi\n```\n\n  * Add Junit post build action and set 'Publish Junit test result report' to:\n`build/CTestResults.xml`\n  * Email notification: Send separate e-mails to individuals who broke the build\n  * Jenkins sounds - set up sounds for Failure, Success and Unstable.\n  * Save\n\nNow open the Job dash board and push something to QGIS and wait a minute to\nvalidate automated builds work.\n\n**Note:** You will need to log in to the Jenkins user account and go to\n/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/QGIS/workspace, then make a `build` directory and run\nthe initial cmake setup and then do test build. This process is the same as\ndescribed elsewhere in this doc.\n\nI based some of the set up from this nice blog article here:\n\nhttp://alexott.blogspot.com/2012/03/jenkins-cmakectest.html\n\n# 8. Debug output and running tests\n\nIf you are interested in seeing embedded debug output, change the following\nCMake option:\n\n```bash\n-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG  # (or RELWITHDEBINFO)\n```\n\nThis will flood your terminal or system log with lots of useful output from\nQgsDebugMsg() calls in source code.\n\nIf you would like to run the test suite, you will need to do so from the build\ndirectory, as it will not work with the installed/bundled app. First set the\nCMake option to enable tests:\n\n```bash\n-D ENABLE_TESTS=TRUE\n```\n\nThen run all tests from build directory:\n\n```bash\ncd build\nmake test\n```\n\nTo run all tests and report to http://cdash.orfeo-toolbox.org/index.php?project=QGIS\n\n```bash\ncd build\nmake Experimental\n```\n\nYou can define the host name reported via 'make Experimental' by setting a CMake\noption:\n\n```bash\n-D SITE=\"my.domain.org\"\n```\n\nTo run specific test(s) (see 'man ctest'):\n\n```bash\ncd build\n# show listing of tests, without running them\nctest --show-only\n\n# run specific C++ or Python test(s) matching a regular expression\nctest --verbose --tests-regex SomeTestName\n```\n\n# 9.

The spanish\ntranslation was also updated.\n\n# What's new in Version 2.0.0 'Dufour'?\n\nThis is a new major release. Building on the foundation of\nQGIS 1.x.x releases, QGIS Dufour introduces many new features,\nimprovements and bug fixes. Here is a summary of some of the\nkey new features.\n\n- We have updated out icon theme to use the 'GIS' theme which introduces\nan improved level of consistency and professionalism to the QGIS user\ninterface.\n- The new symbol layer overview uses a clear, tree-structured layout\nwhich allows for easy and fast access to all symbol layers.\n- QGIS 2.0 now includes Oracle Spatial support.\n- With the new data defined properties, it is possible to control symbol\ntype, size, color, rotation, and many other properties through feature\nattributes.\n- You can now place html elements onto your map.\n- Having nicely aligned map items is critical to making nice printed\nmaps. Auto snapping lines have been added to allow for easy composer\nobject alignment by simply dragging an object close to another.\n- Sometimes you need to align objects a curtain distance on the composer.\nWith the new manual snapping lines you are able to add manual snap lines\nwhich allow for better align objects using a common alignment. Simply\ndrag from the top or side ruler to add new guide line.\n- Ever needed to generate a map series? Of course you have. The composer\nnow includes built in map series generation using the atlas feature.\nCoverage layers can be points, lines, polygons, and the current feature\nattribute data is available in labels for on the fly value replacement.\n- A single composer window can now contain more then one page.\n- The composer label item in 1.8 was quite limited and only allowed a single\ntoken $CURRENT_DATE to be used. In 2.0 full expression support has been\nadded too greater power and control of the final labels.\n- The map frame now contains the ability to show the extents of another\nmap and will update when moved. Using this with the atlas generation\nfeature now core in the composer allows for some slick map generation.\nOverview frame style uses the same styling as a normal map polygon\nobject so your creativity is never restricted.\n- Layer blending makes it possible to combine layers in new and exciting\nways. While in older versions, all you could do was to make the layer\ntransparent, you can now choose between much more advanced options such as\n\"multiply\", \"darken only\", and many more. Blending can be used in the\nnormal map view as well as in print composer.\n- HTML support has been added map composer label item to give you even\nmore control over your final maps. HTML labels support full css styles\nsheets, html, and even JavaScript if you are that way inclined.\n- The labeling system has been totally overhauled - it now includes many\nnew features such as drop shadows, 'highway shields', many more data bound\noptions, and various performance enhancements. We are slowly doing away\nwith the 'old labels' system, although you will still find that\nfunctionality available for this release, you should expect that it will\ndisappear in a follow up release.\n- The full power of normal label and rule expressions can now be used for\nlabel properties. Nearly every property can be defined with an expression\nor field value giving you more control over the label result. Expressions\ncan refer to a field (e.g. set the font size to the value of the field\n'font') or can include more complex logic. Examples of bindable\nproperties include: Font, Size, Style and Buffer size.\n- With the expression engine being used more and more though out QGIS to\nallow for things like expression based labels and symbol, many more\nfunctions have been added to the expression builder and are all accessible\nthough the expression builder. All functions include comprehensive help\nand usage guides for ease of use.\n- If the expression engine doesn't have the function that you need. Not to\nworry. New functions can be added via a plugin using a simple Python API.\n- The Python API has been revamped to allow for a more cleaner, more\npythonic, programming experience. The QGIS 2.0 API uses SIP V2 which\nremoves the messy toString(), toInt() logic that was needed when working\nwith values. Types are now converted into native Python types making for a\nmuch nicer API. Attributes access is now done on the feature itself using\na simple key lookup, no more index lookup and attribute maps.\n**Note:*- Most plugins written for QGIS < 1.x will need to be\nported to work correctly in QGIS 2.x. Please consult\nhttps://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20\nfor more details.\n- The raster data provider system has been completely overhauled. One of\nthe best new features stemming from this work is the ability to 'Layer ->\nSave As...' to save any raster layer as a new layer. In the process you\ncan clip, resample, and reproject the layer to a new Coordinate Reference\nSystem. You can also save a raster layer as a rendered image so if you for\nexample have single band raster that you have applied a color palette to,\nyou can save the rendered layer out to a georeferenced RGB layer.\n- There are many, many more new features  in QGIS 2.0 - we invite\nyou to explore the software and discover them all!\n\n# What's new in Version 1.8.0 'Lisboa'?\n\nThis is a new feature release. Building on the foundation of\nQGIS 1.7.x releases, Lisboa introduces many new features,\nimprovements and bug fixes. Here is a summary of some of the\nkey new features.\n\n- QGIS Browser - a stand alone app and a new panel in QGIS. The browser lets you easily navigate your file system and connection based (PostGIS, WFS etc.) datasets, preview them and drag and drop items into the canvas.\n- DB Manager - the DB manager is now officially part of QGIS core. You can drag layers from the QGIS Browser into DB Manager and it will import your layer into your spatial database. Drag and drop tables between spatial databases and they will get imported. You can use the DB Manager to execute SQL queries against your spatial database and then view the spatial output for queries by adding the results to QGIS as a query layer.\n- Action Tool - now there is a tool on the map tools toolbar that will allow you to click on a vector feature and execute an action.\n- MSSQL Spatial Support - you can now connect to your Microsoft SQL Server spatial databases using QGIS.\n- Customization - allows setting up simplified QGIS interface by hiding various components of main window and widgets in dialogs.\n- New symbol layer types - Line Pattern Fill, Point Pattern fill\n- Composers - have multiple lines on legend items using a specified character\n- Expression based labeling\n- Heatmap tool - a new core plugin has been added for generating raster heatmaps from point data. You may need to activate this plugin using the plugin manager.\n- GPS Tracking - The GPS live tracking user interface was overhauled and many fixes and improvements were added to it.\n- Menu Re-organisation - The menus were re-organised a little - we now have separate menus for Vector and Raster and many plugins were updated to place their menus in the new Vector and Raster top level menus.\n- Offset Curves - a new digitizing tool for creating offset curves was added.\n- Terrain Analysis Plugin - a new core plugin was added for doing terrain analysis - and it can make really good looking colored relief maps.\n- Ellipse renderer - symbollayer to render ellipse shapes (and also rectangles, triangles, crosses by specifying width and height). Moreover, the symbol layer allows setting all parameters (width, height, colors, rotation, outline with) from data fields, in mm or map units\n- New scale selector with predefined scales\n- Option to add layers to selected or active group\n- Pan To Selected tool\n- New tools in Vector menu - densify geometries, Build spatial index\n- Export/add geometry column tool can export info using layer CRS, project CRS or ellipsoidal measurements\n- Model/view based tree for rules in rule-based renderer\n- Updated CRS selector dialog\n- Improvements in Spatial Bookmarks\n- Plugin metadata in metadata.txt\n- New plugin repository\n- Refactored postgres data provider: support for arbitrary key (including non-numeric and multi column), support for requesting a certain geometry type and/or srid in QgsDataSourceURI\nadded gdal_fillnodata to GDALTools plugin\n- Support for PostGIS TopoGeometry datatype\n- Python bindings for vector field symbollayer and general updates to the python bindings.\n- New message log window\n- Benchmark program\n- Row cache for attribute table\n- Legend independent drawing order\n- UUID generation widget for attribute table\n- Added support of editable views in SpatiaLite databases\n- Expression based widget in field calculator\n- Creation of event layers in analysis lib using linear referencing\n- Group selected layers option added to the TOC context menu\n- load/save layer style (new symbology) from/to SLD document\n- WFS support in QGIS Server\n- Option to skip WKT geometry when copying from attribute table\n- upport for zipped and gzipped layers\n- Test suite now passes all tests on major platforms and nightly tests\n- Copy and paste styles between layers\n- Set tile size for WMS layers\n- Support for nesting projects within other projects\n\n# What's new in Version 1.7.2 'Wroclaw'?\n\nThis is a bugfix release over version 1.7.1.

As\nsuch it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over QGIS\n1.0.x and QGIS 1.3.0. If an unchanging user interface, programmatic API and\nlong term support is more important to you then cool new and untested features,\nwe recommend that you use a copy of QGIS from our Long Term Support (LTS)1.0.x\nrelease series. In all other cases we recommend that you use this version.\n\nThis release includes around 200 bug fixes, nearly 30 new features and has had\na lot of love and attention poured into it to take our favorite desktop GIS\napplication another step on the road to GIS nirvana! So much has happened in\nthe 3 months since our last release that it is impossible to document\neverything here. Instead we will just highlight a couple of important new\nfeatures for you.\n\nProbably the biggest new feature is the addition of the new vector symbology\ninfrastructure. This is provided alongside the old implementation - you can\nswitch using a button in the vector layer properties dialog. It doesn't replace\nthe old symbology implementation completely yet because there are various isues\nthat need to be resolved and a large amount of testinhen it is considered\nready.\n\nQGIS now has a field calculator, accessible via a button in the attribute\nsection of the vector properties, and from the attribute table user interface.\nYou can use feature length, feature area, string concatenation and type\nconversions in the field calculator, as well as field values.\n\nThe map composer has had a lot of attention. A grid can now be added to\ncomposer maps. Composer maps can now be rotated in the layout. The limitation\nof a single map layout per project has been removed. A new composer manager\ndialog has been added to manage the existing composer instances. The composer\nwidget property sheets have been completely overhauled to use less screen space\n\nVarious parts of the user interface have been overhauled with the goal of\nimproving consistency and to improve support for netbooks and other smaller\nscreen devices. Loading and saving of shortcuts. Position can now be displayed\nas Degrees, Minutes, Seconds in the status bar. The add, move and delete vertex\nbuttons are now removed and the node tool is moved from the advanced editing\ntoolbar to the standard editing toolbar. The identification tool has also\nundergone numerous improvements.\n\nA render caching capability has been added to QGIS. This speeds up common\noperations such as layer re-ordering, changing symbology, WMS / WFS client,\nhiding / showing layers and opens the door for future enhancements such as\nthreaded rendering and pre-compositing layer cache manipulation. Note that it\nis disabled by default, and can be enabled in the options dialog.\n\nUser defined SVG search paths are now added to the options dialog.\n\nWhen creating a new shapefile, you can now specify its CRS. Also the avoid\nintersections option for polygons is now also possible with background layers.\n\nFor power users, you can now create customizable attribute forms using Qt\nDesigner dialog UIs.\n\n# What's new in Version 1.3.0 'Mimas'?\n\nThis release includes over 30 bug fixes and several useful new features:\n\n## OSM plugin &amp; provider updates\n\n- new OSM style files.\n- new icons.\n- dialog text updated and completed.\n- \"Saving OSM into file\" functionality was improvements.\n- fixed some problems with encoding... ascii to utf-8.\n- all OSM layers are automatically removed after disabling OSM plugin in plugin manager.\n- other OSM related bugfixes.\n\n## Other notable features and improvements in this release\n\n- Marker size is now configurable when editing a layer.\n- Incorporation of the analysis library into the mainstream release.\n- Identify features across multiple layers.\n- Added a new plugin for carrying out raster terrain analysis (computing slope\naspect, steepness etc).\n- A reshape tool to apply to line/polygon geometries. The part of a geometry\nbetween the first and last intersection of the reshape line will be replaced.\n- Added snapping to current layer in measure dialog.\n- Added ability to select the primary key for views.\n- Zoom to a coordinate by entering it in the status bar coordinate display.\n\n# Version 1.2.0 'Daphnis'\n\nPlease note that this is a release in our 'cutting edge' release series. As\nsuch it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over\nQGIS 1.0.x. If stability and long term support is more important to you\nthen cool new and untested features, we recommend that you use a copy\nof QGIS from our stable 1.0.x release series.\nThis release includes over 140 bug fixes and enhancements\nover the QGIS 1.1.0 release. In addition we have added\nthe following new features:\n\n## Editing\n\nEditing functionality in QGIS has had a major update in this release. This\nincludes the addition of new vector editing tools:\n\n- delete part of multipart feature\n- delete hole from polygon\n- simplify feature\n- Added a new \"node\" tool (in advanced digitizing toolbar).\n- New functionality for merging features\n- Added undo/redo functionality for vector layer editing.\n- Added option to show only markers of selected features in editing mode.\n- Change layer's icon in legend to reflext that the layer is editable.\n\nIn addition, there are undo/redo actions in Edit menu, in Advanced digitizing toolbar\nand there is a new dock widget displaying undo stack of active layer.\n\nAbout the node tool: It resembles a tool for editing paths by nodes that is\npresent in every vector editor. How does it work (in QGIS)? Click on a\nfeature, its nodes will be marked by small rectangles. Clicking and dragging a\nnode moves it. Double clicking a segment will add a new node. Pressing delete\nkey will remove active node. It's possible to select more active nodes at\nonce: by clicking and dragging a rectangle. It's possible to select a segment's\nadjacent nodes by clicking on the segment. It's possible to add/remove active\nnodes by using Ctrl when clicking a node or dragging a rectangle\n\nWe recommend that you turn off vertex markers in QGIS options when working with\nthis tool: the redraws are much faster and the map is not cluttered with\nmarkers.\n\n## Keyboard shortcuts\n\nNew feature: configure shortcuts for actions within main window of qgis!\nSee menu Setting->Configure shortcuts\n\n## Map Composer\n\nIt is now possible to lock/unlock composer item positions by right mouse click.\nThe width and height of the composer map will now remain fixed if user sets the\ncomposer map extent to the map canvas extent. possibility to display\ncurrent date in composer label by typing (d 'June' yyyy) or similar.\nIt is now possible to keep the current layers in a composer map even if further\nlayers are added to the main map. Export to PDF in composer is now possible.\n\n## Attribute tables\n\nIt is now possible to search the attribute table within selected records only.\nGeneral speedups have been made on the attribute table. Setting of field width\nand precision when adding attributes is now possible. Handling of attribute\ntypes in WFS provider has bee improved.\n\nAttribute aliases for vector layers are now available. The aliases are shown\ninstead of the original field names in the info tool and attribute table to\nmake things easier for end users. There is now a GUI for setting edit widgets\nfor layer attributes.  A new dialog allows loading a value map from a layer\n(could be non-spatial table too!).  The edit widgets settings will also now\nbe respected in the attribute table.\n\n## Plugins\n\n- The order of layers in the WMS dialog can now be changed.\n- The eVis plugin, version 1.1.0, has been added to the QGIS project and\nincluded as a standard plugin. More information about eVis can be found here:\nhttp://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/evis/documentation.php .\n- The interpolation plugin now has the ability to use line layers as constrains\nfor triangulation in interpolation plugin. You can also now save the\ntriangulation to shape file.\n- An new OpenStreetMap provider and plugin have been added to QGIS.\n\n## Projects Management\n\nQGIS now includes support for  project relative position of file data sources\nand svgs. The saving of relative paths of file data sources is optional.\n\n## PostGIS & the PostgreSQL Provider\n\nYou can now select the SSL mode when adding a new DB connection. Turning off\nSSL encryption can greatly improve performance of PostGIS data loading where\nconnection security is not required. Support has been added for more native\ntypes and for setting of column comments.\n\n## Symbology enhancements\n\n- allow refresh of symbols via popup menu on the renderer's symbol selection\n- add support for data defined symbols\n- add support for font symbol markers (only data defined - no gui yet)\n- add symbol size in map units (ie. symbols that keep the size in mapunits\nindependent of the mapscale)\n\n## Command line arguments\n\nAdded command line argument support on windows.\nEnhancement of command line arguments:\n\n- allow given snapshot sizes\n- allow suppression of splash screen\n- capture map decorations from plugins on snapshots\n\n## Grass\n\nThere is a new GRASS shell. Also there have been many cleanups and consistency\nupdates.\n\n# Version 1.1.0 'Pan'\n\nPlease note that this is a release in our 'unstable' release series. As\nsuch it contains new features and extends the programmatic interface over\nQGIS 1.0.x. If stability and long term support is more important to you\nthen cool new and untested features, we recommend that you use a copy\nof QGIS from our stable 1.0.x release series.\n\nThis release includes many bug fixes and enhancements\nover the QGIS 1.0.0 release. In addition we have added\nthe following new features:\n\n- Updates to translations.\n- Improvements and polishing of the Python plugin installer.

The\nWFS provider now also shows progress information as it is fetching data.\n- Improvements the PostGIS client support. Massive speedups in PostGIS layer\nrendering can now be achieved by disabling SSL in the connection editor.\n- Mapserver Export improvements for continuous color support.\n- Added tools menu - the fTools plugins are now part of the core QGIS\nplugins and will always be installed by default.\n- Improvements to the print composer including object alignment options. It\nis also now possible to print maps as postcript raster or vector. For\npython programmers, the composer classes now have python bindings.\n- When using File - Save as image, the saved image is now georeferenced.\n- Projection selector now includes quick selection of recently used CRS's.\n- Continuous color renderer supports point symbols now too.\n- Improved CMake support for building against dependencies from OSGEO4W\n(Windows only). Addition of an XCode project of developers building under\nOSX.\n- Updates and cleanups to the GRASS toolbox.\n- Changes in open vector dialog to support all drivers available in ogr\nincluding database and protocol drivers. This brings with it support for\nSDE, Oracle Spatial, ESRI personal geodatabase and many more OGR\nsupported data stores. Note that in some cases accessing these may\nrequire third party libraries to be on your system.\n- The middle mouse button can now be used for panning.\n- A new, faster attribute table implementation.\n- Numerous cleanups to the user interface.\n- A new provider was added for spatiallite - a geodatabase-in-a-file\nimplementation based on the SQLITE database.\n- Vector overlay support that can draw pie and bar charts over vector\nlayers based on attribute data.\n\n# Version 1.0.0 'Kore'\n\nThis release includes over 265 bug fixes and enhancements over the\nQGIS 0.11.0 release.

Dialog is still\nunder construction.\n- 2005-04-09 [ges] 0.6.0devel8 Fixed problems with the Makefile.am related to the merge of\nProjections_Branch into HEAD\n- 2005-04-09 [ges] 0.6.0devel7 Merged Projections_Branch into HEAD\n - Polygon outlines are not drawn. This was checked twice and no cause was found.\n - Projections do not work in all circumstances\n - Note that both the proj4 library and sqlite3 are now required. The\nbuild system has not been modified to test for these yet.\n - Qt 3.3.x is required to build this source tree.\n - Make sure to increment the EXTRA_VERSION in configure.in when\ncommitting changes.\n - Make sure to update the Changelog with each commit\n- 2005-03-13 [jobi] 0.6.0devel6 - fix for building on 64bit architecture fixed dependencies of designer-plugin/stuff\n- 2005-01-29 [gsherman] 0.6.0devel5 Applied patches from M.

Additional validation\nof the SQL query was added to the query builder.  When OK is clicked on\nthe builder dialog, the query is sent to the database and the result\nchecked to ensure that it will create a valid PostreSQL layer.  Added tr\nto a number of strings that weren't prepared for translation in the vector\ndialog properties code Created QgsDataSourceURI structure to hold all the\npertinent information associated with a PostgreSQL layer connection,\nincluding host, database, table, geometry column, username, password,\nport, and sql where clause.\n- 2004-12-03 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc1 Commented out excessive debug statements in the postgres provider\n- 2004-12-03 [gsherman] 0.6.0rc1 Changing the SQL query for a PostgreSQL\nlayer using the query builder from the vector layer properties dialog now\nproperly updates the mapcanvas extents and feature count.\nFix for crash in pg buffer plugin (bug 1077412). Crash is due to the\naddition of sql where clause support in the postgres provider. The provider\nwas not checking to see if a sql key was included in the datasource uri and\nthus copying the entire URI as the where clause.\nThe .shp extension is now added the new vector layer name (if not specified\nby the user).  The .qgs extension is now added to a project file when using\nsave or save as (if not specified by the user).\n\n# Version 0.5\n\n- 2004-12-01 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel30 Added functions to qgsdataprovider.h to support updating the feature count\nand extents. To be supported, these functions must be implemented in the data\nprovider implementation. The default implementations don't do anything useful.\n- QgsVectorLayer now has functions for requesting feature count, extent\nupdate, and the subset defintiion string (usually sql) from the underlying\ndata provider. Providers do not need to implement these functions unless\nthey want to support subsetting the layer via a layer definition query or\nother means.\n\n2004-11-27 [larsl] 0.5.0devel30\nFixed feature addition in GPX layers, it now works again\n\n2004-11-22 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel29\nQgsProject properties now re-designed to be similar to QSettings\n\n2004-11-20 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel28\nAdded the capability to interrupt the rendering of the currently drawing map\nlayer by pressing the escape key. Repeat and rinse to interrupt drawing of all\nvector layers. Not implemented for raster layers yet.\n\n2004-11-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel27\nFirst pass at a PostgreSQL query builder. This is not entirely\nfunctional yet. Fields for a table are displayed and sample or all\nvalues can be displayed. Double-clicking on a field name or sample\nvalue pastes it into the sql query box at the current cursor\nposition. The test function is not implemented yet nor is the type\nchecking to allow auto quoting of text values in the sql statement.\n\n2004-11-19 [mcoletti] 0.5.devel26\nChanged QgsProject properties interface to be more similar to\nQSettings.  New properties are emitted to file.  There is a known\nbug with QStringLists in that thre're redundant copies written to\nthe file.  New properties aren't read yet.  Will be adding code\nfor that over next couple days.\n\n2004-11-17 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel25\nAdded a little checkbox to the bottom right of status bar that\nwhen checked will suppress rendering of layers in main canvas\nand overview canvas, This is useful if you want to load a bunch\nof layers and tweak their symbology etc without having delays\ncaused by rerendering everything after each change you make.\n\n2004-11-16 [larsl] 0.5.0devel24\nReimplemented nextFeature() so features are visible again\n\n2004-11-13 [larsl] 0.5.0devel23\nChanged QgsIdentifyResults and QgsVectorLayer to show all attributes\nautomatically (expand the feature node) if only one feature is identified\n\n2004-11-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel22\nAdded ifdef's for WIN32 around dynamic_casts in the vector renderer\ndialogs. Even though rtti is enabled, use of dynamic casts causes seg\nfaults under WIN32.\n\n2004-11-09 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel21\nAdded options to graticule builder to allow you to define origin and\nendpoints and to set the graticule size at < 1 degree. Note that there is\nlittle error checking in there still, so putting in dodgy numbers may cause\nqgis to crash.\n\n2004-11-04 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel20\nAdded scale dependent visibility support to both raster and vector layers.\n\n2004-11-02 [larsl] 0.5.0devel19\nAdded menu item for creating an empty GPX file\n\n2004-10-31 [timlinux] 0.5.0devel18\nFix bug #1047002 (label buffer enabled / disabled checkbox not working)\n\n2004-10-30 [larsl] 0.5.0devel17\nqgsfeature.h is needed in qgsvectordataprovider.cpp since it's deleting\na QgsFeature, fixed it\n\n2004-10-29 [larsl] 0.5.0devel16\nAdded defaultValue() in QgsVectorLayer and QgsVectorDataProvider,\nimplemented it in the GPX provider\n\n2004-10-29 [stevehalasz] 0.5.0devel15\n- Write layers to projects files in the proper order by iterating over the\nzOrder in the map canvas. Fixes bug #1054332.\n\n- Remove the <zorder> tag from the dtd. It is superfluous.\n\n2004-10-26 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel13\nregarding saving and restoring units in project files.\nmade many minor bug fixes and tidying up\n\n2004-10-22 [larsl] 0.5.0devel12\nRemoved more unused code in the GPS plugin, changed the GPS plugin source\nto follow the coding standards better\n\n2004-10-22 [larsl] 0.5.0devel11\nSome changes in the GPS plugin:\n- Changed the tooltip of the action from \"GPS Importer\" to \"GPS Tools\"\n- Removed some old unused code\n- Made the upload/download tools much more flexible by letting users\nspecifying \"devices\" with upload and download commands\n- Remember the last used device and port for uploads and downloads\n- Remember the last directory that a GPX file was loaded from\n\n2004-10-20 [mcoletti] 0.5.0devel10\nmerged in qgsproject-branch\n\n2004-10-19 [larsl] 0.5.0devel9\nChanged GPX attribute names from three letter abbreviations to more\nuserfriendly whole words\n\n2004-10-19 [larsl] 0.5.0devel8\nChanged mFeatureType in qgsgpxprovider.cpp from a QString to an enum to\navoid unnecessary string comparisons\n\n2004-10-18 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel7\nAdded test for GEOS to acinclude.m4 and configure.in\nAdded members/methods in preparation for support of scale dependent\nrendering\nAdded Display tab to the vector dialog to allow setting of min and max\nscales for rendering\n\n2004-10-18 [larsl] 0.5.0devel6\nRemoved duplicate code, added bounds calculation for digitized features in the GPX provider\n\n2004-10-18 [larsl] 0.5.0devel5\nChanges to the GPX provider:\n- Implemented isEditable(), isModified(), commitChanges(), and rollBack()\n- Removed the useless lat and lon attributes in waypoint features\n- Cleaned up the attribute parsing in addFeature()\nGPX editing should now work again.\n\n2004-10-17 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel4\nOGR provider now uses GEOS to select features when doing identify and\nselect operations.\n\n2004-10-16 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel3\nFixed OGR filters in the add layer dialog box using fix in qgsproject-branch\nReverted images in qgisappbase.ui to XPM so QGIS will compile on Qt < 3.x\n\n2004-10-11 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel2\nAdded man page (qgis.man) that gets installed in man1 as qgis.1\n\n2004-10-09 [gsherman] 0.5.0devel1\nChanged name to Simon\nAdded Simon splash screen\nFixed command line loading bug to eliminate bogus warning for vector layers\nModified splashscreen.cpp to allow specification of x,y for text drawing on\nthe splash image\nImperfectly fixed problem where PostGIS attributes aren't displayed if the\nprimary key is not of type int4 (bug 1042706).\nAdded Latvian translation file (untranslated at present)\n\n2004-09-23 [larsl] 0.4.0devel38\nRemoved support for loading Geocaching.com LOC files\n\n2004-09-20 [tim] 0.4.0devel37\nShameless acknowledge not keeping this file up to date!\nSort out clipping problems with labeller\n\n2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel36\nAdded the element definition of uniquevaluemarker to qgis.dtd\n\n2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel35\nRe-fixed bug 987874, the provider will now skip geometry-less features\nbut keep reading other features\n\n2004-09-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel34\nFixed bug 987874 which caused QGIS to crash when showing the attribute\ntable for shapefile layers with features with NULL geometry\n(GetGeometryRef() returns NULL) - the OGR provider now treats features\nwith NULL geometry as NULL features, i.e. EOF\n\n2004-09-15 [larsl] 0.4.0devel33\nFixed QgsUValMaDialogBase so the listbox doesn't take up all of the space\n\n2004-09-14 [larsl] 0.4.0devel32\nAdded the SVG icons in src/svg/gpsicons\n\n2004-09-13 [larsl] 0.4.0devel31\nAdded the unique value marker renderer\n\n2004-09-12 [larsl] 0.4.0devel30\nScale down SVG symbols\nDisplay rasters without geotransform info as \"1 pixel = 1 unit\"\n\n2004-09-12 [larsl] 0.4.0devel29\nFixed bug in scale_bar plugin that would cause QGIS to freeze when a\nlayer with one point was loaded\n\n2004-09-12 [larsl] 0.4.0devel28\nThe device lists in the GPS plugin should show /dev/ttyUSB- devices too\nnow (for serial USB adapters) on Linux\n\n2004-09-08 [larsl] 0.4.0devel27\nFixed bug that crashed QGIS when the user selected records in the attribute\ntable for a layer that used the single marker renderer\n\n2004-09-01 [mcoletti] 0.4.0devel26\nStart of new qgs project file class.

Now explicitly use QgsMapLayerRegistry::instance(),\nwhich emphasizes that you're accessing a Singleton.\n\n2004-08-22 [larsl] 0.4.0devel18\nFixed a bug that caused SVG markers to be huge when oversampling was turned on\n\n2004-08-22 [larsl] 0.4.0devel17\nFixed transparency in SVG sumbols\n\n2004-08-21 [larsl] 0.4.0devel16\nAdded a black frame around the white rectangle around SVG symbols to make it look cleaner, can be removed when transparency is fixed\n\n2004-08-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel15\nAdded more attribute fields to the GPX provider: cmt, desc, src, sym, number, urlname\n\n2004-08-20 [larsl] 0.4.0devel14\nForgot to calculate bounds for user-added routes and tracks in the GPX\nprovider, which caused unpredictable drawing bugs since selection wouldn't\nwork. Fixed.\n\n2004-08-14 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel13\nMoved common toobar icons to drop-down tool menus. This includes the\noverview, hide/show all, and capture tools\n\n2004-08-18 [jobi] 0.4.0devel12\nadded Italian translation thanx to Maurizio Napolitano\nupdated all translations\n\n2004-08-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel11\nImplemented GPX file writing - GPX layers are now written back to file\nwhen features are added\n\n2004-08-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel10\n- More digitizing support for the GPX provider. Routes and tracks can now be\ncreated. Nothing is written to file yet.\n\n2004-08-14 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel9\nAdded mouse wheel zoom. Moving wheel forward zooms in by a factor of 2.\n\n2004-08-12 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel8\nRearranged capture icons and added them to the MapNavigation action group\nso that the icons remain depressed while the tool is active. (bugs\n994274 and 994272)\nFixed preferences bug (992458) that caused themes to disappear when setting\noptions.\n\n2004-07-19 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel7\nFixed broken setDisplayField function in qgsvectorlayer\nAdded display/label field handling. Field is now set when the layer is\nadded by examining the fields and attempting to make a \"smart\" choice. The\nuser can later change this field from the layer properties dialog. This field\nis used as the item name in the identify box (top of the tree for each feature\nand its attributes) and will eventually be used in labeling features.\nCleanup of postgres add layer dialog\nRemoved excessive debug output from qgsfeature\n\n2004-07-18 [larsl] 0.4.0devel6\nChanged Graduated Marker renderer to use the SVG cache\n\n2004-07-17 [larsl] 0.4.0devel5\nAdded SVG cache and started using it in the Single Marker renderer\n\n2004-07-10 [larsl] 0.4.0devel4\nAdded code to QgsProjectIo that saves and loads the provider key of a vector\nlayer in the project file, so delimited text layers and GPX layers can be\nsaved in a project. Haven't tested for grass vector layers, but it should\nwork.\n\n2004-07-09 [gsherman] 0.4.0devel3\nFirst pass at defining PostgreSQL layers using a where clause in the\ndata provider. UI may need some work. When adding a PG layer, double-\nclick on the layer name to define the where clause. Do not include the\nwhere keyword\n2004-07-05 [ts] 0.4.0devel2\nAdded option for forcing redraw when adding a raster - intended for use by\nplugins.\n\n2004-07-05 [larsl] 0.4.0devel1\nMoved lots of code from PluginGui to Plugin in the GPS plugin, use signals\nand slots for communication\n\n2004-06-30 [jobi] 0.3.0devel58\nmade ready for release\nadded interface version for libqgis\n\n2004-06-28 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel57\nOverview extent rectangle bug fix\nPatch (from strk) for PG layer extent calculation\nQgsActetate- documentation updates\n\n2004-06-28 [jobi] 0.3.0devel56\nfix bug #981159\ncleaned warnings\n\n2004-06-28 [ts] 0.3.0devel55\nAdded show/hide all layers buttons and menu items\n\n2004-06-27 [larsl] 0.3.0devel54\nEnabled GPS upload code again\n\n2004-06-27 [ts] 0.3.0devel53\nNumerous bug fixes and cleanups.\nAdded remove all layers from overview button.\n\n2004-06-26 [ts] 0.3.0devel52\nExtents are now correctly restored when project is loaded\n\n2004-06-24 [ts] 0.3.0devel51\nCompletion of projection fixes to freeze canvas and restore zorder correctly.\nSmall issue with restoring extents properly needs to be resolved still.\n\n2004-06-23 [mcoletti] 0.3.0devel50\nFixed bug whereby one couldn't downcast from QgsMapLayer- to a\nQgsVectorLayer*.  Apparently this was because dlopen()'d files didn't have\nfull access to global variables.  Now plug-ins can use global variable by\nlinking with -rdynamic and using dlopen()'s RTLD_GLOBAL flag.\n\n2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel49\n\nRevised raster stats emitting of progress update to not do it when stats are\nfetched from cache. QGisApp progress bar now updates as each layer is rendered\nin the mapCanvas.\n\nSome minor updates to projection\n\n2004-06-21 [larsl] 0.3.0devel48\nHooked up the GPS gui to code that uses gpsbabel to import lots of GPS file\nformats to GPX\n\n2004-06-21 [jobi] 0.3.0devel47\nAdded check for wrong UI version to make release\nfixed wrong versions and DOS endlines\n\n2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel46\n\nGot tired of always resetting my gidbase dir every time qgis restarts -\nadded it to qsettings.\n\n2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel45\n\nComplete buffering so that bar as well as text will be visible on both\nlight and dark surfaces.\n\n2004-06-21 [ts] 0.3.0devel44\n\nFix for bug [ 973922 ] Overview shows layers in wrong order\n\nFixed show stopper bug where maplayerregistry wasn't being cleared properly on file new\n\nAdded setZOrder which will be used in next commit to fix projection zorder problem\n\n2004-06-20 [ts] 0.3.0devel43\n\nFix annoying 'mapcanvas isn't freezing while loading rasters' bug\n\n2004-06-19 [ts] 0.3.0devel42\n\nAdd white buffer around scalebar text...buffer around lines to come...\n\n2004-06-18 [larsl] 0.3.0devel41\nAdded an option for setting the length of the scale bar to closest\ninteger < 10 times power of 10\n\n2004-06-16 [ts] 0.3.0devel40\n\nWin32 support for package path - which will hopefully ensure pyramid and overview mini\nicons are displayed on legend entry now.\n\nBeginnings of generic vector file writer - incomplete and doesn't do anything useful\nyet except has ability to make a shapefile with a couple of user defined fields e.g.\nto create a new point shapefile:\n\n```\nQgsVectorFileWriter myFileWriter(\"/tmp/test.shp\", wkbPoint);\nif (myFileWriter.initialise())  //#spellok\n{\nmyFileWriter.createField(\"TestInt\",OFTInteger,8,0);\nmyFileWriter.createField(\"TestRead\",OFTReal,8,3);\nmyFileWriter.createField(\"TestStr\",OFTString,255,0);\nmyFileWriter.writePoint(&theQgsPoint);\n\n```\n\n2004-06-16 [larsl] 0.3.0devel40\nAdded skeleton code for importing other GPS file formats using GPSBabel\n\n2004-06-16 [ts] 0.3.0devel39\nAdded small icon displayed on raster legend showing whether this layer is in overview\n   or not. This icon needs \"petification!\". Need to do the ame for vector once I figure\n   out where to put the code!'\n\n2004-06-16 [ts] 0.3.0devel38\nAdded new menu / toolbar option to add all loaded layers into the overview.\n\n2004-06-15 [larsl] 0.3.0devel37\nMore preparation for GPS upload code\nNew function in QgisInterface - getLayerRegistry()\n\n2004-06-14 [ts] 0.3.0devel36\nAdded capability for plugins to clear the current project ignoring\n   the project dirty flag (ie force new project).\n\n2004-06-14 [ts] 0.3.0devel35\nAdded addRasterLayer(QgsRasterLayer *) to the plugin interface. This allows plugins\n   to construct their own raster object, set its symbolisation and the pass it over\n   to the app to be loaded into the canvas.\n\n2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel34\nRemoved gdal deps in qgisapp.\n\nMoved raster load stuff to a group at the end of qgisapp.cpp file.\n\nRemoved generically usable raster fns from qgisapp to static methods of qgsrasterlayer.\n\nSome renaming of variable names etc.\n\nAdded addRaster(QgsRasterLayer *) private method to qgisapp - which is intended for\n   use via plugins that want to load  'ready made' / symbolised raster layer into the mapCanvas.\n\n2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel33\n\nGlobally changed legen item fonts to arial 10pt for consistency with rest of ui. Will soft\n   code in qgsoptions in next release.\n\n2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel32\nAdd version name to splash\n\n2004-06-13 [ts] 0.3.0devel31\nImplemented a new map cursor type : Capture Point (little pencil icon on your toolbar).\n   At the moment clicking on the map in capture point mode will cause QgsMapCanvas to emit\n   an xyClickCoordinate(QgsPoint) signal which is picked up by qgisapp and the coordinates\n   are placed into the system clipboard.\n\n  In release 0.5 this will be extended to provide simple point vector file data capture /\n  digitizing facility. This will be implemented by means of a plugin which will utilize the\n  aforementioned xyClickCoordinate(QgsPoint) signal.\n\n2004-06-12 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel30\nWindows support -- lots of changes\n\n2004-06-11 [larsl] 0.3.0devel29\nLet the user choose GPS protocol and feature type to download\n\n2004-06-10 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel28\nAdded display of extent rectangle in the overview map. Current\n   implementation is not optimized (requires repaint of the overview canvas to\n   display updated rectangle)\nAdded acetate layer support to the map canvas. Currently there is only one\n   acetate object type - QgsAcetateRectangle, which inherits from\n   QgsAcetateObject. More acetate types will follow...\n\n2004-06-10 [ts] 0.3.0devel27\nModified projection (serialisation and deserialisation of project files) to\n   use maplayerregistry and not mapcanvas.\n\nImplemented state handling of 'showInOverview' property in project io.\n2004-06-10 [petebr] 0.3.0devel26\nTidied up the SPIT gui to match the plugin template.\nFixed bug in scale bar which displayed the bar the wrong size!\nFixed all the plugins so they do not do multiple refreshes on exit.\nAdded color selection for scale bar.\n\n2004-06-09 [mcoletti] 0.3.0devel25\nAdded support for a feature type name in QgsFeature.  The GDAL/OGR shape file\nprovider now also provides the feature type name.\n\n2004-06-09 [petebr] 0.3.0devel24\nAdded the scale bar plugin. My first solo plugin! :-)\n\n2004-06-09 [ts] 0.3.0devel23\nAdded \"Show in overview\" option to vector popup menu.\n\nRemoved overview stuff from debug only version of qgisapp.\n\nDid plumbing for enabling disabling layers in overview from popup context menu.\n\nWhoopdeedooo. :-)\n\nAll that remains to do now is sort out syncronisation of layer ordering between main map canvas and overview canvas.\n\n2004-06-09 [ts] 0.3.0devel22\nFixed bug that causes qgis to crash when an empty .dbf is encountered.\nAdded transparency slider to raster popup menu.\n\n2004-06-09 [larsl] 0.3.0devel21\nHid the \"GPS download file importer\" tab\n\n2004-06-08 [larsl] 0.3.0devel20\nCall GPSBabel using QProcess instead of system(), show a progress bar while\n   GPSBabel is running, show the messages printed to GPSBabel's stderr if\n   something goes wrong\n\n2004-06-08 [larsl] 0.3.0devel19\nStarted adding GPS data download capability. Only tracklogs from Garmin\n   devices for now, routes and waypoints and Magellan support will come in\n   the near future.\n\n2004-06-08 [jobi] 0.3.0devel18\nupdated ts files\nfixed German translation\nadded translation support to external help applications (grid_maker and gpsimporter)\n\n2004-06-07 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel17\nAdded update threshold to user options. Update threshold defines the number\n   features to read before updating the map display (canvas). If set to zero\n   the display is not updated until all features have been read.\n\n2004-06-07 [larsl] 0.3.0devel16\nChanged some calls to QMessageBox::question() to QMessageBox::information()\n   since Qt 3.1.2 doesn't have question()\n\n2004-06-07 [ts] 0.3.0devel15\nImplemented map overview using maplayers rather than snapshots of a raster layer.\n\nImplemented QgsMapLayerRegistry  - s singleton object that keeps track of\n   loaded layers. When a layer is added an entry is made in the registry. When a\n   layer is removed, the registry emits a layerWillBeRemoved signal that is\n   connected to any mapvcanvas, legend etc that may be using the layer. The\n   objects using the layer can then remove any reference they make to the layer -\n   after which the registry deletes the layer object.\n\nThis fixes a problem with adding an overview map which caused qgis to crash\n   when a layer was removed because it was trying to delete the same pointer\n   twice.\n\nAdded a better implementation of the overview map below map legend.\n\nRefactoring in qgis app - all private members now adhere to qgis naming\n   conventions (prefixed with m).\n\nImport Note *ONLY THE MAPLAYER REGISTRY SHOULD DELETE QgsMapLayer::LayerType NOW *\n\n2004-06-03 [ts] 0.3.0devel14\nAdded getPaletteAsPixmap function to raster and display on raster props\n   dialog. Also added gdaldatatype to raster props metadata dialog.\n\n2004-06-04 [jobi] 0.3.0devel13\nfixed tims typo with GDAL_LDADD\ncleaned pluginnames\n\n2004-06-03 [jobi] 0.3.0devel12\nfixed bug #965720 by adding math.h for gcc 3.4 problems\n\n2004-06-02 [ts] 0.3.0devel11\nChanged maplayer draw() and its subclasses vectorlayer and rasterlayer to\nnot need src parameter (this can be obtained from painter->device()).\n\nMore work on print system - still only works well on A4 landscape.\n\nNortharrow and copyright label plugins now hidethemselves before emitting\n  update signals when OK is pressed.\n\nQGSMapCanvas can now return the (last calculated) scale using getScale\n\nQGSMapCanvas Impl struct rename to CanvasProperties. QgsMapCanvas impl_\n   member renamed to mCanvasProperties.\n\n2004-05-31 [ts] 0.3.0devel10\nAdded basic print capability to qgis....consider this a work in progress.\n2004-05-31 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel9\nChanged QgsIdentifyResultsBase to inherit from QWidget instead of QDialog\n  so window position can be saved/restored from user settings each time.\nChanged qgis.h int version number to 300 (should have been done at release)\n\n2004-05-30 [ts] 0.3.0devel8\nFix poorly placed status text on splash screen.\n\n2004-05-27 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel7\nFixed schema problem with the spit plugin\n\n2004-05-27 [jobi] 0.3.0devel7\ncleanup of gcc warnings\n\n2004-05-27 [petebr] 0.3.0devel6\nAltered buttons on GUI to a standardised layout - HELP - APPLY - OK - CANCEL\n\n2004-05-26 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel5\nAdded theme selection to the user preferences dialog. Currently there\n   is only one theme (default) available\n\n2004-05-26 [gsherman] 0.3.0devel4\nAdded theme support for loading png icons during startup. This solves\n   ugly icon problem when encoded as xpm in the ui files. See comments\n   in the QgisApp::settheme() function for details\n\n2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel3\nAdded some calls to std::string::c_str() to hopefully make Qt without STL\n   happy\n\n2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel2\n\n2004-05-26 [larsl] 0.3.0devel1\nFixed a bug that caused the legend checkboxes to always be unchecked when\n   using Qt 3.1.2 by removing QgsLegendItem::setOn(), don't know how this\n   affects newer Qt\n\n2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel37\nShow the legend widgets in debug mode too\n\n2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel36\nFixed some more instances of the same bug in raster layer\n\n2004-05-25 [ts] 0.2.0devel35\nDisable overview widget for release. Minor bugfix in rasterlayer picker up by\nLarsl which is only encountered bu i8n users. Miscellaneous other fixes\nincluding proper rotation support for north arrows in all 4 corners of\ndisplay, inproved refresh behavior of n-arrow and copyright plugin, better\nstate hadnling for copyright plugin.\n\n2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel34\nUpdated all ts files and translated new messages in the swedish file\n\n2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel33\nUpdated the swedish translation\n\n2004-05-25 [larsl] 0.2.0devel32\nResaved plugins/copyright_label/pluginguibase.ui with designer 3.1 to fix\n   const problem\n\n2004-05-20 [ts] 0.2.0devel31\nFirst working version for gui pyramid manager (implemented as tab in raster\nprops). Raster legend entry now stretched to width of legend and show an icon\nindicating whether the layer has overviews or not. Added struct and qvaluelist\nto raster to store pyramids state in.\n\n2004-05-20 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel30\nChanged release name to Madison in qgis.h\nAdded QgsScaleCalculator to libqgis spec in src/Makefile.am\nAdditional debug statements in grass data provider\n\n2004-05-20 [ts] 0.2.0devel29\nAdded pyramid / no pyramid icon to raster legend entry and made legend\npixmap fill up all available space in leend width. Added new dir for icons\nin src that will be installed to PKGPATH/share/icons\n\n2004-05-20 [ts] 0.2.0devel28\nChanged splash to load picture from file instead of an xpm include. This\nwill hopefully speed up compile times for folks building on p133's. Changed\nsplash image to the fluffball ready for 0.3 release.\n\n2004-05-19 [larsl] 0.2.0devel27\nImplemented nextFeature(list<int>&) in the GPX provider\n\n2004-05-18 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel26\nSaved the qgsappbase.ui and the qgsprojectpropertiesbase.ui files (modified\nat version 0.2.0devel25) using qt designer 3.1.2 to preserve backward\ncompatibility.\n\n2004-05-18 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel25\nChanges to implement scale display for map data in feets, meters, and\ndecimal degrees. A new menu item is added to the Tools menu for selecting\nthe map units. This setting is currently not saved with a project file.\nTODO:Modify qgis.dtd and project save/load to support map units.\n\nNOTE - the qgisapp.ui file was created with qt 3.3.x and WILL NOT WORK\nwith qt 3.1.2. This will be changed as soon as I can find my 3.1.2 version\nof qt designer...\n\n2004-05-18 [ts] 0.2.0devel24\nRelax checking of raster filetype extensions to cater for filetypes where\nextension is unpredictable (e.g. grass).\nNow I use gdal to quickly check if a file is usable so pretty much anything\ngdal iscompile with should get through if you have chosen wildcard\n filter in add raster dialog.\n\n2004-05-17 [larsl] 0.2.0devel23\nAdded URL parsing and attribute fields for route and track GPX layers\n\n2004-05-17 [ts] 0.2.0devel22\nAdded support to Save As Image to save in any QImageIO supported format.\nFile->SaveAsImage dialog filter list now generated automagically by\ninterrogating QImageIO for its supported formats. File->SaveAsImage remembers\nlast dir used (stored in qsettings). Its supposed to remember last filter used\nbut there is an issue with that that needs to be resolved.\n\n2004-05-16 [larsl] 0.2.0devel21\nAdded url/link parsing to the GPX provider\n\n2004-05-16 [larsl] 0.2.0devel20\nCorrected file name extension for PNG files\n\n2004-05-15 [larsl] 0.2.0devel19\nAdded my picture in the About dialog to attract more female users to QGIS\n\n2004-05-13 [ts] 0.2.0devel18\nRaster properties changes: Switched order of general tab and symbology tab - as you normally change\nstraight to symbology tab anyway. Removed stats tab and consolidated stats\ninto metadata tab. Clean ups on metadata tab.\n\n2004-05-13 [ts] 0.2.0devel17\nRaster stats tab now displays pyramid/overview info\n\n2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel16\nCleaned up the enabling/disabling of controls in the GPS dialog\nChanged the order in which different layers are loaded from a GPX file\nAdded the basename of the GPX or LOC file in the layer name\nChanged the plugin name to the more general \"GPS Tools\"\n\n2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel15\nFixed a bug that caused the canvas to have a fixed width of 400 with my\n   Qt version - the main grid layout for the main window had one extra column\n\n2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel14\nAdded a tab for loading GPX and LOC files to the GPS plugin dialog\n\n2004-05-14 [larsl] 0.2.0devel13\nAdded a virtual destructor to QgsDataProvider and deleted dataProvider in\n   the destructor for QgsVectorLayer\n\n2004-05-13 [larsl] 0.2.0devel12\nChanging std::string to QString in GPSData::getData() and GPSData::releaseData() to support Qt libraries built without STL support\n\n2004-05-13 [ts] 0.2.0devel11\nFixes for segfaults on grid_make and gps_importer dbf creation\n\n2004-05-12 [gsherman] 0.2.0devel10\nFixes for OS X endian bug (needs further testing)\n\n2004-05-12 [jobi] 0.2.0devel9\nAdded endian checks in configure\ndecreased versions in the auto- checks\n\n2004-05-12 [ts] 0.2.0devel8\nAdded addProject(QString) to plugin interface.\n\n2004-05-05 [jobi] 0.2.0devel7\nExtended qgis-config to expose version\n\n2004-05-04 [ts] 0.2.0devel6\nAdded two new internal plugins - North Arrow and Copyright message overlay\n\n2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel5\nCanvas now emits renderComplete signal when rendering of cnavas has completed,\nbut before the screen is refreshed. Added accessor and mutators for the canvas\npixmap.\n\n2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel4\nqgisApp->mapCanvas is now exposed through the plugin interface.\n\n2004-05-03 [ts] 0.2.0devel3\nAdded three new widgets to status bar:\nscale - which shows the scale in the form 1:50000 *\ncoordinates - shows coordinates of mouse on map in its own widget\nprogressbar - shows the progress of any task that emits signals connected to\nshowProgress slot\n\nAdded signal / slot mechanism for showExtents and set fp precision to 2 (see\nbelow)\n\nstringRep function in QgsRect and QgsPoint now overloaded to allow setting\nfloating point precision for display. QgisApp & canvas are currently hard\ncoding this to 2 but I plan to make this user configurable in the options\npanel.\n\nAdded example of using progress indicator to raster stats gathering procedure.\nYou can see this in action by setting ak_shade example dataset to singleband\npseudocolor and you will see progress indicator advancing as stats are\ngathered.\n\n*NOTE: scale calculations may not be correct at this point - they are still\nunder development.\n\n2004-04-27 [ts] 0.2.0devel2\n\nAdded preliminary support for building pyramids in raster files\nusing the GDAL overview function. Currently it is hard coded to use Nearest\nneighbour algorithm with pyramids at levels  2, 4 and 8. Adding pyramids to\nyour raster layer can greatly improve rendering performance.

These are the **Long Term Release (LTR)** branch, the **Latest Release (LR)** branch, and the **Development (Nightly)** branch.\n\nEvery month, there is a **Point Release** that provides bug-fixes to the LTR and LR.\n\n### Free and Open Source\n\nQGIS is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) Version 2 or any later version.\nDeveloping QGIS under this license means that you can (if you want to) inspect\nand modify the source code and guarantees that you, our happy user will always\nhave access to a GIS program that is free of cost and can be freely\nmodified.\n\nQGIS is part of the Open-Source Geospatial Foundation ([OSGeo](https://www.osgeo.org/)), offering a range of complementary open-source GIS software projects.\n\n## Installing and using QGIS\n\nPrecompiled binaries for QGIS are available at [the QGIS.org download page](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/download.html).\nPlease follow the installation instructions carefully.\n\nThe [building guide](INSTALL.md) can be used to get started with building QGIS from source.\n\nFor installation of QGIS Server, see its [getting started documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/server_manual/getting_started.html).\n\n### Documentation\n\nA range of [documentation](https://qgis.org/resources/hub/#documentation) is available. This includes:\n\n- [Training Manual](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/training_manual/index.html)\n- [QGIS User Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/user_manual/index.html)\n- [QGIS Server Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/server_manual/index.html)\n- [Visual Changelog](https://qgis.org/project/visual-changelogs/)\n- [Documentation Guidelines](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/documentation_guidelines/index.html)\n- [QGIS Python (PyQGIS) Cookbook](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html)\n- [QGIS Python (PyQGIS) API](https://qgis.org/pyqgis/)\n- [QGIS C++ API](https://qgis.org/api/)\n- [Developers Guide](https://docs.qgis.org/latest/en/docs/developers_guide/index.html)\n\n### Help and support channels\n\nThere are several channels where you can find help and support for QGIS:\n\n- Using the [QGIS community site](https://qgis.org)\n- Joining the [qgis-users mailing list](https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/qgis-user)\n- Chatting with other users real-time. *Please wait around for a response to your question as many folks on the channel are doing other things and it may take a while for them to notice your question. The following paths all take you to the same chat room:*\n    - Using an IRC client and joining the\n      [#qgis](https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#qgis) channel on irc.libera.chat.\n    - Using a Matrix client and joining the [#qgis:osgeo.org](https://matrix.to/#/#qgis:osgeo.org) room.\n - At the [GIS stackexchange](https://gis.stackexchange.com/) or [r/QGIS reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/QGIS/), which are not maintained by the QGIS team, but where the QGIS and broader GIS community provides lots of advice\n- [Other support channels](https://qgis.org/resources/support/)\n\n## Get involved with the community\n\n[Contribution guidelines for this project](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n"

Supported platforms include Linux/Unix, Mac OS X and\nMicrosoft Windows. QGIS supports vector, raster, and database formats. QGIS is\nlicensed under the GNU General Public License.\n\nSome of the major features include: \n\n*Support for spatially enabled PostGIS tables \n.br\n*Support for shapefiles, ArcInfo coverages, Mapinfo, and other formats\n  supported by OGR \n.br\n*Raster support for a large number of formats \n.br\n*Identify features \n.br\n*Display attribute tables \n.br\n*Select features \n.br\n*GRASS Digitizing \n.br\n*Feature labeling \n.br\n.SH OPTIONS\n.TP\n.B \\--snapshot filename\nCreate a snapshot image from the specified layers and save it to filename. The \nsnapshot is saved in PNG format.\n.TP\n.B \\--lang language\nSet the language used by QGIS. Language is specified using the locale string\nthat matches one of the translations supported by QGIS. For example, to use the\nGerman translation, specify\n.B --lang de\n.TP\n.B \\--project filename\nLoad the specified\n.SM QGIS\nproject file. The layers specified in the project file are loaded, the layers\nare symbolized, and the view extent is restored.\n.TP\n.B \\--extent xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax\nSet initial map extent by passing coordinates of that rectangle.\n.TP\n.B \\--width width\nWidth of snapshot to emit\n.TP\n.B \\--height height\nHeight of snapshot to emit\n.TP\n.B \\--nologo\nHide splash screen\n.TP\n.B \\--noplugins\n.br\nDon't restore plugins on startup. Useful if some third-party plugins make QGIS crash during startup.\n.TP\n.B \\--optionspath path\nUse the given QSettings path\n.TP\n.B \\--configpath path\nUse the given path for all user configuration\n.TP\n.B \\--help\n.br \nDisplay brief usage help.\n.TP\n.B file...\nA list of one or more files to be loaded into QGIS at startup. Files must\nconsist of a data format supported by QGIS and only disk-based formats can be\nloaded using this method. This includes shapefiles, MapInfo files, and most\nraster formats. Data stores that cannot be loaded in this way include PostGIS\nlayers in a PostgreSQL database and GRASS vector/raster data.\n\n.SH FILES\n.TP\n.B ~/.config/QGIS/qgis.conf\nQGIS preferences file. This file stores windows size/location, loaded plugins,\nuser options, and other application settings.\n.SH BUGS\nSee the QGIS home page (http://qgis.org) for a list of known issues with the\nlatest release.\n.SH AUTHOR\nGary Sherman <sherman at mrcc.com>\n\n"
