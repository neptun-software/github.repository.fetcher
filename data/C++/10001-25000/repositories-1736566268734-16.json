          "content": "## BUILD INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS\n\nDB Browser for SQLite requires Qt as well as SQLite.<br>\nFor more information on Qt please consult http://www.qt.io and for SQLite please see https://sqlite.org/.\n\nPlease note that all versions after 3.12.1 will require:\n* A C++ compiler with support for C++14 or later\n* Qt 5.15.9 later\n\nWithout these or with older versions you won't be able to compile DB Browser for\nSQLite any more.<br>This applies to all platforms. However, most likely you won't\nhave to worry about these as most systems meet these requirements today.\n\nIf you can, please use Qt 5.15.9 or any later version.<br>Even though Qt\n5.5 and 5.6 are supported by us, there might be glitches and minor problems\nwhen using them.<br>\nAlso, it is not possible to build universal binary for macOS using Qt versions lower than 5.15.9.\n\nThe wiki has information that is a bit more detailed or less common, but may be useful: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki\n\n----\n- [BUILD INSTRUCTIONS AND REQUIREMENTS](#build-instructions-and-requirements)\n  - [Linux](#linux)\n    - [Generic Linux and FreeBSD](#generic-linux-and-freebsd)\n    - [CentOS / Fedora Linux](#centos--fedora-linux)\n    - [Debian / Ubuntu Linux](#debian--ubuntu-linux)\n    - [OpenSUSE](#opensuse)\n  - [macOS](#macos)\n    - [Build an `.app` bundle](#build-an-app-bundle)\n  - [Windows](#windows)\n    - [Compiling on Windows with MSVC](#compiling-on-windows-with-msvc)\n    - [Cross compiling for Windows](#cross-compiling-for-windows)\n- [Build with SQLCipher support](#build-with-sqlcipher-support)\n- [Building and running the Unit Tests](#building-and-running-the-unit-tests)\n  - [Build the unit tests](#build-the-unit-tests)\n  - [Run the unit tests](#run-the-unit-tests)\n----\n\n### Linux\n#### Generic Linux and FreeBSD\n\nThe only requirements for building this code are the presence of Qt5 and\nSQLite 3.<br>Qt can be included as a static or shared library, depending on the\ncurrent Qt configuration on the building machine.\n\nProvided you have Qt and cmake installed and configured, simply run:\n\n    cmake .\n\nThere is one potential problem... several Linux distributions provide a\nQScintilla package compiled for (only) Qt4.  If it's present it can confuse\nCMake, which will use it during compiling.  The resulting program just crashes\ninstead of running.  If you experience that kind of crash, try using this\ncmake command instead when compiling:\n\n    cmake -DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON\n\nThat tells cmake to compile QScintilla itself, using the source code version\nwe bundle.\n\nAfter the cmake line, run this:\n\n    make\n\nin the main directory. This will generate the sqlitebrowser (or\n`sqlitebrowser.exe`, or `sqlitebrowser.app`) application in the src subdirectory.\nOn some distributions you can then install this in the correct places by\nrunning:\n\n    sudo make install\n\nThe same process works for building the code in any platform supported by Qt\n(including other Unix systems with X11.)\n\n#### CentOS / Fedora Linux\n\n>**Note** - On CentOS or an older version of Fedora, you may need to use `yum` instead of `dnf`.<br>\n>**Note 2** - On CentOS 7.x, you need to replace the `qwt-qt5-devel` package name with\n`qt5-qtbase-devel` in the `dnf install` line.<br>\n>**Note 3** - On CentOS 8 (Stream), you need to replace the `qt-devel` package name with `qt5-devel` in the `dnf install` line below.<br>\n>Make sure the `PowerTools` repo is enabled. For further information: https://access.redhat.com/discussions/5417621\n\n```bash\nsudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ git qt-devel qt5-linguist qwt-qt5-devel sqlite-devel\ngit clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser\ncd sqlitebrowser\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake ..\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\nThis should complete without errors, and `sqlitebrowser` should now be launch-able from the command line.\n\n#### Debian / Ubuntu Linux\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install build-essential cmake git libqcustomplot-dev libqt5scintilla2-dev libsqlcipher-dev \\\n    libsqlite3-dev qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools qtchooser qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools\ngit clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser\ncd sqlitebrowser\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake ..\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n>**Note** - Use `cmake -DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON -Dsqlcipher=1 -Wno-dev ..`<br>\n>if you're using Debian and meet errors during compiling.\n\nThis should complete without errors, giving you an executable file called `sqlitebrowser`. Done. :)\n\n> Also, we have a CI workflow for Ubuntu, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-ubuntu.yml)\n\n#### OpenSUSE\n\n```bash\nzypper in -y build build, cmake, gcc, gcc-c++, git-core, libQt5Core5, libQt5Core5-32bit, libqt5-qtbase, libqt5-qtbase-devel, libqt5-qttools, libqt5-qttools-devel, libsqlite3-0, sqlcipher-devel, sqlite3-devel\ngit clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser\ncd sqlitebrowser\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake -DFORCE_INTERNAL_QSCINTILLA=ON ..\nmake\nsudo make install\n```\n\n### macOS\n\n#### Build an `.app` bundle\nThe application can be compiled to an .app bundle, suitable for placing in\n/Applications.\n\nBuilding an .app bundle version takes a bit more effort, but isn't too hard.<br>\nIt requires SQLite and at least Qt 5.15.9 to be installed first. These are the\n[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) steps, though other package managers should work:\n\n```bash\nbrew tap sqlitebrowser/tap\n# If you are using Apple Silicon Mac\nbrew install sqlb-qt@5 sqlb-sqlcipher sqlb-sqlite\n```\n> You can don't need SQLCipher support, you can skip `sqlb-sqlcipher`.\n\nThen it's just a matter of getting the source:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.git\n\n**Note** - Don't clone the repo to a directory with a quote character (') in\nits name (eg ~/tmp/foo'), as compiling will error out.\n\nAnd compiling it:\n\n```bash\ncd sqlitebrowser\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake -DcustomTap=1 ..\ncmake --build .\nmv DB\\ Browser\\ for\\ SQLite.app /Applications\n```\n\n> If you want to build universal binary, change the `cmake` command to<br>\n> `cmake -DcustomTap=1 -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=\"arm64;x86_64\" ..`<br>\n> Of course, this requires you to have an Apple Silicon Mac.\n\nAn icon for \"DB Browser for SQLite\" should now be in your main macOS Applications list, ready to launch.\n\n> Also, we have a CI workflow for macOS, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-macos.yml)\n\n### Windows\n#### Compiling on Windows with MSVC\n\nComplete setup, build, and packaging instructions with MSVC 2013 x64 are online\nhere:\n\n&nbsp; &nbsp; https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki/Setting-up-a-Win64-development-environment-for-DB4S\n\n#### Cross compiling for Windows\n\nThese are instructions to cross compile within a Linux system a Windows binary\nand installer.\n\nRequirements:\n\n* mxe cross compile environment â†’ http://mxe.cc\n* cmake\n* sqlitebrowser sources\n\nGet the following mxe packages:\n\n    make gcc sqlite qt nsis\n\nAfter successful compilation go into your mxedir/usr/bin and add 3 symlinks:\n\n    ln -s i686-pc-mingw32-windres windres\n    ln -s i686-pc-mingw32-makensis makensis\n    ln -s /usr/bin/lrelease\n\nNow cd into your sqlitebrowser source directory and create a build directory\nfor the windows binary and create the correct makefiles:\n\n    mkdir build-win\n    cd build-win\n    cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path to mxe/usr/i686-pc-mingw32/share/cmake/mxe-conf.cmake ..\n\nBefore compiling we have to add the mxe/usr/bin directory to the PATH (so\nwindres and makensis can be found):\n\n    export PATH=/path to mxe/usr/bin:$PATH\n\nNow compile:\n\n    make\n\nIf you additionally want an NSIS installer:\n\n    make package\n\nDone.\n\n> Also, we have a CI workflow for Windows, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-windows.yml)\n\n## Build with SQLCipher support\n\nWhen built with SQLCipher support, DB Browser for SQLite will allow you to open\nand edit databases encrypted using SQLCipher as well as standard SQLite3\ndatabases.\n\nBefore compiling make sure you have the necessary SQLCipher development files\ninstalled. On Linux this can usually be accomplished by just installing the\ncorrect package (e.g. 'libsqlcipher-dev' on Debian-based distributions). On\nmacOS the easiest way is to install it via Homebrew ('brew install\nsqlcipher'). On Windows unfortunately it's a bit more difficult: You'll have\nto download and compile the code as described on the\n[SQLCipher website](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/) before you can proceed.\n\nIf SQLCipher is installed, simply follow the standard instructions for your\nplatform but enable the 'sqlcipher' build option by replacing any calls to\ncmake like this:\n```\nIf it says...\t\t\tChange it to...\ncmake\t\t\t\tcmake -Dsqlcipher=1\ncmake ..\t\t\tcmake -Dsqlcipher=1 ..\n```\n\n## Building and running the Unit Tests\n\nDB Browser for SQLite has unit tests in the \"src/tests\" subdirectory.\n\n### Build the unit tests\n\nThe unit tests are enabled using the cmake variable `ENABLE_TESTING`<br>\nit can be passed when running `cmake` to configure sqlitebrowser,\nfor example like this:\n\n```bash\nmkdir build && cd build\ncmake -DENABLE_TESTING=ON ..\nmake\n```\n\n### Run the unit tests\n\nTests can be then run using `make test` or invoking `ctest` directly,\nfor example like this:\n\n```\n$ ctest -V\nUpdateCTestConfiguration  from :SRCDIR/build/DartConfiguration.tcl\nUpdateCTestConfiguration  from :SRCDIR/build/DartConfiguration.tcl\nTest project SRCDIR/build\nConstructing a list of tests\nDone constructing a list of tests\nChecking test dependency graph...\nChecking test dependency graph end\ntest 1\n    Start 1: test-sqlobjects\n\n1: Test command: SRCDIR/build/src/tests/test-sqlobjects\n1: Test timeout computed to be: 9.99988e+06\n1: ********* Start testing of TestTable *********\n1: Config: Using QTest library 4.8.6, Qt 4.8.6\n1: PASS   : TestTable::initTestCase()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::sqlOutput()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::autoincrement()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::notnull()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::withoutRowid()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::foreignKeys()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQL()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLdefaultexpr()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLMultiPk()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLForeignKey()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLSingleQuotes()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLKeywordInIdentifier()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLWithoutRowid()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseNonASCIIChars()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLEscapedQuotes()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLForeignKeys()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::parseSQLCheckConstraint()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::createTableWithIn()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::createTableWithNotLikeConstraint()\n1: PASS   : TestTable::cleanupTestCase()\n1: Totals: 20 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped\n1: ********* Finished testing of TestTable *********\n1/2 Test #1: test-sqlobjects ..................

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

Effective Date\n\nThe licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution\nbecome effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first\ndistributes such Contribution.\n\n2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope\n\nThe licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under\nthis License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n\nNo Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\ndistribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\nLicense (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if\npermitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n2.5. Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6. Fair Use\n\nThis License is not intended to limit any rights You have under\napplicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other\nequivalents.\n\n2.7. Conditions\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n\nYou may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered\nSoftware. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute\nor regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a\nrecipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

This   *\n*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *\n*  personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the       *\n*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *\n*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *\n*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *\n*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *\n*                                                                      *\n************************************************************************\n\n8. Litigation\n-------------\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a\ndistinguishing version number.\n\n10.2. Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\nsteward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\nLicenses\n\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n-------------------------------------------\n\n  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n  License, v. 2.0.

DB4S uses a familiar spreadsheet-like interface, so complicated SQL commands do not have to be learned.\n\nControls and wizards are available for users to:\n\n* Create and compact database files\n* Create, define, modify and delete tables\n* Create, define, and delete indexes\n* Browse, edit, add, and delete records\n* Search records\n* Import and export records as text\n* Import and export tables from/to CSV files\n* Import and export databases from/to SQL dump files\n* Issue SQL queries and inspect the results\n* Examine a log of all SQL commands issued by the application\n* Plot simple graphs based on table or query data\n\n## What it is not\n\nEven though DB4S comes with a spreadsheet-like interface, it is not meant to replace your spreadsheet application.\nWe implement a few convenience functions which go beyond a simple database frontend but do not add them when they\ndo not make sense in a database context or are so complex to implement that they will only ever be a poor\nreplacement for your favorite spreadsheet application. We are a small team with limited time after all. Thanks\nfor your understanding :)\n\n## Wiki\n\nFor user and developer documentation, check out our Wiki at:\nhttps://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki.\n\n## Continuous, Nightly builds\n\nDownload continuous builds for AppImage, macOS and Windows here:\n\n* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/continuous\n> Note: A continuous build is generated when a new commit is added to the `master` branch.<br>\n\nDownload nightly builds for Windows and macOS here:\n\n* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest\n\n## Windows\n\nDownload Windows releases here:\n\n* https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/#windows\n\nOr use Chocolatey:\n\n```\nchoco install sqlitebrowser\n```\n\nOr use winget:\n\n```\nwinget install -e --id DBBrowserForSQLite.DBBrowserForSQLite\n```\n\nOr use scoop:\n```\nscoop install sqlitebrowser\n```\n\n#### Continuous, Nightly builds\n\nContinuous builds are available here:\n\n* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/continuous\n\nNightly builds are available here:\n* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest\n\n## macOS\n\nDB Browser for SQLite works well on macOS.\n\n* macOS 10.15 (Catalina) - 14.0 (Sonoma) are tested and known to work.\n\n#### Stable release\n\nDownload macOS releases here:\n\n* https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/#macos\n\nThe latest macOS binary can be installed via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/ \"Homebrew Cask\"):\n\n```\nbrew install --cask db-browser-for-sqlite\n```\n\n#### Continuous, Nightly builds\n\nContinuous builds are available here:\n\n* https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/continuous\n\nNightly builds are available here:\n* https://nightlies.sqlitebrowser.org/latest\n\nand also you can be installed via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/ \"Homebrew Cask\"):\n\n```\nbrew tap homebrew/cask-versions\n\n# for the version without SQLCipher support\nbrew install --cask db-browser-for-sqlite-nightly\n\n# for the version with SQLCipher support\nbrew install --cask db-browser-for-sqlcipher-nightly\n```\n\nIt also has its own Homebrew tap the include Cask for older version.<br>\nFor more information, see the following: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/homebrew-tap\n\n## Linux\n\nDB Browser for SQLite works well on Linux.\n\n### Arch Linux\n\nArch Linux provides an [up to date version](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/sqlitebrowser/)\n\nInstall with the following command:\n\n    sudo pacman -S sqlitebrowser\n\n### Debian\n\nDebian focuses more on stability rather than newest features.<br>\nTherefore packages will typically contain an older (but well tested) version, compared to the latest release.\n\nUpdate the cache using:\n\n    sudo apt-get update\n\nInstall the package using:\n\n    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser\n\n### Fedora\n\nInstall for Fedora (i386 and x86_64) by issuing the following command:\n\n    sudo dnf install sqlitebrowser\n    \n### openSUSE\n\n    sudo zypper install sqlitebrowser\n\n### Ubuntu and Derivatives\n\n#### Stable release\n\nFor Ubuntu and derivatives, [@deepsidhu1313](https://github.com/deepsidhu1313)\nprovides a PPA with the latest release here:\n\n* https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser\n\nTo add this PPA just type in this command in terminal:\n\n    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser\n\nThen update the cache using:\n\n    sudo apt-get update\n\nInstall the package using:\n\n    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser\n\nPackages for Older Ubuntu releases are supported while launchpad keeps building those or if Older Ubuntu release has dependency packages that are required to build the latest version of Sqlitebrowser. We don't remove builds from our ppa repos, so users can still install older version of sqlitebrowser if they like. Alternatively Linux users can also switch to Snap packages if Snap packages are supported by the distro they are using.\n\n#### Nightly builds\n\nNightly builds are available here:\n\n* https://launchpad.net/~linuxgndu/+archive/ubuntu/sqlitebrowser-testing\n\nTo add this PPA, type these commands into the terminal:\n\n    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser-testing\n\nThen update the cache using:\n\n    sudo apt-get update\n\nInstall the package using:\n\n    sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser\n\n### Other Linux\n\nOn others, compile DB4S using the instructions in [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md).\n\n## FreeBSD\n\nDB Browser for SQLite works well on FreeBSD, and there is a port for it (thanks\nto [lbartoletti](https://github.com/lbartoletti) :smile:).<br>DB4S can be installed\nusing either this command:\n\n    make -C /usr/ports/databases/sqlitebrowser install\n\nor this command:\n\n    pkg install sqlitebrowser\n\n## Snap packages\n\n[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/sqlitebrowser)\n\n#### Snap Nightlies\n\n     snap install sqlitebrowser --edge\n\n#### Snap Stable\n\n     snap install sqlitebrowser\n\n## Nix Packages\n\n`sqlitebrowser` is packaged and available in nixpkgs.\nIt can be used with the experimental flakes and nix-command features with:\n\n    nix profile install nixpkgs#sqlitebrowser\n\nOr with the `nix-env` or `nix-shell` commands:\n\n    nix-shell -p sqlitebrowser\n\n### Flox\n\n`sqlitebrowser` can be installed into a Flox environment with.\n\n    flox install sqlitebrowser\n\n## Compiling\n\nInstructions for compiling on Windows, macOS, Linux, and FreeBSD are\nin [BUILDING](BUILDING.md).\n\n## X (Known as Twitter)\n\nFollow us on X: https://x.com/sqlitebrowser\n\n## Website\n\n* https://sqlitebrowser.org\n\n## Old project page\n\n* https://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser\n\n## Releases\n\n* [Version 3.13.1 released](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases/tag/v3.13.1) -

The original version was used as a free companion\ntool to the Arca Database Xtra, a commercial product that embeds SQLite\ndatabases with some additional extensions to handle compressed and binary data.\n\nThe original code was trimmed and adjusted to be compatible with standard\nSQLite 2.x databases. The resulting program was renamed SQLite Database\nBrowser, and released into the Public Domain by Mauricio. Icons were\ncontributed by [Raquel Ravanini](http://www.raquelravanini.com), also from\nTabuleiro. Jens Miltner ([@jmiltner](https://github.com/jmiltner)) contributed\nthe code to support SQLite 3.x databases for the 1.2 release.\n\nPete Morgan ([@daffodil](https://github.com/daffodil)) created an initial\nproject on GitHub with the code in 2012, where several contributors fixed and\nimproved pieces over the years. RenÃ© Peinthor ([@rp-](https://github.com/rp-))\nand Martin Kleusberg ([@MKleusberg](https://github.com/MKleusberg)) then\nbecame involved, and have been the main driving force from that point.  Justin\nClift ([@justinclift](https://github.com/justinclift)) helps out with testing\non OSX, and started the new github.com/sqlitebrowser organisation on GitHub.\n\n[John T. Haller](https://johnhaller.com), of\n[PortableApps.com](https://portableapps.com) fame, created the new logo.  He\nbased it on the Tango icon set (public domain).\n\nIn August 2014, the project was renamed to \"Database Browser for SQLite\" at\nthe request of [Richard Hipp](https://www.hwaci.com/drh) (creator of\n[SQLite](https://sqlite.org)), as the previous name was creating unintended\nsupport issues.\n\nIn September 2014, the project was renamed to \"DB Browser for SQLite\", to\navoid confusion with an existing application called \"Database Browser\".\n\n## Contributors\n\nView the list by going to the [__Contributors__ tab](https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/graphs/contributors).\n\n## License\n\nSee the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for licensing information.\n\n  [gitter-img]: https://badges.gitter.im/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser.svg\n  [gitter]: https://gitter.im/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser\n\n  [slack-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/chat-on%20slack-orange.svg\n  [slack]: https://join.slack.com/t/db4s/shared_invite/enQtMzc3MzY5OTU4NDgzLWRlYjk0ZmE5ZDEzYWVmNDQxYTYxNmJjNWVkMjI3ZmVjZTY2NDBjODY3YzNhNTNmZDVlNWI2ZGFjNTk5MjJkYmU\n\n  [download-img]: https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/total.svg\n  [download]: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/releases\n\n  [qt-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/Qt-cmake-green.svg\n  [qt]: https://www.qt.io\n\n  [coverity-img]: https://img.shields.io/coverity/scan/11712.svg\n  [coverity]: https://scan.coverity.com/projects/sqlitebrowser-sqlitebrowser\n\n  [patreon-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/donate-Patreon-coral.svg\n  [patreon]: https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=11578749\n\n  [wiki-img]: https://img.shields.io/badge/docs-Wiki-blue.svg\n  [wiki]: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/wiki\n\n  [ghaction-img]: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/actions/workflows/cppcmake.yml/badge.svg\n  [ghaction]: https://github.com/sqlitebrowser/sqlitebrowser/actions/workflows/cppcmake.yml\n"
