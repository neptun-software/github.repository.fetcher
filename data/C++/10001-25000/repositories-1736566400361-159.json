          "content": "# Architecture\n\nThis document describes the layout of the samples repository.\n\nThe top level directory is a Gradle project. This directory can be opened in\nAndroid Studio (and that will be the easiest way to work with the samples).\n\n## Directory structure\n\n### Samples\n\nMost subdirectories are the individual sample apps. These can't be opened in\nAndroid Studio individually, as they rely on common code from the top level\nproject. These subdirectories have their own `build.gradle` (the Groovy DSL) or\n`build.gradle.kts` (the Kotlin DSL) files. In Gradle terms these are \"projects\".\nAndroid Studio calls them \"modules\". The documentation in this repository will\ntypically call them \"modules\".\n\nEach sample has its own README.md that explains what features it demonstrates,\nas well as any unique requirements.\n\nTo run a sample, use the configuration selector in the top panel of Android\nStudio to select the sample and then click run. For example, to run the\nendless-tunnel sample game:\n\n![Select and run a sample][docs/run-sample.png]\n\n#### Build types\n\nAndroid Gradle modules have multiple \"build types\", sometimes called \"variants\".\nFor most of the samples, there are only two build types: debug and release. A\nfew samples, notably the sanitizers sample, have more. To view the build types\nfor the modules in this repository, in the Android Studio application menu,\nselect View -> Tool Windows -> Build Variants. A window will open that lets you\nselect the active variant for each sample.\n\n### build-logic\n\nThe `build-logic` directory contains Gradle convention plugins used by this\nrepository. This is where Gradle policy decisions that apply to the whole\nrepository are made.\n\nSee the README.md in that directory for more details.\n\n### docs\n\nDocumentation and supporting artifacts for this repository. Yes, for now it's\njust images for the READMEs and this doc.\n\n### gradle/libs.versions.toml\n\nThis is a Gradle [version catalog]. It's the central location that defines the\nlibrary and plugin dependencies for each sample.\n\nThe Android Gradle Plugin does not support evaluating version catalog fields in\nits DSL, so versions for SDK and NDK tools (`ndkVersion`, `compileSdkVersion`,\n`targetSdkVersion`, etc) are all defined by the convention plugins in\n[build-logic](#build-logic).\n\n[version catalog]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/platforms.html\n\n### Gradle wrapper\n\nThe `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` scripts are the Gradle wrappers, macOS/Linux-\nand Windows batch-compatible respectively. They will manage the Gradle\ninstallation used by this repository for you, ensuring that the correct versions\nand environment are used. These should be used instead of running `gradle`\ndirectly.\n\n`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` defines which version of Gradle will\nbe used. This should rarely be modified manually. Android Studio's Upgrade\nAssistant will manage that file and upgrade to whatever version of Gradle it\nprefers for that version of Android Studio and Android Gradle.\n\n### build.gradle and settings.gradle\n\nThe build.gradle (or build.gradle.kts) file is the top level build file. It\ndoesn't do anything interesting but declares which plugins will be used by the\nchild modules. Each sample's module has its own build.gradle file that defines\nproperties of the app.\n\nThe settings.gradle (or settings.gradle.kts) file configures repositories for\nfetching dependencies, and declares each app module.\n\n### Metadata directories\n\n#### .github\n\nThis directory contains GitHub metadata files, such as GitHub Action workflows\nand Issue templates.\n\n#### .google\n\nThe `packaging.yaml` file in this directory is used by Android Studio to enable\nthe File -> New -> Import Sample feature. As this repository is a monolithic\nsample project, it should not need to be changed.\n"

Clone the repository\n2. Open the whole project in Android Studio\n3. Select the sample you want to run in the top bar (you may need to sync gradle\n   first)\n4. Click the play button to run the sample\n\nYou can also build the samples from the command line if you prefer. Use\n`./gradlew build` to build everything (if you're on Windows, use `.\\gradlew.bat`\ninstead of `./gradlew`). For individual tasks, see `./gradlew tasks`. To see the\ntasks for an individual sample, run the `tasks` task for that directory. For\nexample, `./gradlew :camera:basic:tasks` will show the tasks for the\n`camera/basic` app.\n\n## I just want something to copy from as a starting point\n\nThe samples in this repository are generally not a good starting point for a\nproduction quality app. They aim to demonstrate individual NDK APIs, but often\nmake sacrifices to be succinct that make them unsuitable for a production app.\nThis is gradually changing, but for now you should not do this.\n\n[Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid/) is an excellent\nresource for production quality apps in general, but does not touch on NDK-\nspecific issues. https://github.com/DanAlbert/ndk-app-template can help some\nwith that until this repository is able to.\n\nYou're most likely best served by using the New Project wizard in Android Studio\nto create a new app, then using those resources and the samples here as a\nreference. Android Studio's \"Native C++\" template is a good starting point for\ntypical applications that need to use some C++ via JNI. The \"Game Activity\"\ntemplate is a good starting point for game-like apps (that is, apps that do not\nuse the Android UI, but instead render their own UI using OpenGL or Vulkan).\n\n## Additional documentation\n\n- [Add Native Code to Your Project](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code.html)\n- [Configure NDK for Android Studio/Gradle Plugin](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/configure-agp-ndk)\n- [CMake for NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/cmake.html)\n\n## Support\n\nIf you've found an issue with a sample and you know how to fix it, please\n[send us a PR!](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf you need to report a bug, where it needs to be filed depends on the type of\nissue:\n\n- Problems with the samples themselves:\n  https://github.com/googlesamples/android-ndk/issues\n- Problems with the OS APIs: http://b.android.com (usually the Framework\n  component)\n- Problems with NDK (that is, the compiler):\n  https://github.com/android/ndk/issues\n\nFor questions about using the NDK or the platform APIs, you can ask on:\n\n- [The NDK mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/android-ndk) (best if\n  you're not sure where else to ask)\n- The [Discussions](https://github.com/android/ndk-samples/discussions) tab of\n  this repo (best for questions about the samples themselves)\n- The NDK's [Discussions](https://github.com/android/ndk/discussions) (best for\n  questions about the NDK compilers and build systems)\n- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/android)\n\n## Additional NDK samples:\n\n- [Google Play Game Samples with Android Studio](https://github.com/playgameservices/cpp-android-basic-samples)\n- [Google Android Vulkan Tutorials](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-vulkan-tutorials)\n- [Android Vulkan API Basic Samples](https://github.com/googlesamples/vulkan-basic-samples)\n- [Android High Performance Audio](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-audio-high-performance)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright 2018 The Android Open Source Project, Inc.\n\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor\nlicense agreements.
