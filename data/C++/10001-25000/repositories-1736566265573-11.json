          "content": "# The Security Assurance Case for osquery\n\nThis document details the basic security principles of osquery's development, the specific threat cases that the team\nof maintainers have thought about, and how we have attempted to mitigate them.\n\nIn other words, this describes why we think the osquery agent is adequately secure software: the \"assurance case\" for\nosquery. This is a living document, and is the result of continuous threat-modeling during osquery's continued\ndevelopment and maintenance.\n\n## The osquery Threat Model\n\nThe core osquery agent is a single-executable daemon, running on each host that is to be queried.\n\nThe osquery agent does not trust:\n\n- users on the osquery host with standard non-root privilege (no interaction with the users on the host)\n- network third-parties, including external network services (see \"No Network Connectivity to Third Parties\") or\nagents-in-the-middle on the network (see \"use of HTTPS\")\n\nHowever, the osquery agent _must_ trust:\n\n- its config server, if using a remote server to deliver the osquery config\n- the person issuing queries, which is the same role as can modify the config\n\nNote that in this threat model, osquery does _not_ currently have mitigations for:\n\n- an attacker that has successfully elevated to root privilege, and subverts or kills the osquery process\n\n### osquery's Assets\n\n- osquery executable\n- osquery config (may contain threat-hunting queries)\n- local database backing store (RocksDB)\n- osquery's own logs\n- osquery's extension socket (or named pipe, on Windows)\n\n### osquery's Threat Agents\n\n- Remote attacker\n- Network agent-in-the-middle\n- Attacker on the osquery host, with User privilege\n- Attacker on the osquery host, with Root privilege\n- Compromised or maliciously controlled osquery config server\n- Supply-chain threats (vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies)\n\n### Vulnerabilities in Third-party Library Dependencies\n\nTracking and updating native C/C++ library dependencies is a relatively manual process compared to package-managed programming\nlanguages. Ideally, we learn of newly disclosed vulnerabilities in osquery's dependencies through the use of a scheduled\nautomated dependency-checking script in our CI workflows. This workflow is designed to produce timely\n[alerts as new GitHub issues](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Acve+).\nWe close these issues by either adding the alert to an ignore list (following an assessment of how it does not impact\nosquery), or by updating the appropriate dependency or dependencies.\n\nThe osquery maintainers make a best effort to rapidly update vulnerable libraries by releasing a new version of osquery, when\nneeded. Here is an [example code diff](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/7877/files) demonstrating how we update a\nthird-party dependency. We must regenerate the dependency's CMake configuration for each of osquery's supported\nplatforms, then update its Git submodule hash, and lastly we update the hash in the manifest file we use to power our\ndependency-checking automation.\n\nFinally, a note: sometimes security-dependency-checking tools generate false positives. There may be a vulnerability\nin one of osquery's dependencies, but for one reason or another it may not actually affect osquery. We still make an effort\nto update to fixed versions of libraries, but more or less urgently depending on osquery's actual exposure to the risk.\nUntil recently we used the osquery wiki to maintain an\n[updated impact assessment of all known issues](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment/dependency-security/)\nthat have been reported as being vulnerabilities in osquery's third-party dependencies. Now, however, we document our\nassessments of the impact directly in the individual GitHub issues.\n\n## Security Design Considerations of osquery\n\nThe following is a list of high-level considerations for security, and efforts that osquery and its team of maintainers\nimplement in the current version of the software.\n\n### Confidentiality Considerations\n\n#### Use of HTTPS (TLS)\n\nThe current version of osquery uses HTTPS (specifically, the TLS v1.2 protocol), to encrypt all of its communications.\n\n#### No Custom Cryptography\n\nOnly well-known, industry standard encryption libraries are used in osquery. Specifically, OpenSSL.\n\n#### No Network Connectivity to Third Parties\n\nHere, we define a \"third-party\" as any remote server _other than the ones that deliver the agent's config or receive\nits logs_, which for many osquery deployments may be hosted by a SaaS provider (not on-premises).\n\nWith one or two opt-in exceptions (_e.g._, use of the cURL table, or certain configurations of the yara table), the\nosquery core agent will never make an outbound network connection to a third-party server.\n\nIn no case will the osquery core agent ever listen for or accept inbound network connections.\n\n#### Does Not 'shell out' to Other Binaries for Data Collection\n\nThe osquery executable will be the only process; it spawns two instances (a worker process and a watchdog). It does\nnot fork/subprocess/shell out to any other executables. An optional extension interface allows osquery to communicate\nwith osquery extensions (separate executables), which are allowed to invoke their own additional processes.\n\n#### Access Control Functions\n\nosquery makes use of system-provided access control permissions to restrict access to the following osquery assets:\n\n- Reading and writing storage and cached content used by osquery, a.k.a., the RocksDB storage layer\n- Reading and writing status logs and results logs, when osquery logs are written to the filesystem\n- Reading and writing to the osquery extensions socket (or Pipe, on Windows)\n\n### Integrity Considerations\n\n#### Limited Attack Surface\n\nAs mentioned, osquery never listens on network interfaces. If it is configured to use the network at all, it is\nopt-in, and always using a poll model.\n\nosquery minimizes its exposure to user-controlled data on disk by relying on access through OS-provided APIs wherever\npossible. When osquery performs file parsing, it usually does so within third-party libraries that are statically\nlinked into osquery.\n\nThe osquery maintainers react to known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries by being responsive to vulnerability\ndisclosures, upgrading osquery to use the patched version of the associated dependency, and making the new version of\nosquery available at the very next release cycle, if not sooner (urgent security issues may be addressed in an\nout-of-cycle \"point release\").\n\n#### Daemon Runs as root (or Administrator)\n\nThe recommended, and default, way to run the osquery daemon is as root (or Administrator, on Windows).\n\n- Its files are owned as root (config, RocksDB) to resist tampering\n- Extensions must also run as root, and communicate over an IPC restricted to root\n- When osquery runs as root, it enforces additional file permission checks on the osquery core executable file and that\n  of any extensions. For example, a user-controlled directory or binary should not be run as root, since osquery will\n  fork and exec itself, which may lead to TOCTOU bugs. To prevent this, osquery checks for the secure set of file\n  permissions during its startup, and quits with a warning if the permissions are insufficient, unless the user\n  overrides this check with a flag.\n\n#### No Self-update Feature\n\nThe osquery agent will never update or replace itself. The sysadmin is in control of when to update, using their method\nof choice for software update management. Products that ship with or include the osquery agent may have self-update\nfeatures, but the core agent itself does not.\n\n#### No Methods to Modify System State\n\nMaking no changes to the existing host system (its configuration or its data) is a goal that osquery seeks to achieve,\nbut on a best-effort basis. The maintainers enforce this as a policy for the acceptance of any new contributed\ncode in osquery. If we are made aware of violations of this rule, we treat them as high priority bugs and promptly fix\nthem. Where it is for some reason unavoidable, we will document any exceptions here.\n\nExceptions:\n\n- To monitor the Linux Audit subsystem for events (`--audit_allow_config`), osquery changes kernel Audit settings.\n- The osquery installer, or its included convenience scripts, may install the osquery daemon to launch as a service.\n\n#### Static Linking of Libraries\n\nThe osquery executable is self-contained and statically linked, so it has no external library dependencies except the\nabsolute minimum required to load on each platform that it supports. This allows osquery to control the version of its\nthird-party dependencies (it will not be subject to outdated dynamic libraries on a host), and helps osquery avoid\ncertain kinds of library injection privilege-escalation attacks on the host.\n\n#### Code-signed Releases\n\nEvery release of osquery is code-signed, on every supported platform.\n\n### Availability Considerations\n\nAvailability refers to the agent's goal of being resilient to communications failure, shutdown, or other kinds\nof denial-of-service condition. This is one of the three traditional pillars of security design, after confidentiality\nand integrity.\n\n#### Minimal Configuration by Default\n\nThe less functionality is enabled, the fewer things can hypothetically go wrong: that is the reasoning behind the\ndesign principle of osquery requiring an explicit opt-in to enable some of its functionality.\n\n#### Watchdog\n\nThe osquery agent operates as a watchdog process and a worker process, with one forking the other at osquery startup.\nThe intent of the watchdog process is to enforce limits on resource use by the worker process, but one side-benefit\nis that it mitigates certain denial-of-service risks. For example, a poorly crafted query that would otherwise run\non forever, or intentionally planted data on the host that has been crafted specifically to cause a denial-of-service in\nthe osquery agent. Either of those would trigger the watchdog to restart osquery and temporarily ban the query that\nexhibited the problematic behavior, reducing the impact on operations.\n\n## Security Implemented in Development Lifecycle Processes\n\nThe osquery development lifecycle includes many practices to mitigate security issues from entering the codebase:\n\n- configuration management via git, where we can track the changes, who made them, and when they were made\n- issue tracking, code review discussions and contribution management via GitHub\n- use of GitHub's authentication and authorization system to granularly control access permissions\n- limited number of individuals with commit access: the [Technical Steering\n  Committee](https://github.com/orgs/osquery/teams/technical-steering-committee) has control over the GitHub organization, and its members regularly perform code review and merge actions\n- all changes are made in branches, and then merged only after review\n- second-party review required to merge a contribution\n- use of cppcheck\n- use of clang-tidy to enforce readable code formatting, making bugs easier to spot\n- use of clang sanitizers, to automatically detect memory-corruption errors\n- fuzzed by oss-fuzz ([project page](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/osquery))\n- use of modern C++, limiting memory-unsafe language use: not C (except where in third-party library dependencies)\n- using warnings as errors: see [the cmake configuration for the project](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/blob/master/cmake/flags.cmake): using `Wall` and `pedantic`, among others\n- reproducible builds\n- third-party dependencies are retrieved using a known commit hash from their respective repositories\n- opting into compile-time security mitigations (stack protectors, full \"relro\", and other compiler-available hardening options): see [the cmake configuration for the project](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/blob/master/cmake/flags.cmake)\n- only the required subset of the TSC has access to code-signing secrets / key material, and they are protected within a\n  separate GitHub repo that performs osquery release signing\n\nSee our [CONTRIBUTING doc](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#guidelines-for-contributing-features-to-osquery-core) for more information on our guiding principles for osquery development.\n"

Several improvements to various tables, and their handling.\n\nOne potential breaking change, is in how [the watchdog calculates CPU utilization](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/8104).\nPreviously, this calculation was based on physical CPUs, now it is based on virtual cores. We believe this makes more sense with modern CPUs.\n\nA second potential breaking change, is in PR [#8102](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/pull/8102). In addition to allowing decorations to the top level of the status logs, this PR normalizes the decorations format to the results log. In practice, this means that the `unixTime`, `severity` and `line` JSON fields are now numbers instead of strings.\n\nRepresenting commits from 18 contributors!

          "content": "# Contributing to osquery\n\nWe want to make contributing to osquery as simple and transparent as\npossible. These guidelines explain the basics of the osquery\ndevelopment process and how you can contribute. Please read these\nguidelines before submitting your code as they are designed to save\nyou time later on when your code is under review.\n\n## Contributing 101\n\nAll contributions are submitted via pull requests (PRs) open against\nthe osquery's [master](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/tree/master)\nbranch on GitHub. After being reviewed by the _core team_ and tested\nby CI, if all is well, they will be pushed to master and the\ncorresponding PR closed.\n\nYou can see who the _core team_ is by viewing the [team\npage](https://github.com/orgs/osquery/teams) on the osquery GitHub\norganization.\n\nIf you need help, both the core team and community members are on the osquery [Slack](https://osquery.slack.com).\nFeel free to register using the following [shared invite](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-1wipcuc04-DBXmo51zYJKBu3_EP3xZPA).\nThe `#code-review` Slack channel has been set up to handle urgent review needs as well as questions about your PR.\nNote: prefer to keep discussion about code changes in the GitHub pull request thread.\n\nThe osquery team also hosts regular office hours where the community\nis invited to discuss osquery development with the core team. You are\nwelcome to join. Office hours are announced on our Slack on the\n`#officehours` channel.\n\n## Development Process Guidelines\n\nFor documentation on building, testing, and formatting code, please\nreview the ReadTheDocs article on [building\nosquery](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/building/).\nThis CONTRIBUTING guide focuses more on concepts and high level\nworkflow.\n\n### Blueprints\n\nIf you plan to submit a change to the osquery core, a new big feature,\nor in general a change that merits discussion, start by opening a\n[Blueprint](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/new?template=Blueprint.md)\nissue.\n\nA blueprint issue is a standard GitHub issue, tagged with the label\n[#blueprint](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/labels/blueprint),\nwhich describes your idea, the problem you are solving and how you\nplan to implement your solution. The goal of the blueprint is to allow\nboth the core team and the community to discuss whether a certain\nchange is desirable and will be accepted, and identify possible\nproblems with the implementation before it even starts.\n\nThere aren't strict guidelines on when a blueprint is needed or not,\nso you should use your best judgement or just ping the osquery team on\nour `#core` channel on Slack. Here are some examples of changes which\n**would** benefit from a blueprint:\n\n* Change the basic functioning of the query scheduler\n* Alter the thrift interfaces\n* Reimplement the logger interface\n* Add a new plugin type\n\nThere isn't either a strict format for the blueprints, but make sure\nto include what problem you are trying to solve and how you plan to\nsolve it. We can go from that and ask more information if\nnecessary. If you have code already, even if it is only a\nproof-of-concept that will be dropped later, please submit it as a PR\nand associate it with the blueprint by mentioning the blueprint issue\non the pull request.\n\nPlease remember that blueprints are mostly designed to save **you**\ntime by preventing you from implementing code which won't be accepted\nor will need to be extensively modified later on. Please use the right\n[template](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/new?template=Blueprint.md)\nfor the issue. Feel free to advertise your blueprint and ask for\nfeedback on Slack.\n\n### Pull requests\n\n**Do not submit multiple unrelated changes on the same PR.** A pull\nrequest must represent a single body of work. If your work requires a\nbug-fix, submit that first on a separate PR, the same goes for\nrefactors. If you can split your work into multiple smaller PRs please\nalso do so. This is of utmost importance to allow fast reviews and to\nsimplify regression tracking, reverts and references.\n\nStart by developing your feature on a [feature\nbranch](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), possibly\nformatting your code before each commit, and when ready submit a pull\nrequest against the osquery master branch.  The initial PR should\npreferably **contain a single commit**.  If you are unfamiliar with\nGitHub or how pull requests work, GitHub has a very easy to follow\nguide that teaches you [how to fork the project and submit your first\nPR] (https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).\n\nIt is helpful if you tag the GitHub issues you are addressing on the\nbody of your PR description. If your PR is intended to close an issue\nkeywords (like `fixes` or `closes`) as defined on [GitHub\nHelp](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords/).\n\nOnce you submit your PR, a formatting check and continuous integration\ntests will be triggered on the CI systems for the multiple platforms\nwe support. If all the required checks and tests are successful the\ncore team will review your PR.  If the tests fail or the reviewer\nrequests changes, please submit those changes by **appending new\ncommits** to your feature branch. **Avoid amending old commits** as\nthat makes it harder for the reviewer to track your updates. If you\nneed to keep your PR up-to-date with master the preferred way is to\n[rebase your\nbranch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-git-rebase) on\n`master` and `git push` with the `--force` option. Finally, the core\nteam might help you with getting your PR accepted by pushing directly\nto your branch when that makes sense.\n\nOnce both the core team and CI are happy with the PR (remember tests\nneed to pass for all of the supported platforms) the PR will be\nsquashed into a single commit and pushed to the master branch.  Only\nthe core team can merge pull requests and therefore at least one core\nteam member will always review your PR, however reviews from the\ncommunity are highly encouraged and desirable.\n\nFinally, we try to keep only active PRs open, and we like to merge PRs as quickly as possible.\nIf your PR is stale we will close it, however if you want to get back to it at a certain point feel free to re-open, or comment on it.\n\n### A note about labels\n\nThe core team uses labels to tag each and every pull request. If you\ncare about their meaning take a look at\n[labels](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/labels) on\nGitHub. However, only the core team can label issues and PRs, so you\ndon't need to care too much about this.\n\n### Milestones and release versions\n\nWe currently do not use a strict release schedule and we tag new minor versions ideally every two months.\nOtherwise, we may tag a release if it makes sense according to the new features implemented or if critical bug-fixes where merged.\nWe keep several near-future milestones open and try to tag PRs with the milestone when appropriate.\n\n[Milestones](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/milestones) are used for the planned minor releases.\nIf your PR is tagged with the next milestone you can expect it to be merged as soon as it is ready.\nWe may keep PRs open and wait for a major release milestone if the code changes features that are not backwards-compatible.\n\n### Branches and tags\n\nThe osquery repo contains only the\n[master](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/tree/master) branch which\nwe do our best to keep stable. We don't keep feature or release\nbranches. The master branch will always keep a linear history and no\nmerge commits are allowed. All our releases are tagged.\n\n## Bug reports and feature requests\n\nDeveloping code is not the only way to contribute to\nosquery. Submitting bug reports and new ideas is also valuable and\nappreciated.\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. To submit a\nbug report follow the [Bug\nReport](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/new?template=Bug_Report.md)\ntemplate, to submit a feature request use the [Feature\nRequest](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues/new?template=Feature_Request.md)\ntemplate.\n\n**Please only use issues for bug reports or feature requests**. If you\nhave deployment questions or issues or a general question about\nosquery use our Slack instead as you will have better support\nthere. For the fastest result, you should search the available\nchannels and choose the most appropriate one for your question. You\nshould post in the general channel as a last resort.\n\n**If you are using a vendor product please use the appropriate channel\nas we won't be able to support vendor deployments on the non-vendor\nchannels.**\n\n## Guidelines for contributing features to osquery core\n\nThe software housed in this repo is known as osquery core. While there\nare occasional exceptions, contributions to core should abide by the\nfollowing osquery guiding principles in order to be accepted:\n\n1. osquery does not change the state of the system\n2. osquery does not create network traffic to third parties\n3. osquery binaries have a light memory footprint\n4. osquery minimizes system overhead & maximizes performance\n5. osquery does not 'shell out' to other binaries for data collection\n6. The query schema for osquery seeks uniformity between operating systems\n\nFor new features that do not align with the mission principles of\ncore, you may build outside of osquery core in separate integrated\nprocesses called extensions:\nhttps://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/stable/development/osquery-sdk/.\n\n### Does my contribution belong in Core or in an Extension?\n\nBelongs in Core:\n\n* Observes guiding principles\n* Has been shared with and approved by osquery project maintainers\n* Meets osquery's testing and quality standards\n\nBelongs in an extension:\n\n* Might not observe the osquery core guiding principles\n* Expands the scope of use for osquery beyond endpoint monitoring\n* Integrates with a proprietary or esoteric tool that is not widely applicable\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nYou must submit a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before we can\naccept any of your pull requests. You only need to submit one CLA for\nany of osquery's open source projects.\n\nThis is managed through the Linux Foundations's EasyCLA. It will\ncomment appropriately on your PR.\n\n## Technical Steering Committee\n\nAs defined by the [the osquery\ncharter](https://github.com/osquery/foundation/blob/master/CHARTER.md),\nthe Technical Steering Committee (or TSC for short) is responsible for\noversight of the osquery project.\n\nThe [GitHub\nTeam](https://github.com/orgs/osquery/teams/technical-steering-committee)\nis the authoritative source, though we maintain the list here as well.\n\nCurrent Members (in alphabetical order):\n\n* Alessandro -- [@alessandrogario](https://github.com/alessandrogario)\n* Nick -- [@muffins](https://github.com/muffins)\n* seph -- [@directionless](https://github.com/directionless)\n* Sharvil -- [@sharvilshah](https://github.com/sharvilshah)\n* Teddy -- [@theopolis](https://github.com/theopolis)\n* Victor -- [@groob](https://github.com/groob)\n* Zach -- [@zwass](https://github.com/zwass)\n\nThe Technical Steering Commit is chaired by seph. \n\n## License\n\nBy contributing to osquery you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nin accordance with the terms specified in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n"

This allows you to\nwrite SQL-based queries to explore operating system data.  With osquery, SQL tables represent\nabstract concepts such as running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections,\nbrowser plugins, hardware events or file hashes.\n\nSQL tables are implemented via a simple plugin and extensions API. A variety of tables already exist\nand more are being written: [https://osquery.io/schema](https://osquery.io/schema/). To best\nunderstand the expressiveness that is afforded to you by osquery, consider the following SQL\nqueries:\n\nList the [`users`](https://osquery.io/schema/current#users):\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM users;\n```\n\nCheck the [`processes`](https://osquery.io/schema/current#processes) that have a deleted executable:\n\n```sql\nSELECT * FROM processes WHERE on_disk = 0;\n```\n\nGet the process name, port, and PID, for processes listening on all interfaces:\n\n```sql\nSELECT DISTINCT processes.name, listening_ports.port, processes.pid\n  FROM listening_ports JOIN processes USING (pid)\n  WHERE listening_ports.address = '0.0.0.0';\n```\n\nFind every macOS LaunchDaemon that launches an executable and keeps it running:\n\n```sql\nSELECT name, program || program_arguments AS executable\n  FROM launchd\n  WHERE (run_at_load = 1 AND keep_alive = 1)\n  AND (program != '' OR program_arguments != '');\n```\n\nCheck for ARP anomalies from the host's perspective:\n\n```sql\nSELECT address, mac, COUNT(mac) AS mac_count\n  FROM arp_cache GROUP BY mac\n  HAVING count(mac) > 1;\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could also use a SQL sub-query to accomplish the same result:\n\n```sql\nSELECT address, mac, mac_count\n  FROM\n    (SELECT address, mac, COUNT(mac) AS mac_count FROM arp_cache GROUP BY mac)\n  WHERE mac_count > 1;\n```\n\nThese queries can be:\n\n- performed on an ad-hoc basis to explore operating system state using the\n  [osqueryi](https://osquery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction/using-osqueryi/) shell\n- executed via a [scheduler](https://osquery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction/using-osqueryd/)\n  to monitor operating system state across a set of hosts\n- launched from custom applications using osquery Thrift APIs\n\n## Download & Install\n\nTo download the latest stable builds and for repository information\nand installation instructions visit\n[https://osquery.io/downloads](https://osquery.io/downloads/).\n\nWe use a simple numbered versioning scheme `X.Y.Z`, where X is a major version, Y is a minor, and Z is a patch.\nWe plan minor releases roughly every two months. These releases are tracked on our [Milestones](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/milestones) page. A patch release is used when there are unforeseen bugs with our minor release and we need to quickly patch.\nA rare 'revision' release might be used if we need to change build configurations.\n\nMajor, minor, and patch releases are tagged on GitHub and can be viewed on the [Releases](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/releases) page.\nWe open a new [Release Checklist](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/New_Release.md) issue when we prepare a minor release. If you are interested in the status of a release, please find the corresponding checklist issue, and note that the issue will be marked closed when we are finished the checklist.\nWe consider a release 'in testing' during the period of hosting new downloads on our website and adding them to our hosted repositories.\nWe will mark the release as 'stable' on GitHub when enough testing has occurred, this usually takes two weeks.\n\n## Build from source\n\nBuilding osquery from source is encouraged! Check out our [build\nguide](https://osquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/building/).

If you find a\nvulnerability, please see CONTRIBUTING.md#how_to_report_vulnerabilities for how to submit a vulnerability report.\n\n## Security Issues\n\nThis document aggregates security issues (weaknesses and vulnerabilities) affecting osquery. It tracks issues in the format:\n\n```text\n#PRNumber Title - (Optional CVE) - Fixed in Version - Optional Reporter\n```\n\nThere are several types of issues that do not include a CVE or reporter.\nIf you find a security issue and believe a CVE should be assigned, please contact a [member of the TSC](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#technical-steering-committee) in the osquery [Slack](https://osquery.slack.com), we are happy to submit the request and provide attribution to you.\nSpecifically, we will use the GitHub Security Advisory features for CVE requests.\nThe project maintainers will tag related issues and pull requests with the [`hardening`](https://github.com/osquery/osquery/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahardening) label. There may be changes with this label that are not directly security issues.\n\nIf you are editing this document please feel encouraged to change this format to provide more details.
