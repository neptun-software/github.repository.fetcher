Each lesson includes pre- and post-lesson quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more. Our project-based pedagogy allows you to learn while building, a proven way for new skills to 'stick'.\n\nThe projects cover the journey of food from farm to table. This includes farming, logistics, manufacturing, retail and consumer - all popular industry areas for IoT devices.\n\n![A road map for the course showing 24 lessons covering intro, farming, transport, processing, retail and cooking](sketchnotes/Roadmap.jpg)\n\n> Sketchnote by [Nitya Narasimhan](https://github.com/nitya). Click the image for a larger version.\n\n**Hearty thanks to our authors [Jen Fox](https://github.com/jenfoxbot), [Jen Looper](https://github.com/jlooper), [Jim Bennett](https://github.com/jimbobbennett), and our sketchnote artist [Nitya Narasimhan](https://github.com/nitya).**\n\n**Thanks as well to our team of [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn) who have been reviewing and translating this curriculum - [Aditya Garg](https://github.com/AdityaGarg00), [Anurag Sharma](https://github.com/Anurag-0-1-A), [Arpita Das](https://github.com/Arpiiitaaa), [Aryan Jain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aryan-jain-47a4a1145/), [Bhavesh Suneja](https://github.com/EliteWarrior315), [Faith Hunja](https://faithhunja.github.io/), [Lateefah Bello](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lateefah-bello/), [Manvi Jha](https://github.com/Severus-Matthew), [Mireille Tan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mireille-tan-a4834819a/), [Mohammad Iftekher (Iftu) Ebne Jalal](https://github.com/Iftu119), [Mohammad Zulfikar](https://github.com/mohzulfikar), [Priyanshu Srivastav](https://www.linkedin.com/in/priyanshu-srivastav-b067241ba), [Thanmai Gowducheruvu](https://github.com/innovation-platform), and [Zina Kamel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zina-kamel/).**\n\nMeet the team!\n\n[![Promo video](./images/IOT.gif)](https://youtu.be/-wippUJRi5k)\n\n**Gif by** [Mohit Jaisal](https://linkedin.com/in/mohitjaisal)\n\n> 🎥 Click the image above for a video about the project!\n\n> **Teachers**, we have [included some suggestions](for-teachers.md) on how to use this curriculum. If you would like to create your own lessons, we have also included a [lesson template](lesson-template/README.md).\n\n> **[Students](https://aka.ms/student-page)**, to use this curriculum on your own, fork the entire repo and complete the exercises on your own, starting with a pre-lecture quiz, then reading the lecture and completing the rest of the activities. Try to create the projects by comprehending the lessons rather than copying the solution code; however that code is available in the /solutions folders in each project-oriented lesson. Another idea would be to form a study group with friends and go through the content together. For further study, we recommend [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/users/jimbobbennett/collections/ke2ehd351jopwr?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn).\n\nFor a video overview of this course, check out this video:\n\n[![Promo video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/bccEMm8gRuc/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=bccEMm8gRuc \"Promo video\")\n\n> 🎥 Click the image above for a video about the project!\n\n## Pedagogy\n\nWe have chosen two pedagogical tenets while building this curriculum: ensuring that it is project-based and that it includes frequent quizzes. By the end of this series, students will have built a plant monitoring and watering system, a vehicle tracker, a smart factory setup to track and check food, and a voice-controlled cooking timer, and will have learned the basics of the Internet of Things including how to write device code, connect to the cloud, analyze telemetry and run AI on the edge.\n\nBy ensuring that the content aligns with projects, the process is made more engaging for students and retention of concepts will be augmented.\n\nIn addition, a low-stakes quiz before a class sets the intention of the student towards learning a topic, while a second quiz after class ensures further retention. This curriculum was designed to be flexible and fun and can be taken in whole or in part. The projects start small and become increasingly complex by the end of the 12 week cycle.\n\nEach project is based around real-world hardware available to students and hobbyists. Each project looks into the specific project domain, providing relevant background knowledge. To be a successful developer it helps to understand the domain in which you are solving problems, providing this background knowledge allows students to think about their IoT solutions and learnings in the context of the kind of real-world problem that they might be asked to solve as an IoT developer. Students learn the 'why' of the solutions they are building, and get an appreciation of the end user.\n\n## Hardware\n\nWe have two choices of IoT hardware to use for the projects depending on personal preference, programming language knowledge or preferences, learning goals and availability. We have also provided a 'virtual hardware' version for those who don't have access to hardware, or want to learn more before committing to a purchase. You can read more and find a 'shopping list' on the [hardware page](./hardware.md), including links to buy complete kits from our friends at Seeed Studio.\n\n> 💁 Find our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), and [Translation](TRANSLATIONS.md) guidelines. We welcome your constructive feedback!\n\n## Each lesson includes:\n\n- sketchnote\n- optional supplemental video\n- pre-lesson warmup quiz\n- written lesson\n- for project-based lessons, step-by-step guides on how to build the project\n- knowledge checks\n- a challenge\n- supplemental reading\n- assignment\n- post-lesson quiz\n\n> **A note about quizzes**: All quizzes are contained in the quiz-app folder, for 48 total quizzes of three questions each. They are linked from within the lessons but the quiz app can be run locally or deployed to Azure; follow the instruction in the `quiz-app` folder. They are gradually being localized.\n\n## Lessons\n\n|       |              Project Name              |                       Concepts Taught                       | Learning Objectives

For services that require a paid tier, you would have been using them at a level that is included in the free allowance, or will only cost a few cents.\n\nEven with the relatively low costs, it's worth deleting these resources when you are done. You can only have one IoT Hub using the free tier for example, so if you want to create another you will need to use a paid tier.\n\nAll your services were created inside Resource Groups, and this makes it easier to manage. You can delete the Resource Group, and all the services in that Resource Group will be deleted along with it.\n\nTo delete the Resource Group, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:\n\n```sh\naz group delete --name <resource-group-name>\n```\n\nReplace `<resource-group-name>` with the name of the Resource Group you are interested in.\n\nA confirmation will appear:\n\n```output\nAre you sure you want to perform this operation? (y/n): \n```\n\nEnter `y` to confirm and delete the Resource Group.\n\nIt will take a while to delete all the services.\n\n> 💁 You can read more about deleting resource groups on the [Azure Resource Manager resource group and resource deletion documentation on Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/delete-resource-group?WT.mc_id=academic-17441-jabenn&tabs=azure-cli)"

Please feel free!\n\nIn fact, you can use it within GitHub itself by using GitHub Classroom.\n\nTo do that, fork this repo. You are going to need to create a repo for each lesson, so you're going to need to extract each folder into a separate repo. That way, [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms) can pick up each lesson separately.\n\nThese [full instructions](https://github.blog/2020-03-18-set-up-your-digital-classroom-with-github-classroom/) will give you an idea how to set up your classroom.\n\n## Recommended learning model\n\nYou can read more about a recommended learning model when teaching this curriculum in our [Recommended learning model guide](recommended-learning-model.md).\n\n## Using the repo as is\n\nIf you would like to use this repo as it currently stands, without using GitHub Classroom, that can be done as well. You would need to communicate with your students which lesson to work through together.\n\nIn an online format (Zoom, Teams, or other) you might form breakout rooms for the quizzes, and mentor students to help them get ready to learn. Then invite students to for the quizzes and submit their answers as 'issues' at a certain time. You might do the same with assignments, if you want students to work collaboratively out in the open.\n\nIf you prefer a more private format, ask your students to fork the curriculum, lesson by lesson, to their own GitHub repos as private repos, and give you access. Then they can complete quizzes and assignments privately and submit them to you via issues on your classroom repo.\n\nThere are many ways to make this work in an online classroom format. Please let us know what works best for you!\n\n## Please give us your thoughts!\n\nWe want to make this curriculum work for you and your students.

Each project is based on real-world hardware available to students and hobbyists. We have two choices of IoT hardware to use depending on personal preference, programming language knowledge or preferences, learning goals and availability. We have also provided a 'virtual hardware' version for those who don't have access to hardware, or want to learn more before committing to a purchase.\n\n> 💁 You don't need to purchase any IoT hardware to complete the assignments. You can do everything using virtual IoT hardware.\n\nThe physical hardware choices are Arduino, or Raspberry Pi. Each platform has its own upsides and downsides, and these are all covered in one of the initial lessons. If you haven't already decided on a hardware platform, you can review [lesson two of the first project](./1-getting-started/lessons/2-deeper-dive/README.md) to decide which hardware platform you are most interested in learning.\n\nThe specific hardware was chosen to reduce the complexity of the lessons and assignments. Although other hardware may work, we cannot guarantee all the assignments will be supported on your device without additional hardware. For example, a lot of Arduino devices do not have WiFi, which is needed to connect to the cloud - the Wio terminal was chosen because it has WiFi built in.\n\nYou will also need a few non-technical items, such as soil or a pot plant, and fruit or vegetables.\n\n## Buy the kits\n\n![The Seeed studios logo](./images/seeed-logo.png)\n\nSeeed Studios have very kindly made all the hardware available as easy to purchase kits:\n\n### Arduino - Wio Terminal\n\n**[IoT for beginners with Seeed and Microsoft - Wio Terminal Starter Kit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/IoT-for-beginners-with-Seeed-and-Microsoft-Wio-Terminal-Starter-Kit-p-5006.html)**\n\n[![The Wio Terminal hardware kit](./images/wio-hardware-kit.png)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/IoT-for-beginners-with-Seeed-and-Microsoft-Wio-Terminal-Starter-Kit-p-5006.html)\n\n### Raspberry Pi\n\n**[IoT for beginners with Seeed and Microsoft - Raspberry Pi 4 Starter Kit](https://www.seeedstudio.com/IoT-for-beginners-with-Seeed-and-Microsoft-Raspberry-Pi-Starter-Kit-p-5004.html)**\n\n[![The Raspberry Pi Terminal hardware kit](./images/pi-hardware-kit.png)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/IoT-for-beginners-with-Seeed-and-Microsoft-Raspberry-Pi-Starter-Kit-p-5004.html)\n\n## Arduino\n\nAll the device code for Arduino is in C++. To complete all the assignments you will need the following:\n\n### Arduino hardware\n\n* [Wio Terminal](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-p-4509.html)\n* *Optional* - USB-C cable or USB-A to USB-C adapter. The Wio terminal has a USB-C port and comes with a USB-C to USB-A cable. If your PC or Mac only has USB-C ports you will need a USB-C cable, or a USB-A to USB-C adapter.\n\n### Arduino specific sensors and actuators\n\nThese are specific to using the Wio terminal Arduino device, and are not relevant to using the Raspberry Pi.\n\n* [ArduCam Mini 2MP Plus - OV2640](https://www.arducam.com/product/arducam-2mp-spi-camera-b0067-arduino/)\n* [ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-2-Mics-Pi-HAT.html)\n* [Breadboard Jumper Wires](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Breadboard-Jumper-Wire-Pack-241mm-200mm-160mm-117m-p-234.html)\n* Headphones or other speaker with a 3.5mm jack, or a JST speaker such as:\n  * [Mono Enclosed Speaker - 2W 6 Ohm](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Mono-Enclosed-Speaker-2W-6-Ohm-p-2832.html)\n* microSD Card 16GB or less, along with a connector to use the SD card with your computer if you don't have one built-in. **NOTE** - the Wio Terminal only supports SD cards up to 16GB, it does not support higher capacities.\n\n## Raspberry Pi\n\nAll the device code for Raspberry Pi is in Python. To complete all the assignments you will need the following:\n\n### Raspberry Pi hardware\n\n* [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)\n  > 💁 Versions from the Pi 2B and above should work with the assignments in these lessons. If you are planning on running VS Code directly on the Pi, then a Pi 4 with 2GB or more of RAM is needed. If you are going to access the Pi remotely then any Pi 2B and above will work.\n* microSD Card (You can get Raspberry Pi kits that come with a microSD Card), along with a connector to use the SD card with your computer if you don't have one built-in.\n* USB power supply (You can get Raspberry Pi 4 kits that come with a power supply). If you are using a Raspberry Pi 4 you need a USB-C power supply, earlier devices need a micro-USB power supply.\n\n### Raspberry Pi specific sensors and actuators\n\nThese are specific to using the Raspberry Pi, and are not relevant to using the Arduino device.\n\n* [Grove Pi base hat](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Base-Hat-for-Raspberry-Pi.html)\n* [Raspberry Pi Camera module](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/camera-module-v2/)\n* Microphone and speaker:\n\n  Use one of the following (or equivalent):\n  * Any USB Microphone with any USB speaker, or speaker with a 3.5mm jack cable, or using HDMI audio output if your Raspberry Pi is connected to a monitor or TV with speakers\n  * Any USB headset with a built in microphone\n  * [ReSpeaker 2-Mics Pi HAT](https://www.seeedstudio.com/ReSpeaker-2-Mics-Pi-HAT.html) with\n    * Headphones or other speaker with a 3.5mm jack, or a JST speaker such as:\n    * [Mono Enclosed Speaker - 2W 6 Ohm](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Mono-Enclosed-Speaker-2W-6-Ohm-p-2832.html)\n  * [USB Speakerphone](https://www.amazon.com/USB-Speakerphone-Conference-Business-Microphones/dp/B07Q3D7F8S/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=m0&qid=1614647389&sr=8-1)\n* [Grove Light sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Light-Sensor-v1-2-LS06-S-phototransistor.html)\n* [Grove button](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Button.html)\n\n## Sensors and actuators\n\nMost of the sensors and actuators needed are used by both the Arduino and Raspberry Pi learning paths:\n\n* [Grove LED](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-LED-Pack-p-4364.html) x 2\n* [Grove humidity and temperature sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor-DHT11.html)\n* [Grove capacitive soil moisture sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Capacitive-Moisture-Sensor-Corrosion-Resistant.html)\n* [Grove relay](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Relay.html)\n* [Grove GPS (Air530)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-GPS-Air530-p-4584.html)\n* [Grove Time of flight Distance Sensor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Time-of-Flight-Distance-Sensor-VL53L0X.html)\n\n## Optional hardware\n\nThe lessons on automated watering work using a relay. As an option, you can connect this relay to a water pump powered by USB using the hardware listed below.\n\n* [6V water pump](https://www.seeedstudio.com/6V-Mini-Water-Pump-p-1945.html)\n* [USB terminal](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3628)\n* Silicone pipes\n* Red and black wires\n* Small flat-head screwdriver\n\n## Virtual hardware\n\nThe virtual hardware route will provide simulators for the sensors and actuators, implemented in Python. Depending on your hardware availability, you can run this on your normal development device, such as a Mac, PC, or run it on a Raspberry Pi and simulate only the hardware you don't have. For example, if you have the Raspberry Pi camera but not the Grove sensors, you will be able to run the virtual device code on your Pi and simulate the Grove sensors, but use a physical camera.\n\nThe virtual hardware will use the [CounterFit project](https://github.com/CounterFit-IoT/CounterFit).\n\nTo complete these lessons you will need to have a web cam, microphone and audio output such as speakers or headphones. These can be built in or external, and need to be configured to work with your operating system and available for use from all applications.\n"

This mode of instruction engages a variety of learning methods – visual, auditory, hands-on, problem solving, etc.[[1]](#references)\n2. Flipped classrooms have shown to increase focus, engagement, motivation, self-sufficiency, knowledge retention, and communication (both teacher-to-student and student-to-student).[[2,3]](#references)\n3. As instructors, you can spend more time with struggling students while allowing more advanced learners the freedom to work ahead.[[4]](#references)\n\nWe also recommend instructors assume the role of **“Co-Facilitator\"** who learns alongside and supports students as they work through questions and explorations driven by their own interests and insights.\n\nThere’s no “right way\" to do something here. At times, you won’t have all the answers. Some students may not get through all the projects. Your goal is to help your students arrive organically at ways to problem solve that may be more playful, collaborative, or self-directed than what they originally expected.\n\n## Helpful Facilitation Tips:\n\n* Reflect on what you notice, ask questions, and make observations.\n* Use phrases like “I notice…\" and “I wonder…\"\n* Connect students who are struggling with those who have already found solutions.\n* Point at components and parts or make suggestions about different things to try if a student is stuck. Ask the student to change one thing at a time and observe what happens.\n* Acknowledge frustration and recognize effort.\n* Avoid building or coding for the students, except where students need physical assistance.\n\n## Sample Facilitation Language:\n\n* “Ask two others before you ask me.\"\n* “Spend another two minutes trying…\"\n* “Let’s try taking a break from this. Maybe you could help other students with their electrical connections since you already figured that out?\"\n* “I wonder if another student has had the same problem. Let’s check!\"\n* \"You really committed to this and figured it out! Could I send others to you for help with this?\"\n* “That’s odd, it doesn’t make sense to me, either. Maybe we could ask another student, or if you figure it out could you share with the class?\"\n\n## References\n\n[1] [An empirical study on the effectiveness of College English Reading classroom teaching in the flipped classroom paradigm (researchgate.net)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322264495_An_empirical_study_on_the_effectiveness_of_College_English_Reading_classroom_teaching_in_the_flipped_classroom_paradigm).
