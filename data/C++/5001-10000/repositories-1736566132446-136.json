The Free Translation Project is\na way to get maintainers of free software, translators, and users all\ntogether, so that free software will gradually become able to speak many\nlanguages.  A few packages already provide translations for their\nmessages.\n\n   If you found this `ABOUT-NLS' file inside a distribution, you may\nassume that the distributed package does use GNU `gettext' internally,\nitself available at your nearest GNU archive site.  But you do _not_\nneed to install GNU `gettext' prior to configuring, installing or using\nthis package with messages translated.\n\n   Installers will find here some useful hints.  These notes also\nexplain how users should proceed for getting the programs to use the\navailable translations.  They tell how people wanting to contribute and\nwork on translations can contact the appropriate team.\n\n   When reporting bugs in the `intl/' directory or bugs which may be\nrelated to internationalization, you should tell about the version of\n`gettext' which is used.  The information can be found in the\n`intl/VERSION' file, in internationalized packages.\n\n1.1 Quick configuration advice\n==============================\n\nIf you want to exploit the full power of internationalization, you\nshould configure it using\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n\nto force usage of internationalizing routines provided within this\npackage, despite the existence of internationalizing capabilities in the\noperating system where this package is being installed.  So far, only\nthe `gettext' implementation in the GNU C library version 2 provides as\nmany features (such as locale alias, message inheritance, automatic\ncharset conversion or plural form handling) as the implementation here.\nIt is also not possible to offer this additional functionality on top\nof a `catgets' implementation.  Future versions of GNU `gettext' will\nvery likely convey even more functionality.  So it might be a good idea\nto change to GNU `gettext' as soon as possible.\n\n   So you need _not_ provide this option if you are using GNU libc 2 or\nyou have installed a recent copy of the GNU gettext package with the\nincluded `libintl'.\n\n1.2 INSTALL Matters\n===================\n\nSome packages are \"localizable\" when properly installed; the programs\nthey contain can be made to speak your own native language.  Most such\npackages use GNU `gettext'.  Other packages have their own ways to\ninternationalization, predating GNU `gettext'.\n\n   By default, this package will be installed to allow translation of\nmessages.  It will automatically detect whether the system already\nprovides the GNU `gettext' functions.  If not, the included GNU\n`gettext' library will be used.  This library is wholly contained\nwithin this package, usually in the `intl/' subdirectory, so prior\ninstallation of the GNU `gettext' package is _not_ required.\nInstallers may use special options at configuration time for changing\nthe default behaviour.  The commands:\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n     ./configure --disable-nls\n\nwill, respectively, bypass any pre-existing `gettext' to use the\ninternationalizing routines provided within this package, or else,\n_totally_ disable translation of messages.\n\n   When you already have GNU `gettext' installed on your system and run\nconfigure without an option for your new package, `configure' will\nprobably detect the previously built and installed `libintl.a' file and\nwill decide to use this.  This might not be desirable.  You should use\nthe more recent version of the GNU `gettext' library.  I.e. if the file\n`intl/VERSION' shows that the library which comes with this package is\nmore recent, you should use\n\n     ./configure --with-included-gettext\n\nto prevent auto-detection.\n\n   The configuration process will not test for the `catgets' function\nand therefore it will not be used.  The reason is that even an\nemulation of `gettext' on top of `catgets' could not provide all the\nextensions of the GNU `gettext' library.\n\n   Internationalized packages usually have many `po/LL.po' files, where\nLL gives an ISO 639 two-letter code identifying the language.  Unless\ntranslations have been forbidden at `configure' time by using the\n`--disable-nls' switch, all available translations are installed\ntogether with the package.  However, the environment variable `LINGUAS'\nmay be set, prior to configuration, to limit the installed set.\n`LINGUAS' should then contain a space separated list of two-letter\ncodes, stating which languages are allowed.\n\n1.3 Using This Package\n======================\n\nAs a user, if your language has been installed for this package, you\nonly have to set the `LANG' environment variable to the appropriate\n`LL_CC' combination.  If you happen to have the `LC_ALL' or some other\n`LC_xxx' environment variables set, you should unset them before\nsetting `LANG', otherwise the setting of `LANG' will not have the\ndesired effect.  Here `LL' is an ISO 639 two-letter language code, and\n`CC' is an ISO 3166 two-letter country code.  For example, let's\nsuppose that you speak German and live in Germany.  At the shell\nprompt, merely execute `setenv LANG de_DE' (in `csh'),\n`export LANG; LANG=de_DE' (in `sh') or `export LANG=de_DE' (in `bash').\nThis can be done from your `.login' or `.profile' file, once and for\nall.\n\n   You might think that the country code specification is redundant.\nBut in fact, some languages have dialects in different countries.  For\nexample, `de_AT' is used for Austria, and `pt_BR' for Brazil.  The\ncountry code serves to distinguish the dialects.\n\n   The locale naming convention of `LL_CC', with `LL' denoting the\nlanguage and `CC' denoting the country, is the one use on systems based\non GNU libc.  On other systems, some variations of this scheme are\nused, such as `LL' or `LL_CC.ENCODING'.  You can get the list of\nlocales supported by your system for your language by running the\ncommand `locale -a | grep '^LL''.\n\n   Not all programs have translations for all languages.  By default, an\nEnglish message is shown in place of a nonexistent translation.  If you\nunderstand other languages, you can set up a priority list of languages.\nThis is done through a different environment variable, called\n`LANGUAGE'.  GNU `gettext' gives preference to `LANGUAGE' over `LANG'\nfor the purpose of message handling, but you still need to have `LANG'\nset to the primary language; this is required by other parts of the\nsystem libraries.  For example, some Swedish users who would rather\nread translations in German than English for when Swedish is not\navailable, set `LANGUAGE' to `sv:de' while leaving `LANG' to `sv_SE'.\n\n   Special advice for Norwegian users: The language code for Norwegian\nbokma*l changed from `no' to `nb' recently (in 2003).  During the\ntransition period, while some message catalogs for this language are\ninstalled under `nb' and some older ones under `no', it's recommended\nfor Norwegian users to set `LANGUAGE' to `nb:no' so that both newer and\nolder translations are used.\n\n   In the `LANGUAGE' environment variable, but not in the `LANG'\nenvironment variable, `LL_CC' combinations can be abbreviated as `LL'\nto denote the language's main dialect.  For example, `de' is equivalent\nto `de_DE' (German as spoken in Germany), and `pt' to `pt_PT'\n(Portuguese as spoken in Portugal) in this context.\n\n1.4 Translating Teams\n=====================\n\nFor the Free Translation Project to be a success, we need interested\npeople who like their own language and write it well, and who are also\nable to synergize with other translators speaking the same language.\nEach translation team has its own mailing list.  The up-to-date list of\nteams can be found at the Free Translation Project's homepage,\n`http://translationproject.org/', in the \"Teams\" area.\n\n   If you'd like to volunteer to _work_ at translating messages, you\nshould become a member of the translating team for your own language.\nThe subscribing address is _not_ the same as the list itself, it has\n`-request' appended.  For example, speakers of Swedish can send a\nmessage to `sv-request@li.org', having this message body:\n\n     subscribe\n\n   Keep in mind that team members are expected to participate\n_actively_ in translations, or at solving translational difficulties,\nrather than merely lurking around.  If your team does not exist yet and\nyou want to start one, or if you are unsure about what to do or how to\nget started, please write to `coordinator@translationproject.org' to\nreach the coordinator for all translator teams.\n\n   The English team is special.  It works at improving and uniformizing\nthe terminology in use.  Proven linguistic skills are praised more than\nprogramming skills, here.\n\n1.5 Available Packages\n======================\n\nLanguages are not equally supported in all packages.  The following\nmatrix shows the current state of internationalization, as of May 2010.\nThe matrix shows, in regard of each package, for which languages PO\nfiles have been submitted to translation coordination, with a\ntranslation percentage of at least 50%.\n\n     Ready PO files       af am ar as ast az be be@latin bg bn_IN bs ca crh\n

This is because a few extra PO files are\nused for implementing regional variants of languages, or language\ndialects.\n\n   For a PO file in the matrix above to be effective, the package to\nwhich it applies should also have been internationalized and\ndistributed as such by its maintainer.  There might be an observable\nlag between the mere existence a PO file and its wide availability in a\ndistribution.\n\n   If May 2010 seems to be old, you may fetch a more recent copy of\nthis `ABOUT-NLS' file on most GNU archive sites.

Of course you have to respect the GNU Library General Public\nLicense which covers the use of the GNU `gettext' library.  This means\nin particular that even non-free programs can use `libintl' as a shared\nlibrary, whereas only free software can use `libintl' as a static\nlibrary or use modified versions of `libintl'.\n\n   Once the sources are changed appropriately and the setup can handle\nthe use of `gettext' the only thing missing are the translations.  The\nFree Translation Project is also available for packages which are not\ndeveloped inside the GNU project.  Therefore the information given above\napplies also for every other Free Software Project.  Contact\n`coordinator@translationproject.org' to make the `.pot' files available\nto the translation teams.\n\n"

          "content": "# Building Tenacity\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### Linux\n\nMost distributions do not package all of Tenacity's dependencies (yet).\nwxWidgets 3.1 is suggested for building Tenacity but many distributions only\npackage wxWidgets 3.0. When 3.0 is used instead of 3.1, the main user visible\nknown drawback is that a few user interface texts will not be localized, and\nthe effects of not having various wxWidgets bug fixes that have not been\nbackported to the stable 3.0 series.\n[PortMidi](https://github.com/mixxxdj/portmidi) and\n[PortSMF](https://github.com/tenacityteam/portsmf) are required for MIDI support\nbut some distributions do not package PortSMF (Tenacity can still build without\nMIDI support). [libsbsms](https://github.com/claytonotey/libsbsms) is an\noptional dependency used for time stretching that is not available in many Linux\ndistribution package managers either. Optionally,\n[vcpkg can be used](#vcpkg-on-Linux) to build dependencies from source which\nmay be helpful if your distribution is missing some packages.\n\nInstalling ccache and ninja-build is highly recommended for faster builds but\nnot required. CMake will automatically use ccache if it is installed.\n\n#### wxWidgets from source\n\nWhere wxWidgets is not provided as a binary package,\na possible way to build and install wxWidgets from source is given by the\nfollowing example. After [downloading](https://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/) and extracting the\nsource code into a location, such as `~/Downloads/wxWidgets-3.1.5`, it can be built in a local\ndirectory, such as `~/Downloads/wxWidgets-build`:\n\n```\ncd ~/Downloads\nmkdir wxWidgets-build && cd wxWidgets-build  # create and go to a new empty build directory\ncmake -G Ninja ~/Downloads/wxWidgets-3.1.5   # configure wxWidgets from the assumed download location\ncmake --build .  # actual compilation\n```\n\nThen to install wxWidgets in the default location, run\n\n```\nsudo cmake --build . --target install\n```\n\n#### Debian, Ubuntu, and derived distributions\n\nTo install Tenacity's dependencies, run:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install build-essential libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libflac++-dev libglib2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev libid3tag0-dev libjack-dev liblilv-dev libmad0-dev libmp3lame-dev libogg-dev libpng-dev portaudio19-dev libportmidi-dev libserd-dev libsndfile1-dev libsord-dev libsoundtouch-dev libsoxr-dev libsuil-dev libtwolame-dev vamp-plugin-sdk libvorbis-dev lv2-dev zlib1g-dev cmake ninja-build libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev liblzma-dev libsqlite3-dev\n```\n\n##### Notes\n\n- The version of PortSMF included in Debian & Ubuntu distributions\n(`libportsmf-dev`) is not included in the above list because it is outdated\nand using it will cause Tenacity to fail to build. If you want to use MIDI, it\nis recommended to use our modified version of\n[PortSMF](https://github.com/tenacityteam/portsmf) that you should build\nfrom source until the packaged version gets updated. If you are installing\nPortSMF to any other location than the default location where libraries get\ninstalled (`/usr/local/lib`, `/usr/lib`, etc.) such as your `$HOME` directory,\nyou should point CMake to it by adding `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/portsmf`\nto the CMake configuration step.\n\n- Additionally, if you happen to come across a package conflict involving a\npackage called `libjack0`, you may need to install `libjack-jack2-dev` instead\nof `libjack-dev`.\n\n- wxWidgets 3.1 is suggested but not packaged in Debian or Ubuntu. Refer\nto the\n[wxWidgets documentation](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.1/overview_cmake.html)\nfor how to install it from source code, or see the [previous section](#wxwidgets-from-source). The above package list\nincludes wxWidgets' build dependencies. If you install wxWidgets\nsomewhere other than the default /usr/local, you need to set the\n`WX_CONFIG` environment variable to the location of the `wx-config`\nscript installed by wxWidgets to get CMake to find wxWidgets 3.1. For\nexample, if you installed wxWidgets to /home/user/local:\n\n```\nexport WX_CONFIG=/home/user/local/bin/wx-config\n```\n\n- Alternatively, you may skip installing wxWidgets 3.1 and use 3.0 instead:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install libwxgtk3.0-dev\n```\n\n#### Fedora\n\nFirst, if you want to build Tenacity with FFmpeg support, enable the\n[RPM Fusion](https://rpmfusion.org/) free repository if you do not\nhave enabled already. The nonfree RPM Fusion repository is not\nrequired. If you do not mind building without FFmpeg support,\nRPM Fusion is not required and this first step can be skipped (also\nremove `ffmpeg-devel` from the end of the package list in the second\nstep below).\n\n```\nsudo dnf install https://mirrors.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm\n```\n\nThen install Tenacity's dependencies:\n\n```\nsudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel cmake expat-devel flac-devel gcc-g++ gettext-devel lame-devel libid3tag-devel libmad-devel libogg-devel libsndfile-devel libvorbis-devel lilv-devel lv2-devel portaudio-devel portmidi-devel serd-devel sord-devel soundtouch-devel soxr-devel sqlite-devel sratom-devel suil-devel taglib-devel twolame-devel vamp-plugin-sdk-devel wxGTK-devel zlib-devel ccache ninja-build git ffmpeg-devel\n```\n\nIf you use a high DPI screen, the wxWidgets 3.1.4 package in Fedora 34\ndoes not work well for that. You can compile wxWidgets 3.1.5 instead of\nusing the Fedora package. Refer to the\n[wxWidgets documentation](https://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.1/overview_cmake.html)\nfor details. If you install wxWidgets somewhere other than the default\n/usr/local, you need to set the `WX_CONFIG` environment variable to\nthe location of the `wx-config` script installed by wxWidgets to get\nCMake to find wxWidgets 3.1. For example, if you installed wxWidgets to\n/home/user/local:\n\n```\nexport WX_CONFIG=/home/user/local/bin/wx-config\n```\n\n#### Arch\n\nTo use wxWidgets 3.1, install `wxgtk3-dev-light` with your AUR helper of\nchoice, for example:\n\n```\nparu -S wxgtk3-dev-light\n```\n\nCMake requires explicitly specifying the path to the wx-config script from\nthis AUR package:\n\n```\nexport WX_CONFIG=/usr/bin/wx-config-gtk3-3.1\n```\n\nAlternatively, install `wxgtk3` with pacman to use wxWidgets 3.0, and set\n`WX_CONFIG=/usr/bin/wx-config-gtk3`.\n\nInstall the rest of the build dependencies from the main Arch repository:\n\n```\nsudo pacman -S cmake ninja ccache expat gcc-libs gdk-pixbuf2 glibc flac gtk3 glib2 libid3tag lilv libmad libogg portaudio portmidi libsndfile libsoxr suil twolame vamp-plugin-sdk libvorbis soundtouch ffmpeg\n```\n\nTODO: add portsmf and sbsms to this package list when those packages are updated.\n\n#### Alpine\n\nThe build dependencies for Tenacity and wxWidgets can be found on Alpine's\ncommunity repository:\n\n```\nsudo apk add cmake samurai lame-dev libsndfile-dev soxr-dev sqlite-dev portaudio-dev portmidi-dev libid3tag-dev soundtouch-dev libmad-dev ffmpeg-dev\n```\n\nwxWidgets 3.1 is suggested but not packaged in Alpine Linux. Refer to the\n[wxWidgets documentation](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/blob/master/docs/gtk/install.md)\nfor how to install it from source code, and make sure to set\n`--disable-xlocale` in the configuration.\n\nTo install wxWidgets' dependencies:\n\n```\nsudo apk add gtk+3.0-dev zlib-dev libpng-dev tiff-dev libjpeg-turbo-dev expat-dev\n```\n\nAlternatively, install `wxgtk3-dev` with apk to use wxWidgets 3.0, and set\n`WX_CONFIG=/usr/bin/wx-config-gtk3`.\n\nTODO: add portsmf and libsbsms to this package list when aports are accepted.\n\n\n#### FreeBSD\n\nwxWidgets 3.1.5 is packaged in FreeBSD's repositories. Install it and the rest\nof Tenacity's dependencies:\n\n```\nsudo pkg install wx31-gtk3 cmake ninja pkgconf lame libsndfile libsoxr portaudio lv2 lilv suil vamp-plugin-sdk portmidi libid3tag twolame libmad soundtouch ffmpeg\n```\n\n#### vcpkg on Linux\n\nOptionally, you can build dependencies from source using vcpkg, with the\nexception of wxWidgets due to\n[bugs in vcpkg's wxwidgets package](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/pull/17111).\nvcpkg is not set up to build GTK or GLib either. To use vcpkg for\ndependencies, pass `-D VCPKG=ON` to the CMake configure command. You will need\n[nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) installed to build ffmpeg from vcpkg which you can\ninstall from your distribution's package manager. If you use vcpkg, you need to\nset the `WX_CONFIG` environment variable to the path of the wx-config script\ninstalled by wxWidgets. For example, if you installed wxWidgets to /usr/local:\n\n```\nexport WX_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/wx-config\n```\n\nIf you switch between system packages and vcpkg, you may need to delete\n`CMakeCache.txt` inside your CMake build directory.\n\n### Windows\n\nInstall\n[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)\nwith the **Desktop development with C++** installation option. Microsoft's ATL/MFC components are also needed to build the application.\n\nInstalling [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) is highly recommended\nfor faster builds but not required. CMake will automatically use sccache if you\nhave it installed. You can install it from\n[Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages/sccache):\n\n```\nchoco install sccache\n```\n\nAlternatively, if you have a [Rust toolchain\ninstalled](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html),\nyou can build sccache from source:\n\n```\ncargo install sccache\n```\n\nTenacity's dependencies will be built automatically with vcpkg when configuring\nCMake. You can turn off vcpkg by passing `-D VCPKG=OFF` to the CMake\nconfiguration command, but then it is up to you to install all of Tenacity's\ndependencies.\n\nNote that building the dependencies requires 10 GB of storage space.\n\n### macOS\n\nInstall the Clang C++ compiler and macOS SDK from the Xcode command line tools.\nIf you have the Xcode IDE installed, you already have the command line tools\ntoo. To install the Xcode command line tools without the Xcode IDE, launch the\nTerminal application, and type the following command:\n\n```\nxcode-select --install\n```\n\nClick \"Install\" on the software update popup window that will appear and wait\nfor the download and installation to finish.\n\nYou will also need to install a few build tools and dependencies, which can be\ninstalled from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):\n\n```\nbrew install cmake ccache ninja nasm mono wxwidgets\n```\n\nYou must set the `WX_CONFIG` environment variable for CMake to find wxWidgets\ninstalled from Homebrew:\n\n```\nexport WX_CONFIG=/usr/local/bin/wx-config\n```\n\nThe rest of the dependencies will be built automatically with vcpkg when\nconfiguring CMake. You turn off vcpkg by passing `-D VCPKG=OFF` to the CMake\nconfiguration command, but then it is up to you to install all of Tenacity's\ndependencies.\n\n## Building Tenacity\n\nOn Windows, run the commands below from the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt. For\nother operating systems, run them from a normal shell.\n\nFirst, download the Tenacity source code:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity.git\ncd tenacity\n```\n\nThen, configure CMake. This will take a long time the first time on macOS and\nWindows (or if you use `-D VCPKG=ON` on Linux) because vcpkg will compile\nitself, then compile Tenacity's dependencies. `-G Ninja` is recommended for\nfaster builds but not required. Add `-D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/some/path` to\nchange the installation path from the default /usr/local:\n\n```\ncmake -G Ninja -S . -B build\n```\n\nBuild Tenacity:\n\n```\ncmake --build build --config Release\n```\n\nRun Tenacity:\n\n```\nbuild/bin/Release/tenacity\n```\n\nOptionally, install Tenacity:\n\n```\ncmake --install build\n```\n\n## Build options\n\nThese are set with a `-D` prefix, for example `cmake -DLV2=OFF ...`\n\n  * **VCPKG** (ON|OFF): whether to use dependencies from vcpkg. ON by default\n    for Windows and macOS; OFF by default for Linux.\n  * **VCPKG_ROOT** (file path): path to vcpkg Git repository, defaults to\n    using the vcpkg submodule in the Tenacity repository\n  * **SCCACHE** (ON|OFF): whether to use sccache for compiler caching to\n    speed up rebuilds. ON by default if sccache is installed.\n  * **CCACHE** (ON|OFF): whether to use ccache for compiler caching to speed\n    up rebuilds. ON by default if ccache is installed. If sccache and ccache\n    are both installed, sccache will be prefered.\n\nThe following feature options are enabled by default if the required libraries\nare found. You may explicitly disable them if you prefer or your distribution\nhas outdated libraries that do not build with Tenacity.\n\n  * **MIDI** (ON|OFF): MIDI support. Requires PortMidi and PortSMF.\n  * **ID3TAG** (ON|OFF): ID3 tag support for MP3 files. Requires libid3tag.\n  * **MP3_DECODING** (ON|OFF): MP3 decoding support. Requires libmad.\n  * **MP2_ENCODING** (ON|OFF): MP2 encoding support. Requires Twolame library.\n  * **OGG** (ON|OFF): Ogg container format support. Requires libogg.\n  * **VORBIS** (ON|OFF): Vorbis codec support. Requires libvorbis.\n  * **FLAC** (ON|OFF): FLAC codec support. Requires libflac and libflac++ C++\n    bindings.\n  * **SBSMS** (ON|OFF): SBSMS timestretching support. Requires libsbsms.\n  * **SOUNDTOUCH** (ON|OFF): SoundTouch timestretching support. Requires\n    SoundTouch library.\n  * **FFMPEG** (ON|OFF): Support for a wide variety of codecs with FFmpeg.\n    Requires FFmpeg libraries.\n  * **VAMP** (ON|OFF): VAMP plugin hosting support. Requires VAMP host SDK.\n  * **LV2** (ON|OFF): LV2 plugin hosting support. Requires LV2, lilv, and\n    suil libraries.\n  * **VST2** (ON|OFF): VST2 plugin hosting support. Requires GTK with X11\n    support on non-Apple/Windows.\n"

Some guidelines\nhave been put in place in an effort to keep the codebase clean.\n\n## Reporting bugs and feature requests\n\nOur IRC channel, [`#tenacity` on Libera](https://web.libera.chat/#tenacity)\n([IRC](ircs://irc.libera.chat:6697/#libera)/\n[Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#tenacity:libera.chat)), is the best place to ask\ngeneral questions about Tenacity and talk about feature requests in real time.\n\nYou can use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity/issues)\nto report bugs and propose feature requests *only*. Support questions will be\nignored.\n\nThe\n[`tenacity-discuss` mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~tenacity/tenacity-discuss)\ncan also be used for bug reports, feature requests and discussion.\nUsing a mailing list is as simple as sending an ordinary email to\n[`~tenacity/tenacity-discuss@lists.sr.ht`](mailto:~tenacity/tenacity-discuss@lists.sr.ht).\nKeep in mind that all emails posted in our mailing list will be archived publicly.\nIt may be a good idea to look through our archives, because it is possible that\nsomeone else has asked the same question as you have before.\n\n* Please only submit a bug report if you are sure it is valid.\n* On GitHub, we use \"issue templates\" to help you help us. Please use them\n  and answer as many questions as you can. That way, we will not have to go\n  back and forth to understand what you want to say to us.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributing code to Tenacity is done either via sourcehut or GitHub. Tenacity\nrequires you to Sign-off your commits, which indicates you agree to the\n[Developer Certificate of Origin](#developer-certificate-of-origin). Details below.\n\n_Note: you do not need to open a GitHub issue for every matching contribution,\nonly for those which need further looking into, and only when asked to._\n\n### Submitting code\n\n#### Sending patches through SourceHut\n\nSourceHut operates on an email-driven workflow, and uses\n[`git send-email`](https://git-send-email.io) for patch submission. Please\nconfigure the repository like so:\n\n```\ngit config format.subjectprefix \"PATCH tenacity\"\ngit config sendemail.to \"~tenacity/tenacity-dev@lists.sr.ht\"\n```\n\nWhen revising a patch, please use `git commit --amend` and add the `-v2`\n(increment every revision) flag.\n\n#### Making pull requests on GitHub\n\nTo contribute code using GitHub, first\n[fork this repository](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity)\nand make your changes. Please use `git commit --amend` and\n`git push -f` for minor changes (only **your** commits).\n\nSee [git-rebase.io](https://git-rebase.io) for more details.\n\n### Guidelines for code\n\nPlease adhere to the following guidelines when authoring code that you plan to submit to Tenacity:\n\n1. Follow proper code formatting guidelines e.g. If the file uses spaces, do not\n   change them to tabs.\n2. Do not change any variable names unless necessary.\n3. Follow the [commit message guidelines](#commit-messages).\n\n### Guidelines for commits\n\n#### Developer Certificate of Origin\n\nTenacity is an open source project licensed under the GNU General Public\nlicense, version 2 or later (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE.txt)).\n\nWe respect intellectual property rights, and we would like to make sure that\nall contributions are properly attributed. As such, we use the simple and clear\nDeveloper Certificate of Origin (DCO).\n\nThe DCO is a declaration attached to every contribution made by every\ncontributor. All the developer has to do is include a `Signed-off-by` statement,\nthereby agreeing to the DCO, provided below or on\n[developercertificate.org](https://developercertificate.org):\n\n```\nDeveloper Certificate of Origin Version 1.1\n\nCopyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.  1\nLetterman Drive Suite D4700 San Francisco, CA, 94129\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license\ndocument, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n\nDeveloper's Certificate of Origin 1.1\n\nBy making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n\n(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right\nto submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or\n\n(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my\nknowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the\nright under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether\ncreated in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I\nam permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated in the file; or\n\n(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who\ncertified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.\n\n(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are public\nand that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I\nsubmit with it, including my sign-off) is maintained indefinitely and may be\nredistributed consistent with this project or the open source license(s)\ninvolved.\n```\n\nEach commit must include a DCO in its description, which looks like this:\n\n```\nSigned-off-by: Con Tributor <con.tributor@example.com>\n```\n\nYou may type this line manually or, if using the command line, simply append\n`-s` to your commit.\n\nWe ask that all contributors use their real email address, which can be replied\nto.\n\n#### Commit messages\n\nThe following rules continue to support hosting our code on multiple platforms,\nsuch as both GitHub and SourceHut, without being unnecessarily locked in to\nGitHub. Moreover, they are also necessary for complying to the GPL license,\nensuring our independence and just giving credit where it is due.\n\nOur stance on these rules is not very strict. Worst case scenario, we may\ncorrect the commit messages for you and inform you about what we had to correct\nfor future reference. However, if you would like to get seriously involved\nwith our project and take on responsibilities such as as reviewing and merging\npatches, your abidance to the following rules will also be one of the factors\nthat will be considered.\n\nApart from including a DCO, as mentioned earlier, the following are also very\nimportant:\n\n* Make concise and accurate commit messages. A commit message should be\n   limited to 50 characters and its description limited to 72 characters\n   per line, and the message should be able to complete this sentence:\n\n    > This commit will...\n\n    If you need to add any additional context, do so in the commit description.\n\n* Avoid using full stops (e.g. `.`) or past tense in your commit messages.\n\n   - Correct: `Add support for the Commodore 64`\n   - Incorrect: `Added support for the Commodore 64.`\n\n* The first character of the commit message should be capitalized.\n\n   Example:\n\n   - `GH Actions: Buy celebratory Margaretha Pizza`\n   - `Have Tenacity eat more veggies`\n\n* If you are using changes that were made by another person, make sure to\n  properly credit them by using the `Co-authored-by: ` tag(s) in the end of\n  the commit message before the `Signed-off-by:` tag(s), followed by the name\n  or alias that they have used in Git in the past, as well as their e-mail.\n\n   Example: `Co-authored-by: Jane Doe <jane.doe@example.com>`\n\n* If your commit is complicated and involves multiple changes, use asterisks\n  and explain of the changes you made in a few words.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```\n   Prepare Teriyaki Sauce\n\n   * Added Soy Sauce\n   * Added Cooking Sake and Sugar\n   * Added 1 teaspoon of Mirin\n   * Added Dashi Stock\n   * Mixed ingredients together\n   ```\n\n* If you are using changes that were made by another person, the original\n  changes by that said person should generally be signed off and available\n  publicly in places such as another pull request on GitHub. Exceptions can\n  be made, but do ***not*** sign off a commit for another person without\n  their explicit permission.\n\n* If your patch resolves an issue that was previously mentioned in the Issues\n  tab on GitHub or in our mailing list, please use the `Reference-to:` tag,\n  followed by the URL where the issue in question was mentioned.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```\n   Reference-to: https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity/issues/2046\n   ```\n\n* Leave an empty line between tags such as `Signed-off-by:` and the rest of\n  the commit description.\n\n   Example:\n\n   ```\n   Remove references to pumpkin pies\n\n   I get that pumpkin pie is tasty, but this does not have anything to do\n   with Tenacity whatsoever.\n\n   Signed-off-by: Pumpkin Hater <pumpkin.hater99@example.com>\n   ```\n\n##### GitHub\n\n* Avoid using emojis or GitHub-specific references (e.g. `:tada:`) to emojis\n  in your commits. They may look just fine on GitHub, but they do not anywhere\n  else.\n\n##### Maintainers\n\n* When merging pull requests from GitHub, make sure to remove references to\n  issues or pull requests that have a numeric format (e.g. `(#1234)` or\n  `Resolves #1234`). Please use the `Reference-to:` tag instead.\n\n  Including a hyperlink to the said issue or pull request is preferred, because\n  these links will not break outside of GitHub and will also reduce confusion\n  between patches that refer to issues in the Audacity repository and patches\n  that are meant to be used in Tenacity. If you use a hyperlink instead of just\n  the #nnn format, GitHub will still show the #nnn format on the website, but\n  other websites and/or the command line will show the full hyperlink.\n  This is good, because it reduces our dependency on GitHub.\n\n###### Merging branches\n\n* If a proposed change is running behind a certain amount of commits that affect\n  the same \"parts\" of the project that the patch also affects, make sure to\n  rebase the patch on top of the `master` branch just to be sure that the most\n  recent changes do not cause the proposed patch to break.\n\n* In order to accommodate other reviewers that live in different timezones,\n  the rule of thumb is to wait for up to a day before merging a change that\n  has been approved by a reviewer, or wait around 12 hours before merging a\n  change that has been approved by multiple people. If possible, make sure to\n  check the change for yourself if possible, especially when a reviewer\n  approves a change reluctantly.\n\n* Before merging any change, make sure that all (or, at the very least, *most\n  of*) the tests have passed. If a change concerns a particular platform (e.g.\n  macOS), then wait for the tests for that said platform to complete.\n\n* If a change affects the user interface or the audio engine, you're generally\n  expected to use Tenacity with the included change on your machine and\n  evaluate it. Since it's very hard to answer whether a specific change\n  affecting the experience of the user is worth including or if the contributor\n  should adjust their change, you may want to ask for the help of other\n  contributors.\n\n* If there are multiple proposed changes that affect the same parts of the\n  project, ***please wait*** for a while after initially merging a single\n  proposed change just to be sure that this will not break the build. This does\n  not apply to changes that do not affect the functionality of the program\n  (such as changes to a Markdown file).\n\nThe most basic way of evaluating whether two separate changes affect the same\npart of the project is checking whether the changes concern the same source\nor header files. For example, if both changes affect `src/Theme.cpp`, then\nthey affect the same part of the project. However, this sort of evaluation\ncan get trickier, as in large applications, different source and header files\ndepend on each other.\n\nRebasing patches on top of the `master` branch and making sure that they work\nas intended is the safest and fastest way to make sure that everything will be\nokay.\n\n###### Reverting\n\nMistakes can happen, and that's okay. After all, we're here to learn and\nhelp others. However, reverting can impose a large amount of work on yourself\nor other maintainers later down the line, as well as frustrate\ncontributors -- particularly those who are contributing for the first-time\nor are thinking about contributing to the project.\n\nA change that breaks Tenacity should be reverted under at least some of the\nfollowing conditions:\n\n* There is no obvious or fast way (up to a couple of hours) to fix the mistake\n  that caused Tenacity to break. **Fixing is better than reverting most of the\n  time.**\n* There is a high amount of activity on the project and the change that got\n  merged is killing off that said activity.\n* There are maintainers and contributors that are aware of this and agree that\n  reverting is the best cause of action.\n* The community appears to heavily disagree with the change.\n* Another person, regardless of whether they are a well-established developer\n  or a community member, provides an additional perspective that the\n  contributors or maintainers were not previously aware of, which calls the\n  validity of the change into question.\n\nWhen reverting a change, you should be *at least* **just as careful** as when\ncommitting a change. Make sure to use your own judgement, communicate\ntransparently and coordinate with other contributors -- especially the ones\nthat worked on the change itself.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA.\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n"

It is built on top of the widely popular [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org/) and is being developed by a wide, diverse group of volunteers.\n\n- **Recording** from audio devices (real or virtual)\n- **Export / Import** a wide range of audio formats (extensible with FFmpeg)\n- **High quality** including up to 32-bit float audio support\n- **Plug-ins** providing support for VST, LV2, and AU plugins\n- **Scripting** in the built-in scripting language Nyquist, or in Python, Perl and other languages with named pipes\n- **Editing** arbitrary sampling and multi-track timeline\n- **Accessibility** including editing via keyboard, screen reader support and narration support\n- **Tools** useful in the analysis of signals, including audio\n\n## Motivation\n\nOur project initially started as a fork of [Audacity](https://audacityteam.org) as a result of multiple controversies and public relation crises, which you can find out more about here:\n\n- [**Privacy policy which may violate the original project's GPL license**](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/issues/1213)\n- [**Contributor's License Agreement (CLA) which may violate the same GPL license**](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/932)\n- [**Attempts at adding telemetry using Google services for data collection**](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/pull/835)\n\nNevertheless, the goal of this project is to pick up what the original developers of Audacity the decades-long work by the original creators of Audacity and create an audio editor that is fresh, more modern, convenient and practical to use, with the help and the guidance of our users and our community.\n\n## Download\n\n### Tenacity\n\nWe have not released the first version of Tenacity yet, as it is still in the early stages of development.\n\nNevertheless, as a result of popular demand by the community, we decided to provide \"nightly\" downloads for Windows, macOS and Ubuntu Linux. These downloads are based on the latest version of Tenacity's code, and are not representative of our final product. Some features may be added, removed, or changed.\n\n- [Nightly Downloads](https://tenacityaudio.org/very-early-builds)\n- [Nightly Flatpak builds](https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity-flatpak-nightly/blob/main/README.md)\n- [Unofficial Arch Linux (AUR) Package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tenacity-git/)\n\n### Audacity\n\nThe latest official version of Audacity that does not implement telemetry is `3.0.2`. Some Linux-based operating systems also ship Audacity with telemetry and networking features disabled by default.\n\nDownloads for these versions can be found on the [Audacity website](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/). If you're looking for support regarding these versions, it may be worth consulting [Audacity's forum](https://forum.audacityteam.org/) or [Audacity's wiki](https://wiki.audacityteam.org/).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBuild instructions for Tenacity are available in the [BUILDING.md file](BUILDING.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo start contributing, please consult the [CONTRIBUTING.md file](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nIf you are planning to make a big change or if you are otherwise hesitant as to whether we want to incorporate something you want to work on in Tenacity itself, then just ask us about it in our [development mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/~tenacity/tenacity-dev). We can discuss it and work together, so that neither our time or your time and hard effort goes to waste.\n\n### Translating\n\nYou can help us translate Tenacity and make it more accessible on [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/tenacity).\n"
