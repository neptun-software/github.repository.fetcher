Matches any character.\n\n  (...)  This marks a region for tagging a match.\n\n  \\n     Where n is 1 through 9 refers to the first through ninth\n         tagged region when replacing. For example, if the search\n         string was Fred([1-9])XXX and the replace string was Sam\\1YYY,\n         when applied to Fred2XXX this would generate Sam2YYY.\n\n  \\<     This matches the start of a word.\n\n  \\>     This matches the end of a word.\n\n  \\x     This allows you to use a character x that would otherwise\n         have a special meaning. For example, \\[ would be interpreted\n         as [ and not as the start of a character set.\n\n  [...]  This indicates a set of characters, for example, [abc] means\n         any of the characters a, b or c. You can also use ranges, for\n         example [a-z] for any lower case character.\n\n  [^...] The complement of the characters in the set. For example,\n         [^A-Za-z] means any character except an alphabetic character.\n\n  ^      This matches the start of a line (unless used inside a set,\n         see above).\n\n  $      This matches the end of a line.\n\n  ?      This matches 0 or 1 times. For example, a?b matches ab and b.\n\n  *      This matches 0 or more times. For example, Sa*m matches Sm,\n         Sam, Saam, Saaam and so on.\n\n  +      This matches 1 or more times. For example, Sa+m matches Sam,\n         Saam, Saaam and so on.\n\n  *?     Causes * and + to behave non-greedy. For example, <.+> matches\n  +?     all HTML tags on a line, whereas <.+?> matches only one tag.\n\n  \\d     Any decimal digit.\n  \\D     Any character that is not a decimal digit.\n\n  \\s     Any whitespace character.\n  \\S     Any character that is not a whitespace character.\n\n  \\w     Any \"word\" character.\n  \\W     Any \"non-word\" character.\n\n  \\xHH   Character with hex code HH.\n\n  -----> Examples (don't use quotes)\n         - Quote lines: find \"^\" replace with \"> \"\n         - Unquote lines: find \"^> \" replace with \"\"\n         - Remove line numbers: find \"^[0-9]+\" replace with \"\"\n         - Convert tabs to double spaces: find \"\\t\" replace with \"  \"\n         - Remove NULL bytes: find \"\\x00\" replace with \"\"\n\n\nCommand Line Switches\n\n  Notepad2.exe [encoding] [line-ending-mode] [/e id] [/g ln[,col]]\n               [/m[-][r|b] text] [/l|/l0] [/q] [/s ext] [/d] [/h] [/x]\n               [/c] [/b] [/n|/ns] [/r|/rs]\n               [/p x,y,cx,cy[,max]|/p0|/ps|/p[f|l|t|r|b|m]]\n               [/t title] [/i] [/o|/o0] [/f ini|/f0] [/u] [/z ...] [/?]\n               [+|-] [file] ...\n\n    file  File to open, can be a relative pathname, or a shell link.\n          Must be the last argument, no quoted spaces by default.\n    +     Accept multiple file arguments (with quoted spaces).\n    -     Accept single file argument (without quoted spaces).\n    ...

Project files for Visual C++ 7.0 are included. Chances are\n  that Notepad2 can be rebuilt with other development tools, including\n  the free Visual C++ Express Edition, but I haven't tested this.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nRebuilding from the Source Code\n--------------------------------------------------\n  Notepad2 4.2.25 is based on Scintilla 2.24 [1].\n\n  [1] https://www.scintilla.org\n\n  To be able to rebuild Notepad2, the source code of the Scintilla\n  editing component has to be unzipped to the \"scintilla\" subdirectory\n  of the Notepad2 source code directory.\n\n  Many of the Scintilla lexing modules are not used by Notepad2. Run\n  LinkLex.js to adapt the list (in \"scintilla/src/Catalogue.cxx\") and\n  make linking work properly.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nCreating a Compact Executable Program File\n--------------------------------------------------\n  Linking to the system CRT slightly improves disk footprint, memory\n  usage and startup because the pages for the system CRT are already\n  loaded and shared in memory. To achieve this, the release version of\n  Notepad2.exe is built using the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 7.1.0 tools,\n  available as a free download from Microsoft. The appropriate build\n  scripts can be found in the \"wdkbuild\" subdirectory. Set %WDKBASEDIR%\n  to the directory of the WDK tools on your system.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nHow to add or modify Syntax Schemes\n--------------------------------------------------\n  The Scintilla documentation has an overview of syntax highlighting,\n  and how to write your own lexing module, in case the language you\n  would like to add is not currently supported by Scintilla.\n\n  Add your own lexer data structs to the global pLexArray (Styles.c),\n  then adjust NUMLEXERS (Styles.h) to the new total number of syntax\n  schemes. Include the \"scintilla/lexers/Lex*.cxx\" file required for\n  your language into your project. Ensure the new module is initialized\n  (in \"scintilla/src/Catalogue.cxx\"), either by manually uncommenting\n  the corresponding LINK_LEXER() macro call, or by updating and\n  re-running LinkLex.js.\n\n--------------------------------------------------\nCopyright\n--------------------------------------------------\n  See License.txt for details about distribution and modification.\n\n  If you have any comments or questions, please drop me a note:\n  florian.balmer@gmail.com\n\n  (c) Florian Balmer 2004-2011\n  https://www.flos-freeware.ch\n\n###\n"

Settings will go here.\n\n#### `SettingsVersion=5`\n\n#### `Favorites=%APPDATA%\\Rizonesoft\\Notepad3\\Favorites\\`\n\n\n## **`[Settings2]`**\n\nThis section offers some advanced Notepad3 program settings, and can only be edited manually. \nPress Ctrl+F7 to open the Notepad3 ini-file. Most changes only take effect upon restarting Notepad3.\n\n#### `PreferredLanguageLocaleName=en-US`\n\nThe default value for the already supported languages is defined by the: “OS language setting”.\n- The fallback is: “en-US”.\n\n##### Available languages:\n\n```\nEnglish/United States (en-US) (internal default)\nAfrikaans/South Africa (af-ZA)\nBelarusian/Belarus (be-BY)\nGerman/Germany (de-DE)\nGreek/Greece (el-GR)\nEnglish/United Kingdom (en-GB)\nSpanish/Spain (es-ES)\nFrench/France (fr-FR)\nHindi/India (hi-IN)\nHungarian/Hungary (hu-HU)\nIndonesian/Indonesia (id-ID)\nItalian/Italy (it-IT)\nJapanese/Japan (ja-JP)\nKorean/Korea (ko-KR)\nDutch/Netherlands (nl-NL)\nPolish/Poland (pl-PL)\nPortuguese/Brazil (pt-BR)\nPortuguese/Portugal (pt-PT)\nRussian/Russia (ru/RU)\nSlovak/Slovakia (sk-SK)\nSwedish/Sweden (sv-SE)\nTurkish/Turkey (tr-TR)\nVietnamese/Vietnam (vi-VN)\nChinese Simplified/China (zh-CN)\nChinese Traditional/Taiwan (zh-TW)\n```\n\n#### `IMEInteraction=0`\n\n#### `DateTimeFormat=`\n\n- (-> (Locale dependent short format)\n\n#### `DateTimeLongFormat=`\n\n- (-> (Locale dependent long format)\n\nSpecify the short/long date and time formats. This is the format parameter passed to \nthe `strftime()` function. \nNote that the locale will be set to English (because of the English Visual C++ Run-time \nLibrary used by Notepad3).  \n\n#### `TimeStampRegEx=`\n\n- (-> \\$Date:[^\\$]+\\$) (Find-Pattern to Update Stamps)\n\n#### `TimeStampFormat=`\n\n- (-> \\\\$Date:[^\\\\$]+\\\\$ | $Date: %Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S $\n- (-> $Date: %s $) (Print format should fit to TimeStampRegEx)\n\nThis parameter is used as a regex pattern to match time-stamps which will be updated to \ncurrent date-time by `Shift+F5`, e.g. `$Date: 2018/04/26 00:52:39 $`\n\n- Default `DateTime` formats are:\n    1. SHORT: `[Settings2] DateTimeFormat=` (empty) - Notepad3's language locale short '<time> <date>' format is used\n    2. LONG:  `[Settings2] DateTimeLongFormat=` (empty) - Notepad3's language locale long '<time> <date>' format is used\n    3. TIME_STAMP: `[Settings2] TimeStampFormat=` (empty) - \"$Date: %s $\" where '%s' is replaced by time/date in \n      `DateTimeFormat`. E.g. `[Settings2] TimeStampFormat=#TimeStamp=2020-07-21 16:02:23 #`\n- All `DateTime` formats accept the [`strftime()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strftime-wcsftime-strftime-l-wcsftime-l?view=vs-2019) format string.\n  Addon: `TimeStampFormat` accepts '%s' (which is no valid `strftime()` formatting code) - a placeholder for a `DateTimeFormat` formatted current date/time string. (mixing of `strftime()` and '%s' is not allowed). \n- If you define your own `TimeStampFormat`, you should define the corresponding `TimeStampRegEx` regular expression pattern accordingly (for our example: `[Settings2] TimeStampRegEx=\"#TimeStamp=[^#]+#\"`), so that` Update Timestamps` operation can find and update them correctly.\n- Additional Menu Point: Insert Current Timestamp.\n\n#### `DefaultDirectory=`\n\nSpecify the default directory for the open and save dialogs, used if no file is opened. \n- Path-names can be relative to the Notepad3 program directory.\n\n#### `DefaultExtension=txt`\n\nSpecify the default extension for saved files (omit the leading dot, just like txt or html).\n\n#### `DenyVirtualSpaceAccess=0`\n\n#### `filebrowser.exe=minipath.exe`\n\nSpecify the path of an external program that is launched when pressing the Browse toolbar button. \nDefaults to `minipath.exe`, which is the file browser plugin. \n\nYou can specify additional command line switches, and the file currently opened in Notepad3 will be appended as the last command line parameter. \n\nNote: Due to special treatment of quotes by the Win32 ini-file APIs, pathnames with spaces need to be quadruple-quoted (\"\"path to/file.exe\"\"), but only double-quoted if there's additional command line arguments (\"path to/file.exe\" /arg).\n\nOn the other hand, our preferred file browser is `minipath.exe` (Menu->File->Browse... Ctrl+M) + Toolbar-Button.\n\nIf you don't like it, you can configure e.g. \n- [Settings2] filebrowser.exe=explorer.exe (system's file explorer), or\n- [Settings2] filebrowser.exe=Explorer++.exe (https://explorerplusplus.com/) (side-by-side Notepad3), or\n- [Settings2] filebrowser.exe=Q-Dir_x64+.exe (https://www.softwareok.de/?seite=Freeware/Q-Dir/) (side-by-side Notepad3)\n\n#### `grepWin.exe=grepWinNP3.exe`\n\nWe have integrated a powerful external tool called **grepWinNP3**. \n**grepWinNP3** is a search and replace tool which can use regular expressions to perform its job.\nThis allows you to perform much more powerful search and replace operations in files.\n\n**grepWinNP3** can be launched:\n- from \"File --> Launch --> Search in Files\"\n- or from \"Edit --> Search --> Search in Files\"\n- or simply with \"`Ctrl+Shift+F`\"\n\n#### `FileCheckInterval=2000`\n\nThe interval (in milliseconds) to check for external modification of the currently opened file. \n- Defaults is 2000 msec.\n- Min: 200[msec] - if equal or less, notify immediately.\n\n#### `FileChangedIndicator=[@]`\n\n#### `FileDeletedIndicator=[X]`\n\n#### `FileDlgFilters=`\n\nSpecify filters for the open and save dialogs \n- (Example: `Text Files|*.txt;*.wtx;*.log;*.asc;*.doc;*.diz;*.nfo|All Files|*.*`).\n\n#### `FileLoadWarningMB=4`\n\nThe size limit, in megabytes, to display a warning message for large files. \n- A value of 0 disables the warning.\n\n#### `MultiFileArg=0`\n\nControl if Notepad3 should allow multiple files on the command line (set to 1). \nThe default behavior is to accept only a single file, without quoted spaces, like Windows Notepad (set to 0). \nThe command line switches + and - can be used to override this setting on the fly, and the /z command-line switch has the same effect as the - switch.\n\n#### `NoCGIGuess=0`\n\nSet to 1 to disable simple language detection for cgi and fcgi files.\n\n#### `NoCopyLineOnEmptySelection=0`\n\nNoCopyLineOnEmptySelection=1 to avoid the copy line (`Ctrl+C`) on empty selection.\n\n#### `NoCutLineOnEmptySelection=0`\n\nNoCutLineOnEmptySelection=1 to avoid the cut line (`Ctrl+X`) on empty selection.\n\n#### `NoFadeHidden=0`\n\nSet to 1 to disable fading of hidden objects in file lists (such as Favorites, etc.).\n\n#### `NoFileVariables=0`\n\nSet to 1 to disable file variable parsing. \nEncoding tag parsing can be disabled in the Menu ? File ? Encoding ? Default dialog box.\n\nNotepad3 can parse a few of the Emacs variables that can be used in source code files. \nThe first 512 bytes of a file (and, if nothing is found, also the last 512 bytes) are checked for the following constructs (can be manually disabled in the ini-file, or the File, Encoding, Default dialog box, respectively):\n```\ncoding: utf-8;\nmode: python;\ntab-width: 8;\nc-basic-indent: 2;\nindent-tabs-mode:  nil;\nc-tab-always-indent: true;\nfill-column: 64;\ntruncate-lines: false;\nenable-local-variables: true;\n```\n`coding`: Serves as a file encoding tag. Details about using encoding tags are outlined in the \nNotepad2 Encoding Tutorial.      \n`mode`: Indicates the syntax scheme to be used, and is either the name of a scheme, or a \nfile name extension.\n`tab-width`:       \n`c-basic-indent`: Denote tab and indentation settings.      \n`indent-tabs-mode`: Determines whether to insert tabs as spaces (nil, false or 0) \nor not (true or 1).      \n`c-tab-always-indent`: Configures whether the tab key re-formats indenting white-space \n(true or 1) or not (nil, false or 0).      \n`fill-column`: Sets the desired limit for long lines (but does not automatically display \nthe visual marker).      \n`truncate-lines`: Controls word wrap (enable: nil, false or 0; disable: true or 1).      \n`enable-local-variables`: Disables file variable parsing (nil, false or 0), but keeps \nevaluating encoding tags.      \n\nTo bypass both file variable and encoding tag parsing, reload the file with Alt+F8. \nAdapt the settings mentioned above to permanently turn off file variables and encoding tags.\n\n#### `NoHTMLGuess=0`\n\nSet to 1 to disable simple HTML/XML detection for files without extensions.\n\n#### `PortableMyDocs=1`\n\nIf set to 1, recent files and other path settings referring to the `My Documents` directory tree are stored relative to `My Documents`. \nThis enhances USB stick portability between different versions of Windows, which are using different locations for `My Documents`. \nThis setting has no effect if Notepad3.exe itself is located inside `My Documents` (or a sub-directory thereof). \n- The default is 1 (enabled) if `RelativeFileMRU` is enabled, and 0 (disabled) otherwise.\n\n#### `OpacityLevel=75`\n\nOpacity level (in %) of the Notepad3 window in transparent mode.\n\n#### `FindReplaceOpacityLevel=50`\n\nOpacity level (in %) of the Find/Replace window in transparent mode.\n\n#### `RelativeFileMRU=1`\n\nSet to 0 to disable recent files on the same drive or network share as Notepad3.exe being saved with relative path-names. \n- The default is 1 (enabled).\n\n#### `ReuseWindow=0`\n\nThis items are managed by Notepad3. (`Menu->Settings->Window->Reuse Window  Ctrl+Shift+L`)\n- If set, another started Notepad3 instance will try to give control to the currently opened Window and quit.\n\n#### `SaveBlankNewFile=true`\n\nNew file (not exists on file system (\"Untitled\")) asking('true')/not asking('false') for file save if document contains any whitespace (blank/space, tab, line-break) character.\n\n#### `SciFontQuality=3`\n\n#### `SimpleIndentGuides=0`\n\nSet to 1 to prevent indentation guides from jumping across empty lines.\n\n#### `SingleFileInstance=1`\n\nThis items are managed by Notepad3.\n\n#### `ShellAppUserModelID=Rizonesoft.Notepad3`\n\n#### `ShellUseSystemMRU=1`\n\nApplication User Model IDs (AppUserModelIDs) are used extensively by the taskbar in Windows 7 and later systems to associate processes, files, and windows with a particular application. \nIn some cases, it is sufficient to rely on the internal AppUserModelID assigned to a process by the system. \nHowever, an application that owns multiple processes or an application that is running in a host process might need to explicitly identify itself so that it can group its otherwise disparate windows under a single taskbar button and control the contents of that application's Jump List.\n\nMost recently used (MRU) source lists are resident on the user's computer and contain information about source paths used in previous installations. \nThis information can be used when prompting the user for a source path. \nControl system MRU, task-bar and jump list behavior. \nSee Replacing Windows Notepad for detailed explanations.\n\n#### `StickyWindowPosition=0`\n\nThis items are managed by Notepad3. \n- `Menu->View->Position->Sticky Window Position` (Will remember current window position on restart, instead of last closed position (save on exit))\n\n#### `SubWrappedLineSelectOnMarginClick=false`\n\nSet to `true` to revert to old selection behavior:\n- 1 click on line-number margin selects the entire corresponding line\n- 1 double click on line-number margin selects the entire line with all sub-lines.\n\n#### `LaunchInstanceWndPosOffset=28`\n\n#### `LaunchInstanceFullVisible=true`\n\n#### `UseOldStyleBraceMatching=0`\n\nUseOldStyleBraceMatching=1 to switch back to (not recommended) old style behavior\n\n#### `WebTemplate1=https://google.com/search?q=%s`\n\n#### `WebTmpl1MenuName=Open Web Action 1`\n\n#### `WebTemplate2=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=%s`\n\n#### `WebTmpl2MenuName=Open Web Action 2\n\n#### `ExtendedWhiteSpaceChars=:`\n\nPut in here all ASCII chars which will be word delimiters for \"Accelerated Word Navigation\".\n\n#### `AutoCompleteWordCharSet=`\n\nIs set automatically for CJK input languages (GetACP()). \n\nIf you define your own character-set in AutoCompleteWordCharSet, Auto-Completion word list is limited to words composed of these chars only (case insensitive).)\n\n#### `AutoCompleteFillUpChars=`\n\nNew configuration .ini-file: [Settings2] AutoCompleteFillUpChars=\nTo get the \"Enter\" completion behavior back, define: [Settings2] AutoCompleteFillUpChars=\\r\\n\nI you like to allow more \"fill-up\" characters (accept completion item), just add them:\n- e.g. [Settings2] AutoCompleteFillUpChars=\\r\\n[(. (will accept completion item & adds the char).\n\n#### `LineCommentPostfixStrg=`\n\nIt will be appended/removed to the comment tag on line comment block toggle. \nIf the string contains spaces, you have to double-quote it,\n- e.g. [Settings2] LineCommentPostfixStrg=\" \" to add a space after the comment tag (origin and title of this feature request).\n\n#### `UpdateDelayMarkAllOccurrences=50`\n\n#### `CurrentLineHorizontalSlop=40`\n\n#### `CurrentLineVerticalSlop=5`\n\n#### `UndoTransactionTimeout=0`\n\n- in [msec]\n\nUndoTransactionTimeout=1 (will be clamped to 10msec min.) will separate nearly every keystroke as single undo action.\n(UndoTransactionTimeout=0 will switch this timer OFF)\n\n#### `AdministrationTool.exe=`  \n\nThis parameter is not used at the moment.\n\n#### `DevDebugMode=0`\n\nEncoding Detector information in Titlebar. This parameter is used to \"debug\" UCHARDET.\n\n#### `AnalyzeReliableConfidenceLevel=90`\n\nConfidence/Reliability level for reliability switch in encoding dialog.\n\n#### `LocaleAnsiCodePageAnalysisBonus=33`\n\nBias/Bonus on top of Confidence/Reliability if current system's ANSI Code-Page is file encoding analysis result.\n(This will push detection algorithm to like system's ANSI Code-Page more than other detection result)\n\n#### `LexerSQLNumberSignAsComment=1`\n\nThe # (hash) is the start of a line comment in MySQL dialect.\nBut if this is confusing, it can be switched off by providing an option to Scintilla's SQL-Lexer\n(set option: lexer.sql.numbersign.comment to 0 (zero)).\n\nUnfortunately, in Notepad3, this can not be done by configuration, it can only be done hard coded.\n- Ed.: The default is \"OFF\", it is set to \"ON\" explicitly in Notepad3 (hard coded) to preserve old behavior, \n\n#### `ExitOnESCSkipLevel=2`\n\nThe leveling of ESC behavior (msg-boxes -> selection -> exit) leads to following implementation:\n\nNew parameter \"[Settings2] ExitOnESCSkipLevel = 2\"\n- Level 2 : ESC cancels every single state separately (the default).\n- Level 1 : ESC cancels message-box and ignores Selection.\n- Level 0 : ESC cancels all states and proceeds to Exit (if configured).\n\n#### `ZoomTooltipTimeout=3200`\n\n- in [msec]\n- A value of zero (0) (or less than 100 msec) will disable the tooltip display.\n\n#### `WrapAroundTooltipTimeout=2000`\n\n- in [msec]\n- A value of zero (0) (or less than 100 msec) will disable the tooltip display.\n\n#### `LargeIconScalePrecent=150`\n\n- `Screen/Display Scale Percent` threshold to switch to bigger file types icons (lexer style selections)\n\n#### `DarkModeBkgColor=0x1F1F1F`\n\n#### `DarkModeBtnFaceColor=0x333333`\n\n#### `DarkModeTxtColor=0xEFEFEF`\n\n#### `HyperlinkShellExURLWithApp=\"\"`\n\n- If not defined or empty the default behavior on `Ctrl+Click` URL is performed:\n- The URL-String is sent to the OS via ShellExecute(), which will try open the URL using the registered protocol (e.g. http:// or file://) - in most cases the default browser resp. the file, if extension is known.\n- If defined, e.g. \"`D:\\PortableApps\\GoogleChromePortable\\GoogleChromePortable.exe`\", this application will be started on `Ctrl+Click`.\n\n#### `HyperlinkShellExURLCmdLnArgs=\"${URL}\"`\n\n- (use ${URL} as place holder for clicked Hyperlink URL string)\n- Defining the argument/parameter string for the above application (only taken into account if  `HyperlinkShellExURLWithApp` is defined). \n- If not defined, empty or set to \"${URL}\", the argument for the app will be the URL-String clicked.\nYou can specify more command line parameter for the app here. The token `${URL}` within the string will be replaced by the URL-String clicked. E.g. `HyperlinkShellExURLCmdLnArgs=\"--incognito \"${URL}\"\"` will start the Chrome-Browser (see `HyperlinkShellExURLWithApp`) in \"incognito mode\" trying to open the clicked URL.\n\n#### `HyperlinkFileProtocolVerb=\"\"`\n\n- `ShellExecuteEx()::lpVerb (\"\"=default, \"edit\", \"explore\", \"find\", \"open\", \"print\", \"properties\", \"runas\")`\n\n#### `CodeFontPrefPrioList=\"Cascadia Code,Cascadia Mono,Cousine,Fira Code,Source Code Pro,Roboto Mono,DejaVu Sans Mono,Inconsolata,Consolas,Lucida Console\"`\n\nConfigurable Fonts priority list for for \"Common Base\" Scheme.\n\n#### `TextFontPrefPrioList=\"Cascadia Mono,Cousine,Roboto Mono,DejaVu Sans Mono,Inconsolata,Consolas,Lucida Console\"`\n\nConfigurable Fonts priority list for \"Text Files\" Scheme.\n\n\n## **`[Statusbar Settings]`**\n\nThis section provides the ability to set the number, order and width of columns, \nand the prefix text of the status bar fields.\n\n#### `VisibleSections=0 1 15 14 2 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11`  (internal default)\n\nThis parameter is used to define, which fields of the Status Bar should be visible. \nIf used, this setting also defines the field ordering.\n      \n- Section  0 = Ln : Line number of Caret position / Number total of lines in the file\n- Section  1 = Col : Column number of  Caret position / Limit for Long Line settings\n- Section  2 = Sel : Number of characters selected\n- Section  3 = Sb : Number of bytes (Bytes in [UTF-8]) selected\n- Section  4 = SLn : Number of selected lines\n- Section  5 = Occ : Number of Marked Occurrences \n- Section  6 = Size of file in [UTF-8] Mode\n- Section  7 = Encoding Mode  (double click to open `Encoding F9` )\n- Section  8 = EOL Mode (Toggle CR+LF, LF, CR)\n- Section  9 = Toggle INS/OVR Mode\n- Section 10 = Toggle STD/2ND Text Mode (Default Text or 2nd Default Text)\n- Section 11 = Current Scheme  (double click to open `Select Scheme` )\n- Section 12 = Character Count (per line from line start)\n- Section 13 = Replaced Occurrences\n- Section 14 = TinyExpr Evaluation\n- Section 15 = Unicode point display (UTF-16 encoding) of current (caret pos) character.\n\n#### `SectionPrefixes=Ln  ,Col  ,Sel  ,Sb  ,SLn  ,Occ  ,,,,,,,Ch  ,Repl  ,Eval  ,U+,`  (internal default)\n\nThis parameter is used to redefines the displayed Prefixes in the sections of the Status Bar\n- A “,” (comma) is used as separator.
