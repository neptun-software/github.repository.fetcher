It deals with\nthe *inference* aspect of machine learning, taking models after *training* and\nmanaging their lifetimes, providing clients with versioned access via\na high-performance, reference-counted lookup table.\nTensorFlow Serving provides out-of-the-box integration with TensorFlow models,\nbut can be easily extended to serve other types of models and data.\n\nTo note a few features:\n\n-   Can serve multiple models, or multiple versions of the same model\n    simultaneously\n-   Exposes both gRPC as well as HTTP inference endpoints\n-   Allows deployment of new model versions without changing any client code\n-   Supports canarying new versions and A/B testing experimental models\n-   Adds minimal latency to inference time due to efficient, low-overhead\n    implementation\n-   Features a scheduler that groups individual inference requests into batches\n    for joint execution on GPU, with configurable latency controls\n-   Supports many *servables*: Tensorflow models, embeddings, vocabularies,\n    feature transformations and even non-Tensorflow-based machine learning\n    models\n\n## Serve a Tensorflow model in 60 seconds\n```bash\n# Download the TensorFlow Serving Docker image and repo\ndocker pull tensorflow/serving\n\ngit clone https://github.com/tensorflow/serving\n# Location of demo models\nTESTDATA=\"$(pwd)/serving/tensorflow_serving/servables/tensorflow/testdata\"\n\n# Start TensorFlow Serving container and open the REST API port\ndocker run -t --rm -p 8501:8501 \\\n    -v \"$TESTDATA/saved_model_half_plus_two_cpu:/models/half_plus_two\" \\\n    -e MODEL_NAME=half_plus_two \\\n    tensorflow/serving &\n\n# Query the model using the predict API\ncurl -d '{\"instances\": [1.0, 2.0, 5.0]}' \\\n    -X POST http://localhost:8501/v1/models/half_plus_two:predict\n\n# Returns => { \"predictions\": [2.5, 3.0, 4.5] }\n```\n\n## End-to-End Training & Serving Tutorial\n\nRefer to the official Tensorflow documentations site for [a complete tutorial to train and serve a Tensorflow Model](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/serving/rest_simple).\n\n\n## Documentation\n\n### Set up\n\nThe easiest and most straight-forward way of using TensorFlow Serving is with\nDocker images.

(commit: c140e0115a9c6d9cb28279acee0c80d56ed2982b)\n* Add the option to enable GRPC health checking to model_server. This is useful for clients that want to use health checking with load balancing channels (if not we get errors on the client side). The current implementation is trivial, once we open our serving port we assume we we always be healthy but users may want to tweak this, specially if they need a mandated version, etc. (commit: a9a8e7bfe982f48a9156dedd48f61f537dea84a0)\n* Automated Code Change (commit: f761fc7742d66129e7f8b26bba749d44d4d4b678)\n* Update description of model versioning.
