It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n          GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n             END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

However, You may include an additional document\n    offering the additional rights described in Section 3.5.\n\n    3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must\n    be made available in Source Code form under the terms of this\n    License either on the same media as an Executable version or via\n    an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom\n    you made an Executable version available; and if made available\n    via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for\n    at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became\n    available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version\n    of that particular Modification has been made available to such\n    recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code\n    version remains available even if the Electronic Distribution\n    Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n    3.3. Description of Modifications.\n\n    You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain\n    a file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered\n    Code and the date of any change. You must include a prominent\n    statement that the Modification is derived, directly or\n    indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer\n    and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the Source\n    Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related\n    documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the\n    Covered Code.\n\n    3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n\n        (a) Third Party Claims.\n\n        If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third\n        party's intellectual property rights is required to exercise\n        the rights granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or\n        2.2, Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n        distribution titled \"LEGAL'' which describes the claim and the\n        party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient\n        will know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such\n        knowledge after the Modification is made available as\n        described in Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify\n        the LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available\n        thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying\n        appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated\n        to inform those who received the Covered Code that new\n        knowledge has been obtained.\n\n        (b) Contributor APIs.\n\n        If Contributor's Modifications include an application\n        programming interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent\n        licenses which are reasonably necessary to implement that API,\n        Contributor must also include this information in the LEGAL\n        file.\n\n        (c)    Representations.\n\n        Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n        Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n        Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n        Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed\n        by this License.\n\n\n    3.5. Required Notices.\n\n    You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the\n    Source Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a\n    particular Source Code file due to its structure, then You must\n    include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory)\n    where a user would be likely to look for such a notice.  If You\n    created one or more Modification(s) You may add your name as a\n    Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.  You must also\n    duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code\n    where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights relating\n    to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee\n    for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one\n    or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on\n    Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any\n    Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such\n    warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by\n    You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer\n    and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n    Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n    3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n    requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered\n    Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code\n    version of the Covered Code is available under the terms of this\n    License, including a description of how and where You have\n    fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be\n    conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable version,\n    related documentation or collateral in which You describe\n    recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may\n    distribute the Executable version of Covered Code or ownership\n    rights under a license of Your choice, which may contain terms\n    different from this License, provided that You are in compliance\n    with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n    Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the\n    recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights set\n    forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version\n    under a different license You must make it absolutely clear that\n    any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone,\n    not by the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as\n    a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    3.7. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other\n    code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the\n    Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make\n    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the\n    Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of\n    this License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due\n    to statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a)\n    comply with the terms of this License to the maximum extent\n    possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they\n    affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file\n    described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all\n    distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited\n    by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently\n    detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n    understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n    This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n    attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n    6.1. New Versions.\n\n    Netscape Communications Corporation (''Netscape'') may publish\n    revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each\n    version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n    6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of\n    the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of\n    that version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under\n    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n    Netscape. No one other than Netscape has the right to modify the\n    terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.\n\n    6.3. Derivative Works.\n\n    If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you\n    may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already\n    Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your\n    license so that the phrases ''Mozilla'', ''MOZILLAPL'', ''MOZPL'',\n    ''Netscape'', \"MPL\", ''NPL'' or any confusingly similar phrase do\n    not appear in your license (except to note that your license\n    differs from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear that\n    Your version of the license contains terms which differ from the\n    Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public License. (Filling in\n    the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in\n    the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of themselves be\n    deemed to be modifications of this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS'' BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS\n    FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE\n    OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE\n    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS\n    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n    8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the\n    breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly\n    granted shall survive any termination of this License. Provisions\n    which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n    termination of this License shall survive.\n\n    8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent\n    infringement claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against\n    Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or\n    Contributor against whom You file such action is referred to as\n    \"Participant\") alleging that:\n\n    (a) such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n    Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n    shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate\n    prospectively, unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice\n    You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually\n    agreeable reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of\n    Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your\n    litigation claim with respect to the Contributor Version against\n    such Participant.  If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable\n    royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually agreed upon in\n    writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn,\n    the rights granted by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or\n    2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of the 60 day notice\n    period specified above.\n\n    (b) any software, hardware, or device, other than such\n    Participant's Contributor Version, directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any rights granted to You by such\n    Participant under Sections 2.1(b) and 2.2(b) are revoked effective\n    as of the date You first made, used, sold, distributed, or had\n    made, Modifications made by that Participant.\n\n    8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against\n    Participant alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version\n    directly or indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is\n    resolved (such as by license or settlement) prior to the\n    initiation of patent infringement litigation, then the reasonable\n    value of the licenses granted by such Participant under Sections\n    2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the amount\n    or value of any payment or license.\n\n    8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n    all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and\n    resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any\n    distributor hereunder prior to termination shall survive\n    termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n    COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO\n    ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL\n    DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES\n    FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR\n    MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES,\n    EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\n    SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO\n    LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S\n    NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS\n    EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Code is a ''commercial item,'' as that term is defined\n    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of ''commercial\n    computer software'' and ''commercial computer software\n    documentation,'' as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212\n    (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48\n    C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all\n    U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n    rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed\n    by California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law,\n    if any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law\n    provisions. With respect to disputes in which at least one party\n    is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or registered to do\n    business in the United States of America, any litigation relating\n    to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the\n    Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue\n    lying in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party\n    responsible for costs, including without limitation, court costs\n    and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses. The application of\n    the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International\n    Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which\n    provides that the language of a contract shall be construed\n    against the drafter shall not apply to this License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or\n    indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License\n    and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to\n    distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing\n    herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission\n    of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n    Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n    �Multiple-Licensed�.  �Multiple-Licensed� means that the Initial\n    Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code\n    under Your choice of the NPL or the alternative licenses, if any,\n    specified by the Initial Developer in the file described in\n    Exhibit A.\n\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n    ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public\n    License Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file\n    except in compliance with the License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n  License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n  using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n  the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n  your programs, too.\n\n    When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n  price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n  have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n    To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n    For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n  gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n  you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n  source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n  rights.\n\n    We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n  distribute and/or modify the software.\n\n    Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n  that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n  software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n  want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n  that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n  authors' reputations.\n\n    Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n  patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n  program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n  program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n  patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n    The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n  modification follow.\n\n\t  GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n    0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n  a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n  under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n  refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n  means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n  that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n  either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n  language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n  the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n  covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n  running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n  is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n  Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n    1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n  source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n  and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n  along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n  you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n    2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n  of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n  distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n      a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n      stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n      b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n      whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n      part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n      parties under the terms of this License.\n\n      c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n      when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n      interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n      announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n      notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n      a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n      these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n      License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n      does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n      the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n  These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n  identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n  and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n  themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n  sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n  distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n  on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n  this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n  entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n  Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n  your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n  collective works based on the Program.\n\n  In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n  the scope of this License.\n\n    3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n      a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n      source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n      1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n      b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n      years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n      cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n      machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n      distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n      customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n      c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n      to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n      allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n      received the program in object code or executable form with such\n      an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\n  The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n  making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n  control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n  special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n  itself accompanies the executable.\n\n  If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n  access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n  access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n  distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n  compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n    4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n  parties remain in full compliance.\n\n    5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n  signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n  distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n  the Program or works based on it.\n\n    6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n  these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n  this License.\n\n    7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n  excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n  License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n  may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n  license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n  all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n  the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n  refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n  If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n  apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n  circumstances.\n\n  It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n  implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n  to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n  impose that choice.\n\n  This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n  be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n    8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n  countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n    9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n  of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n  be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n  address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n  later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n  either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n  Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n  this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n  Foundation.\n\n    10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n  to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n  Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n  make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n  of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n  of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n    11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n  OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n  PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n  OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n  TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n  PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n  REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n    12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n  INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\n  OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n  TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n  YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\n  PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\tHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n    If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n  free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n    To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n      <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n      Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n      This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n      it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n      the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n      (at your option) any later version.\n\n      This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n      but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n      MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n      GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n      You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n      with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n      51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\n  Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n  when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n      Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n      Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n      This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n      under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\n  The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n  parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\n  be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\n  mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n  school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n  necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\n  This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n  proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n  consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n  library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n  Public License instead of this License.\n============================================================================\n\n------------------\n\nFiles: \n\nCopyright (c) 2005-2010 Sam Stephenson\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n        i) changes to the Program, and\n        ii) additions to the Program;\n\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\nfrom a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself\nor anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\nadditions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\ndistributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\nand (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or\nwhen combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with\nthis Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n       reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,\n       in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and\n       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,\n       in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply\n       to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time\n       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\n       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n       Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n       combinations which include the Contribution.\n       No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n       rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes\n       sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\n       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\n       Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n       before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n       license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n        consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\nif any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to\nidentify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\nif a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and\nindemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any\nlosses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims,\nlawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the\nIndemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of\nsuch Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply\nto any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual\nproperty infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\na) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\nCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.\nIf that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\nwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties\nare such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section,\nthe Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result,\nthe Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nEach Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of\nusing and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\nrisks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\nor loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability\nor interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\nLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\nremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by\nthe parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\nnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\nunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and\ndoes not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming\naware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this\nAgreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the\nProgram as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations\nunder this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the\nProgram shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\nonly be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\nthe right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\nfrom time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to\nmodify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial\nAgreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to\nserve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\nof the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\n(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version\nof the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version\nof the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\nstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\nlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\nProgram not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\nthis Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one\nyear after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a\njury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\n------------------\n\nFiles:\n\nCopyright (C) 1993 by Sun Microsystems, Inc.

These owners may\ncontribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the\nfurther production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain\nreputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and\nefforts of others.\n\nFor these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation\nof additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a\nWork (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright\nand Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work\nand publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her\nCopyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal\neffect of CC0 on those rights.\n\n1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following: \n\ni. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,\nand translate a Work;\n\nii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person&apos;s image or\nlikeness depicted in a Work;\n\niv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject\nto the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n\nv. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a\nWork;\n\nvi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\nprotection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,\nincluding any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world\nbased on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer&apos;s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer&apos;s heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer&apos;s express Statement of Purpose. \n\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer&apos;s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer&apos;s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer&apos;s express Statement of Purpose. \n\n4.

With these\ncapabilities you can build entirely new AR experiences or enhance existing apps\nwith AR features.\n\n\n## Breaking change affecting previously published 32-bit-only apps\n\n_Google Play Services for AR_ (ARCore) has removed support for 32-bit-only\nARCore-enabled apps running on 64-bit devices. Support for 32-bit apps running\non 32-bit devices is unaffected.\n\nIf you have published a 32-bit-only (`armeabi-v7a`) version of your\nARCore-enabled app without publishing a corresponding 64-bit (`arm64-v8a`)\nversion, you must update your app to include 64-bit native libraries.\n32-bit-only ARCore-enabled apps that are not updated by this time may crash when\nattempting to start an augmented reality (AR) session.\n\nTo learn more about this breaking change, and for instructions on how to update\nyour app, see https://developers.google.com/ar/64bit.\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\nSee the [Quickstart for Android Java](//developers.google.com/ar/develop/java/quickstart)\nor [Quickstart for Android NDK](//developers.google.com/ar/develop/c/quickstart)\ndeveloper guide.\n\n\n## API Reference\n\nSee the [ARCore SDK for Java API Reference](//developers.google.com/ar/reference/java)\nor [ARCore SDK for C API Reference](//developers.google.com/ar/reference/c).\n\n\n## Release Notes\n\nThe SDK release notes are available on the\n[releases](//github.com/google-ar/arcore-android-sdk/releases) page.\n\n\n## Terms & Conditions\n\nBy downloading the ARCore SDK for Android, you agree that the\n[**ARCore Additional Terms of Service**](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/terms)\ngoverns your use thereof.\n\n\n## User privacy requirements\n\nYou must disclose the use of Google Play Services for AR (ARCore) and how it\ncollects and processes data, prominently in your application, easily accessible\nto users. You can do this by adding the following text on your main menu or\nnotice screen: \"This application runs on [Google Play Services for AR](//play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core) (ARCore),\nwhich is provided by Google LLC and governed by the [Google Privacy Policy](//policies.google.com/privacy)\".\n\nSee the [User privacy requirements](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/privacy-requirements).\n\n## Deprecation policy\n\nApps built with **ARCore SDK 1.12.0 or higher** are covered by the\n[Cloud Anchor API deprecation policy](//developers.google.com/ar/distribute/deprecation-policy).\n\nApps built with **ARCore SDK 1.11.0 or lower** will be unable to host or resolve\nCloud Anchors beginning December 2020 due to the SDK's use of an older,\ndeprecated ARCore Cloud Anchor service.\n"
