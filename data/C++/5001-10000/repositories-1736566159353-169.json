Would be nice to demo or play around on other ESP32 boards (or on ESP32-CAM boards when you broke the camera cable...).\n\n#### #35 Use the same model, but provide the image from a Smartphone Camera\nas reading the Electricity or Water meter every few minutes only delivers apparent accuracy (DE: \"Scheingenauigkeit\") you could just as well take a picture with your Smartphone every so often (e.g. once a week when you are in the Basement anyway), then with some \"semi clever\" tricks pass this image to the model developed here, and the values than on to whoever needs them e.g. via MQTT.\nIMO: It is not needed to have that many readings (datapoints) as our behaviour (Use of electricity or water) doesn't vary that much, say, over a weeks time. The interpolation between weekly readings will give sufficient information on the power and/or water usage. \n\n\n#### #34 implement state and Roi for water leak detection\nfor example see Roi in the next picture..\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38385805/207858812-2a6ba41d-1a8c-4fa1-9b6a-53cdd113c106.png)\nin case of position change between the measurements set this state to true, if there is no change set it back to false.\nIn a defined time window this movement can lead into an alarm state / water leak..\nhaving this state in the mqtt broker can trigger functions like closing the water pipe valve and so on...\n\n\n\n#### #33 Implement MATTER protocoll\n\n* see [#1404](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/issues/1404)\n\n#### #32 Add feature to correct misinterpreted value\n\n* If a value is misinterpreted, the user can manually correct the value.\n* The misinterpreted ROIs would be saved in a \"training data\" -folder on the SD-card\n* Stretch goal: make sending of saved training data as easy as pushing a button =)\n\n#### #31 Implement InfluxDB v2.x interface\n\n* Currently only InfluxDB v1.x is supported, extend to v2.x\n* Remark: interface has changed\n* see [#1160](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/issues/1160)\n\n#### #30 Support meter clock over\n\n* In case of meter clocking over, that is, reaching its max. value and starting over from 0,\n  accept the new value and calculate correctly the difference.\n  (see line 739 onwards in ClassFlowPostProcessing.cpp)\n\n#### ~~#29 Add favicon and use the hostname for the website~~- implemented v11.3.1\n\n* ~~https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/issues/927~~\n\n#### #28 Improved error handling for ROIs\n\n* In case a ROI is out of the image, there is no error message, but a non sense image is used\n* Implement a error message for wrong configuration of ROI\n\n#### #27 Use Homie Spec for Mqtt binding\n\n* Use the standardized Home Protocol for the Mqtt binding \n* https://homieiot.github.io/\n\n#### #26 Changes behaviour for \"N\" replacement\n\n* in case the higher digits has already increased by minium 1 - don't set the \"N\" to the last value, but to \"0\"\n* https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/issues/792\n\n\n#### #25 Trigger Measurement via MQTT\n\n* https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/issues/727\n\n\n#### #24 Show Mqtt state directly in Webserver\n\n* Show MQTT log in Web page.

While most AI systems rely on powerful processors or cloud computing, **edge computing** brings AI closer to the end user by utilizing the capabilities of modern processors.  \nThis project demonstrates edge computing using the **ESP32**, a low-cost, AI-capable device, to digitize your analog meters—whether water, gas, or electricity. With affordable hardware and simple instructions, you can turn any standard meter into a smart device.\n\nLet's explore how to make **AI on the Edge** a reality! 🌟\n\nAll you need is an [ESP32 board with a supported camera](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/Hardware-Compatibility/) and some practical skills. 🛠️\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Key Features 🚀\n- 🔗 **Tensorflow Lite (TFLite) integration** – including an easy-to-use wrapper.\n- 📸 **Inline image processing** (feature detection, alignment, ROI extraction).\n- 💡 **Small** and **affordable** device (3 x 4.5 x 2 cm³, less than 10 EUR).\n- 📷 Integrated camera and illumination.\n- 🌐 Web interface for administration and control.\n- 🔄 OTA interface for updating directly via the web interface.\n- 🏠 Full integration with Home Assistant.\n- 📊 Support for **Influx DB 1** and **2**.\n- 📡 **MQTT protocol** support.\n- 📥 **REST API** available for data access.\n\n<br>\n\n## Workflow 🔧\nThe device captures a photo of your meter at set intervals. It then extracts the Regions of Interest (ROIs) from the image and runs them through artificial intelligence. As a result, you get the digitized value of your meter.\n\nThere are several options for what to do with that value:\n- 📤 Send it to a **MQTT broker**.\n- 📝 Write it to an **InfluxDb**.\n- 🔗 Provide access via a **REST API**.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"images/idea.jpg\" width=\"600\"> \n</p>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Impressions 📷\n\n+ ### AI-on-the-edge-device on a Water Meter 💧\n  <p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"images/watermeter_all.jpg\" width=\"200\"><img \n  src=\"images/main.jpg\" width=\"200\"><img \n  src=\"images/size.png\" width=\"200\"> \n  </p>\n\n+ ### Web Interface (Water Meter) 💻\n  <p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"images/watermeter.jpg\" width=\"600\"> \n  </p>\n\n+ ### AI-on-the-edge-device on an Electrical Power Meter ⚡\n  <p align=\"center\">\n    <img src=\"images/powermeter.jpg\" width=\"600\"> \n  </p>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Setup 🛠️\nThere is growing [documentation](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/) which provides you with a lot of information. Head there to get started, set it up, and configure it.\n\nThere are also articles in the German Heise magazine \"make:\" about the setup and technical background (behind a paywall): [DIY - Setup](https://www.heise.de/select/make/2021/2/2103513300897420296) 📰\n\nA lot of people have created useful YouTube videos that might help you get started:\n- 🎥 [youtube.com/watch?v=HKBofb1cnNc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HKBofb1cnNc)\n- 🎥 [youtube.com/watch?v=yyf0ORNLCk4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyf0ORNLCk4)\n- 🎥 [youtube.com/watch?v=XxmTubGek6M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxmTubGek6M)\n- 🎥 [youtube.com/watch?v=mDIJEyElkAU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDIJEyElkAU)\n- 🎥 [youtube.com/watch?v=SssiPkyKVVs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SssiPkyKVVs)\n- 🎥 [youtube.com/watch?v=MAHE_QyHZFQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MAHE_QyHZFQ)\n- 🎥 [youtube.com/watch?v=Uap_6bwtILQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uap_6bwtILQ)\n\nFor further background information, head to:\n- [Neural Networks](https://www.heise.de/select/make/2021/6/2126410443385102621)\n- [Training Neural Networks](https://www.heise.de/select/make/2022/1/2134114065999161585)\n- [Programming on the ESP32](https://www.heise.de/select/make/2022/2/2204010051597422030)\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Download 🔽\nThe latest available version can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/releases).\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Flashing the ESP32 💾\nInitially, you will have to flash the ESP32 via a USB connection. Later updates are possible directly over the air (OTA using Wi-Fi).\n\nThere are different ways to flash your ESP32:\n- The preferred way is the [Web Installer and Console](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device/index.html), a browser-based tool to flash the ESP32 and extract the log over USB:  \n  ![](images/web-installer.png)\n- Flash Tool from Espressif\n- ESPtool (command-line tool)\n\nSee the [documentation](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/Installation/) for more information.\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Flashing the SD Card 💾\nThe SD card can be set up automatically after the firmware is installed. See the [documentation](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/Installation/#remote-setup-using-the-built-in-access-point) for details. For this to work, the SD card must be FAT formatted (which is the default on a new SD card).\n\nAlternatively, the SD card can still be set up manually. See the [documentation](https://jomjol.github.io/AI-on-the-edge-device-docs/Installation/#3-sd-card) for details.\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Casing 🛠️\nVarious 3D-printable housings can be found here:\n- 💧 [Water Meter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4573481)\n- ⚡ [Power Meter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5028229)\n- 🔥 [Gas Meter](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5224101)\n- 📷 [ESP32-cam housing only](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4571627)\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Donate ☕\nIf you'd like to support the developer with a cup of coffee, you can do so via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=8TRSVYNYKDSWL).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=8TRSVYNYKDSWL\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"images/paypal.png\" width=\"200px\" target=\"_blank\"></a>\n</p>\n\n---\n\n<br>\n\n## Support 💬\nIf you have any technical problems, please search the [discussions](https://github.com/jomjol/AI-on-the-edge-device/discussions).
