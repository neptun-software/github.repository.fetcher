Preamble\n\nSoftware is deeply embedded in all aspects of our lives and it is important that it empower, rather than restrict us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.\n\nDevelopment of Free Software can follow many patterns. In some cases whole development is handled by a sole programmer or a small group of people. But usually, the creation and maintenance of software is a complex process that requires the contribution of many individuals. This also affects who owns the rights to the software. In the latter case, rights in software are owned jointly by a great number of individuals.\n\nTo tackle this issue some projects require a full copyright assignment to be signed by all contributors. The problem with such assignments is that they often lack checks and balances that would protect the contributors from potential abuse of power from the new copyright holder.\n\nFSFE’s Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) was created by the Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. with just that in mind – to concentrate all deciding power within one entity and prevent fragmentation of rights on one hand, while on the other preventing that single entity from abusing its power. The main aim is to ensure that the software covered under the FLA will forever remain Free Software.\n\nThis process only serves for the transfer of economic rights. So-called moral rights (e.g. authors right to be identified as author) remain with the original author(s) and are inalienable.\n\n### How to use this FLA\n\nIf You are an employee and have created the Contribution as part of your employment, You need to have Your employer approve this Agreement or sign the Entity version of this document. If You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship, any other author of the Contribution should also sign this – in any event, please contact Us at jorrit@jrouwe.nl\n\n### 1\\. Definitions\n\n**\"You\"** means the individual Copyright owner who Submits a Contribution to Us.\n\n**\"Legal Entity\"** means an entity that is not a natural person.\n\n**\"Affiliate\"** means any other Legal Entity that controls, is controlled by, or under common control with that Legal Entity. For the purposes of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such Legal Entity, whether by contract or otherwise, (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or securities that vote to elect the management or other persons who direct such Legal Entity or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.\n\n**\"Contribution\"** means any original work of authorship, including any original modifications or additions to an existing work of authorship, Submitted by You to Us, in which You own the Copyright.\n\n**\"Copyright\"** means all rights protecting works of authorship, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence.\n\n**\"Material\"** means the software or documentation made available by Us to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the Material means the software or documentation to which the Contribution was Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may be included in the Material.\n\n**\"Submit\"** means any act by which a Contribution is transferred to Us by You by means of tangible or intangible media, including but not limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us, but excluding any transfer that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n**\"Documentation\"** means any non-software portion of a Contribution.\n\n### 2\\. License grant\n\n#### 2.1 Copyright license to Us\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us a worldwide, royalty-free, exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable (except as stated in Section 8.2) license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the Copyright covering the Contribution to use the Contribution by all means, including, but not limited to:\n\n* publish the Contribution,\n* modify the Contribution,\n* prepare derivative works based upon or containing the Contribution and/or to combine the Contribution with other Materials,\n* reproduce the Contribution in original or modified form,\n* distribute, to make the Contribution available to the public, display and publicly perform the Contribution in original or modified form.\n\n#### 2.2 Moral rights\n\nMoral Rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognized and not waivable by applicable law. Notwithstanding, You may add your name to the attribution mechanism customary used in the Materials you Contribute to, such as the header of the source code files of Your Contribution, and We will respect this attribution when using Your Contribution.\n\n#### 2.3 Copyright license back to You\n\nUpon such grant of rights to Us, We immediately grant to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the Copyright covering the Contribution to use the Contribution by all means, including, but not limited to:\n\n* publish the Contribution,\n* modify the Contribution,\n* prepare derivative works based upon or containing the Contribution and/or to combine the Contribution with other Materials,\n* reproduce the Contribution in original or modified form,\n* distribute, to make the Contribution available to the public, display and publicly perform the Contribution in original or modified form.\n\nThis license back is limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the Material.\n\n### 3\\. Patents\n\n#### 3.1 Patent license\n\nSubject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of Materials distributed by Us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable (except as stated in Section 3.2) patent license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in combination with any Material (and portions of such combination). This license applies to all patents owned or controlled by You, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or otherwise transferring of Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with any Material.\n\n#### 3.2 Revocation of patent license\n\nYou reserve the right to revoke the patent license stated in section 3.1 if We make any infringement claim that is targeted at your Contribution and not asserted for a Defensive Purpose. An assertion of claims of the Patents shall be considered for a \"Defensive Purpose\" if the claims are asserted against an entity that has filed, maintained, threatened, or voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against Us or any of Our licensees.\n\n### 4\\. License obligations by Us\n\nWe agree to (sub)license the Contribution or any Materials containing, based on or derived from your Contribution under the terms of any licenses the Free Software Foundation classifies as Free Software License and which are approved by the Open Source Initiative as Open Source licenses.\n\nMore specifically and in strict accordance with the above paragraph, we agree to (sub)license the Contribution or any Materials containing, based on or derived from the Contribution only under the terms of the following license(s) MIT (including any right to adopt any future version of a license if permitted).\n\nWe agree to license patents owned or controlled by You only to the extent necessary to (sub)license Your Contribution(s) and the combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Material under the terms of any licenses the Free Software Foundation classifies as Free Software licenses and which are approved by the Open Source Initiative as Open Source licenses..\n\n### 5. Disclaimer\n\nTHE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION AND EXTENT TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD AND EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.\n\n### 6. Consequential damage waiver\n\nTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.\n\n### 7. Approximation of disclaimer and damage waiver\n\nIF THE DISCLAIMER AND DAMAGE WAIVER MENTIONED IN SECTION 5. AND SECTION 6. CANNOT BE GIVEN LEGAL EFFECT UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW, REVIEWING COURTS SHALL APPLY LOCAL LAW THAT MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL CIVIL OR CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTRIBUTION.\n\n### 8. Term\n\n8.1 This Agreement shall come into effect upon Your acceptance of the terms and conditions.\n\n8.2 This Agreement shall apply for the term of the copyright and patents licensed here. However, You shall have the right to terminate the Agreement if We do not fulfill the obligations as set forth in Section 4. Such termination must be made in writing.\n\n8.3 In the event of a termination of this Agreement Sections 5., 6., 7., 8., and 9. shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, Free and Open Source Software (sub)licenses that have already been granted for Contributions at the date of the termination shall remain in full force after the termination of this Agreement.\n\n### 9. Miscellaneous\n\n9.1 This Agreement and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings arising out of this agreement or relating in any way to it shall be governed by the laws of Netherlands excluding its private international law provisions.\n\n9.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or understandings.\n\n9.3 In case of Your death, this agreement shall continue with Your heirs. In case of more than one heir, all heirs must exercise their rights through a commonly authorized person.\n\n9.4 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.\n\n9.5 You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.\n"

Suitable for games and VR applications. Used by Horizon Forbidden West.\n\n[![Horizon Forbidden West Cover Art](https://jrouwe.nl/jolt/Horizon_Forbidden_West.png)](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/)\n\n|[![Ragdoll Pile](https://img.youtube.com/vi/pwyCW0yNKMA/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwyCW0yNKMA)|\n|:-|\n|*A YouTube video showing a ragdoll pile simulated with Jolt Physics.*|\n\nFor more demos and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwyCW0yNKMA&list=PLYXVwtOr1CBxbA50jVg2dKUQvHW_5OOom) go to the [Samples](Docs/Samples.md) section.\n\n## Design considerations\n\nWhy create yet another physics engine? Firstly, it has been a personal learning project. Secondly, I wanted to address some issues that I had with existing physics engines:\n\n* Games do more than simulating physics. These things happen across multiple threads. We emphasize on concurrently accessing physics data outside of the main simulation update:\n\t* Sections of the simulation can be loaded / unloaded in the background. We prepare a batch of physics bodies on a background thread without locking or affecting the simulation. We insert the batch into the simulation with a minimal impact on performance.\n\t* Collision queries can run parallel to adding / removing or updating a body. If a change to a body happened on the same thread, the change will be immediately visible. If the change happened on another thread, the query will see a consistent before or after state. An alternative would be to have a read and write version of the world. This prevents changes from being visible immediately, so we avoid this.\n\t* Collision queries can run parallel to the main physics simulation. We do a coarse check (broad phase query) before the simulation step and do fine checks (narrow phase query) in the background. This way, long running processes (like navigation mesh generation) can be spread out across multiple frames.\n* Accidental wake up of bodies cause performance problems when loading / unloading content. Therefore, bodies will not automatically wake up when created. Neighboring bodies will not be woken up when bodies are removed. This can be triggered manually if desired.\n* The simulation runs deterministically. You can replicate a simulation to a remote client by merely replicating the inputs to the simulation. Read the [Deterministic Simulation](https://jrouwe.github.io/JoltPhysics/#deterministic-simulation) section to understand the limits.\n* We try to simulate behavior of rigid bodies in the real world but make approximations. Therefore, this library should mainly be used for games or VR simulations.\n\n## Features\n\n* Simulation of rigid bodies of various shapes using continuous collision detection:\n\t* Sphere\n\t* Box\n\t* Capsule\n\t* Tapered-capsule\n\t* Cylinder\n\t* Tapered-cylinder\n\t* Convex hull\n\t* Plane\n\t* Compound\n\t* Mesh (triangle)\n\t* Terrain (height field)\n* Simulation of constraints between bodies:\n\t* Fixed\n\t* Point\n\t* Distance (including springs)\n\t* Hinge\n\t* Slider (also called prismatic)\n\t* Cone\n\t* Rack and pinion\n\t* Gear\n\t* Pulley\n\t* Smooth spline paths\n\t* Swing-twist (for humanoid shoulders)\n\t* 6 DOF\n* Motors to drive the constraints.\n* Collision detection:\n\t* Casting rays.\n\t* Testing shapes vs shapes.\n\t* Casting a shape vs another shape.\n\t* Broadphase only tests to quickly determine which objects may intersect.\n* Sensors (trigger volumes).\n* Animated ragdolls:\n\t* Hard keying (kinematic only rigid bodies).\n\t* Soft keying (setting velocities on dynamic rigid bodies).\n\t* Driving constraint motors to an animated pose.\n\t* Mapping a high detail (animation) skeleton onto a low detail (ragdoll) skeleton and vice versa.\n* Game character simulation (capsule)\n\t* Rigid body character. Moves during the physics simulation. Cheapest option and most accurate collision response between character and dynamic bodies.\n\t* Virtual character. Does not have a rigid body in the simulation but simulates one using collision checks. Updated outside of the physics update for more control. Less accurate interaction with dynamic bodies.\n* Vehicles\n\t* Wheeled vehicles.\n\t* Tracked vehicles.\n\t* Motorcycles.\n* Soft body simulation (e.g. a soft ball or piece of cloth).\n\t* Edge constraints.\n\t* Dihedral bend constraints.\n\t* Tetrahedron volume constraints.\n\t* Long range attachment constraints (also called tethers).\n\t* Limiting the simulation to stay within a certain range of a skinned vertex.\n\t* Internal pressure.\n\t* Collision with simulated rigid bodies.\n\t* Collision tests against soft bodies.\n* Water buoyancy calculations.\n* An optional double precision mode that allows large worlds.\n\n## Supported platforms\n\n* Windows (Desktop or UWP) x86/x64/ARM32/ARM64\n* Linux (tested on Ubuntu) x86/x64/ARM32/ARM64/RISC-V64/LoongArch64/PowerPC64LE\n* FreeBSD\n* Android x86/x64/ARM32/ARM64\n* Platform Blue (a popular game console) x64\n* macOS x64/ARM64\n* iOS x64/ARM64\n* MSYS2 MinGW64\n* WebAssembly, see [this](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics.js) separate project.\n\n## Required CPU features\n\n* On x86/x64 the minimal requirements are SSE2. The library can be compiled using SSE4.1, SSE4.2, AVX, AVX2, or AVX512.\n* On ARM64 the library uses NEON and FP16. On ARM32 it can be compiled without any special CPU instructions.\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo learn more about Jolt go to the latest [Architecture and API documentation](https://jrouwe.github.io/JoltPhysics/). Documentation for [a specific release is also available](https://jrouwe.github.io/JoltPhysicsDocs/).\n\nTo get started, look at the [HelloWorld](HelloWorld/HelloWorld.cpp) example. A [HelloWorld example using CMake FetchContent](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysicsHelloWorld) is also available to show how you can integrate Jolt Physics in a CMake project.\n\nSome algorithms used by Jolt are described in detail in my GDC 2022 talk: Architecting Jolt Physics for 'Horizon Forbidden West' ([slides](https://gdcvault.com/play/1027560/Architecting-Jolt-Physics-for-Horizon), [slides with speaker notes](https://jrouwe.nl/architectingjolt/ArchitectingJoltPhysics_Rouwe_Jorrit_Notes.pdf), [video](https://gdcvault.com/play/1027891/Architecting-Jolt-Physics-for-Horizon)).\n\n## Compiling\n\n* Compiles with Visual Studio 2019+, Clang 10+ or GCC 9+.\n* Uses C++ 17.\n* Depends only on the standard template library.\n* Doesn't use RTTI.\n* Doesn't use exceptions.\n\nIf you want to run on Platform Blue you'll need to provide your own build environment and PlatformBlue.h due to NDA requirements. This file is available on the Platform Blue developer forum.\n\nFor build instructions go to the [Build](Build/README.md) section. When upgrading from an older version of the library go to the [Release Notes](Docs/ReleaseNotes.md) or [API Changes](Docs/APIChanges.md) sections.\n\n## Performance\n\nIf you're interested in how Jolt scales with multiple CPUs and compares to other physics engines, take a look at [this document](https://jrouwe.nl/jolt/JoltPhysicsMulticoreScaling.pdf).\n\n## Folder structure\n\n* Assets - This folder contains assets used by the TestFramework, Samples and JoltViewer.\n* Build - Contains everything needed to build the library, see the [Build](Build/README.md) section.\n* Docs - Contains documentation for the library.\n* HelloWorld - A simple application demonstrating how to use the Jolt Physics library.\n* Jolt - All source code for the library is in this folder.\n* JoltViewer - It is possible to record the output of the physics engine using the DebugRendererRecorder class (a .jor file), this folder contains the source code to an application that can visualize a recording.
