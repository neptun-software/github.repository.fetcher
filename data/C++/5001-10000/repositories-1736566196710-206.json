Having ccache on at least\n  # one build still helps ensure that ccache compatibility is at least tested\n  # and if the Centos 9 build is always significantly faster than all other\n  # builds (e.g. on self-hosted Gitlab instances) then users would at least be\n  # able to discover it.\n  #\n  # Most steps don't need the source code, only artifacts\n  GIT_STRATEGY: none\n  # Hack to satisfy directory name length requirement by CPackRPM in CMake 3.x\n  # https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.7/module/CPackRPM.html#variable:CPACK_RPM_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX\n  GIT_CLONE_PATH: $CI_BUILDS_DIR/CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_LONG_NAME_REQUIREMENT\n\n# Define once, use many times\n.rpm_listfiles: &rpm_listfiles\n  - |\n    echo \"Generating rpmlist-$CI_JOB_NAME-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG.log ...\"\n    for package in *.rpm\n    do\n      echo \"$package\"\n      rpm -qlpv \"$package\" | awk '{print $1 \" \" $3 \"/\" $4 \" .\" $9 \" \" $10 \" \" $11}' | sort -k 3\n      echo \"------------------------------------------------\"\n    done >> \"../rpmlist-$CI_JOB_NAME-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG.log\"\n  # CPackRPM lists contents in build log, so no need to show the output of this,\n  # just store it as a build artifact that can be downloaded and diffed against\n  # other builds to detect which files where added/removed/moved\n\nfedora:\n  stage: build\n  variables:\n    GIT_STRATEGY: fetch\n    GIT_SUBMODULE_STRATEGY: normal\n  script:\n    - yum install -y yum-utils rpm-build openssl-devel graphviz\n    # Accelerate builds with unsafe disk access, as we can afford to loose the entire build anyway\n    - yum install -y https://github.com/stewartsmith/libeatmydata/releases/download/v129/libeatmydata-129-1.fc33.x86_64.rpm\n    # This repository does not have any .spec files, so install dependencies based on Fedora spec file\n    - yum-builddep -y mariadb-server\n    - mkdir builddir;

On others, the command\nline needs to be modified to e.g \"yum install\" on Fedora or \"zypper install\" \non OpenSUSE.\n\nOpenSolaris:\nshell> pfexec pkgadd install SUNWcmake\n\nWindows and Mac OSX:\nDownload and install the latest distribution from \nhttp://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html\nOn Windows, download installer exe file and run it. On MacOS, download\nthe .dmg image and open it.\n\nOther Unixes:\nPrecompiled packages for other Unix flavors (HPUX, AIX) are available from \nhttp://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html \n\nAlternatively, you can build from source, source package is also available on \nCMake download page.\n\n\nCompiler Tools\n--------------\nYou will need  a working compiler and make utility on your OS. \nOn Windows, install Visual Studio (Express editions will work too). \nOn Mac OSX, install Xcode tools.\n\n\n\nBUILD \n---------------------------------------------------------------\nEnsure that compiler and cmake are in PATH.\nThe following description assumes that current working directory \nis the source directory. \n\n\n- Generic build on Unix, using \"Unix Makefiles\" generator\n\nshell>cmake . \nshell>make\n\nNote: by default, cmake build is less verbose than automake build. Use \n\"make VERBOSE=1\" if you want to see add command lines for each compiled source.\n\n- Windows, using \"Visual Studio 9 2008\" generator\nshell>cmake . -G \"Visual Studio 9 2008\" \nshell>devenv MySQL.sln /build /relwithdebinfo\n(alternatively, open MySQL.sln and build using the IDE)\n\n- Windows, using \"NMake Makefiles\" generator\nshell>cmake . -G \"NMake Makefiles\" \nshell>nmake\n\n- Mac OSX build with Xcode\nshell>cmake . -G Xcode\nshell>xcodebuild -configuration Relwithdebinfo\n(alternatively, open MySQL.xcodeproj and build using the IDE)\n\nCommand line build with CMake 2.8\nAfter creating project with cmake -G as above, issue\ncmake . --build \nthis works with any  CMake generator.\n\nFor Visual Studio and Xcode you might want to add an extra \nconfiguration parameter, to avoid building all configurations.\n\ncmake . --build --config Relwithdebinfo\n\n\nBuilding \"out-of-source\"\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nBuilding out-of-source provides additional benefits. For example it allows to \nbuild both Release and Debug configurations using the single source tree.Or \nbuild the same source with different version of the same compiler or with \ndifferent compilers. Also you will prevent polluting the source tree with the\nobjects and binaries produced during the make. \n\nHere is an example on how to do it (generic Unix), assuming the source tree is\nin directory named src and the current working directory is source root.\n\nshell>mkdir ../build # build directory is called build\nshell>cd ../build\nshell>cmake ../src\n\nNote: if a directory was used for in-source build, out-of-source will \nnot work. To re-enable out-of-source build, remove <source-root>/CMakeCache.txt\nfile.\n\n\nCONFIGURATION PARAMETERS\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nThe procedure above will build with default configuration.\n\nLet's you want to change the  configuration parameters and have archive\nstorage engine compiled into the server instead of building it as pluggable \nmodule.\n\n1)You can provide parameters on the command line, like\n\nshell> cmake .  -DWITH_ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ENGINE=1\n\nThis can be done during the initial configuration or any time later.\n\nNote, that parameters are \"sticky\", that is they are remebered in the CMake \ncache (CMakeCache.txt file in the build directory)\n\n2) Configuration using cmake-gui (Windows, OSX, or Linux with cmake-gui \ninstalled)\n\nFrom the build directory, issue\nshell> cmake-gui .\n\n- Check the WITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE checkbox\n- Click on \"Configure\" button\n- Click on \"Generate\" button\n- Close cmake-gui\nshell> make\n\n3)Using ccmake (Unix)\nccmake is curses-based GUI application that provides the same functionality \nas cmake-gui. It is less user-friendly compared to cmake-gui but works also \non exotic Unixes like HPUX, AIX or Solaris.\n\nBesides storage engines, probably the most important parameter from a \ndeveloper's point of view is CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE (this allows to build server with \ndbug tracing library and with debug compile flags).\n\nAfter changing the configuration, recompile using\nshell> make\n\n\nListing configuration parameters\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nshell> cmake -L \n\nGives a brief overview of important configuration parameters (dump to stdout)\n\nshell> cmake -LH\n\nDoes the same but also provides a short help text for each parameter.\n\nshell> cmake -LAH \n\nDumps all config parameters (including advanced) to the stdout.\n\nPACKAGING\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n-- Binary distribution --\nPackaging in form of tar.gz archives (or .zip on Windows) is also supported\nTo create a tar.gz package, \n\n1)If you're using \"generic\" Unix build with makefiles\n\nshell> make package\nthis will create a tar.gz file in the top level build directory.\n\n2)On Windows, using  \"NMake Makefiles\" generator\n\nshell> nmake package\n\n3)On Windows, using \"Visual Studio\"  generator\n\nshell> devenv mysql.sln /build relwithdebinfo /project package\n\nNote On Windows, 7Zip or Winzip must be installed and 7z.exe rsp winzip.exe \nneed to be in the PATH.\n\n\nAnother way to build packages is calling cpack executable directly like\nshell> cpack -G TGZ --config CPackConfig.cmake\n(-G TGZ is for tar.gz generator, there is also -GZIP)\n\n-- Source distribution --\n\"make dist\" target is provided. \n\nADDITIONAL MAKE TARGETS: \"make install\" AND \"make test\"\n----------------------------------------------------------------\ninstall target also provided for Makefile based generators. Installation \ndirectory can be controlled using configure-time parameter \nCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX (default is /usr/local. It is also possible to install to\nnon-configured directory, using\n\nshell> make install DESTDIR=\"/some/absolute/path\"\n\n\"make test\" runs unit tests (uses CTest for it)\n\"make test-force\" runs mysql-test-run.pl tests with --test-force parameter\n\nFOR PROGRAMMERS: WRITING PLATFORM CHECKS\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you modify MySQL source and want to add a new platform check,please read \nhttp://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_HowToDoPlatformChecks first. In MySQL, most of \nthe platform tests are implemented in configure.cmake and the template header \nfile is config.h.cmake\n\nBigger chunks of functionality, for example non-trivial macros are implemented \nin files <src-root>/cmake subdirectory.\n\nFor people with autotools background, it is important to remember CMake does \nnot provide autoheader functionality. That is, when you add a check\n\nCHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS(foo HAVE_FOO)\nto config.cmake, then you will also need to add\n#cmakedefine HAVE_FOO 1\nto config.h.cmake\n\nTroubleshooting platform checks\n--------------------------------\nIf you suspect that a platform check returned wrong result, examine \n<build-root>/CMakeFiles/CMakeError.log and \n<build-root>/CMakeFiles/CMakeOutput.log\nThese files they contain compiler command line, and exact error messages.\n\nTroubleshooting CMake code\n----------------------------------\nWhile there are advanced flags for cmake like -debug-trycompile and --trace,\na simple and efficient way to debug to add \nMESSAGE(\"interesting variable=${some_invariable}\")\nto the interesting places in CMakeLists.txt\n\n\nTips:\n- When using Makefile generator it is easy to examine which compiler flags are \nused to build. For example, compiler flags for mysqld are in \n<build-root>/sql/CMakeFiles/mysqld.dir/flags.make and the linker command line\nis in <build-root>/sql/CMakeFiles/mysqld.dir/link.txt\n\n- CMake caches results of platform checks in CMakeCache.txt. It is a nice \nfeature because tests do not rerun when reconfiguring (e.g when a new test was \nadded).The downside of caching is that when a platform test was wrong and was \nlater corrected, the cached result is still used. If you encounter this \nsituation,  which should be a rare occation, you need either to remove the \noffending entry from CMakeCache.txt (if test was for HAVE_FOO, remove lines \ncontaining HAVE_FOO from CMakeCache.txt) or just remove the cache file.\n\n"

          "content": "# Coding Standards\n\nThis is a working document outlining the coding standard for the general MariaDB codebase.\nThe document can be found in the 11.0 and newer trees in the root directory as \"CODING_STANDARDS.md\"\n\nIt does not cover the coding standards for individual plugins, these should have their own coding standards documentation.\n\n## Using Git with the MariaDB codebase\n\n### Git commit messages\n\nGit commit messages must conform to the 50/72 rule.\nThis is a de facto git standard which is automatically enforced by some editors.\nThis means:\n\n* 50 characters max for the first (description) line (see exception later)\n* A blank line.\n* 72 characters max for every subsequent line.\n\nIn addition if there is a Jira ticket number, this should be the first thing in the description.\nAs an example:\n\n```\nMDEV-12345 Fixing Rockwell Turbo Encabulator\n\nThe new principle involved is that instead of power being generated by\nthe relative motion of conductors and fluxes, it’s produced by the\nmodial interaction of magneto-reluctance and capacitive diractance.\n```\n\nThe only explicitly allowed exception to the 50-72 rules is that if the first line can be MDEV-###### title', even if the title would make the line longer than 50 characters.\n\nThe commit messages are typically rendered in [Markdown format](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), so markdown formatting is permitted for the message body.\n\n### Branch handling\n\nWhen updating your code, please make sure you perform a rebase, not a merge with the latest branch.\nPull requests should be a simple fast-forward of the branch they are intended to land on.\n\nThe correct way to rebase (if working on top of 10.11 branch):\n\n```sh\ngit fetch upstream/10.11  # This assumes upstream is github.com/MariaDB/server\ngit rebase upstream/10.11\ngit push --force my_branch\n```\n\n### Target branch\n\nPull requests should be based against the correct MariaDB version.\nNew features should be based against the `main` branch, which is the GitHub default branch.\nBug fixes should be based against the earliest maintained branch in which the bug can be reproduced.\nThe earliest maintained branch is found at https://mariadb.org/about/#maintenance-policy.\n\n## Coding Style (C / C++ files)\n\nEveryone has a preferred coding style, there is no real correct style for all projects around the world.\nWhat is important is that we stick to one common style throughout this code base.\n\n### Indentation\n\nWe should use a variant of the [Allman indentation style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Allman_style).\nThe variation is to use two spaces instead of tabs and has a couple of minor rule changes as below.\n\nAllman style specifies that braces associated with a statement should be on the following line with the same indentation and the statements inside the braces are next level indented.\nThe closing braces are also on a new line at the same indentation as the original statement.\n\nFor example:\n\n```cpp\nwhile (x == y)\n{\n  something();\n  somethingelse();\n}\nfinalthing();\n```\n\n#### Switch / Case statements\n\nFor switch / case statements the `case` needs to be inline with the `switch`.\nPreferably switch (expr) should be followed by '{' on the same line to\nmake the lineup of 'case:' nice:\n\nFor example:\n\n```cpp\nswitch(level) {\ncase ERROR:\n  sql_print_error(\"Error: %s\", message.c_ptr_safe());\n  break;\ncase WARNING:\n  sql_print_warning(\"Warning: %s\", message.c_ptr_safe());\n  break;\n...\n}\n```\n\n#### If statements\n\nIf the `if` statement only executes one line of code it is possible to write the statement without the braces such as this:\n\n```cpp\nif (opt_console)\n  opt_error_log= 0;\n```\n\nPrefer reducing indent level with the use of early return statements (or in special circumstances goto).\nRather than:\n\n```cpp\nif (condition)\n{\n   <logic>\n}\nreturn error_code;\n```\n\nUse:\n\n```cpp\nif (!condition)\n  return error_code;\n<logic>\nreturn success;\n```\n\n#### Functions\n\nConsecutive functions should be separated with 2 empty lines in between\n\n```cpp\nvoid my_function_1()\n{\n  <logic>\n}\n\n\nvoid my_function_2()\n{\n  <logic>\n}\n```\n\n#### Preprocessor directives\n\nCompiler preprocessor directives should have no indentation to them, even if in the middle of indented code.\nFor example:\n\n```c\n  case SSL_TYPE_NONE:                           // SSL is not required\n    if (opt_require_secure_transport)\n    {\n      enum enum_vio_type type= vio_type(vio);\n#ifdef HAVE_OPENSSL\n      return type != VIO_TYPE_SSL &&\n#ifndef _WIN32\n             type != VIO_TYPE_SOCKET;\n#else\n             type != VIO_TYPE_NAMEDPIPE;\n#endif\n#else\n#ifndef _WIN32\n      return type != VIO_TYPE_SOCKET;\n#else\n      return type != VIO_TYPE_NAMEDPIPE;\n#endif\n#endif\n    }\n```\n\nComments reflecting the original `#if` condition can be appended to `#else` / `#endif` to provide additional clarity. This can be useful for large code blocks between the start and end preprocessor directives or nested preprocessor directives.\nFor example:\n\n```c\n#ifndef EMBEDDED_LIBRARY\n...\n#else /* ! EMBEDDED_LIBRARY */\n...\n#endif /* ! EMBEDDED_LIBRARY */\n```\n\n### File names\n\nFile names should be lower case with underscore word separators.\nC file names use the `.c` extension, C++ files use the `.cc` extension and header files use the `.h` extension.\n\n### Language standards\n\nFor pure-C files we use C99 and for C++ we use C++11.\nThe code need to be able to compile on multiple platforms using different compilers (for example: Windows / Linux, x86_64 / ARM).\n\n### Line lengths\n\nLines should be no more than 80 characters.\nThe reason for this is that it makes it easier to have multiple editor\nwindows open side by side and still keep code readable without line\nwraps.\n\nWhen breaking long lines:\n- use '()' to group expressions so that the editor can automatically help\n  you with the indentation.\n- When breaking expressions, leave the operator (+,- etc) last on the previous\n  line.\n\n```cpp\nrows= tab->table->file->multi_range_read_info(tab->ref.key, 10, 20, tab->ref.key_parts, &bufsz, &flags, &cost);\n->\nrows= tab->table->file->multi_range_read_info(tab->ref.key, 10, 20,\n                                              tab->ref.key_parts, &bufsz,\n                                              &flags, &cost);\n```\n\n```cpp\ntmp= aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa+bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb;\n->\ntmp= (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa+\n      bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb);\n```\n\n### Comments\n\nSingle line / inline code comments can use the double slash (`//`) style of coding, whereas multi-line code comments should use `/*` as a start and `*/` at the end, with the text indented by 2 spaces, for example:\n\n```cpp\n/*\n  This is a multi-line code comment.\n  It has an indentation of two spaces.\n*/\n```\n\n### Variables classes, and functions\n\nVariables and functions should be descriptive and in \"snake case\", for example:\n\n```cpp\nvoid my_function(uint16 variable_name)\n{\n```\n\nClass names should also be \"snake case\" but should start with an upper-case character.\nSuch as this:\n\n```cpp\nclass Buffered_logs\n{\n```\n\nAssignments should not have a space on the left side of the equals, and one space on the right hand side. For example:\n\n```cpp\na= 1;  // Correct\na = 1; // Incorrect for the server code,\n       // ok for Storage Engines if they use it (aka Connect)\n```\n\nThe above makes it easy to use 'grep' to find all assignments to a variable.\n\nPlease do not write conditions like this:\n\n```cpp\nif (0 == *error_code)\n```\n\nPlease do this instead:\n\n```cpp\nif (*error_code == 0)\n// Or even better\nif (!*error_code)\n```\n\nOnly use one-character variables (i,j,k...) in short loops. For anything else\nuse descriptive names!\n\n### Variable declarations\n\nVariables should be declared at the start of it's context (start of function, inside the 'if' statement.\n\nThe benefits of this:\n- Code lines gets shorter\n- It is easier to see the stack space used by a function.\n- It is easier to find the declaration of the variable.\n- If one has to add an 'if (error) goto end' construct, one can do\n  that without having to move variable declarations around.\n\n\n### Variable initializations\nVariables can be initialized using assignment operator or initializer and expression list.\nFor Example:\n\n```cpp\nint milliseconds= 1000;\nchar type= 't';\n```\n\nOr\n\n```cpp\nint milliseconds{1000};\nchar type{'t'};\n```\n\n\n### Constant integers\n\nConstant integers that are used to define elements such as buffer sizes should be defined rather than used directly.\nThis is because the integer could change and uses of it could be missed.\nFor example:\n\n```cpp\nchar *buffer= my_malloc(PSI_INSTRUMENT_ME, 1024, MYF(MY_WME));\n\nsnprint(buffer, 1024, \"%d: %s\", integer, text);\n```\n\nCould become:\n\n```cpp\nconstexpr int buffer_size= 1024;\nchar *buffer= my_malloc(PSI_INSTRUMENT_ME, buffer_size, MYF(MY_WME));\n\nsnprint(buffer, buffer_size, \"%d: %s\", integer, text);\n```\n\nAlternatively the integer can be defined using an `enum` or `#define`.\n\n### Spacing\n\n#### Whitespace\n\n* Lines should not have any trailing whitespace.\n* There should not be any trailing blank lines at the end of a file.\n* Line endings are POSIX style (`\\n`).\n* Two spaces for each indentation level, not tabs.\n\n#### Pointers\n\nThe `*` of a pointer should be on the side of the variable name such as:\n\n```cpp\nvoid my_function(THD *thd)\n{\n```\n\nAs yet there is no standard as to whether the `*` in a casting should have a space or not.\nBoth of these are valid:\n\n```cpp\nname= (const char*)db_name;\nname= (const char *) db_name;\n```\n\n#### Function variables\n\nThere should be a space after each comma in a definition and usage of a function.\nFor example:\n\n```cpp\nmy_function(thd, db_name);\n```\n\n### Types\n\nIn general the usage of types such as `char`, `int` and `long` should be discouraged but there are shortened versions of the unsigned variants available for these in `my_global.h`.\nThey can be different sizes across platforms and `char` can be either unsigned or signed depending on platform, and therefore are not portable.\nInstead these should be used as appropriate:\n\n* 8-bit signed / unsigned int -> `int8` / `uint8`\n* 16-bit signed / unsigned int -> `int16` / `uint16`\n* 32-bit signed / unsigned int -> `int32` / `uint32`\n* 64-bit signed / unsigned int -> `int64` / `uint64`\n* Integer file descriptor -> `File`\n* Integer socket descriptor -> `my_socket`\n\n`size_t` and `ptrdiff_t` are used in the source where appropriate, buffer sizes for example.\nIt should be noted that these are implementation dependent but are useful when used in the correct context.\n\nFurther types can be found in the `include/` directory files.\nThere are also general utility functions in `mysys`.\n"

And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most\nof the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can\ndo these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make\nsure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them\nthese terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer\nyou this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or\nmodify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by\nothers will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish\nto avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually\nobtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent\nthis, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free\nuse or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or\nwork, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without\nlimitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not\nrestricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately\npublish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty;\nkeep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at\nyour option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that\nyou changed the files and the date of any change. \n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\nin part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\nlicensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this\nLicense. \n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\nyou must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most\nordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate\ncopyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that\nyou provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\nconditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception:\nif the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an\nannouncement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an\nannouncement.) \n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,\nand thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the\nProgram.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section\n2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\nprovided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\ncode, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange; or, \n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\ngive any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\nperforming source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\ncorresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\nabove on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, \n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\ndistribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for\nnoncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code\nor executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.) \n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the\nsource code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed\nneed not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or\nbinary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code\nfrom the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third\nparties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any\nwork based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do\nso, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third\nparties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement\nor for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed\non you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the\nconditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this\nLicense. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a\nconsequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those\nwho receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the\nsection as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright\nholder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such\ncase, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this\nLicense.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies\na version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\",\nyou have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version\nor of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the\nProgram does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any\nversion ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE\nPROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED\nIN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS\nIS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT\nNOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nPROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,\nSPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY\nTO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER\nPARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use\nto the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which\neveryone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\none line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.\nCopyright (C) yyyy  name of author\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License\nas published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2\nof the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\nGNU General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\nalong with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\nFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1335  USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\nstarts in an interactive mode:\n\nGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\nGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\ntype `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome\nto redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c' \nfor details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary. Here is\na sample; alter the names:\n\nYoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright\ninterest in the program `Gnomovision'\n(which makes passes at compilers) written \nby James Hacker.\n\nsignature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\nTy Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.

It is\nupdated periodically to reflect changes made by political bodies to time zone\nboundaries, UTC offsets, and daylight-saving rules. This database (often called\ntz or zoneinfo) is used by several implementations, including the GNU C Library\nused in GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Cygwin, DJGPP, HP-UX, IRIX, Mac OS\nX, OpenVMS, Solaris, Tru64, and UnixWare.\n\nEach location in the database represents a national region where all clocks\nkeeping local time have agreed since 1970. Locations are identified by continent\nor ocean and then by the name of the location, which is typically the largest\ncity within the region. For example, America/New_York represents most of the US\neastern time zone; America/Phoenix represents most of Arizona, which uses\nmountain time without daylight saving time (DST); America/Detroit represents\nmost of Michigan, which uses eastern time but with different DST rules in 1975;\nand other entries represent smaller regions like Starke County, Indiana, which\nswitched from central to eastern time in 1991 and switched back in 2006. To use\nthe database on an extended POSIX implementation set the TZ environment variable\nto the location's full name, e.g., TZ=\"America/New_York\".\n\nIn the tz database's FTP distribution the code is in the file tzcodeC.tar.gz,\nwhere C is the code's version; similarly, the data are in tzdataD.tar.gz, where\nD is the data's version. The following shell commands download these files to a\nGNU/Linux or similar host; see the downloaded README file for what to do next.\n\nwget 'ftp://elsie.nci.nih.gov/pub/tz*.tar.gz'\ngzip -dc tzcode*.tar.gz | tar -xf -\ngzip -dc tzdata*.tar.gz | tar -xf -\n\nThe code lets you compile the tz source files into machine-readable binary\nfiles, one for each location. It also lets you read a tz binary file and\ninterpret time stamps for that location.\n\nThe data are by no means authoritative. If you find errors, please send changes\nto the time zone mailing list. You can also subscribe to the mailing list,\nretrieve the archive of old messages (in gzip compressed format), or retrieve\narchived older versions of code and data; there is also a smaller HTTP mirror.\n\n***************************************************************************\n\n%%The following software may be included in this product:\nhttp://www.unicode.org/copyright.html\n\n    Unicode® Copyright and Terms of Use\n\n    For the general privacy policy governing access to this site, see the  Unicode Privacy Policy.\n\n        Unicode Copyright\n            Copyright © 1991-2023 Unicode, Inc.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    \n    Copyright (C)   \n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  , 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\n***************************************************************************\n\n%%The following software may be included in this product:\nHandlerSocket plugin for MySQL\n\nCopyright (c) 2010 DeNA Co.,Ltd.\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n    * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n    * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n      notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n      documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n    * Neither the name of DeNA Co.,Ltd. nor the names of its contributors\n      may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this software\n      without specific prior written permission.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY DeNA Co.,Ltd. \"AS IS\" AND ANY EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE ARE DISCLAIMED.
