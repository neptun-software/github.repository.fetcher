Thus, it is not used internally. \n\n---\n\n\nThe Bazel oneTBB build is currently only intended for a subset of oneTBB that suffices restricted use cases.\nPull requests to improve the Bazel build experience are welcome.\n\nThe standard Bazel approach to handling third-party libraries is static linking. It is the best practice within the Bazel ecosystem.\n\n## Using oneTBB as a dependency\n\n### Traditional WORKSPACE approach\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use oneTBB as a dependency within a Bazel project.\n\nThe following file structure is assumed:\n\n```\nexample\n├── .bazelrc\n├── BUILD.bazel\n├── main.cpp\n└── WORKSPACE.bazel\n```\n\n_WORKSPACE.bazel_:\n```python\nload(\"@platforms//tools/build_defs/repo:git.bzl\", \"git_repository\")\n\ngit_repository(\n    name = \"oneTBB\",\n    branch = \"master\",\n    remote = \"https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/\",\n)\n```\n\nIn the *WORKSPACE* file, the oneTBB GitHub* repository is fetched. \n\n_BUILD.bazel_:\n\n```python\ncc_binary(\n    name = \"Demo\",\n    srcs = [\"main.cpp\"],\n    deps = [\"@oneTBB//:tbb\"],\n)\n```\n\nThe *BUILD* file defines a binary named `Demo` that has a dependency to oneTBB.\n\n_main.cpp_:\n\n```c++\n#include \"oneapi/tbb/version.h\"\n\n#include <iostream>\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout << \"Hello from oneTBB \"\n              << TBB_VERSION_MAJOR << \".\"\n              << TBB_VERSION_MINOR << \".\"\n              << TBB_VERSION_PATCH\n              << \"!\" << std::endl;\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThe expected output of this program is the current version of oneTBB.\n\nSwitch to the folder with the files created earlier and run the binary with `bazel run //:Demo`.\n\n### Bzlmod\n\nIf you use Bzlmod, you can fetch oneTBB with the [Bazel Central Registry](https://registry.bazel.build/).\n\nAdd the following line to your `MODULE.bazel` file:\n\n```bazel\nbazel_dep(name = \"onetbb\", version = \"2021.13.0\")\n```\n\n## Build oneTBB using Bazel\n\nRun ```bazel build //...``` in the oneTBB root directory.\n\n## Compiler support\n\nThe Bazel build uses the compiler flag `-mwaitpkg` in non-Windows* builds.\nThis flag is supported by the GNU* Compiler Collection (GCC) version 9.3, Clang* 12, and newer versions of those tools.\n\n\n---\n**NOTE**\n\nTo use the Bazel build with earlier versions of GCC, remove `-mwaitpkg` flag as it leads to errors during compilation.\n\n---\n"

This document explains how to participate in project conversations, log bugs and enhancement requests, and submit code patches to the project. \n\n## Licensing \n\nLicensing is very important to open source projects. It helps ensure the software continues to be available under the terms that the author desired. The oneTBB project uses the [Apache 2.0 License](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/blob/master/LICENSE.txt), a permissive open source license that allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute your own products that include Apache 2.0 licensed software. By contributing to the oneTBB project, you agree to the license and copyright terms therein and release your own contributions under these terms. \n\nSome imported or reused components within oneTBB use other licenses, as described in [third-party-programs.txt](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/blob/master/third-party-programs.txt). By carefully reviewing potential contributions, we can ensure that the community can develop products with oneTBB without concerns over patent or copyright issues. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\nAs a contributor, you'll want to be familiar with the oneTBB project and the repository layout. You should also know how to use it as explained in the [oneTBB documentation](https://uxlfoundation.github.io/oneTBB/) and how to set up your build development environment to configure, build, and test oneTBB as explained in the [oneTBB Build System Description](cmake/README.md). \n\n## Pull Requests \n\nYou can find all [open oneTBB pull requests](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/pulls) on GitHub. \n \n### Before contributing changes directly to the oneTBB repository\n\n* Make sure you can build the product and run all the tests with your patch. \n* For a larger feature, provide a relevant test. \n* Document your code. The oneTBB project uses reStructuredText for documentation.  \n* Update the copyright year in the first line of the changing file(s). \n  For example, if you commit your changes in 2022:\n  * the copyright year should be `2005-2022` for existing files\n  * the copyright year should be `2022` for new files\n* Submit a pull request into the master branch. You can submit changes with a pull request (preferred) or by sending an email patch.  \n\nContinuous Integration (CI) testing is enabled for the repository. Your pull request must pass all checks before it can be merged. We will review your contribution and may provide feedback to guide you if any additional fixes or modifications are necessary. When reviewed and accepted, your pull request will be merged into our GitHub repository. \n"

          "content": "# Installation from Sources\n\n\n## Prerequisites \n   \n   - Make sure you have installed CMake version 3.1 (or newer) on your system. oneTBB uses CMake build configuration.\n   - Configure and build oneTBB. To work with build configurations, see [Build System Description](cmake/README.md). \n\n\n## Configure oneTBB\n\nAt the command prompt, type:\n```\ncmake <options> <repo_root>\n```\n\nYou may want to use some additional options for configuration:\n\n| Option                    | Purpose                   | Description                                                                        |\n| ------                    |------                     | ------                                                                             |\n| `-G <generator>`          | Specify project generator | For more information, run cmake `–help`.                                           |\n|`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` | Specify for Debug build   | Not applicable for multi-configuration generators such as Visual Studio generator. |\n\n\n## Build oneTBB\n \nTo build the system, run:\n```\ncmake --build . <options>\n```\n\nSome useful build options:\n- `--target <target>` - specific target, \"all\" is default.\n-\t`--config <Release|Debug>` - build configuration, applicable only for multi-config generators such as Visual Studio generator.\n\n\n## Install and Pack oneTBB\n\n---\n**NOTE**\n\nBe careful about installing prefix. It defaults to `/usr/local` on UNIX* and `c:/Program Files/${PROJECT_NAME}` on Windows* OS.\nYou can define custom `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` during configuration:\n\n```\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/install/prefix ..\n```\n\n---\n\nInstallation can also be done using:\n\n```\ncmake --install <project-binary-dir>\n```\n\nSpecial ``--install`` target can alternatively be used for installation, e.g. ``make install``.\n\nYou can use the ``install`` components for partial installation.\n\nThe following install components are supported:\n- `runtime` - oneTBB runtime package (core shared libraries and `.dll` files on Windows* OS).\n- `devel` - oneTBB development package (header files, CMake integration files, library symbolic links, and `.lib` files on Windows* OS).\n- `tbb4py` - [oneTBB Module for Python](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/blob/master/python/README.md).\n\nIf you want to install specific components after configuration and build, run:\n\n```bash\ncmake -DCOMPONENT=<component> [-DBUILD_TYPE=<build-type>] -P cmake_install.cmake\n```\n\nSimple packaging using CPack is supported.\nThe following commands allow you to create a simple portable package that includes header files, libraries, and integration files for CMake:\n\n```bash\ncmake <options> ..\ncpack\n```\n\n## Installation from vcpkg\n\nYou can download and install oneTBB using the [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) dependency manager:\n```sh\n  git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git\n  cd vcpkg\n  ./bootstrap-vcpkg.sh #.\\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat(for Windows)\n  ./vcpkg integrate install\n  ./vcpkg install tbb\n```\n\nThe oneTBB port in vcpkg is kept up to date by Microsoft* team members and community contributors. If the version is out of date, create an issue or pull request on the [vcpkg repository](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg).\n\n## Example of Installation\n\n### Single-configuration generators\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to install oneTBB for single-configuration generators (e.g. GNU Make, Ninja, etc.).\n```bash\n# Do our experiments in /tmp\ncd /tmp\n# Clone oneTBB repository\ngit clone https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB.git\ncd oneTBB\n# Create binary directory for out-of-source build\nmkdir build && cd build\n# Configure: customize CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and disable TBB_TEST to avoid tests build\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/my_installed_onetbb -DTBB_TEST=OFF ..\n# Build\ncmake --build .\n# Install\ncmake --install .\n# Well done! Your installed oneTBB is in /tmp/my_installed_onetbb\n```\n\n### Multi-configuration generators\n\nThe following example demonstrates how to install oneTBB for multi-configuration generators such as Visual Studio*. \n\nChoose the configuration during the build and install steps:\n```batch\nREM Do our experiments in %TMP%\ncd %TMP%\nREM Clone oneTBB repository\ngit clone https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB.git\ncd oneTBB\nREM Create binary directory for out-of-source build\nmkdir build && cd build\nREM Configure: customize CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX and disable TBB_TEST to avoid tests build\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%TMP%\\my_installed_onetbb -DTBB_TEST=OFF ..\nREM Build \"release with debug information\" configuration \ncmake --build . --config relwithdebinfo\nREM Install \"release with debug information\" configuration \ncmake --install . --config relwithdebinfo\nREM Well done! Your installed oneTBB is in %TMP%\\my_installed_onetbb\n```\n"

It includes: \n\n1. The platform is out of official support (met end of life). When you use an unsupported platform, you can face a security risk that can be difficult to resolve.\n2. We do not have the infrastructure to test a platform. Therefore we cannot guarantee that oneTBB works correctly on that platform. \n3. Changes affect more code than just platform-specific macros.\n4. The platform is incompatible with oneTBB. Some platforms may have limitations that prevent oneTBB from working correctly. We cannot provide support in these cases as the issue is beyond our control.\n5. The platform is modified or customized. If you made significant updates to your platform, it might be hard for us to find the root cause of the issue. Therefore, we may not be able to provide support as the modification could affect the oneTBB functionality. \n\n\nWe understand that these limitations can be frustrating.

See the [instructions](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html). \n\nTo build the system, run:\n\n```\nmkdir build && cd build\nemcmake cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=em++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=emcc -DTBB_STRICT=OFF -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-Wno-unused-command-line-argument -DTBB_DISABLE_HWLOC_AUTOMATIC_SEARCH=ON -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DTBB_EXAMPLES=ON -DTBB_TEST=ON\n```\nTo compile oneTBB without ``pthreads``, set the flag ``-DEMSCRIPTEN_WITHOUT_PTHREAD=true`` in the command above. By default, oneTBB uses the ``pthreads``.\n```\ncmake --build . <options>\ncmake --install . <options>\n```\nWhere:\n\n* ``emcmake`` - a tool that sets up the environment for Emscripten*. \n* ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=em++`` - specifies the C++ compiler as Emscripten* C++ compiler. \n* ``-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=emcc`` - specifies the C compiler as Emscripten* C compiler.\n\n\n> **_NOTE:_** See [CMake documentation](https://github.com/uxlfoundation/oneTBB/blob/master/cmake/README.md) to learn about other options. \n\n\n## Run Test\n\nTo run tests, use:\n\n```\nctest\n```\n\n# Limitations\n\nYou can successfully build your application with oneTBB using WASM, but you may not achieve optimal performance immediately. This is due to the limitation with nested Web Workers: a Web Worker cannot schedule another worker without help from a browser thread. This can lead to unexpected performance outcomes, such as the application running in serial.\nFind more information in the [issue](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/discussions/21963) in the Emscripten repository.\nTo workaround this issue, try one of the following ways:\n1. **Recommended Solution: Use the ``-sPROXY_TO_PTHREAD`` Flag**. \nThis flag splits the initial thread into a browser thread and a main thread (proxied by a Web Worker), effectively resolving the issue as the browser thread is always present in the event loop and can participate in Web Workers scheduling. Refer to the [Emscripten documentation](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/pthreads.html) for more details about ``-sPROXY_TO_PTHREAD`` since using this flag may require refactoring the code.\n2. **Alternative Solution: Warm Up the oneTBB Thread Pool**\nInitialize the oneTBB thread pool before making the first call to oneTBB. This approach forces the browser thread to participate in Web Workers scheduling.\n```cpp\n    int num_threads = tbb::this_task_arena::max_concurrency();\n    std::atomic<int> barrier{num_threads};\n    tbb::parallel_for(0, num_threads, [&barrier] (int) {\n        barrier--;\n        while (barrier > 0) {\n            // Send browser thread to event loop\n            std::this_thread::yield();\n        }\n    }, tbb::static_partitioner{});\n```\n> **_NOTE:_** Be aware that it might cause delays on the browser side.\n"
