By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.

We made Relativty in my bedroom with a soldering iron and a 3D printer and we expect you to do the same: **build it yourself**.\r\n\r\nRelativty at its basics is a 3 Degrees of Freedom (3-DoF) VR headset with no built-in controller support, designed to work with SteamVR.\r\nThis may limit its practical usability for games that demand knuckle-style VR controllers.\r\nIf you are looking for a more full-featured DIY VR project 6-Dof tracking and controller support, we recommend you check out <a href=\"https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR\">HadesVR</a>.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you are building either Relativty or HadesVR, or if you just want to join our community and hang out, we invite you to <a href=\"https://discord.gg/F8GNKjy6RF\">Relativty's Guild on Discord</a>.\r\n\r\nIt is a place for the DIY/Open-Source VR community to learn, grow, share knowledge, and ask for help. \r\n\r\n# Start Building Relativty\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/open.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\n# Building The Hardware\r\n## 1. CURRENT RECOMMENDED BUILD - As of May 2023\r\n### 1.1 Introduction\r\nThis is an updated build guide to help people who recently discovered Relativty. It aims to explain how to build the minimum functional product, which can be further improved upon and modified to the individual's liking. The original build guide can still be found further below.\r\n\r\n            Following this guide to build a Relativty headset assumes basic understanding of electronics and programming Arduino boards.\r\n            A VR headset is a complex system and can be difficult to figure out what is not working if you get stuck with the build.\r\n            If you encounter any issues, join our Discord and ask for help, we are happy to assist.\r\n\r\n### 1.2 ELECTRONICS\r\n\r\nThe following electronic components are required:\r\n\r\n- ATmega32U4 Microcontroller (MCU) with USB HID support, such as an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/diymore-Atmega32U4-Development-Microcontroller-Header/dp/B0BKGSVX2X\">Arduino Pro Micro</a>\r\n- Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that is supported by the <a href=\"https://github.com/LiquidCGS/FastIMU\">FastIMU Library</a>\r\n- A small, high resolution and high refresh rate PC display + driver board. <a href=\"https://github.com/HadesVR/HadesVR/blob/main/docs/Headset.md#displays\">This segment of the HadesVR documentation presents possible good options you can choose from</a>. It is important to note that these displays connect to a DRIVER BOARD, which then connects to your computer. ALWAYS purchase the driver board and display(s) in the same bundle if you can to ensure they are compatible with each other. If you have further questions about displays, join us at <a href=\"https://discord.gg/F8GNKjy6RF\">Relativty's Guild on Discord</a>.\r\n```\r\nNOTES on VR DISPLAYS:\r\n- The display does not connect to the Microcontroller, it only connects to the Computer running your VR Apps.\r\n- Technically, any PC display/monitor can be configured as the display used by Relativty. Therefore, you can simply test your build on your PC monitor\r\nfirst to make sure it works, before you decide to spend a significant amount of money on lenses, display(s) and other parts.\r\n- High performance, small form factor displays are expensive, and often very delicate. Handle them with care! :)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 1.2.1 Wiring the IMU and MCU\r\nThe IMU needs to be connected to the MCU for power and communication.\r\nThe MCU connects to your computer via USB to send the IMU readings to SteamVR.\r\n\r\nIn case of an Arduino Pro Micro, you need to connect the following pins:\r\n```\r\nPro Micro       IMU\r\nVCC         ->  VCC  \r\nGND         ->  GND  \r\nSDA(pin 2)  ->  SDA  \r\nSCL(pin 3)  ->  SCL  \r\n```  \r\nIf you use a different MCU, the SDA and SCL pins might be mapped to different pin numbers.\r\n\r\nAlso, make sure that the VCC of your MCU is compatible with the rated operating voltage of your IMU.\r\n\r\nSupplying incorrect voltage to electronic components may cause damage to them.\r\n\r\nThe MCU itself simply connects to your computer via the USB port.\r\n\r\n### 1.2.2 Connecting the display\r\nAs mentioned previously, any display that is compatible with a personal computer should be able to function as your VR display.\r\n\r\nIn case you are using the recommended one or a similar component that is powered via micro-USB or other USB standard, it is possible that you will encounter situations where the board does not power up. This could be either because the micro-USB cable you are using is too long (so the board cannot power up because the voltage dropped too much), or the board is unable to turn on because the USB port it connects to on the computer side is simply unable to supply enough power. In this case, you might need to try different ports on your computer or a powered USB hub.\r\n\r\n### 1.3 MECHANICAL BUILD\r\n\r\nThe following parts are required for the Mechanical Build:\r\n\r\n- Housing - .STL files for 3D-printable model provided in Relativty_Mechanical_build folder.\r\n- Lenses -  for building the 3D-printable headset, Lenses with 40mm diameter/50mm focal length required. You can often find these on Aliexpress or similar.\r\n- Strap and Facial Interface - e.g. replacement strap + foam for HTC Vive. You can often find these on Aliexpress or similar.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/front.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\nIf you do not have access to 3D-printing, it is also possible (and MUCH simpler) to just use an Android VR Phone case, and modify it to fit your screen and so that you can attach your IMU and MCU to it.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this approach is that you get everything in one package, often including IPD adjustment.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/android-vr.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\n### 1.4 SOFTWARE SETUP\r\n\r\n### 1.4.1 Introduction\r\n\r\nRelativty depends on 2 main software components:\r\n- the Arduino firmware\r\n- the SteamVR driver\r\n\r\nAs the system is designed to work with SteamVR, you need to have Steam installed and SteamVR downloaded on your computer.\r\n\r\n### 1.4.2 Programming your MCU\r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, we recommend you use an Arduino Pro Micro and an IMU supported by the FastIMU Library.\r\nFastIMU is an awesome package that supports many commonly used IMUs and comes with a pre-written Arduino sketch that works with Relativty.\r\n\r\nFirst, you will need to install the Arduino IDE and connect your MCU to your computer via the USB connector.\r\n\r\nOnce you have it connected and verified your Arduino IDE can work with your MCU, download FastIMU from the library manager.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/FastIMU-lib.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\nWire up your IMU as recommended in Section 1.2.1.\r\n\r\nFind the Examples/Fastimu/Calibrated_relativty sketch in your Arduino IDE:\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/FastIMU-sketch.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\nAnd finally, Upload it to your MCU.\r\n\r\nFastIMU also includes a built-in calibration tool that can store the calibration data on the IMUs EEPROM.\r\n\r\nCalibrating the IMU may help with sensor drift that you can experience over time while using Relativty.\r\n\r\nAfter uploading Calibrated_relativty sketch to the IMU, you can open the Arduino Serial Monitor to initiate a calibration sequence:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/FastIMU-calib.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\n      NOTE: you only have to do this once, but make sure to follow the instructions given to you in the serial monitor.\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1.4.3 Installing The SteamVR Driver\r\n\r\nTo install the Relativty SteamVR driver:\r\n- download the <a href=\"https://github.com/relativty/Relativty/archive/refs/heads/master.zip\">master repository</a>\r\n- inside Relativty-master find the Relativty_Driver\\Relativty folder and copy it to your SteamVR installation's drivers directory.\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/driver-copy.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n### 1.4.4 Configuring The SteamVR Driver\r\n\r\nOnce you copied the driver files, it is time to configure the driver to work with your setup and computer.\r\n\r\nInside drivers\\Relativty\\resources\\settings, there should be a file called default.vrsettings.\r\n\r\nThis is the configuration file for the driver.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things that you need to change.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Configuring the driver to talk to the MCU\r\nASSUMING you use an Arduino Pro Micro and the FastIMU library:\r\n\r\nIn the Relativty_hmd segment find these values:\r\n- hmdPid\r\n- hmdVid\r\n- hmdIMUdmpPackets\r\n\r\nand change the values like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"hmdPid\" : 32823,\r\n      \"hmdVid\": 9025,\r\n      \"hmdIMUdmpPackets\":  false,\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using a different MCU, you need to figure out the USB PID and VID values.\r\n\r\nEasiest way is to connect it to your computer via USB and check in Arduino IDE.\r\n\r\nIn the menu bar, select Tools/Get Board Info:\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/board-info.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\nTake the PID and VID values and convert them to decimal with a <a href=\"https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html\">hex converter</a>.\r\n\r\nThe converted values then go into the hmdPid and hmdVid values in default.vrsettings.\r\n\r\n### Configuring the Display Settings\r\nNow let's look at configuring the driver to work with your Display.\r\n\r\nThe config variables for the display are in the Relativty_extendedDisplay segment:\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the VR Viewport window's point of origin:\r\n```\r\n      \"windowX\" : 3440,\r\n      \"windowY\" : 0,\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the VR Viewport's actual size\r\n```\r\n      \"windowWidth\" : 1920,\r\n      \"windowHeight\" : 1080,\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the VR Viewport's rendering resolution - this should be normally the same as the size\r\n```\r\n      \"renderWidth\" : 1920,\r\n      \"renderHeight\" : 1080,\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd some miscellaneous settings:\r\n```\r\n      \"DistortionK1\" : 0.4,\r\n      \"DistortionK2\" : 0.5,\r\n      \"ZoomWidth\" : 1,\r\n      \"ZoomHeight\" : 1,\r\n      \"EyeGapOffsetPx\" : 0,\r\n      \"IsDisplayRealDisplay\" : true,\r\n      \"IsDisplayOnDesktop\" : true\r\n```\r\nIf the point of origin and size is not configured correctly, the driver will crash and SteamVR will not display anything!\r\n\r\nTherefore we need to have a look at and understand the coordinate system SteamVR uses for displays.\r\n\r\nWindows always assumes one of the connected displays as your Primary Display.\r\n\r\nYou can verify which one is your Primary in Display Settings.\r\n\r\nYou can select each of your displays with the mouse. The one that has \"Make this my main display\" checkbox greyed out is your Primary Display.\r\n\r\nTHIS GUIDE ASSUMES THAT THE TOP EDGE OF ALL OF YOUR DISPLAYS ARE ALIGNED IN WINDOWS DISPLAY SETTINGS (as seen on the screenshots)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/display-settings.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\nConsequently, checking the same on another, non-primary display will make that one your Primary.\r\n\r\nThe TOP LEFT corner of your Primary Display is the ORIGIN POINT of SteamVR's display coordinate system.\r\n\r\nTo be able to tell SteamVR where to draw the VR Viewport on your displays, you need to make sure you understand this fact and as a result can identify the correct point of origin for the Viewport.\r\n\r\nFor example, in a setup like this:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/display-coordinates.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\nBecause the \"1\" screen is the primary, and the \"3\" screen is the VR Display, the origin point (the 0,0 coordinate) is on the top left of the \"1\" screen.\r\n\r\nThis screen has 3440x1440 resolution.\r\n\r\nThis means it occupies the X axis from 0 to 3439, and the next screen on its right starts at point 3440.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in this case the correct windowX and windowY values are:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"windowX\" : 3440,\r\n      \"windowY\" : 0,\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf \"2\" screen was the VR display (and \"1\" is still the Primary), the correct values would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"windowX\" : -1920,\r\n      \"windowY\" : 0,\r\n```\r\nBecause the \"2\" screen's coordinates occupy space over the other side of the origin point.\r\n\r\nFor windowWidth,windowHeight,renderWidth,renderHeight, simply set the Native Resolution of your VR display.\r\n\r\nOnce this is all set, save the settings file.\r\n\r\nNow you should be ready to start SteamVR.\r\n\r\nIf everything is set up right, you should get straight into the vr holodeck area:\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/electronics-assembled.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\nIf you are encountering any issues with your build:\r\n- open the SteamVR Web Console and copy the entire log file\r\n- Join <a href=\"https://discord.gg/F8GNKjy6RF\">Relativty's Guild on Discord</a>, tell us about the issues you are facing, and upload the log file in the chat. \r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/steamvr-logs.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\n### IF YOUR VR WINDOW DISAPPEARS AFTER CLICKING ON IT:\r\n\r\nOpen Windows PowerShell and paste these commands into the command line, then hit enter:\r\n\r\n```\r\nget-process vrcompositor | stop-process -Force;cd \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\SteamVR\\bin\\win64\";.\\vrcompositor.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfterwards the VRCompositor should remain stable, so you only have to do this once per session.\r\n\r\n\r\n# 2. LEGACY BUILD\r\nThe hardware is based on the Relativty Motherboard which includes an Atmel SAM3X8E ARM Cortex-M3 processor and uses an MPU-6050 as it’s IMU.\r\nAlternatively, any processor that supports the ArduinoCore and is connected to an MPU-6050/MPU-9250 can be used as the hardware for Relativty. Both methods are explained below.\r\n\r\n## Building The Relativty Motherboard\r\n### PCB Manufacturing.\r\n\r\nWe first start with the naked PCB.\r\n\r\nit can be manufactured and bought for around $4 on websites like <a href=\"https://jlcpcb.com/\">jlcpcb</a>.\r\n\r\nYou’ll need to provide the Gerber file folder `Relativty_Electronics_build/GerberFiles.zip` which describes the shape of the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Assembling\r\n\r\nSoldering the components onto the naked PCB. \r\n\r\nYou’ll have to buy the components listed in one of the two BOMs, depending on availability:\r\n- `Relativty_Electronics_build/Assembly/jlcpcb.com_motherboard_BOM.csv` \r\n- `Relativty_Electronics_build/Assembly/motherboard_BOM.xlsx`\r\n\r\nWhere to position those components on the PCB is described in the file `Relativty_Electronics_source/motherboard.brd` which can be opened in Eagle.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/motherboard.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\n#### Using an Arduino\r\n\r\nAn alternative to the Relativty Motherboard is to use an Arduino Due and to connect it to an MPU-6050.\r\n```\r\n5V      -> VCC  \r\nGND     -> GND  \r\nSDA(20) -> SDA  \r\nSCL(21) -> SCL  \r\nPIN 2   -> INT  \r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you are using an MPU-9250 with the alternative firmware provided the pinout is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n5V      -> VCC  \r\nGND     -> GND  \r\nSDA(20) -> SDA  \r\nSCL(21) -> SCL   \r\n```\r\n\r\nThen push the `ERASE` and the `RESET` button on the Arduino Due and you’ll be able to install the Relativty Firmware.\r\n\r\n#### Installing The Relativty Firmware\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/cards.jpg\"> </p>\r\nYou’ll now need to install the Relativty board in the Arduino IDE. \r\n\r\nTo do that copy that JSON URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/relativty/Relativty/master/Relativty_Firmware/package_Relativty_board_index.json and open the Arduino IDE\r\n\r\nIn Arduino, Click File and then Preferences:\r\n\r\n- If you are using the Relativty PCB, aad the JSON URL to the `Additional Boards Manager` text box.\r\n- Go to `Tools > Board > Board Manager` and you should see the Relativty Board, click install.\r\n- Reboot the Arduino IDE and under Tools > Boards, select Relativty.\r\n- You can now open `Relativty_Firmware/firmware/firmware.ino` and upload it to your board.\r\n\r\nIf you are using a different board e.g. Arduino Due:\r\n\r\n- install contents of `Relativty_Firmware\\Relativty_board\\` to your Arduino IDE\r\n- if you are using MPU-6050, use `Relativty_Firmware/firmware/firmware.ino`\r\n- if you are using MPU-9250, use `Relativty_Firmware\\MP9250-HID\\MP9250-HID\\MP9250-HID.ino`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Building The Mechanical Parts\r\n\r\n## Assembling the HMD\r\n\r\nAll the files needed for the 3D printing can be found in the `Relativty_Mechanical_build` folder and the screws needed to assemble the Headset are listed in `screws_BOM.xlsx`.\r\n\r\nWe've used parts from Aliexpress:\r\n\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33058848848.html\">The Strap</a>, \r\n- <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/4000199486058.html\">The Foam</a>,\r\n- <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33029909783.html\">The Lenses</a> (40mm diameter/50mm focal length).\r\n\r\n### The screen for the HMD\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/display.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\nRelativty Headset runs a dual-screen at 120FPS 2K, however, because of the open nature of Relativty you can equip it with any screen.\r\n\r\nOur model can be found on Aliexpress, but depending on the vendor similar screens can cost from $150 to $190. You'll have to hunt and maybe wait for the right vendor at the right price to get the display for cheap (or buy in bulk). \r\n\r\nThis is [the model we used](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32975198897.html).\r\n\r\n### Setting Up the Software\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\"> <img src=\"ressources/img/front.jpg\"> </p>\r\n\r\n#### Installing Relativty Driver for SteamVR\r\n\r\nThe Relativty Driver is contained within `Relativty_Driver/Relativty` folder. \r\n\r\n⚠️ You’ll need to set it up by editing the JSON file `Relativty_Driver/Relativty/resources/settings/default.vrsettings`\r\n\r\nIf you are not using a Relativty PCB, you will need to change these:\r\n\r\n      \"hmdPid\" : 9,\r\n      \"hmdVid\": 4617,\r\n\t  \r\nThese are the USB HID device's unique Vendor and Producit Identifieres (pid/vid)\r\n\r\nIf you are using and Arduino Due, the correct values will be:\r\n\r\n      \"hmdPid\" : 62,\r\n      \"hmdVid\" : 9025,\r\n\t  \r\nIn case you are using a different board, the process to get the right values is as below:\r\n\r\n1.\tPlug your board in\r\n\r\n2.\tSelect your board in Arduino IDE and click Tools/Get Board info. you will see something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\tBN: Arduino Due (Native USB Port)\r\n\tVID: 2341\r\n\tPID: 003e\r\n\tSN: HIDHB\r\n```\r\n3.\tMake note of the VID and PID numbers. These are hexadecimal values.\r\n\r\n\tTo apply them to the config, they need to be converted to int.\r\n\t\r\n\tIf you are unsure how to do that, there is plenty online converters available.\r\n\t\r\n\tSuch as: https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html\r\n\r\n4.\tChange your hmdPid and hmdVid values to the converted values.\r\n\r\nNext, you need to set up the display coordinates and resolution.\r\n\r\nAt first, you should have the HMD's display set up as a secondary screen extending your desktop,\r\n\r\naligned onto the top right corner of your primary display.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the config file's \"Relativty_extendedDisplay\" segment, find and set these:\r\n```\r\n      \"windowX\" : *whatever your primary screen resolution's width is*,\r\n      \"windowY\" : 0,\r\n      \"windowWidth\" : *HMD's native resolution width*,\r\n      \"windowHeight\" : *HMD's native resolution height*,\r\n      \"renderWidth\" : *HMD's native resolution width*,\r\n      \"renderHeight\" : *HMD's native resolution height*,\r\n\t  \r\n\t  And at the bottom of this segment:\r\n\t  \r\n      \"IsDisplayRealDisplay\" : true,\r\n      \"IsDisplayOnDesktop\" : true\r\n```  \r\n\t  \r\nMake sure not to delete any \",\" symbols as that will break the config.\r\n\r\nOnly the last item in the config should not have a \",\" symbol.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf for whatever reason the above settings do not work out for you try:\r\n\r\n\r\nSet your HMD display as a mirrored display of your primary display.\r\n\r\nChange config as follows:\r\n```\r\n      \"windowX\" : 0,\r\n      \"windowY\" : 0,\r\n      \"windowWidth\" : *HMD's native resolution width*,\r\n      \"windowHeight\" : *HMD's native resolution height*,\r\n      \"renderWidth\" : *HMD's native resolution width*,\r\n      \"renderHeight\" : *HMD's native resolution height*,\r\n\t\r\n      \"IsDisplayRealDisplay\" : false,\r\n      \"IsDisplayOnDesktop\" : true\r\n\t\r\n```\t\r\n⚠️ Please note that this may result in keyboard/mouse input not being captured by the VR window, should your game require it, it might become unplayable.\r\n\r\nYou can also make IPD (Interpupillary Disance) adjustments within the configuration file:\r\n\r\nIn the \"Relativty_hmd\" segment find and adjust:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"IPDmeters\" : 0.063,\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also change the lens distortion correction by changing these:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      \"DistortionK1\" : 0.4,\r\n      \"DistortionK2\" : 0.5,\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can now install Relativty Driver:\r\n- Locate your `vrpathreg.exe` program, usually located at `C:/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win64/vrpathreg.exe`\r\n- Then open the Windows Command Prompt and run the following commands:\r\n`cd C:/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win64\r\nvrpathreg.exe`\r\n\r\nAnd then assuming your `Relativty_Driver/Relativty` driver folder is located at:\r\n`C:/code/Relativty_Driver/Relativty`\r\n- run `vrpathreg adddriver C:/code/Relativty_Driver/Relativty`\r\n\r\nRelativty Driver is now installed. You can uninstall it any time by running:  \r\n- `vrpathreg removedriver C:/code/Relativty_Driver/Relativty`\r\n\r\n#### Setting up the Experimental 3D Tracking\r\n\r\nThe tracking is still very experimental and can only be run on NVIDIA GPU due to the usage of CUDA. The tracking makes uses of only a video input and an Artificial Neural Network AI trained to estimate a 3D body position. \r\n\r\nThis method is nothing close to the precision or freedom of movements of a dedicated sensor however we believe that the model can be trained and improved by orders of magnitude.\r\n\r\nYou first need to connect a webcam to your computer and install Python 3.8.4 and select the option to add it to the path. Then install `PyTorch`, you can do so by running the following commands:\r\n\r\n`python -m pip install torch===1.6.0 torchvision===0.7.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html`\r\n\r\nThen proceed to install `CUDA Toolkit 11.0.`\r\n\r\nYou’ll then need to download the Folder `PYTHONPATH` at https://github.com/relativty/Relativty/releases and add its location to `PyPath` in the `JSON Relativty_Driver/Relativty/resources/settings/default.vrsettings`\r\n\r\nSet `tracking` to 1. The tracking is now turned on and can be turned off anytime by setting `tracking` to 0. The tracking can also be calibrated depending on your camera, this can be done by tweeking `scalesCoordinateMeter` and `offsetCoordinate`. `scalesCoordinateMeter` correspond to the delta of coordinates in a given axis calculated by the AI after normalization when you move 1 meter in that given axis.\r\n\r\n**Note:** If you plan on using mpu9250 firmware do not forget to switch to it in the driver by setting `hmdIMUdmpPackets` to `false`:\r\n`\"hmdIMUdmpPackets\":  false,`\r\n\r\n## Final Steps\r\n\r\nEverything is now set up to start playing. \r\n\r\nTo start using Relativty:\r\n- Lay the headset on a flat surface with the front panel facing the ground\r\n- Plug in the Headset.\r\nIt’ll automatically calibrate after a few seconds.\r\n\r\nYou can now run any SteamVR game!\r\n\r\n"
