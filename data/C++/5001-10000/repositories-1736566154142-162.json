Somewhere outside, subsequent rumble starts to build rapidly. After Hjlod regains control of the crawler, she immediately veers away from the noise. \"That vas Nifel-quake, and loud noise was avalanche, or landslide, maybe both. This is not good.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tBy the time you are on your feet, Hjlod has already gathered up numerous supplies and is preparing to open the hatch and dig her way to the surface. She looks at you. \"Nothing to vorry about. Happens all time. Vell, not really. First time this happen, but Hjlod not let you die, probably. I can lead us to settlement not far from here.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tHjlod abruptly stops and glares at you. \"You are fool. You vill certainly die, and you endanger me in process. This is no game, valk only vhere I valk or die.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tEvening and exhaustion approach hand in hand, and as the last sun sets, you're not sure how much farther you can go. \"There!\" Hjlod breaks the silence of hours as she points at the weak flicker of light in the twilight landscape. \"This is good,\" she admits hoarsely as you both stumble toward the light. \"Ve vould have not survived night.\"`\n\t\t\t`\t\"I just vant to thank you.\" Hjlod's gray-blue eyes glitter in the morning light. \"I alvays say Hjlod keep tourist safe. But yesterday you save Hjlod. I vill not forgot, know this.\"`\n\t\t\t`There are no signs of Hjlod when you arrive at the mostly empty spaceport. You spend a few minutes wandering around before you see her heading down the hall toward you. \"Sorry to be late, you vould not believe all paper-vork they had for me. I think they aren't happy about Ice-Crawler.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tYou ask her if she's worried you've been compromised - that you might be working against the Skadenga's best interests. Hjlod shakes her head. \"No. Future is set. Vhat vill, vill be. You are given task to tell us vhere to go, ve go vhere you say. The rest is just noise.`\n\t\t\t`\t\"Sounds like herbalist box. Ondurdis had one long before I vas born. Gave it to liar. It not important though, not Setstokkr.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tHjlod nods. \"Hrithfjall sounds like good place. I vill tell Ondurdis.`\n\t\t\t`\tHjlod nods. \"The Skadenga have alvays been guides, pathfinders. I vill tell Ondurdis.`\n\t\t\t`\t\"Vhen you were gone, thing, or assembly, vas held. Ondurdis called in all Skadenga from all villages across Nifel. You must find transportation for 2,200 folk. That is what Ondurdis told me to tell you.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tHjlod takes a deep, calming breath. \"I call because you are our only hope. They vill not let us leave. They vill not let us be. They vill steal our souls.\" She points a shaky finger at you. \"Take us back to Nifel. All those who are left. Take us home. Ve know the cold vill get us eventually. But better to live on a dying vorld as Skadenga than to live here as nothing.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tHjlod grimaces. \"Once they know you are here, they vill collect us. Come back here in an hour. Any longer than that, and ve vill be gone.\" She slumps down on the ground as you exit the dark, dirty tunnel where the remaining Skadenga cling to their fleeting identity.`\n\t\t\t`\t\"Ve have 52 people that need off this vorld right now.\" Hjlod hesitates a moment, and then adds, \"I know how much you like money. Ve have pooled all our savings together and vill pay you <payment> for this job.\" She grabs a ragged duffle bag and a group gather around her. \"The rest vill meet us at your ship. Ve move now.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tHjlod frowns. \"It's Arnson's family isn't it? I told him he vas too far.\"`\n\t\t\t`\t\"I do not know vhy you sent us to that place. But I am happy to be home. So go, and maybe one day I vill not hate to see you again.\"`\n\t\t\t`A familiar woman is waiting for you outside your ship. Although it's been more than seven years since you've last seen her, you recognize Hjlod instantly. Her eyes are brighter than when last you parted, and she has the same lopsided grin that you remember. \"<first>, I saw your ship landing, and thought I vould say hello.\"`\n\t\t\t`\tShe reaches into her pocket and pulls out a small wooden box, similar to the one you saw displayed at Asgard years ago. \"I have been thinking,\" Hjlod says. \"Maybe all this vas vill of Skade. Maybe you took us to Asgard to make us stronger, to make us better. It is bitter lesson, but I understand it now.\"`\n\tobject \"Sies Upi\"\nplanet \"Sies Upi\"\n\tdescription `Sies Upi is one of the most recently colonized planets of the Gegno Vi. This hot, dry, and harsh world serves as more of an outpost than it does a colony, but nevertheless the Vi have found ways to create manageable living conditions for their settlers.`\n\t\t\"Brocken\"\n\t\t\t`\t\"What part of non-negotiable did you not understand? You're pushing your luck, Captain <last>. I didn't expect you to be such a petty money pincher.\"`\n\t\t\"Shepard\"\n\t\t\t`\tShe gives you a little smile and nods. \"If you come across someone and have difficulty getting them to trust you, try telling them 'Luf e ow, vai, luf e eh.'\"`\n\t\t\t`\tShe gives you a very serious look and nods. \"If you come across any others and have difficulty getting them to trust you, try telling them 'Luf e ow, vai, luf e eh.'\"`\n\t\tship Geocoris \"Vai e Lur\"\n\t\t\t\t`\t\"Uh, luf e ow, vai, luf e eh?\"`\n\t\t\t\t`\t\"No wait!

You'll find Irene at the militia base on <destination> - that's Gunnery Sergeant Irene Brower. I do appreciate this. You'll be paid upon receipt of the package, too, lest you think my appreciation is all I can give.\"`\n\t\t\t`You arrive at the militia base on <destination>, and ask at the gate for Gunnery Sergeant Irene Brower. After a few minutes, a compact young woman with close-cropped blonde hair appears and walks over. When she sees the package at your feet, her face splits into a lopsided grin and her steps quicken. \"I see you've brought me a package; this must be from Torrey! She said she was sending something.\"`\n\t\t\t`\t\tMSGT IRENE BROWER`\n\t\t\t`As you step out of your ship, you spot a familiar face: Irene Brower, the gunnery sergeant you delivered a care package to before the war, though she seems to have master sergeant insignia now. She's on crutches, with what looks like a brand-new prosthetic leg. When she spots you, her pained face brightens. \"Hey, I know you! You brought me that package from Tor before. Thanks!\" She shifts her weight, then winces and shifts it back.`\n\t\tlog \"Minor People\" \"Torrey and Irene\" `Torrey Dupont, an activist, is friends with SMDP militia NCO Irene Brower.

Finally he says, \"What's the bits between a fella's legs gotta do with anything? I already said, 'Ser' is just what decent folk call each other; ain't nothing more to it. Don't matter if you're a guy, gal, or anything else. Hel, I reckon I'd even call an elf 'Ser' if they done me a good turn.`\n\t\t\t`\tThe old man gives you a gruff nod and says, \"Ah, I see. Can be confusing for a newcomer, I s'pose. What's 'tween a fella's legs gots nothing to do with it. Just like I said before, 'Ser' is just what decent folk call each other; ain't nothing more to it.

Hel, I reckon I'd even call an elf 'Ser' if they done me a good turn.`\nplanet Independance\n\tdescription `Independance, originally named for a document of emancipation for an ancient nation on old Earth, became of interest to the Confederated Councils when they began to consider plans for a defense against an invasion. One such plan involved deploying \"cloud bunkers\" into the gas giants of the Outer Rim from which an uprising could be staged against a foreign occupier. Independance, given its fitting name and position near Alvorada, was chosen as the testing site for this project.`\n\tdescription `\tOf the few prototype bunkers that were deployed, none ever survived the surface of Independance; the Councils simply didn't have the technology for such an ambitious project. The official who proposed the plan was shortly shuffled out of the Politburo, and what remained of the bunkers were left quietly in the depths of the gas giant.`\n\tobject Independance\nsystem Currus\n\tlink Currus\n\t\t\"Mian\"\n\t\t\"i' amazin\"          # is amazing (mispronounced)\n            * Care Package 2a has been replaced with a new mission, FW Deep Memorial, a set of missions and events that offers regardless of the player's choices, but which has a branch if Brower dies during the attack.\n\t\t\t`\tHe smiles sadly. \"Skaldgar always had a nose for good folks. Anyways, he told me he had a nephew named Helm who worked at the Norn spaceport.

Hayipp is a grain, similar to your human 'corn,' which creates a wholesome ruddy brown flour when milled. The bread was hearty, yet exquisite.\" You note the wistful look on his face. \"Yur ki is a milk, sourced from livestock we raise. You may have seen some on Newhome; I'm told your kind has a similar animal called 'sheep.' Bread made from yur ki is rich and decadent. It is among my favorite foods to have for breakfast.\" He pauses for a moment and looks a bit downcast. \"Acorn bread was once a rare sight in Hai cuisine. Far too sweet. But, since humans have joined us on our planets, all they want is acorn bread. The high demand has displaced all of the traditional breads that I grew up with from high traffic areas such as this spaceport restaurant. I miss having them easily available.\"`\n\t\t\"Love's Labour Lost\"\n"

          "content": "# Endless Sky\n\nExplore other star systems. Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own...\n\n------\n\nEndless Sky is a sandbox-style space exploration game similar to Elite, Escape Velocity, or Star Control. You start out as the captain of a tiny spaceship and can choose what to do from there. The game includes a major plot line and many minor missions, but you can choose whether you want to play through the plot or strike out on your own as a merchant or bounty hunter or explorer.\n\nSee the [player's manual](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/PlayersManual) for more information, or the [home page](https://endless-sky.github.io/) for screenshots and the occasional blog post.\n\n## Installing the game\n\nOfficial releases of Endless Sky are available as direct downloads from [GitHub](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/releases/latest), on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/404410/Endless_Sky/), on [GOG](https://gog.com/game/endless_sky), and on [Flathub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/io.github.endless_sky.endless_sky). Other package managers may also include the game, though the specific version provided may not be up-to-date.\n\n## System Requirements\n\nEndless Sky has very minimal system requirements, meaning most systems should be able to run the game. The most restrictive requirement is likely that your device must support at least OpenGL 3.\n\n|| Minimum | Recommended |\n|---|----:|----:|\n|RAM | 750 MB | 2 GB |\n|Graphics | OpenGL 3.0 | OpenGL 3.3 |\n|Storage Free | 350 MB | 1.5 GB |\n\n## Building from source\n\nDevelopment is done using [CMake](https://cmake.org) to compile the project. Most popular IDEs are supported through their respective CMake integration. [SCons](https://scons.org/) was the primary build tool up until 0.9.16, and some files and information continue to be available for it.\n\nFor full installation instructions, consult the [Build Instructions](docs/readme-cmake.md) readme.\n\n## Contributing\n\nAs a free and open source game, Endless Sky is the product of many people's work. Contributions of artwork, storylines, and other writing are most in-demand, though there is a loosely defined [roadmap](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/DevelopmentRoadmap). Those who wish to [contribute](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) are encouraged to review the [wiki](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki), and to post in the [community-run Discord](https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx) beforehand. Those who prefer to use Steam can use its [discussion rooms](https://steamcommunity.com/app/404410/discussions/) as well, or GitHub's [discussion zone](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/discussions).\n\nEndless Sky's main discussion and development area was once [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/endless-sky), but due to factors outside our control, it is now inaccessible to new users, and should not be used anymore.\n\n## Licensing\n\nEndless Sky is a free, open source game. The [source code](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/) is available under the GPL v3 license, and all the artwork is either public domain or released under a variety of Creative Commons (and similarly permissive) licenses.

The flamethrower mission will likely bring players to Rust anyway, but it's no longer in the way of the main campaign.\n        * Moving House:\n          * Increased offer rate to 35%, limited source planets to \"near earth\", \"core\" and \"paradise\".\n          * Tied the second part of the chain to the FW chapter break instead of Thule's independence.\n          * The player can now choose to decline the follow-up mission.\n        * Southern Fiance:\n          * Reduced the possible source planets to urban core Syndicate worlds.\n          * Cut all of the follow up missions except for the marriage letter.

(@Quantumshark)\n      * Changed the Marauder Manta weapons-variant ship description to properly describe what new features the variant has. (@warp-core)\n      * Adjusted a conversation branch in \"Remnant: Shattered Light 4\" that was preventing most ships from getting the full conversation. (@justinnhli)\n      * \"Expedition to Hope 2\" now gives clearance to the destination, allowing it to offer if you are hostile with the destination instead of not offering without explanation. (@warp-core)\n      * Old pilots who completed part of the Wanderer campaign will now be properly retroactively granted the Wanderer outfit license. (@warp-core)\n      * The \"Remnant: Expanded Horizons Astral\" job can no longer choose the Deep Space systems as waypoints. (@Quantumshark)\n      * Ssil Vida station no longer loses one of its planet attributes after an event. (@danaris)\n      * Spaceport news intended for occupied Pug worlds no longer appears on uninhabited worlds. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Added the \"minor\" mission tag to a Free Worlds side plot storyline to prevent it from offering at the same time as major storyline missions. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Fixed the \"Remnant: Face to Maw\" missions to properly offer under the expected circumstances. (@Zitchas, @warp-core)\n      * Replaced the \"shield resistance\" attribute (which doesn't do anything) on the Embersylph with \"ion resistance\". (@Quantumshark)\n      * Set the Hai merchant fleets to use the correct government. (@warp-core)\n      * Contacting the Korath Exiles can now properly be deferred and reoffered instead of deferring the mission effectively declining it. (@Hurleveur)\n      * Corrected the offer location on \"Robotic Musical 1\", as it was unable to offer with the location it was given. (@Terin)\n      * Corrected uses of the \"scrambling protection/resistance\" attribute to the proper \"scramble protection/resistance\" attribute. (@warp-core)\n      * Separated the government used for space life near the Gegno to be different to the one used for space life in the Ember Waste to prevent one from unintentionally affecting the other.

(@RisingLeaf)\n      * Player escorts no longer appear as landed on the planet that the player landed on if they themselves could not land on that planet. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Fixed an error with this where landing on planets under certain circumstances, such as when losing mission clearance after landing, could cause no ship to be chosen as the player's flagship, stranding you on the planet. (@danaris, @warp-core)\n      * The autopilot AI no longer attempts to make pointless turn commands when already in the process of jumping. (@Zitchas)\n      * Escorts now properly offload their cargo on every landing. (@flowers9)\n      * Map buttons no longer overlap on smaller screens.

(@warp-core)\n      * The player info UI now only accepts double clicking to open a ship's info if both clicks were on the same ship, instead of allowing clicking on one ship and then clicking on another ship shortly afterward to count as double clicking the second ship. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Trailing whitespace in hails no longer causes hails to overlap with one another. (@flowers9)\n      * The selected ship UI now has the ship name centered with the ship image, and the maximum ship image size has been shrunk so that it doesn't overlap with the ship's name. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * If the player's flagship is a fighter, the travel plan will now be properly drawn with how far the flagship can jump. (@flowers9)\n      * Fixed the new \"fail\" action behavior not working with the \"on enter\" action (@Hurleveur)\n      * Fixed a logic error when checking if a ship is ready to jump that prevented some ships from jumping. (@flowers9)\n      * The amount of thrust provided by engines when you have insufficient resources (e.g. energy, fuel) available to fire them at 100% now correctly scales down the thrust provided by the amount of resources you have. (@flowers9)\n      * Planets no longer launch defense fleets from invalid definitions, which could cause the game to crash. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * The click zones for the descriptions of ships and outfits in the shop are now properly aligned with the description text. (@flowers9)\n      * Ships and outfits without descriptions in the shop will no longer display description click zones. (@warp-core)\n      * Fixed an issue where scanning a ship's cargo or outfits could cause the scan dialog to appear twice. (@warp-core)\n      * Selecting a new system on the map now always clears the system orbit data, instead of only doing so when the newly selected system has been visited. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Switching between two engines that use the same engine flare sprite but at different scales will now properly update the engine sprite scale. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Overlays like the planet labels are no longer stepped while the player is landed. This was causing planet labels to appear in the wrong position when landed. (@tibetiroka)\n      * NPC actions now properly trigger if a ship receives two simultaneous events. (@warp-core)\n      * Disabling and enabling plugins is now properly handled with the new plugin metadata file. (@quyykk)\n      * Long plugin names are now truncated to the appropriate length in the plugins preferences panel. (@warp-core)\n      * Travel plans that become invalid due to any reason (such as by system changes caused by events) are now cleared. (@warp-core)\n      * A valid CargoHold is now always returned when getting planetary storage, preventing segfaults. (@quyykk)\n      * Fixed a race condition that could occur when drawing planet labels, causing them to flicker. (@quyykk)\n      * Corrected the use of SDL_GetPrefPath in Files.cpp. (@quyykk)\n      * Fixed a lambda function that was unnecessarily copying the list of every active ship every frame instead of getting a reference to it. (@tibetiroka, @quyykk)\n  * Game content:\n    * New content:\n      * New mission where you answer a distress call in Korath space. (@UnorderedSigh, @williaji)\n      * More human spaceport news.

(@danaris)\n      * Added more high-end passenger missions to human space. (@Anarchist2)\n    * Mission changes:\n      * Mentioned in the conversation and description of \"Deal Change 2\" that you need to hail the destination planet in order to land. (@bene-dictator)\n      * The player can now ask Tomek for combat advice prior to the first major Free Worlds battle. (@warp-core)\n      * Revised the smuggler arc of the Hai Reveal storyline. (@UnorderedSigh)\n      * Bounty jobs now provide their payment the moment the bounty fleet is destroyed, instead of requiring that the player return to the offer location of the job to receive pay. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Improved the wording in the description of \"FW Bounty 1\". (@mOctave, @EjoThims)\n      * Added the mission destination to the description of \"Remnant: Cognizance 7\". (@lumbar527)\n      * The Heliarch jump drive jobs now use the <payment> text replacement instead of spelling out the payment. (@Arachi-Lover, @tibetiroka)\n      * Removed a sentence that didn't make sense from the description of the secure package delivery job completion dialog. (@ziproot)\n    * Balance:\n      * Added weaponry to some human fighters to fit in the additional hardpoints that they were recently given. (@AvianGeneticist)\n      * Increased the reputation gains with Unfettered sympathizers when doing Unfettered jobs. (@Hurleveur)\n      * Changed the stock Frigate to have two Torpedo Launchers instead of one Torpedo and a Sidewinder, in exchange for less battery power. (@warp-core)\n      * Added a deadline to the pirate occupation spaceport missions to prevent them from being stacked indefinitely. (@lumbar527)\n      * The Quarg in Korath space now receive permanent reputation hits if you attack the Efreti. (@Saugia)\n      * Gave the Dagger +5 engine space and stock A120 Atomic Thrusters to give it more of a niche among the other human fighters. (@Quantumshark)\n      * Gave the Violin Spider +4 weapon space to allow it to equip an anti-missile turret in addition to its gun. (@Hurleveur)\n      * Flattened the thrust scaling of sets of engines as you get bigger engines in a set. (@Quantumshark)\n        * The exact changes depend on the set of engines, but the changes are roughly as follows:\n          * Tiny: +23.0% thrust\n          * Small: +14.3%\n          * Medium: +5.5%\n          * Large: +0.0%\n          * Huge: -5.1%\n        * In other words: small engines have been made stronger while large engines have been made slightly weaker. The result of this is that smaller ships should be generally quicker than they were before while larger ships should either see no change or should be slightly slower.\n        * Afterburners are unchanged.\n      * Reduced the cost of the supercapacitor from 9,000 credits to 1,500, to bring it closer in line with other human batteries while still having a slight \"premium\" for its tiny size. (@Zitchas)\n      * Removed a few ship variants from the pirate raid fleet that had high damage weapons not conducive to disabling their target. (@Zitchas)\n      * The Ka'het Nullifier has been rebalanced to more effectively disable targets by draining their energy. (@beccabunny)\n        * Energy damage from 0 to 3200. This is energy which is immediately removed from the target's batteries on impact.\n        * Ion damage from 150 to 220. This is lingering energy loss that results in about 22,000 energy lost over the course of the next ten seconds after impact.\n        * Scrambling damage from 150 to 10. This causes the Nullifier to have much less of an effect on the target's weapons, instead relying on its much greater energy and ion damage.\n      * Buffed the Ion Cannon's ion and scrambling damage by 20%, from 5 to 6 for each in order to make it a bit more competitive with other weaponry. (@Hurleveur)\n      * Reduced the profitability of commodity trading in Hai space by about 40% by bringing trade prices closer together, as the lack of piracy in Hai space makes it an easy place for trading. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Combined the two Barb variants into a single ship. This effectively just means that the turreted variant of the ship has gained +4 weapon space, and the Proton Gun variant of the ship is no longer sold. These two ships weren't sufficiently differentiated from one another to justify keeping both around. (@Quantumshark)\n      * Reduced the buff to engine space provided to the Marauder Leviathan and Falcon engine variants. (@Quantumshark)\n        * Falcon: +55 to +25 (total of 220 to 190)\n        * Leviathan: +80 to +40 (total of 220 to 180)\n    * Other:\n      * Tweaked the wording of the description of the Vivid Aether planet. (@Zitchas)\n      * Ringworld planets now have a \"ringworld\" attribute for missions to use. (@Quantumshark)\n      * Added a \"frozen\" attribute to various cold and frozen worlds for missions and spaceport news to use. (@dorbarker, @Anarchist2)\n      * The Unfettered Solifuge and Violin Spider are now added to the Unfettered shipyards at the same time as they are added to Unfettered fleets. (@Hurleveur)\n      * Added the \"forest\" attribute to Stormhold and changed its planet sprite in order to better match the planet's description. (@bene-dictator)\n      * Various NPC ships in Free Worlds missions which state that they carry cargo now actually have the cargo you're told they have. (@bene-dictator)\n      * Changed the attitude of various Hai governments toward certain actions that the player takes to better reflect the story. (@Hurleveur)\n        * You no longer gain reputation with the Hai for attacking or destroying Unfettered ships.\n        * You no longer lose reputation with the Unfettered for disabling Unfettered ships.\n        * You now gain 50% more reputation for assisting Hai ships.\n      * Standardized the language used for attribute tooltips. (@tibetiroka)\n      * Renamed the Hai's Railgun to the Skipper Railgun. (@Saugia)\n      * Gave a \"noun\" to the hallucination for use when the ship is scanned. (@warp-core)\n      * Tweaked the limited jump ranges of some systems in Gegno and Rulei space. (@Saugia)\n  * Game mechanics:\n    * New mechanics:\n      * Fighters will now grab a chunk of energy from their carrier's batteries when they deploy if the fighter's energy reserves are not full. Useful for battery-only fighters. (@tibetiroka)\n      * Mission can now have an \"on disabled\" action that triggers when the player's flagship is disabled. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Ships can now be given display names for their model name. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Created new \"cargo scan opacity\" and \"outfit scan opacity\" attributes that increase the time it takes for a scanner to scan your cargo or outfits respectively. (@Quantumshark)\n      * Game actions are now able to take ships from the player. (@Hurleveur)\n      * Fighters in fleets can now be given different personalities than the rest of the fleet. (@Quantumshark)\n      * Using the \"fail\" action with no named mission now only fails the mission that called the action instead of failing every mission with the same name. Explicitly listing the name of the mission will still fail every mission with the same name. (@Amazinite)\n      * Plugins can now have a \"plugin.txt\" metadata file in their root folder that specifies the name of the plugin and its description as shown in the plugins menu in game. (@Beed-git)\n      * Systems can now define the raid fleets that spawn in them or disable all raid fleet spawning, instead of raid fleets only being able to be defined for the government of the system. (@Hurleveur)\n      * Ship images can now be given \"@sw\" sprites that apply a swizzle mask to the ship in game, allowing certain parts of a ship to remain unswizzled while other parts are. (@RisingLeaf)\n      * Weapons can be given a \"fade out\" attribute which causes their projectiles to become more transparent until disappearing at the end of their lifetime. (@RisingLeaf)\n      * New multiplier attributes for a ship's base shields and hull. (@Azure3141)\n      * Created a new \"on destroy\" NPC action that triggers when every ship in the fleet has been destroyed but not captured. This was the behavior of the \"on kill\" action, which has been changed to allow every ship in the fleet to be either destroyed or captured, matching the \"kill\" NPC objective. (@warp-core)\n      * Governments can now fine the player for having an illegal ship. If a ship is illegal, it may be discovered by an outfit scan. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Governments can now define travel restrictions that prevent their fleets from traveling to or from systems or planets that match the restrictions. (@Hurleveur)\n      * Going to the outfitter when you're able to refill your ammo now auto-refills ammo from planetary storage if you have stored ammo on the planet. (@warp-core)\n      * New autoconditions:\n        * \"flagship disabled\" returns 1 if the player's flagship is disabled, 0 otherwise. (@TomGoodIdea)\n        * \"installed plugin: <name>\" returns 1 if a plugin of the given name is installed, 0 otherwise. (@1010Todd, @Hurleveur)\n        * \"roll: <number or condition>\" returns a random number between 0 and the specified number, or between 0 and the value of the given condition if a condition name is provided. (@Amazinite)\n        * \"person destroyed: <name>\" returns 1 if the person ship with the given name has been destroyed, 0 otherwise. (@Hurleveur)\n        * \"flagship bays: <type>\" returns the number of bays of the given type that the player's flagship has. (@TomGoodIdea)\n    * Changed mechanics:\n      * Having more required crew than you have bunks is now an outfitter warning instead of an error that prevents you from leaving. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Redesigned how outfit and cargo scanning works. (@UnorderedSigh)\n        * The scan time is now always 2 seconds at the best and 10 seconds at the worst.\n        * Scan speed now follows a gaussian decay as distance increases.\n        * Scan time increases with cargo hold or outfit space size with the 2/3rd power of the size instead of linearly.\n      * Pirate raid deterrence no longer looks at whether you have ammo in your launchers. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Fleets can now spawn from any section of a ringworld instead of only ever spawning from the same section. (@quyykk)\n      * Cooling is no longer disabled when a ship becomes overheated. (@Quantumshark)\n      * The player now always launches from the same section of the ringworld that they landed on instead of only ever departing from the same section. (@quyykk)\n    * AI:\n      * Ships with only secondary weapons that run out of ammo will now attempt to flee instead of flying straight at their target without any weapons. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Escorts that are capable of cloaking can now cloak on their own without input from the player if they are low on health. (@TomGoodIdea)\n      * Ships with the \"surveillance\" personality will now patrol the system they are in when there are no other ships to scan instead of freezing up and doing nothing. (@tibetiroka)\n  * User interface:\n    * Weapons that use both outfits and fuel as ammunition now properly display the number of shots remaining instead of ignoring the fuel use. (@tibetiroka)\n    * The flagship now has a separate color scheme from friendlies in the HUD overlay. (@warp-core)\n    * Moved the definitions of the ship info hardpoint colors to the interfaces file so that they can be modified without recompiling. (@TomGoodIdea)\n    * Disabling motion blur in the settings now also disables motion blur for the starfield. (@Koranir)\n    * Added support for drawing pointers in the interface game data. (@warp-core)\n    * Increased the saturation of the shields HUD color. (@Quantumshark)\n    * Added a new setting that determines which ships in your fleet will pick up flotsams, if at all. (@OcelotWalrus)\n    * The outfits installed on player ships are now displayed in a list format under all the other ship stats in the shipyard and outfitter, similar to how they're displayed for ships that are sold in the shipyard. (@flowers9)\n    * Changed the \"has no shipyard/outfitter\" color on the shipyard and outfitter map keys to a darker shade of blue to better differentiate it from the \"has shipyard/outfitter\" color. (@flowers9)\n    * Added a \"landing zoom\" UI setting that zooms the camera in or out when landing on or launching from a planet. (@flowers9)\n    * Human engines in the outfitter are now ordered according to the engine set that they come from, from smallest to largest, and listed with steering before thrusters, instead of purely alphabetically. (@warp-core)\n    * The color of a wormhole's link on the map is now also used when that wormhole is a part of the travel plan. (@RisingLeaf, @warp-core)\n    * Increased the amount of motion blur that occurs in the background while hyperspacing. This can be toggled in the settings under the \"extended jump effects\" preference. (@Koranir)\n    * The map can now be opened from the shipyard or outfitter. (@TomGoodIdea)\n    * Externally docked fighters are now drawn in the hail panel when hailing a carrier. (@TomGoodIdea)\n    * The auto-selection of available jobs when you accept one job now moves to the next available job for the destination instead of resetting back to the top of the list of jobs for that destination. (@flowers9)\n    * Added a preference to blink the map mission marker for missions with a deadline more quickly if you have fewer extra days to reach the destination compared to the minimum number of days necessary to reach it. The default behavior is to simply blink based on the number of days until the deadline. (@TomGoodIdea)\n    * The player will now be warned when taking off if they don't have enough cargo space for outfits that are marked as in cargo. (@flowers9, @warp-core)\n    * Buttons on the planet panel when you are landed no longer disappear if you don't have a flagship. (@flowers9)\n    * Mission destination reminder messages are now colored in a new green \"info\" message level. (@RisingLeaf)\n    * Interface bars can now be defined to draw from the top left corner instead of only drawing from the bottom right. (@warp-core)\n    * Added a confirmation dialog to demanding tribute from a planet, to prevent the player accidentally demanding tribute from a planet and ruining their reputation. (@UnorderedSigh)\n    * Non-hyperdrive jumps in the travel plan are now drawn with dashed lines instead of solid ones in the map. (@flowers9)\n    * The save file load panel now scrolls when you use arrow keys to select your pilot and save. (@warp-core)\n    * Planet labels are now much less likely to overlap with one another or with other objects in the system. (@flowers9)\n    * The escort HUD display is now defined by the interfaces file so that it can be modified without recompiling. (@warp-core)\n    * Fullscreen can now be toggled in all panels. (@TomGoodIdea)\n    * The net change in energy and heat when all systems are active is now visible on the energy/heat table for ships when viewed in the outfitter and shipyard. (@mOctave)\n    * The shipyard and outfitter map keys now have a color for denoting systems with parked ships or stored outfits. (@flowers9)\n    * If a planet has a different government from the system it is in, that is now displayed on the planet's detail card in the map. (@TomGoodIdea, @Hurleveur)\n    * Created a new preference to change the format that dates are displayed in. (@a-random-lemurian)\n    * All applicable takeoff warnings are now displayed at the same time instead of only displaying one warning. (@TomGoodIdea, @quyykk)\n    * Improved the behavior of scrolling in the outfitter and shipyard to be smoother and better handle movement with the arrow keys. (@flowers9)\n    * Messages about being unable to land on the target planet now use the \"Highest\" message importance, causing them to be displayed in orange. (@AmbushedRaccoon)\n  * Under the hood:\n    * Refactored part of PlayerInfo::Land to reduce code duplication. (@warp-core)\n    * Selling all your commodities in the trade panel now loops over the commodities that the player owns instead of looping through all commodities in the game and seeing if the player owns them.

(@tibetiroka)\n\nVersion 0.10.0\n  * Breaking changes:\n    * The accompany objective on mission npcs no longer implicitly sets the save objective. Plugin missions that had \"accompany\" but not \"save\" should be changed to include \"save\" if the intention of the mission is that the npcs live (without the bug this time). (@Amazinite, @RisingLeaf)\n  * Big changes:\n    * Added a young alien faction located beyond the core, inhabiting a region of space that is home to long-lost secrets and mysterious lifeforms. (@Saugia, @GefullteTaubenbrust2)\n    * Added a not-so-young alien faction located near the Korath, an advanced race of mantis-like beings that make heavy use of genetic and cybernetic modifications. (@Amazinite, @beccabunny, @Saugia)\n    * A long-standing UI feature has been finished: the job board can now be sorted by various metrics! Jobs can be sorted alphabetically, pay, deadline, and more. (@alextd, @samrocketman)\n    * A long-standing (and annoying) bug has also been fixed: out of system mission cargo and passengers will no longer be teleported to the player's location when loading a save. (Yes, this bug was reported enough over the years that this constitutes a big change.) (@warp-core)\n    * Created a large number of new conditions for content creators to make use of, including the ability to set \"global conditions\" that can be accessed by any save file, as well as a few new places to use them, including allowing individual lines and choices in a conversation to be hidden by conditions.

(@Zitchas)\n    * Hailing a hostile ship shows the hostile hail, offering a bribe shows the cost. (@Hurleveur)\n    * The outfitter only shows one tutorial each time it opens, and tutorials have titles. (@Hurleveur)\n    * Selecting a new system in the mission panel selects the first mission involving that system, instead of looking down from the previously selected mission.

(@Amazinite)\n      * Fixed an instance where the player could be fined for outfits that had been put into their cargo hold but were removed. (@quyykk)\n      * Improved synchronization of the calculation and rendering threads. It turns out the game has always been rendering one frame slower before.

(@quyykk)\n      * The confirmation dialog for deleting a save file now correctly verifies the input against the pilot's name instead of the file name, which isn't visible in-game and may sometimes differ from the pilot's name.

(@roadrunner56)\n      * 25 spare landscape images. (@petervdmeer)\n      * The player can now attempt to ask the Unfettered for help with communicating with the Wanderers. (@Anarchist2)\n      * A new set of missions involving the various Arach houses. (@Arachi-Lover)\n      * New jobs and missions in the Deep region to encourage players to stick around and discover more major storylines there.

(@roadrunner56)\n      * Added a new planet in a system near Nenia to save on and cut down on travel times when dodging the Archon in Nenia. (@Zitchas)\n      * Created a Coalition mining drill used by Coalition mining fleets. (@Arachi-Lover)\n      * Added tiny, small, and medium-sized reverse thrusters for the Hai. (@Hecter94)\n    * Mission changes:\n      * Killing both Arfecta that defend the Wanderer planets now causes hostility with the Wanderers upon landing on any of their planets, not just one specific planet. (@Terin)\n      * The Deep Archaeology and Unfettered first contact missions now contain branches if the player knows about the Pug or Sheragi respectively, before reaching those missions. (@BlazingDiesel)\n      * The Remnant now gifts a Puffin to the player instead of requiring that the player buy one. (@Zitchas)\n      * The Hai first contact mission now describes the wormhole connection to human space in case the player reached the Hai via jump drive. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Reordered the Deep: Remnant missions so that further investigation into the Ember Waste doesn't happen until after Deep: Scientist Rescue. (@Amazinite)\n      * Removed a stopover location that was optional in a Remnant mission. (@Zitchas)\n      * Reworked most pirate jobs to be higher risk but also higher reward. (@Pointedstick)\n      * The \"Hiding in plain sight\" mission now has a deadline. (@Pointedstick, @waterhouse)\n      * Changed some missions to take advantage of the new conversation action behavior. (@Amazinite)\n      * Greatly reduced the threshold on the raid warning mission for players with high pirate attraction fleets from about 50% to about 14%. (@Amazinite)\n      * Ivan in Terminus exploration now gives the player a hint on where to go to continue the storyline in the Deep. (@Amazinite)\n      * Refit the Cosmic Devil to use less Remnant tech. (@Amazinite)\n      * Added additional dialog to \"FW Katya 7\". (@saraswativ23)\n      * Removed a mention of Freya from \"FW Alphas 1.1,\" as she is located somewhere else at that time in the story. (@DownsB)\n      * The Paradise Fortune missions now restore your reputation with the Republic to exactly what it was before the missions should you choose to cooperate with the Navy. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Change the government of some hostile mission NPCs to dummy governments to prevent permanent reputation loss with the main government. (@PeacefulPotato)\n      * Hai jobs now grant a small amount of reputation upon completion, allowing access to Hai-home without the need to fight the Unfettered. (@Terin)\n      * Moved the defer option in \"There Might Be Riots 1\" to an earlier point so that information isn't repeated if the player defers multiple times. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Unwanted Cargo can now trigger anywhere outside Hai space instead of only in human space. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Various minor spaceport missions that did not mention their payments now do. (@Anarchist2)\n      * The Hauler VI mission no longer offers if you don't have any weapons. (@Anarchist2)\n      * The intro mission now mentions the usefulness of buying local maps. (@Hecter94)\n      * Improved the salaries you get during the Free Worlds campaign to better cover the ships you're expected to have at the time. (@Anarchist2)\n      * The final Kestrel mission now displays the thumbnail of the Kestrel you chose. (@Anarchist2)\n      * Increased how much the Coalition pays for Yottrite from 220k per sample to 350k per sample. (@Arachi-Lover)\n      * Updated the prisoner transports in some Free Worlds missions to be equipped with brigs. (@AlbertNewton)\n      * The Remnant missions that ask you to get a copy of Alexandria's archives now make it clear that you keep a copy for yourself. (@Amazinite)\n      * The \"Deep: Remnant\" missions are no longer required to trigger \"Deep: Scientist Rescue\", which is the set of missions that unlocks the Bactrian. (@Amazinite)\n      * Improved the dialog in one of the new Remnant missions to make it more understandable. (@alextd)\n      * Rewrote part of \"FW Hope Recon 1C\" to have the Gunboat join the Oathkeepers should you ask them to surrender. (@jostephd)\n      * The senator in \"FW Senate 1B\" now commends you if you reach the destination in an impossibly short time. (@Hecter94)\n      * The corporate espionage job now has a short deadline, as it is easy to miss the objective and never find the NPC that you're supposed to scan. (@Terin)\n      * Slight wording change in FW Bounty 1 to reduce repeated information. (@Anarchist2)\n    * Balance:\n      * Altered the default equation for when a ship becomes disabled to become continuous. The lowest-hull ships still become disabled at about 45% remaining hull, but the highest-hull ships approach a threshold of 10% hull remaining instead of all ships over 4,500 hull becoming disabled at 15%. This results in most human ships becoming disabled slightly earlier while higher health alien ships become disabled slightly later. (@Ferociousfiend)\n      * Buffed the Heavy Shuttle while increasing its price to make it more of a midpoint between the Shuttle and the Scout or Bounder rather than having a massive price gap between the Shuttle and Heavy Shuttle and the ships mentioned previously. (@Zitchas)\n        * +2 bunks\n        * -20 mass\n        * -0.2 drag\n        * +5 cargo space\n        * +10 outfit space\n        * +6 weapon space\n        * +5 engine space\n        * +15,000 cost\n      * Buffed the cargo and bunk capacities of civilian Coalition ships to make them more appealing compared to when you're likely to reach them. (@Arachi-Lover)\n        * +10% cargo and bunks on Saryd light freighters\n        * +20% cargo and bunks on Saryd heavy freighters\n        * +50% bunks and +10% cargo space on all Kimek ships\n        * +20% cargo space on Arach light freighters\n        * +40% cargo space on Arach heavy freighters\n      * Gave the Sparrow an extra bunk to slightly increase its effectiveness in capturing other interceptors during the early game. (@Terin)\n      * Greatly reduced the required crew and bunks on the Rainmaker so that it's no longer tied with the Gunboat as the highest required crew among human light warships, instead having one of the lowest crew requirements. (@Terin)\n        * 7 -> 3 required crew\n        * 14 -> 7 bunks\n      * Lowered the offer requirements on more lucrative jobs in human space, allowing the player to start running them sooner. (@Terin)\n      * Increased the Lampyrid's number of bunks to match the source material. (@Zitchas)\n      * Archons now ramp up significantly in strength when they feel threatened. (@Zitchas)\n        * 11x normal DPS when threatened\n      * Buffed the Protector. (@Amazinite)\n        * The Protector has long been considered the worst human heavy warship in the game. While some heavy warships should be better than others, the Protector had almost no redeeming factors. These changes seek to make the Protector more of a heavy weapons platform, slow but able to pack a considerable punch when within range.\n        * 6 -> 8 turrets, going from \"a lot\" to \"tied with the most among all heavy warships in the game.\"\n        * +500 shields\n        * +1300 hull\n        * +20 outfit space\n        * +10 weapon space\n      * Rebalanced various human primary weapons. Here are some highlights: (@Amazinite)\n        * Lasers have been the overwhelmingly most popular choice among human primary weapons for years due to their high damage but low firing costs, with blasters seeing little use due to their high energy and heat costs but lower damage. These changes seek to bring all human weapons more in line with one another, making choosing a weapon more a matter of what role you need filled than a matter of which weapon is better than all the rest.\n        * Lasers:\n          * Lasers are a pirate's friend and always will be. Easy to use and great for disabling ships without destroying them, but not necessarily the best at everything.\n          * +33% firing energy and heat\n        * Blasters:\n          * Blasters are the smallest weapons in human space. They are weak but cheap and strong in numbers. Put eight quad blaster turrets on a new Protector and have some fun.\n          * -40% firing energy and heat\n          * +10% shield and hull damage\n        * Cannons:\n          * Cannons are the big guns. Powerful, even in small numbers. The weapons you pull out when you want to punch a hole in something.\n          * +20% shield and hull damage on the Particle Cannon and Proton Gun. The Plasma Cannon has been untouched, as its added heat damage is still rather powerful.\n      * Added an additional Small Heat Shunt to the stock Korath Raider. (@Arachi-Lover)\n      * Rebalanced most engines in the game. Here are some highlights: (@Amazinite)\n        * The goal of this was to improve lesser used engines while also making it so that choosing which engines you use is more a matter of what you're looking for instead of there being one best choice for everything.\n        * Afterburners were made 33% smaller while providing 50% more thrust at 75-80% less fuel, as afterburners have long been considered not worth installing.\n        * The largest ion and plasma engines were made smaller and easier to install, as these engines were so large that it was seldom feasible to use them.\n        * Ion and plasma engines now provide about 20% more thrust and turn, so atomic engines aren't such a no-brainer upgrade.\n        * Buffed the reverse thrust on Remnant thrusters while reducing their forward thrust to compensate, making Remnant engines more the choice for people who enjoy the reverse thrust instead of being incredibly good for almost everything.\n      * Differentiated the Bulk Freighter and Container Transport. (@ravenshining)\n      * Changed Coalition solar panels to use solar heat instead of heat generation. (@Arachi-Lover)\n      * Buffed ion damage. Ionization now causes a ship's weapons to jam in addition to draining the ship's energy, causing ionization to be a damage debuff. The lower a ship's energy capacity and the higher its ionization, the more likely a weapon is to jam when attempting to fire, capping out at 50%. Jammed weapons must reload before attempting to fire again. (@Amazinite)\n      * Rebalanced most battery outfits in the game. Here are some highlights: (@warp-core, @Zitchas)\n        * The goal of this was to make relying on your batteries more viable, as with weaker batteries from past versions, outfitting your ship has almost always been a matter of ensuring your reactor produces enough energy for all your systems. With stronger batteries, getting the best energy reactor possible should be less of a requirement as you can now rely on your energy capacity to get you through short bursts of intense combat. Even going so far as to use nothing but batteries with little to no energy generation should also be a possibility as a cheaper but not as a combat-capable alternative.\n        * Greatly buffed the energy capacity of most battery outfits.\n          * Most dedicated battery outfits have received a 4x buff.\n          * Some outfits that are batteries as a secondary characteristic, such as Korath System Cores or Wanderer Sun reactors, received a 2x buff.\n          * Wanderer Small and Large Biochemical Cells received a 25x and 42.8x buff, respectively.\n        * Greatly reduced the size of the two largest human and Hai batteries to make them more feasible to use.\n        * Cut the cost of dedicated battery outfits in half.\n      * Added an arrival distance to all systems in the game. The arrival distance is equal to the system's habitable distance, capped at the range of [500, 5000]. This causes ships to generally enter the system farther apart from one another and farther from any inhabited planets in the system, improving the ability of a player to pick and choose their fights. (@Zitchas)\n      * Traded some batteries for better engines, weapons, or repairs on Heliarch ships. (@Arachi-Lover)\n      * Slightly adjusted the stats on Scout and Bounder to better fit their size and role. (@Anarchist2)\n        * -100 fuel capacity on the Bounder.\n        * +800 shields on the Scout.\n        * -1 required crew on the Scout.\n    * Graphics:\n      * Completely redid and improved the graphics for all existing stars. (Matteo \"Lead\" M., @ravenshining)\n      * Created various new star graphics, including giant and supergiant variants for all star spectral types. (Matteo \"Lead\" M., @ravenshining)\n      * Created a new planet sprite for Saturn. (@ravenshining)\n      * Remodeled all Navy ships. (@GefullteTaubenbrust2)\n      * Created a new effect for the nuke explosion. (@Karirawri)\n      * Remodeled the nuclear missile, afterburner, asteroid scanner, photovoltaic outfits, Wanderer reactors, shield generators, cooling, and weapons.

Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\nLicense: CC-BY-SA-3.0\n CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE\n LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS LICENSE DOES NOT CREATE AN\n ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS\n INFORMATION ON AN \"AS-IS\" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES\n REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR\n DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.\n .\n License\n .\n THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE\n COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY\n COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS\n AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n .\n BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE\n TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY\n BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS\n CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND\n CONDITIONS.\n .\n 1. Definitions\n .\n a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and\n other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,\n derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a\n literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\n cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be\n recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably\n derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a\n Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\n this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\n work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in\n timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an\n Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n .\n b. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as\n encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\n broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\n in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\n arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\n which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\n with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\n collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\n considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this\n License.\n .\n c. \"Creative Commons Compatible License\" means a license that is listed\n at https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been\n approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this\n License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains\n terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License\n Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing\n of adaptations of works made available under that license under this\n License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same\n License Elements as this License.\n .\n d. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and\n copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or\n other transfer of ownership.\n .\n e. \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license attributes\n as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:\n Attribution, ShareAlike.\n .\n f. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that\n offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n .\n g. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,\n the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work\n or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in\n addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,\n musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim,\n play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or\n expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer\n being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a\n performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the\n organization that transmits the broadcast.\n .\n h. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms\n of this License including without limitation any production in the\n literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or\n form of its expression including digital form, such as a book,\n pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work\n of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a\n choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\n composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are\n assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography;\n a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or\n lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\n expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\n art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\n relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\n performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the\n extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by\n a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise\n considered a literary or artistic work.\n .\n i. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\n respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\n Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\n violation.\n .\n j. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and\n to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or\n process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital\n performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that\n members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a\n place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public\n by any means or process and the communication to the public of the\n performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to\n broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs,\n sounds or images.\n .\n k. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including\n without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\n fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a\n protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic\n medium.\n .\n 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\n limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\n limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\n copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n .\n 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\n Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\n perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\n exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n .\n a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n Collections;\n .\n b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation,\n including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to\n clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made\n to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The\n original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a\n modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n .\n c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated\n in Collections; and,\n .\n d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n .\n e. For the avoidance of doubt:\n .\n i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n .\n ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n of the rights granted under this License; and,\n .\n iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\n collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the\n Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers\n voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise\n by You of the rights granted under this License.\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\n known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\n such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in\n other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly\n granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made\n subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n .\n a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms\n on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of\n the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the\n Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and\n to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You\n Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly\n Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological\n measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the\n Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under\n the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as\n incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection\n apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You\n must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit\n as required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an\n Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n Section 4(c), as requested.\n .\n b. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the\n terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License with\n the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative Commons\n jurisdiction license (either this or a later license version) that\n contains the same License Elements as this License (e.g.,\n Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible\n License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the licenses\n mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If\n you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses\n mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"), you must\n comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the\n following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the URI for,\n the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation You\n Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any\n terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable\n License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to exercise\n the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable\n License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that refer to the\n Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy\n of the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly\n Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Adaptation,\n You may not impose any effective technological measures on the\n Adaptation that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation\n from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the\n terms of the Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the\n Adaptation as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require\n the Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject to\n the terms of the Applicable License.\n .\n c. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or\n Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the\n name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,\n and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party\n or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\n terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party\n or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the\n extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work;\n and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b), in the case of an\n Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation\n (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or\n \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit\n required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable\n manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or\n Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all\n contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as\n part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the\n credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of\n doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the\n purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising\n Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly\n assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the\n Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate,\n of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior\n written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n Parties.\n .\n d. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or\n Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or\n take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be\n prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor\n agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise\n of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to\n make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert,\n as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the\n applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your\n right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations)\n but not otherwise.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\n OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\n KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\n INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,\n WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION\n OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\n LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\n ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS\n BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination\n .\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n survive any termination of this License.\n .\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is\n perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work).\n Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the\n Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at\n any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as\n stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous\n .\n a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection,\n the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same\n terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n .\n b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n .\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n enforceable.\n .\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n .\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with\n respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n .\n f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention\n for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on\n September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright\n Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996\n and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971).\n These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under\n applicable law.\n\nLicense: GPL-2\n Version 2, June 1991\n .\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n .\n Preamble\n .\n The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n your programs, too.\n .\n When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n .\n To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n .\n For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n rights.\n .\n We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n distribute and/or modify the software.\n .\n Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n authors' reputations.\n .\n Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n .\n The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n modification follow.\n .\n GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n .\n 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n .\n Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n .\n 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n along with the Program.\n .\n You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n .\n 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n .\n a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n .\n b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n parties under the terms of this License.\n .\n c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n .\n These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n .\n Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n collective works based on the Program.\n .\n In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n the scope of this License.\n .\n 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n .\n a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n .\n b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n customarily used for software interchange; or,\n .\n c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n received the program in object code or executable form with such\n an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n .\n The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n special exception, the source code distributed need not include\n anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n itself accompanies the executable.\n .\n If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n access to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n .\n 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n parties remain in full compliance.\n .\n 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n the Program or works based on it.\n .\n 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n this License.\n .\n 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n .\n If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n circumstances.\n .\n It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n integrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n impose that choice.\n .\n This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n .\n 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n original copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n .\n 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n address new problems or concerns.\n .\n Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n either of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n Foundation.\n .\n 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n make exceptions for this.

Definitions\n .\n \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\n \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\n \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\n \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n .\n 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n .\n 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n .\n to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;\n to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original work has been modified.\";\n to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n .\n For the avoidance of doubt:\n Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n .\n You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\n Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination\n .\n This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\n Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous\n .\n Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\n The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\n\nLicense: CC0\n The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an \"owner\") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a \"Work\").\n .\n Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works (\"Commons\") that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of others.\n .\n For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the \"Affirmer\"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.\n .\n 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited to, the following:\n .\n the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate a Work;\n moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\n publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness depicted in a Work;\n rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in a Work;\n database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof, including any amended or successor version of such directive); and\n other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.\n .\n 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the \"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\n .\n 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.\n .\n No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.\n Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\n Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.\n Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.\n\nLicense: CC-BY-2.0\n THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (\"CCPL\" OR \"LICENSE\"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n .\n BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n .\n 1. Definitions\n .\n \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.\n \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.\n \"Licensor\" means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n \"Original Author\" means the individual or entity who created the Work.\n \"Work\" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.\n \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\n .\n 2. Fair Use Rights.

License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n .\n to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;\n to create and reproduce Derivative Works;\n to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.\n .\n For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:\n Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n 4.

You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement.

If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.\n If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author\"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.

Earn money by trading, carrying passengers, or completing missions. Use your earnings to buy a better ship or to upgrade the weapons and engines on your current one. Blow up pirates. Take sides in a civil war. Or leave human space behind and hope to find some friendly aliens whose culture is more civilized than your own.\n\nFor keyboard controls, click the \"Preferences\" button on the title screen. You can pause and return to the title screen at any point in the game by pressing <escape>.\n\nMost of the controls should be self\\-explanatory. Your ship has no reverse thrusters, so as with a real spacecraft, the only way to slow down is to turn your ship around and accelerate in the opposite direction from your current heading. To assist with some tricky maneuvers, your ship has an autopilot which engages when you press 'L' to land or 'J' to enter hyperspace; the autopilot disengages if you press any of the movement keys. The autopilot will also automatically aim your ship if you are firing a weapon and have a target selected.\n\nFor a manual and other information, visit https://endless\\-sky.github.io\n\nWhen run from the command line, if a resource directory is not specified, the program will check to see if the current directory contains directories named \"data\" and \"images\" and files named \"keys.txt\" and \"credits.txt\"; if so it will read resources from the current directory. Otherwise it will use /usr/local/share/games/endless\\-sky if it exists, or /usr/share/games/endless\\-sky/ otherwise.\n\n.SH OPTIONS\n.IP \\fB\\-h,\\ \\-\\-help\nprints a short help message.\n\n.IP \\fB\\-v,\\ \\-\\-version\nprints the software version.\n\n.IP \\fB\\-t,\\ \\-\\-talk\nreads a data file from STDIN and looks for a \"conversation\" node at the root level (i.e. not indentated).

bugs and making some other small improvements.</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>The biggest change this release is the removal of the \"hold fire\" command, added in 0.10.9, because of bugs associated with it that could not be adequately resolved prior to this release.</li>\n          <li>We hope to have addressed those issues for the next release in a few months.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>This release brings one new feature:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>The addition of the \"silent jumps\" and \"silent scans\" attributes, which allow ships to jump and scan without playing any sounds, not even the default ones.</li>\n        </ul>\n        <p>Some other changes are:</p>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Particularly large capture defense values on some outfits were reduced, to work better with changes to capturing mechanics in 0.10.9.</li>\n          <li>Fixes and improvements to various Incipias, Remnant, and Successor missions.</li>\n          <li>Updated landing messages

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\n    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"
