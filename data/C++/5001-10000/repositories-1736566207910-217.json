Please use `Platform.resourceDir` instead.\n\n`PlotView.plotColors` is deprecated ([#4678](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4678)). Please use `plotColor` instead.\n\nAs part of version reforming, `Main.scVersionPostfix` has been deprecated ([#4706](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4706)).  Please use `Main.scVersionTweak` instead\n\n`Object.asInt` is deprecated ([#4089](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4089)). Please use `Object.asInteger` instead.\n\n### Class library: Fixed\n__Breaking change__: Fixed an issue with `Signal:hammingWindow` using incorrect coefficients. `Signal:hammingWindow_old` can be used for previous behaviour ([#4324](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4324))\n\n__Breaking change__: `Color:asHSV` could sometimes return NaN -- grayscale colors returned NaN hue, and black returned NaN hue and saturation. Zero values are now returned in these cases, as is the standard ([#4369](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4369))\n\nFixed an issue where NamedControl would erroneously convert `name` to a String in some cases ([#4761](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4761)).\n\nFixed an issue with copying Ndef ([#4690](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4690))\n\nFixed an issue where `Document.initAction` would fail to run in some cases ([#4582](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4582))\n\nFixed an issue with NodeProxy bundling ([#4461](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4461))\n\nFixed a bug in `Ndef:asCode` to correctly handle the default `fadeTime` ([#4721](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4721), [#4695](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4695))\n\nFixed a bug involving fadeTime and `Ndef:copy` ([#4701](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4701))\n\nFixed issues with resampling in `Plotter` ([#4223](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4223))\n\nFixed a duplicate node ID error in `NodeProxy:xset` ([#4512](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4512))\n\nFixed an issue where changing the number of channels or rate of a `NodeProxy` would not free the old bus in time ([#4493](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4493))\n\nFixed an issue with `Plotter` resampling of domain given fixed `Array:series` method ([#4510](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4510))\n\nFixed a UnitTest for `TestTempoClock` ([#4334](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4334))\n\nFixed an issue where `typeView` wasn't updated in NdefGUI ([#4056](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4056))\n\nFixed an issue where `findRegexp` would return incorrectly when given an empty string  ([#4241](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4241))\n\nFix for Score examples and `Platform.defaultTempDir` on OSX ([#4221](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4221))\n\nFixed `Plotter` domain and superpose behavior ([#4082](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4082))\n\nFix `FunctionDef:argumentString` handling of varArgs ([#4085](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4085))\n\nFixed several issues with `SoundFile:cue` behaviour ([#3728](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3728))\n\nFixed an issue where `Image` would not support a filename as an argument ([#3949](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3949))\n\nFixed UnitTests for `Event` to reset between tests ([#3961](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3961))\n\nFixed an issue where `NodeProxy` would use the wrong release shape in some cases ([#3776](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3776))\n\nFixed an issue with `Menu.insertAction` not invoking properly ([#3871](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3871))\n\nFixed an issue with `UnitTest` where `runAll` could be inherited by individual tests ([#4722](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4722))\n\n### IDE & SCDoc: Added\nHelp Browser now supports executing code regions ([#3904](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3904))\n\n### IDE & SCDoc: Changed\nsc-ide is now built as a static library ([#4628](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4628))\n\nImproved a number of style issues in the Help Browser ([#3881](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3881))\n\n### IDE & SCDoc: Fixed\nFixed an issue where SCDoc might segfault on deep node trees during tests ([#4713](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4713))\n\nFix for an issue on Windows where the IDE would appear to lock during launch in some cases due to an IPC issue between IDE and sclang ([#4646](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4646))\n\nFixed an issue with code execution in the Help Browser where comments contained brackets ([#4548](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4548))\n\nFixed an issue where copying a theme would crash the IDE if the new theme was not yet saved ([#4146](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4146))\n\nFixed a number of deprecations in Qt ([#4649](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4649))\n\nFixed a number of rendering warnings from SCDoc ([#4265](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4265))\n\n3.10.4 (2020-01-16)\n===================\n\nXcode 11 is now supported ([#4611](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4611)).\n\nMinimum supported Boost version is now 1.66.0 ([#4611](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4611)). Boost 1.71 is also now supported ([#4612](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4612)).\n\nsupernova would sometimes return malformed `/done` OSC messages over TCP due to a concurrency issue. This has been fixed ([#4435](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4435)).\n\nOn macOS, Cmd+Q causes a segmentation fault in sclang. This is a regression from old behavior, where Cmd+Q is simply ignored. This has been fixed ([#4533](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4533)).\n\nFixed a mistake where `Recorder` would get its default file extension from `server.recHeaderFormat` rather than its own `recHeaderFormat` ([#4550](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4550)).\n\nThe `NodeProxy` `filter` role now respects `fadeTime` ([#4278](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4278)).\n\nSome sequences of IDE actions involving editor splits (such as removing a split and then recompiling the class library) can lead to an eventual IDE crash. These have been fixed ([#4645](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4645)).\n\nOn macOS, Cmd+Q used to quit both the IDE and interpreter, but it regressed and only the interpreter would quit. This has been fixed ([#4300](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4300)).\n\n3.10.3 (2019-08-30)\n===================\n\nGeneral: Fixed\n-----\n\nFor people compiling with musl libc, some build errors have been fixed ([#4535](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4535)).\n\nscsynth and supernova: Changed\n-------\n\n**Breaking change:** scsynth had a security issue where it listens to 0.0.0.0 by default. For most users, this is undesirable behavior since it allows anyone on your local network to send messages to scsynth! This default has been changed to 127.0.0.1 ([#4516](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4516)). To change it back (e.g. for networked server/client setups), use `-B 0.0.0.0` at the command line or `server.options.bindAddress = \"0.0.0.0\"`.\n\nscsynth and supernova: Fixed\n-----\n\nOn Windows, scsynth was not able to select separate input and output devices. Since many audio drivers present inputs and outputs as separate devices, this caused major blocking issues for anyone using Windows with an external sound card. This has been fixed ([#4475](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4475)).\n\nFixed a supernova compilation issue on Boost 1.67 ([#4447](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4447)).\n\nFixed server hangs happening in plugins employing SequencedCmd ([#4456](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4456)).\n\nUGens: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed an initialization issue for the `trig` input to `Convolution2` ([#4341](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4341)).\n\nsclang: Added\n-----\n\nsclang and the IDE can now be compiled without QtWebEngine -- just set `SC_USE_QTWEBENGINE=OFF` at the `cmake` stage ([#4328](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4328)).\n\nsclang: Fixed\n-----\n\nThe `mouseWheelAction` of `View` erroneously reported `xDelta` and `yDelta` to be 0 in some cases. This is fixed ([#4423](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4423)).\n\nFixed incorrect mathematics in `SimpleNumber:series` ([#4454](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4454)).\n\nFixed a harmless but annoying warning in when running `HelpBrowser.instance` in sclang without the IDE ([#4488](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4488)).\n\nClass library: Added\n-----\n\nThe `-B` command-line flag to scsynth was missing a frontend in `ServerOptions`. This has been fixed by introducing `ServerOptions:bindAddress` ([#4516](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4516)).\n\nAdd `Platform.hasQtWebEngine` to query whether sclang was compiled with QtWebEngine support ([#4523](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4523)).\n\nClass library: Fixed\n-----\n\nFix issues when using a regular `Buffer` (that is, not a `LocalBuf`) for FFT ([#4050](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4050)).\n\nLots of small issues in `Plotter` were fixed, especially related to the `domain` and `domainSpec` arguments ([4082](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4082)).\n\nWhen changing the source of an input to a `NodeProxy`, discontinuities can happen even when smooth crossfading is requested. This has been fixed ([#4296](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4296)).\n\n`ProxyMixer` no longer assumes the `ProxySpace` it is using to be the current environment ([#4339](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4339)).\n\nThe default recordings directory on Windows was the somewhat redundant `My Documents\\SuperCollider\\SuperCollider\\Recordings`. The additional `SuperCollider` subdirectory has been removed ([#4420](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4420)).\n\nIn Events where `strum` is set, the releases of notes was erroneously done in reverse order. This is fixed ([#4406](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4406)).\n\nFix `EnvirGui` always creating a `SkipJack` due to incorrect logic concerning the `makeSkip` flag ([#4376](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4376)).\n\n`SkipJack` would not remove itself properly when stopped by its stopTest. This is fixed ([#4376](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4376)).\n\nFixed class library compilation issues on Qt-less sclang installations ([#4219](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4219)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed crashes trying to run multiple IDEs at once, and a related error when attempting to run `HelpBrowser:instance` in sclang while an IDE help browser is open ([#4267](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4267)).\n\nOn macOS, Cmd+Q in the IDE would quit the interpeter but not the IDE. This is a regression from old behavior where the IDE was quit entirely. This has been fixed ([#4300](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4300)).\n\nSince 3.10, the help browser would execute code twice when selected. This has been fixed ([#4390](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4390)).\n\nFix footnotes adding unwanted line breaks in SCDoc ([#4365](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4365)).\n\n\n3.10.2 (2019-02-08)\n===================\n\nDue to immature development status and lack of cross-platform compatibility, **MainMenu is no longer created by default** ([#4285](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4285)). It can be re-enabled by running `MainMenu.initBuiltInMenus` (add this to your startup file to permanently re-enable). The API for MainMenu is subject to change in the future.\n\nMainMenu consumes less resources and no longer causes a gradual memory leak ([#3870](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3870)).\n\nFix SCIDE missing an icon on some Linux desktop environments ([#4269](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4269)).\n\nFixed incorrect parsing of strings containing `\\\"` and single-quote symbols containing `\\'` in class library files ([#4255](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4255)).\n\nFixed language-side issues when using FFT UGens on a regular Buffer rather than a LocalBuf ([#4050](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4050)).\n\nAdded `TempoClock:isRunning` method ([#4254](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4254)).\n\nFixed some compiler warnings ([#4275](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4275), [#4274](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4274)).\n\n3.10.1 (2019-01-17)\n===================\n\nFixed an infinite hang in `SerialPort.devices` affecting macOS ([#4180](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4180)).\n\nFixed `ServerOptions` producing eight channels instead of two channels when explicitly setting `numOutputBusChannels` or `numInputBusChannels` ([#4251](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4251)).\n\nFixed a build issue on OpenBSD ([#4203](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4203)).\n\nFixed `/b_fill`, which was broken in supernova ([#4188](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4188)).\n\nFixed incorrect latency compensation in PortAudio driver ([#4210](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4210)).\n\nThe `CheckBadValues` UGen incorrectly recognized zero as a bad value on Windows. This has been fixed ([#4240](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4240)).\n\nFixed `crtscts` flag in `SerialPort.new`, which broke in 3.10 ([#4191](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4191)).\n\nFixed lack of `backgroundImage` support for `Slider2D` ([#3952](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3952)).\n\nFixed incorrect behavior of `String:asSecs` ([#3819](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3819)).\n\n`0X0` is an illegal hexadecimal literal in sclang, but SCIDE and SCDoc highlighted such strings as if they were correct. They have been updated ([#4170](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4170)).\n\nFixed weird colors in SCIDE when changing from other themes to the \"classic\" theme ([#4161](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4161)).\n\n3.10.0 (2018-11-24)\n=========================\n\nContributors to this release: adcxyz, bagong, brianlheim, dkmayer, dmorgan-github, dyfer, g-roma,\ngeoffroymontel, gusano, hardiksingh-rathore, htor, jamshark70, jpburstrom, LFSaw, lnihlen, lvm,\nmarkwheeler, mhetrick, miczac, muellmusik, nilninull, novadeviator, orbsmiv, patrickdupuis, paum3,\nprko, redFrik, sbl, scztt, sensestage, shimpe, simonvanderveldt, smiarx, smrg-lm, snappizz,\nsonoro1234, telephon, tem44, widp, Xon77, and many others.\n\nKnown issues\n------------\n\n- FileDialog can hang — currently we are only able to reproduce on KDE, but other OS's could be affected ([#3807](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3807)).\n- On Windows and Linux, running code with Ctrl+Enter in the help browser (not the editor) only evaluates the current line ([#3989](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3989)).\n- QtWebEngine, a hard dependency of SCLang and SCIDE, is difficult or impossible to install in some environments ([#4010](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/4010)). Work is underway to make it an optional component, but this will not happen in time for 3.10.\n\nGeneral: Added\n-----\n\nA `NO_X11` option has been added to the build system so that server plugins requiring an X server such as MouseX can be omitted ([#3738](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3738)).\n\nGeneral: Changed\n-------\n\nsclang and scide have long been stuck with Qt 5.5 due to Qt dropping QtWebKit for QtWebEngine. They have been upgraded for compatibility with Qt 5.7+. We recommend using the most recent version of Qt. The impacts of this change include:\n\n- sclang and scide now build on Visual Studio 2015 and later. (Previously, Windows users had to obtain the now-ancient Visual Studio 2013.)\n- UserView now supports Retina/HiDPI display.\n- A somewhat different build process on Linux. See the README.\n\nThe minimum required version is now CMake 3.5 instead of CMake 2.8 ([#3656](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3656)).\n\nscel (the emacs package) is now a submodule ([#3519](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3519)).\n\nGeneral: Fixed\n-----\n\nMany issues with Unicode paths on Windows were fixed in 3.9. A few remaining cases involving sound files remained, and are now fixed ([#3720](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3720)):\n\n- supernova's sound file backend, buffer manager, and plugin loading\n- NRT mode in scsynth\n- `/b_read` family of commands in scsynth\n- `SoundFileView` in the sclang GUI\n\nFixed a build failure with the CMake option `SYSTEM_YAMLCPP=on` ([#3558](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3558)).\n\nFixed a misleading deprecation warning when `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is set to the home directory in Linux ([#3613](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3613)).\n\nFixed `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` incorrectly defaulting to `/usr/local/` on macOS under some conditions ([#4043](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4043)).\n\nscsynth and supernova: Added\n-----\n\nsupernova now has latency compensation ([#3790](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3790)).\n\nscsynth and supernova: Fixed\n-----\n\nscsynth's latency compensation had a math error that ended up doubling the latency. It is fixed now ([#3790](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3790)).\n\nFor consistency with scsynth, supernova no longer requires the final argument to `/b_allocReadChannel` ([#3826](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3826)).\n\nFixed a missing newline in some of supernova's error messages ([#3897](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3897)).\n\nFixed errors in supernova's `/s_getn` ([#3893](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3893)).\n\nFix supernova's response to `/g_queryTree` so it matches scsynth ([#3221](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3221)).\n\nUGens: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed clicks in Convolution2L ([#3687](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3687)).\n\nsclang: Added\n-----\n\nMenus are now supported in the Qt GUI. See help files for `Menu`, `MenuAction`, `ToolBar`, and `MainMenu` ([#2504](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2504)).\n\nAdded wrappers for over 100 special mathematical functions (gamma function, Bessel functions, elliptic integrals, etc.) from the Boost library ([#3672](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3672)).\n\nSerialPort now works on Windows ([#3809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3809)).\n\n`FileDialog` and `Dialog` now support a \"path\" argument that specifies a default directory when the dialog appears ([#3508](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3508)).\n\n`QTreeView` has a new method: `setColumnWidth` ([#3560](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3560)).\n\nsclang: Changed\n-------\n\n**Breaking change:** `Float:asString` now always produces a decimal point, so `3.0.asString` is now `\"3.0\"` instead of `\"3\"` ([#3585](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3585)).\n\n**Breaking change:** The `server` argument has changed to `target` in `Function:asBuffer`, `Function:loadToFloatArray`, and `Function:plot`, and now allows spawning the plotting synth relative to a group or node rather than just a server ([#3088](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3088)).\n\n**Breaking change:** `File:mkdir` now returns a Boolean indicating whether the operation was successful. Previously, it returned the File object ([#3635](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3635)).\n\nScrollbars now always appear for ScrollView on Linux an Windows, as a temporary workaround for a very odd dependency on the use of the scroll wheel ([#3686](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3686)).\n\nsclang: Removed\n-------\n\nRemoved some unused Qt dependencies from the build system ([#3472](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3472)).\n\nsclang: Fixed\n-----\n\n**Breaking change:** Fixed a long-standing math error in `SimpleNumber:expexp` ([#3786](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3786)).\n\nFixed extreme CPU usage of sclang when built without Qt ([#3772](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3772)).\n\nOn Windows, the directory where extensions were installed was accidentally changed in 3.9. It has been reverted ([#3751](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3751)).\n\nFixed a crash when calling `File.copy` when the destination exists ([#3633](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3633)).\n\nFixed two `Array:lace` issues: a crash when any element is an empty array, and an error when no length argument is provided and any element is not an array ([#3716](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3716)).\n\nFixed conditions where `Integer:forBy` can cause sclang to freeze when the step size is 0 or a floating point value with an absolute value less than 1 ([#3804](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3804)).\n\nFixed some incorrect output in `FunctionDef:dumpByteCodes` ([#3803](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3803)).\n\nFixed `Node:release` getting stuck on negative release times, which are now equivalent to 0 ([#3741](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3741)).\n\nFixed `==` on `Signal` objects randomly returning the wrong result ([#3970](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3970)).\n\nClass library: Added\n-----\n\n`UnitTest.passVerbosity` allows changing the verbosity of test failure reports. See the `UnitTest` help file for more information ([#3615](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3615)).\n\nAdded new UGen methods `.snap` and `.softRound` ([#3429](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3429/files)).\n\n`Node:query` has a new `action` argument, allowing specification of a callback function ([#3701](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3701)).\n\n`.degrad` and `.raddeg` are now implemented for UGens ([#3821](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3821)).\n\nClass library: Changed\n-------\n\nThe default behavior of `SerialPort.devices` pattern matching has been improved to match a wider variety of devices on macOS and Linux ([#3809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3809)).\n\nInternal calls to `.interpret` have been removed from `Color.fromHexString` and `History.unformatTime`, improving both performance and security ([#3527](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3527)).\n\nClass library: Deprecated\n----------\n\n`SerialPort.cleanupAll` is deprecated ([#3809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3809)).\n\nProviding an integer index for `SerialPort.new` is deprecated ([#3809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3809)).\n\nClass library: Fixed\n-----\n\n`BufWr.ar` no longer allows its input signals to be control rate, which caused the server to read from garbage memory ([#3749](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3749)).\n\n`Buffer:query` returned incorrect results if multiple query messages are sent at once. This has been fixed ([#3645](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3645)).\n\nFixed fragilities in path joining methods such as `+/+`, `withTrailingSlash`, and `withoutTrailingSlash` ([#3634](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3634)).\n\nFixed bugs when certain pattern classes are passed in 0 as the number of repeats ([#3603](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3603)).\n\nFixed `Event.addEventType` ignoring the `parentEvent` argument ([#3736](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3736)).\n\nFixed `Pkey` being skipped because the default number of repeats is `nil` instead of `inf` ([#3724](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3724)).\n\nFixed some harmless but annoying errors about extensions of nonexistent classes when sclang is built without Qt ([#3770](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3770)).\n\n`ProxySpace:linkDoc` was broken — switching documents did not actually change ProxySpaces. This is fixed now ([#3764](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3764)).\n\n`Recorder:prepareForRecord` produced an error if the recordings path does not exist. It now makes the directory if it doesn't exist ([#3788](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3788)).\n\nFixed bugs when providing multiple paths in `ServerOptions:ugensPluginPath` ([#3754](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3754)).\n\nFixed `HelpBrowser` (the class, not the IDE help browser) being unusable since it didn't trigger rendering of help files when links are clicked ([#3832](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3832)).\n\nFixed some bugs in `EnvGate`: throwing an error when `fadeTime` is a constant rather than a UGen input, and `i_level` not behaving as documented ([#3797](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3797)).\n\nFixed occasional hangs when rebooting supernova ([#3848](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3848)).\n\nFixed confusing user feedback with the \"Check for updates\" button in the quarks GUI ([#3986](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3986)).\n\n`Buffer` methods ensure that the buffer number in outbound OSC messages is an integer ([#3907](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3907)). This fixes errors in supernova, which is stricter than scsynth about the buffer number type.\n\nFixed confusing user feedback with the \"Check for updates\" button in the quarks GUI ([#3986](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3986)).\n\nFixed missing default arguments in `fold2`, `wrap2`, and `excess` methods of `Collection` for consistency with `SimpleNumber` ([#4037](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4037)).\n\nFixed incorrect template matching behavior in `OSCFunc` and related functionality ([#4027](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4027)).\n\nFixed \"Message 'extension' not understood\" preventing `Image` from working ([#3728](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3949)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Added\n-----\n\nThe IDE has a prettier default theme ([#4025](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4025)). The old theme still exists as \"classic.\"\n\nThe IDE now properly highlights scale degree literals like `4s` ([#4032](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4032)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Changed\n-------\n\nThe IDE has a prettier default theme ([#4025](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4025)). The old theme still exists as \"classic.\"\n\nThe IDE now has a unified look across all platforms, and its color scheme adapts to match the editor theme ([#3950](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3950)).\n\nThe SCDoc TOC and menubar have been redesigned again ([#3831](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3831)).\n\nVarious tweaks to the appearance of the IDE: nicer tabs ([#3992](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3992)), better border colors ([#4022](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/4022)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Fixed\n-----\n\nWhen starting the IDE, detached docklet sometimes spawn as unresponsive. This has been fixed ([#3660](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3660)).\n\nSyntax colors in the help browser now match the IDE ([#3883](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3883)).\n\nOnly one preference window can be open at a time now ([#3988](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3988)).\n\nFixed tabs reversing in order when restoring a session ([#3942](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3942)).\n\n3.9.3 (2018-04-07)\n==================\n\nContributors to this release: brianlheim, mneilsen, patrickdupuis, telephon\n\nGeneral: Fixed\n-----\n\nIt is now possible to build the project using a system install of yaml-cpp. Previously the `SYSTEM_YAMLCPP` CMake option was broken ([#3557](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3557)).\n\nImprovements to documentation on writing and designing classes ([#3605](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3605)).\n\nsclang: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed a regression from 3.8 to 3.9 that prevented the tilde character from being expanded to the user's home directory during class library compilation ([#3646](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3646)).\n\nClass library: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed an issue with handling of ranges in `RangeSlider:setSpan` and `:setDeviation` ([#3620](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3620)).\n\nFixed a regression in `Score`'s multichannel expansion from 3.9.1 to 3.9.2 ([#3608](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pulls/3608)).\n\n3.9.2 (2018-03-23)\n==================\n\nContributors to this release: adcxyz, brianlheim, davidgranstrom, jamshark70, patrickdupuis, snappizz, telephon, vivid-synth\n\nGeneral: Fixed\n-----\n\nImprovements to various documentation pages ([#3587](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3587), [#3526](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3526))\n\nFixed CMake configuration errors that prevented successfully building on Windows when the project path contains spaces ([#3525](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3525)).\n\nUGens: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed PSinGrain growing in amplitude after it was supposed to finish ([#3494](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3494)).\n\nsclang: Fixed\n-----\n\nsclang now creates a configuration directory on startup, rather than waiting for it to be created by another action. This step is skipped if sclang is run as a standalone (-a) or if a language config file is specified with the -l option ([#3577](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3577)).\n\n`SequenceableCollection:unixCmd` now allows respects `PATH` instead of strictly requiring the executable path ([#3501](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3501)).\n\nClass library: Added\n-----\n\nA new method, `Platform:killProcessByID`, was added ([#3499](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3499)).\n\nClass library: Changed\n-------\n\n`LanguageConfig:store` throws an error if it fails to write ([#3577](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3577)).\n\nClass library: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed an off-by-one error in a warning message for `Server:clientID_` ([#3487](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3487)).\n\n`Event:isRest` now returns true if the event's `\\isRest` entry is `true`. This usage was backported from 3.8 and is deprecated ([#3521](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3521)).\n\n`Server` now tries to recover in the case of a lost connection between client and server ([#3486](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3486)).\n\nFixed an error when producing a `Score` containing an `Event` with a multichannel `timingOffset` ([#3544](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3544)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Fixed\n-----\n\nThe help browser table of contents popout no longer has redundant \"table of contents\" text ([#3576](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3576)).\n\n3.9.1 (2018-02-05)\n==================\n\nContributors to this release: antonhornquist, aspiers, brianlheim, cappelnord, florian-grond, gusano, jamshark70, patrickdupuis, redFrik, shimpe, telephon\n\nGeneral: Added\n--------------\n\nIntroduced Guard integration that allows sclang UnitTests to be automatically rerun whenever a file changes ([#3369](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3369)).\n\nBleeding-edge builds are now uploaded for Windows. See the Windows README for details ([#3441](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3441)).\n\nGeneral: Fixed\n--------------\n\nDebugging information is improved when building a Windows installer package ([#3464](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3464)).\n\nscsynth and supernova: Fixed\n----------------------------\n\nsupernova only looked for plugins in a `plugins/` subfolder of the provided extensions directory. This has been fixed to be consistent with scsynth ([#3433](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3433)).\n\nUGens: Fixed\n------------\n\nFixed `Index`, `IndexL`, `FoldIndex`, `WrapIndex`, `IndexInBetween`, and `DetectIndex` incorrectly downsampling audio-rate index arguments ([#3436](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3436)).\n\nsclang: Fixed\n-------------\n\nThe GUI class library folders were installed even when building sclang without Qt, resulting in unbound primitives. This has been fixed ([#3456](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3456)).\n\nSome default class library directories had to be manually created. sclang will now create them for you if they don't exist ([#3469](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3469)).\n\nClass library: Fixed\n--------------------\n\nFixed a Routine not being properly terminated when running `CmdPeriod.run` (or hitting an equivalent shortcut) when a `Server:plotTree` window is open ([#3423](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3423)).\n\nFixed `LevelIndicator:style_` doing nothing and printing the warning `Qt: WARNING: Do not know how to use an instance of class 'Meta_QLevelIndicatorStyle'` ([#3398](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3398)).\n\nFixed `Git.checkForGit` returning `nil` ([#3445](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3445)).\n\nThe SynthDef compiler optimizes `a + b.neg` to `a - b`, but other UGens that depend on `b.neg` would also be incorrectly removed in some cases. This has been fixed ([#3437](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3437)).\n\nIn 3.9.0, the `group` key broke in the \"grain\" event type. This has been fixed ([#3483](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3483)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Added\n------------------\n\nNew IDE themes have been introduced for the editor and post window: Solarized, Solarized Dark, and Dracula ([#3412](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3412), [#3410](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3410)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Changed\n--------------------\n\nSet the default font in the IDE for macOS to Monaco, instead of the rather silly non-monospace font that has been the SC default for over a decade ([#3404](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3404)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Fixed\n------------------\n\nFixed duplicate SCIDE icons in GNOME, and fixed the SCIDE icon looking wrong ([#3380](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3380)).\n\nFixed SCDoc breaking with page titles containing a single quote character ([#3301](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3301)).\n\nFixed an error due to lack of input sanitization when trying to open help (Cmd+D/Ctrl+D) or references (Cmd+U/Ctrl+U) on text containing a double quote character ([#3277](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3277)).\n\n3.9.0 (2018-01-13)\n======================\n\nWe are proud to announce the arrival of SuperCollider 3.9.0! Apologies\nfor being so far behind schedule; we hope the improvements you'll find here\nwill more than make up for it. In 3.9.0, determined contributors have fixed\nsome of SuperCollider's major cross-platform compatibility demons, addressed\nlongstanding issues in the IDE and language, and added new features and bugfixes\nacross the board.\n\nMany thanks to all who contributed to this release: adcxyz, awson, bagong,\nbrianlheim, cappelnord, carlocapocasa, crucialfelix, danstowell, defaultxr,\ndyfer, elifieldsteel, gagnonlg, ghost, gusano, jamshark70, jd-m, jleben,\njmckernon, joshpar, jreus, LFSaw, llloret, LucaDanieli, Magicking,\nmiguel-negrao, muellmusik, patrickdupuis, porres, privong, redFrik, samaaron,\nscztt, simdax, smoge, smrg-lm, snappizz, telephon, thormagnusson,\ntiagomoraismorgado88, timsutton, vivid-synth, vividsnow, yurivict, and many\nmore in the SC community who helped in ways other than participation on GitHub.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nThe IDE server status display turns yellow after a few seconds when opening `s.makeGui`.  This does not cause any usability issues ([#3310](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3310)).\n\nOnly the first pages of the HTML files produced by SCDoc are printed in web browsers ([#3395](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3395)).\n\nThe help browser does not remember the last position open in a document when navigating through history, and just jumps to the top of the file ([#3396](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3396)).\n\nSupernova loads plugins from \"Extensions/plugins\" rather than \"Extensions\" ([#3391](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3391)).\n\n`LevelIndicator.style()` is broken, which leads to confusing warning messages ([#3398](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3398)).\n\n`File.copy` crashes the interpreter if the destination file exists ([#3401](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3401)).\n\nOn Windows, SerialPort is not available ([#1008](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/1008)).\n\nOn Windows, Supernova is not available.\n\nOn Windows, the command-line sclang interpreter is not available.\n\nGeneral: Added\n-----\n\nscvim has seen numerous enhancements now that an actively maintained fork has been merged in ([scvim #11](https://github.com/supercollider/scvim/pull/11)).\n\nSuperCollider can now be built on Windows using the MSYS2 toolchain, thanks in particular to @awson and @bagong. ([PortAudio #1](https://github.com/supercollider/portaudio/pull/1), [HIDAPI #5](https://github.com/supercollider/hidapi/pull/5), [#2473](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2473), [#2704](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2704))\n\nSuperCollider can now be built on FreeBSD, thanks to @shamazmazum and @yurivict ([#2834](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2834), [#2704](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2704), [HIDAPI #8](https://github.com/supercollider/hidapi/pull/8), [#3131](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3131)).\n\nDetailed documentation on creating macOS standalone applications with SuperCollider has been added, thanks to @adcxyz ([#2881](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2881)).\n\nSupport for multiple sclang clients connecting to the same server is greatly improved, thanks to @adcxyz.\n\nA CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md and CONTRIBUTING.md have been added to the repository ([#3001](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3001)).\n\nHigher-resolution raster versions of the SC cube logo have been added to the top-level `icons/` directory ([#3023](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3023)), and a retina-friendly `.icns` file ([#3060](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3060)).\n\nGeneral: Changed\n-------\n\n**Breaking change:** `sc_gcd` in the plugin interface now conforms to `gcd(n, 0) == n` instead of `gcd(n, 0) == abs(n)` ([#2980](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2980)). This also affects the method `SimpleNumber:gcd`.\n\nThe macOS plist file now shows the full version number for both the Version String and Shortened Version String ([#2487](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2487)).\n\nGeneral: Fixed\n-----\n\nA typo in the build system prevented the `-msse` compiler flag from being properly set for gcc and clang ([#2623](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2623)). This *may* fix subnormal number issues in scsynth that some users have been experiencing.\n\nFixed a fontification break in scel when too many classes are defined ([#2508](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2508)).\n\nFixed build failures on FreeBSD ([#3126](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3126)), GCC 7 ([#3226](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3226)), and newer versions of Boost ([#3227](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3227)).\n\n\nscsynth and supernova: Added\n-----\n\nscsynth and supernova now support a `/version` command, which responds with a message of the form `/version.reply program major minor patch branch commit` ([#2546](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2546), [#2598](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2598)). See the Server Command Reference for full details.\n\nscsynth and supernova: Changed\n-------\n\nOn macOS, if scsynth's input and output devices have mismatched sample rates, an error is thrown and the server does not boot. Setting the number of input channels to 0 (`-i 0` on the command line and `s.options.numInputBusChannels = 0` in sclang) now bypasses this error ([#2610](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2610)).\n\nDisabled Nagle's algorithm for TCP communication in scsynth ([#2613](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2613)). Nagle's algorithm increases bandwidth at the cost of delay, which is undesirable in the context of SuperCollider. Both supernova and sclang have it turned off.\n\nscsynth and supernova: Fixed\n-----\n\nThe `/b_read` and `/b_readChannel` messages experienced intermittent failures to read sound files, most notably affecting `Buffer.cueSoundFile`. This has been fixed ([#2793](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2793)).\n\n\nUGens: Added\n-----\n\nA new UGen, `Sanitize`, replaces infinities, NaNs, and subnormals with another signal, zero by default ([#2561](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2561)).\n\nThe `doneAction` argument to DetectSilence can now be modulated ([#2379](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2379)).\n\nUnaryOpUGen now supports the bitwise not operator `bitNot` ([#2381](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2381)). It used to simply fail silently.\n\nUGens: Changed\n-------\n\n**Breaking change:** The application binary interface (ABI) for server plugins has changed ([#3129](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3129)). This has an important impact: **plugin binaries compiled for SuperCollider 3.8 will not work with SuperCollider 3.9** and vice versa. Please recompile your plugins.\n\n**Breaking change:** `FOS.ar` with control-rate coefficient inputs incorrectly initialized its coefficients at 0 and ramped to the correct values over the first control period. This has been fixed ([#2658](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2658)). To restore old behavior, multiply each coefficient by `Line.ar(0, 1, ControlDur.ir)`.\n\nUGens: Deprecated\n----------\n\n`Donce`, a demand-rate UGen with no identifiable purpose, is deprecated ([#2564](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2562)). It was most likely used in the production of electronic donce music.\n\nUGens: Fixed\n-----\n\nA number of UGens were discovered to have serious initialization bugs ([#2333](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2333)) where the UGen would output an initial sample of garbage memory. This can create audio explosions if the buggy UGen's output is fed into certain filter UGens like LPF or Delay1. These bugs have been fixed, affecting:\n\n- BeatTrack\n- BeatTrack2\n- CoinGate\n- Convolution\n- Convolution2\n- Convolution2L\n- Convolution3\n- DetectSilence\n- DiskIn\n- DiskOut\n- IFFT\n- KeyTrack\n- LFGauss\n- PartConv\n- PV_JensenAndersen\n- PV_HainsworthFoote\n- RunningSum\n- StereoConvolution2L\n- Unpack1FFT\n\nFixed a bug with `TGrains` ignoring the `amp` parameter ([#2809](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2809)).\n\n`Dibrown` no longer ignores the `length` argument ([#2654](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2654)).\n\n`Pitch` no longer ignores the `median` argument ([#2953](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2953)).\n\nFixed a build error in DiskIOUGens on Windows ([#3015](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3015)).\n\nFixed `AudioControl` outputting garbage data if a bus is mapped to it but nothing is playing to the bus ([#3063](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3063)).\n\nFixed incorrect math in `PanAz.ar` with audio-rate input signal and position ([3139](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3139)).\n\n\nsclang: Added\n-----\n\nRegression tests for the sclang lexer, parser, and compiler have been added ([#2751](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2751)). This will make it easier to make fixes to these components in the future.\n\nsclang: Changed\n-------\n\n**Breaking change:** sclang's nestable multiline comments had some mistakes. In particular, sometimes sclang's lexer would incorrectly process overlapping combinations of `/*` and `*/`, so e.g. `*/*/` would be interpreted like `*/ /* */`. This has been fixed ([#2625](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2625)).\n\nThe maximum number of MIDI ports has been increased from 16 to 128 ([#2494](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2494)).\n\nThe startup post \"NumPrimitives = #\" is reworded to \"Found # primitives\" ([#3139](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3139)).\n\nsclang: Removed\n-------\n\nRemoved some unhelpful memory addresses from call stack output in error printing ([#2951](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2951)).\n\nRemoved some accidentally retained debug posts when the language starts up ([#3135](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3135)).\n\nsclang: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed help files failing to open on Windows if the user's name contains a non-ASCII character ([#2861](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2861)).\n\nFixed non-ASCII characters breaking the Visual Studio debugger ([#2861](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2861)).\n\nFixed a crash in `Object:perform` when the selector is an Array whose first element is not a Symbol, e.g. `0.perform([0])` ([#2617](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2617)).\n\n`thisProcess.nowExecutingPath` is no longer corrupted by `Routine:stop` ([#2620](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2620)).\n\n`TextView:selectedString_` now works when the selection size is zero ([#2648](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2648)).\n\nFixed a crash when a method or class/instance variable is named \"`none`\" ([#2638](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2638)).\n\nExceptions occurring in primitives no longer print unavoidable error messages even when wrapped in try-catch ([#2876](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2876)).\n\nFixed a crash when `Dictionary:keysValuesArrayDo` is called with `nil` as an argument ([#2799](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2799)).\n\nFixed `WebView:onLinkActivated` handler failing to fire ([#3003](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3003)).\n\nFixed GUI objects failing to display when launched from the `action` of `unixCmd` ([#3009](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3009)). You will still need `{ }.defer`, however.\n\nFixed `QImage:getColor` always returning zero for the green channel ([#3190](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3190)).\n\n\nClass library: Added\n-----\n\nThe UnitTest quark has been incorporated into the main repository ([#3168](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3168)).\n\nAdded a `rewind` method to `CollStream` ([#2400](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2400)).\n\nAdded four new class methods to `File` for convenience: `readAllString`, `readAllSignal`, `readAllStringHTML`, `readAllStringRTF` ([#2410](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2410)).\n\n`Pstep` accepts an array as a duration argument ([#2511](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2511)).\n\nHelp files originating from extensions now display a plaque for visibility ([#2449](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2449)).\n\nFor consistency with other `Platform` class methods, `Platform.recordingsDir` may be used instead of `thisProcess.platform.recordingsDir` ([#2877](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2877)).\n\n`SequenceableCollection` has two new instance methods: `flatten2` and `flatBelow` ([#2527](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2527)). Additionally, `flatten` is faster now.\n\nThe `~callback` function is now available for all `Event` types instead of just \"on\" events ([#2376](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2376)).\n\nEvent types now include a `parentEvent`, which provides default values. ([#3021](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3021)).\n\nNew aliases for done actions, e.g. `Done.freeSelf == 2`, are introduced for better readability ([#2616](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2616)). See the `Done` helpfile for details.\n\nA new class, `Recorder`, allows recording independently of the `Server` object ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).\n\n`SequenceableCollection:reduce` supports an adverb argument ([#2863](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2863)).\n\nA `recordingsDir` method has been added directly to `Platform`, which transparently calls `thisProcess.platform.recordingsDir` ([#2877](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2877)).\n\n`View:-resizeToBounds`, `View:-resizeToHint`, and `Window:-resizeToHint` were added to make it easier to force Views and Windows to automatically resize ([#2865](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2865)).\n\n`Maybe` now supports collection methods `at`, `atAll`, `put`, `putAll`, `add`, `addAll` ([#2437](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2437)).\n\n`BusPlug:-play` can now accept a `Bus` object ([#2845](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2845)).\n\nBreadcrumb links in helpfiles now have separate links for each node in the hierarchy, and pages with multiple categories have separators between the categories ([#2916](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2916)).\n\n`SoundFile:*openWrite` now takes additional parameters ([#2926](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2926)).\n\nTwo new instance methods were added to Symbol: `isBinaryOp` and `isIdentifier` ([#2955](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2955)).\n\nAdded three convenience methods: `View:resizeToBounds`, `View:resizeToHint`, and `Window:resizeToHint` ([#2865](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2865)).\n\nAdded `Collection:asEvent` for easy conversion to an `Event` ([#2871](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2871)).\n\n`DeprecatedError` now shows you the file path of the deprecated method ([#3039](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3039)).\n\nAdded two new methods to `SimpleNumber`: `snap` and `softRound` ([#3160](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3160)).\n\n`ReadableNodeIDAllocator` offers a new optional replacement for `PowerOfTwoAllocator` that assigns node IDs in a way more readable to humans when working with multiclient setups ([#3179](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3179)).\n\nA new \"booted\" stage has been added to Server objects that have been booted but\nmay not be running yet, accessible via `Server:hasBooted` and\n`Server.allBootedServers`\n([#3275](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3275)).\n\nClass library: Changed\n-------\n\n**Breaking change:** Rests in the patterns system have been restructured ([#2802](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2802)). Instead of using the `isRest` event property, events are considered rests if one of their properties is a `Rest` object. You must use instances of `Rest` rather than the rest class itself -- use of `Rest` instead of `Rest()` is now deprecated.\n\n**Breaking change:** Fixed `Dictionary:==` only comparing the values of the two dictionaries, not the keys ([#2737](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2737)).\n\n**Breaking change:** Fixed a mistake where `Pen.quadCurveTo` used the primitive for a cubic Bézier instead of quadratic ([#2553](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2553)). To restore the old behavior, change `Pen.quadCurveTo` to `Pen.curveTo`.\n\n**Breaking change:** The convenience instance methods `Env:kr` and `Env:ar` had the arguments `mul` and `add` renamed to `levelScale` and `levelBias`, since they don't behave like typical `mul` and `add` arguments ([#2866](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2866)).\n\n`Collection:processRest` returns the processed collection rather than the original ([#2497](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2497)).\n\nThe maximum number of MIDI ports has been increased ([#2494](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2494)).\n\nAttempting to use a control-rate signal as an input to `Hasher.ar` now results in an error ([#2589](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2589)).\n\nThe \"Cleaning up temp synthdefs...\" post message is suppressed if there is nothing to clean up ([#2629](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2629)).\n\nTo match `Out` and `ReplaceOut`, `LocalOut` and `XOut` now correctly validate their input, checking for a non-zero number of channels ([#2659](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2657), [#2659](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2659)).\n\nThe argument to `Pattern:fin` has a default of 1 for consistency with `Object:fin` ([#2480](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2840/files)).\n\n`Complex:reciprocal` is faster now ([#2890](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2890)).\n\n`Buffer:write` takes floating point arguments, truncating them to integers ([#2547](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2547)).\n\nConversion methods among collection types has been improved and documented ([#2871](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2871)).\n\n`clientID` is now protected from being changed while the server is running\n([#3275](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3275)).\n\nClass library: Deprecated\n----------\n\n`OSCresponder`, `OSCresponderNode`, and `OSCpathResponder` now emit deprecation messages, and will be removed after at least a year ([#2870](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2870)). Use `OSCFunc` or `OSCdef` instead.\n\n`Speech` is deprecated ([#2424](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2424)), and will be removed in 3.10. The rationale is that its audio output is independent of the server (severely limiting use in compositions), it depends on a proprietary macOS API with no prospect of cross-platform compatibility, and it is too niche to justify inclusion in the core library.\n\nThe WiiMote classes (`WiiMote`, `WiiMoteIRObject`, `WiiCalibrationInfo`, `WiiMoteGUI`, `WiiRemoteGUI`, `WiiNunchukGUI`) are deprecated ([#2698](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2698)). They never reached a stable state and have gone unmaintained and unused for years.\n\n`AudioIn` is deprecated and will be removed in some future version ([#2482](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2482)). It was provided only for backward compatibility with SC2, so its deprecation is long overdue. Use `SoundIn` instead.\n\n`SplayZ` has been deprecated for a long time, but it's finally on the \"official\" deprecation track and will be removed in 3.10 ([#2631](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2631)). Use `SplayAz` instead.\n\n`TDuty_old` has been deprecated for a long time, but it now emits a warning and will be removed in 3.10 ([#2677](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2677)). Use `TDuty` instead.\n\n`Watcher` is an old alias for `SkipJack` provided for backward compatibility. It is officially deprecated and will be removed in 3.10 ([#2700](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2700)).\n\n`Server:recordNode` is deprecated. Use `Recorder:recordNode` instead (e.g. `s.recorder.recordNode`) ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).\n\nThe `Server.set` class variable is deprecated. Use `Server.all` instead ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).\n\n`SimpleNumber:quantize` is deprecated. Use `SimpleNumber:snap` instead ([#3160](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3160)).\n\n`Server:userSpecifiedClientID` is deprecated. Use `Server:clientID` instead\n([#3275](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3275)).\n\nClass library: Removed\n-------\n\nRemoved non-functional stub methods and classes related to Image: the classes ImageFilter and ImageKernel, and the Image instance methods lockFocus, unlockFocus, applyFilters, filters, filteredWith, addFilter, removeFilter, flatten, invert, crop, applyKernel ([#2867](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2867)).\n\n`Module`, an unmaintained and unused class for serialization of Synths, has been moved to a quark ([#2703](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2703)).\n\nRemoved the `openHelpFile` instance methods of `Object`, `String`, `Method`, and `Quark`. These methods have been deprecated since 3.8.\n\nRemoved `String:openTextFile` and `Symbol:openTextFile`. Use `String:openDocument` and `Symbol:openTextFile` instead. These methods have been deprecated since 3.8.\n\nClass library: Fixed\n-----\n\nA number of instance methods in `Buffer` and `Bus` did not properly check to see if the object has already been freed, and would act on buffer #0 or bus #0 (which is especially dangerous for the `free` instance method). They now safeguard against this case and throw errors ([#2936](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2936), [#2960](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2960), [#2993](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2993)).\n\nThe `useRanger` option in `EnvirGui` broke in 3.7. This has been fixed ([#2418](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2418)).\n\n`IdentityDictionary` methods `collect`, `select`, and `reject` retain references to the `parent` and `proto` objects ([#2507](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2507)).\n\nOn Linux, some MIDI methods created method override warnings. These have been silenced ([#2717](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2717)).\n\nThe \"key\" argument to `Pn` was not properly set on the first repeat. This has been fixed ([#2833](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2833)).\n\nFixed errors when using a DragSource inside a CompositeView object ([#2804](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2804)).\n\nFixed an interpreter crash when defining a SynthDef whose name is too long ([#2821](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2821)). More specifically, the inputs to `UnixFILE:putPascalString` and `CollStream:putPascalString` are now validated.\n\nServer crashes are better handled by the interpreter ([#2453](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2453)).\n\nThe time display and the \"start recording\", \"pause recording\", and \"stop recording\" menu items now cooperate better with running `Server:record`, `Server:pauseRecording`, and `Server:stopRecording` ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).\n\n`Server:makeGui` and `Server:makeWindow` broke in 3.8 — the fields in the windows went blank. They are working again ([#2422](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2422)).\n\nA timing error with `NodeProxy:-clear` was fixed ([#2845](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2845)).\n\n`SoundFileView` correctly displays its grid and does not draw the grid on top of the selection box ([#2872](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2872)).\n\nThe macOS plist file now shows the full version number for both the Version String and Shortened Version String ([#2487](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2487)).\n\nFixed instances of accidentally silencing error messages caused by neglecting to call `Object:primitiveFailed` ([#2908](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2908)).\n\nPatched the possibility of inconsistent `TempoClock` state when the tempo is set via `setTempoAtSec` ([#2078](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2078)).\n\nFixed memory spikes when using `MIDIFunc.sysex` with a large `srcID` ([#3005](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3005)).\n\nFixed spaces sometimes being rendered as `%20` in links in SCDoc ([#3033](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3033)).\n\nFixed `Function:plot` showing an empty graph if the server wasn't booted when the method was invoked ([#3047](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3047)).\n\nFixed blatant errors in `Collection:asAssociations` and `Collection:asPairs` where elements were dropped ([#3101](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3101)).\n\nFixed bugs in `NodeProxy` when using external servers ([#3103](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3103)).\n\n`History` now outputs a correct timestamp on Windows ([#3045](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3045)).\n\nFixed Volume control failing to be persistent when rebooting the server ([#3125](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3125)).\n\nFixed `SimpleNumber:asTimeString` producing nonsensical results with the \"precision\" argument ([#3166](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3166)).\n\n`Server:clientID` can now be changed, allowing multiple clients connect to the same server ([#3178](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3178)).\n\nHistory and HistoryGui have been cleaned up\n([#3267](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3267)).\n\nFixed duplicate node IDs involving `Server.initTree`\n([#3265](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3265)).\n\nFixed supernova crashing when too many controls are used\n([#3196](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3196)).\n\n`Volume` now respects lag time when it is instantiated or destroyed\n([#3332](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3332)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Added\n-----\n\nEntries in the Documents docklet can be reordered, and document tabs will automatically reorder to reflect this ([#2555](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2555)).\n\n\"Edit > Preferences > Editor > Display\" has a new option that allows replacing tabs with a dropdown whose items are alphabetically ordered ([#2555](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2555)). This makes navigation easier in some performance contexts.\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Changed\n-------\n\nServer actions, which were previously in the \"Language\" menu, have been moved out to their own \"Server\" menu ([#3049](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3049)).\n\nChanged \"occurrences\" to \"matches\" in the status bar in the Find and Replace features ([#2702](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2702)).\n\nMany minor improvements were made to the look and feel of the documentation ([#2944](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2944), [#2945](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2945), [#2947](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2947), [#2948](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2948), [#2967](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2967), [#3006](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3006), [#3022](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3022), [#3025](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3025), [#3034](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3034), [#3175](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3175), [#3346](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3346)).\n\nIDE & SCDoc: Fixed\n-----\n\nFixed SCDoc refusing to index any further documents if one document has a malformed `copymethod::` command ([#3050](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3050)).\n\nSome Linux systems had unreadable font colors in the autocomplete tooltips. This has been (finally) fixed ([#2672](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2762)).\n\nFixed a bug where `Document:selectedString_` had no effect ([#2849](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2849)).\n\nNew tabs are now inserted to the right of the current tab instead of all the way at the end ([#3053](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3053)).\n\nThe help browser now has keyboard shortcuts for navigating back and forward ([#3056](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3056)). These shortcuts are OS-dependent and given to us by [Qt](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5.9/qkeysequence.html#standard-shortcuts).\n\nFixed the \"Find in page...\" feature in the help viewer skipping every other occurrence ([#2903](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2903)).\n\nFixed HTML checkboxes appearing in the upper left of the help viewer ([#3028](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/3028)).\n\nFixed the right-click menu for the tabs appearing in the wrong place in macOS ([#3042](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/3042)).\n\n# [3.8.0](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/tree/3.8.0) (2016-09-23)\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/compare/3.7.2...3.8.0)\n\n##  API change\n\n- Increase the default number of audio buses from 128 to 1024\n  [#2239](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2239) by [vivid-synth](https://github.com/vivid-synth)\n- server plugins: Unify panning behavior of granular ugens\n  [#2136](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2136) by [snappizz](https://github.com/snappizz)\n- scsynth: commandline option  (-B) to bind to specific address\n  [#2095](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2095) by [llloret](https://github.com/llloret)\n- PathName has potentially superfluous methods\n  [#1909](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/1909) by [telephon](https://github.com/telephon)\n- class library: sound file view -

Changelog](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/compare/Version-3.7.1...Version-3.7.2)\n\nThis patch release fixes the Windows including MIDI. HID is still not quite working on Windows. Many thanks to: @bagong and @llloret\n\nSC VIM is now a git submodule. This affects mainly developers. VIM support can be installed as per the documentation - nothing has changed in how you use it.  We changed this in 3.7.2 as well as on master (3.8 development) so that switching back and forth between branches wouldn't be super annoying.\n\n**Fixes:**\n\n- Midi not working on Windows [\\#1922](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/1922)\n- Windows: opening SC via system registered document types faulty [\\#2022](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2022)\n- HIDdef.element forwards arguments incorrectly [\\#2090](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/issues/2090)\n\n**Closed Pull Requests**\n\n- midi: make midi work in Windows [\\#2009](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2009) ([llloret](https://github.com/llloret))\n- Classlib: Fix HIDdef.element arg list passed to super.element [\\#2105](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2105) ([jamshark70](https://github.com/jamshark70))\n- Fix build on debian, add -fPIC to TLSF target [\\#2031](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2031) ([danstowell](https://github.com/danstowell))\n- Update linux readme, add missing dependency [\\#2030](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2030) ([danstowell](https://github.com/danstowell))\n- editor: windows: fix double click when app already open [\\#2029](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2029) ([llloret](https://github.com/llloret))\n- nsis: windows: add path information [\\#2028](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2028) ([llloret](https://github.com/llloret))\n- Convert scvim to submodule, on 3.7 branch [\\#2025](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2025) ([danstowell](https://github.com/danstowell))\n- lang: Not wait for keystroke when exiting [\\#2012](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2012) ([llloret](https://github.com/llloret))\n- Windows Readme: tiny enhancements [\\#2006](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/pull/2006) ([bagong](https://github.com/bagong))\n- Make sure NodeProxy generates unique name.

If someone has been harmed or offended, it is our responsibility to listen carefully and respectfully, and do our best to right the wrong.\n\nAlthough this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, colour, immigration status, education level, size, family status, religion, sexual orientation, class, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including discrimination against participants with disabilities.\n\nWe are aware that the definitions and examples for diversity and discrimination have a strong cultural bias and are likely to change over time. They mirror the sensitivities of the SuperCollider community at the time of writing. We welcome suggestions as to how to extend our understanding of discrimination and exclusivism.\n\n## Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship\n\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase free and open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\n\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\n\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming and friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n\n### The SuperCollider community strives to be:\n\n* Friendly and patient.\n* Welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.\n* Considerate: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.\n* Respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.\n* Understanding of differences of opinion: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The strength of our community comes from its diversity. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.\n\n## Expected Behavior\n\n* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n* Attempt collaboration before conflict.\n* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n\n### Self-Promotion\n\n* You are invited to use the SuperCollider mailing lists and forums to share your own projects and events, commercial or noncommercial, that directly involve SuperCollider. Posting your artistic projects is specifically encouraged.\n* You may also share news of projects and events that are only topically related to SuperCollider, provided that they are noncommercial.\n* Avoid using the community as a platform to advertise commercial products that lack direct connections to the software.\n* Self-promotion postings should be in courteous volumes and preferably include good descriptions.\n\n## Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, culturally appropriative, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant in our community online, at all related events and in one-on-one communications carried out in the context of community business. Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\nHarassment includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* Harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, regional discrimination, political or religious affiliation\n* Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment\n* Deliberate misgendering. This includes deadnaming or persistently using a pronoun that does not correctly reflect a person’s gender identity. You must address people by the name they give you when not addressing them by their username or handle\n* Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop\n* Inappropriate depictions of violence (including presentation slides)\n* Threats of violence, both physical and psychological\n* Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm\n* Deliberate intimidation\n* Stalking or following\n* Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes\n* Sustained disruption of discussion\n* Unwelcome sexual attention, including gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour\n* Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others\n* Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease\n* Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect others from intentional abuse\n* Publication of non-harassing private communication\n\nThe SuperCollider community prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:\n* ‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’\n* Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”\n* Refusal to explain or debate social justice concepts\n* Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions\n\n## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n\n## If You Witness or Are Subject to Unacceptable Behavior\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n\n## Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify one of the event or community organizers with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\n\n## Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues—online and in-person—as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\n\n## License and attribution\n\nThe SuperCollider Code of Conduct is distributed under a [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

It consists of:\n\n- **scsynth**, a real-time audio server with hundreds of unit generators (\"UGens\") for audio analysis, synthesis, and processing\n- **supernova**, an alternative server to scsynth with support for parallel DSP on multi-core processors\n- **sclang**, an interpreted programming language that controls the servers\n- **scide**, an editing environment for sclang with an integrated help system\n\nsclang comes with its own package manager, called Quarks. scsynth and supernova both support third-party plugins via C and C++ APIs.\n\nSuperCollider is written in C++17 using several third-party libraries, including Qt and Boost. It can be used on Windows, macOS, a variety of Linux and BSD distributions, Raspberry Pi, and BeagleBone Black.\n\nInstall\n-------\n\nmacOS and Windows builds for stable releases are provided at our [downloads page][downloads page].

Connect an ethernet cable from the network router to the BBB\n2. Insert the SD card and USB soundcard.\n3. Connect USB power from a 5V@1A power supply\n\n### Step 2: Update the system, install required libraries\n\nssh from your laptop by opening a terminal and typing:\n\n    ssh debian@beaglebone # default password is temppwd\n    sudo passwd debian # change password\n    sudo /opt/scripts/tools/grow_partition.sh # expand file system. skip if you are running on the emmc\n    sudo reboot # and log in again with ssh\n\n    # log in again with ssh\n    ssh debian@beaglebone\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get upgrade\n    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n    sudo apt-get install libsamplerate0-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libavahi-client-dev libreadline-dev \\\n        libncurses5-dev libfftw3-dev libudev-dev cmake git build-essential python-dev alsa-utils cpufrequtils\n\n### Step 3: Compile, install and configure jackd (no d-bus)\n\n    cd ~ # or cd into the directory where you'd like to build jack2\n    git clone https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2 --depth 1\n    cd jack2\n    ./waf configure --alsa --libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/\n    ./waf build\n    sudo ./waf install\n    sudo ldconfig\n    cd ..\n    rm -rf jack2\n    sudo sh -c \"echo @audio - memlock 256000 >> /etc/security/limits.conf\"\n    sudo sh -c \"echo @audio - rtprio 75 >> /etc/security/limits.conf\"\n\n    # `-dhw:1` is normally the USB soundcard. `sudo aplay -l` will list available devices.\n    # Use `nano ~/.jackdrc` to edit jack settings.\n    echo /usr/local/bin/jackd -P75 -p16 -dalsa -dhw:1 -r44100 -p1024 -n3 > ~/.jackdrc\n\n    exit # and ssh in again to make the limits.conf settings work\n\n### Step 4: Compile and install SuperCollider\n\n    cd ~ # or cd into the directory where you'd like to clone and build supercollider\n    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider.git\n    cd supercollider\n    mkdir build && cd build\n    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DNATIVE=ON -DSC_IDE=OFF -DNO_X11=ON \\\n        -DSC_QT=OFF -DSC_EL=OFF -DSC_VIM=ON ..\n    cmake --build . --config Release --target all\n    sudo cmake --build . --config Release --target install\n    sudo ldconfig\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo use SuperCollider, just open a terminal and execute `sclang`.\n\n**Done!** See below for other usage notes and tips.\n\nsc3-plugins\n-----------\n\nTo compile and install sc3-plugins, follow the instructions in the [sc3-plugins README](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins).\n\nAutostart\n---------\n\nTo automatically run SuperCollider code at system boot:\n\n    cat >~/autostart.sh <<EOF\n    #!/bin/bash\n    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n    export DISPLAY=:0.0\n    sleep 10\n    sclang mycode.scd\n    EOF\n\n    chmod +x ~/autostart.sh\n    crontab -e # and add the following line to the end:\n        @reboot cd /home/pi && ./autostart.sh\n\n    nano ~/mycode.scd # And add your code inside a waitForBoot. For example:\n        s.waitForBoot{ {SinOsc.ar([400, 404])}.play }\n\n    sudo reboot # the sound should start after a few seconds\n\nLogin with ssh and run `pkill jackd; pkill sclang; pkill scsynth` to stop the sound.\n\nBenchmarks\n----------\n\nThese are rough benchmark tests. The server should be booted and jackd running with settings: `-P75 -p1024 -n3 -r44100`\n\nAlso make sure to power the bbb through the barrel jack (else the CPU is capped at 300mhz - check with\n`cpufreq-info`). Also for comparison it is important to set CPU scaling to 'performance' with:\n\n    sudo cpufreq-set --governor performance\n\nStart sclang and run:\n\n    s.boot\n    {1000000.do{2.5.sqrt}}.bench // ~1.9 on a bb-black, ~2.6 with lxqt on a bb-black\n    a= {Mix(50.collect{RLPF.ar(SinOsc.ar)});DC.ar(0)}.play\n    s.avgCPU // run a few times. ~47% on a bb-black\n    a.free\n\nThe default CPU scaling mode 'ondemand' seem to work quite good on the BBB and will save battery without losing much\nin performance.\n\nNotes and Troubleshooting\n-------------------------\n\n* An easy way to burn the img.xy file (no need to unpack) to an SD card is to use [etcher](http://etcher.io).\n* Type `alsamixer` in terminal and then F6. Adjust the mic and speaker volume with the arrow keys. Press escape to\n  exit.\n* If compilation stops or returns an error the compiler might just have run out of memory. Try to reboot and\n  run the make command again.\n* If you get `WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!` when trying to ssh in, type `ssh-keygen -R\n  beaglebone` to reset.\n* For lower latency, set a lower blocksize for jackd. Try, for example `-p512` or `-p128`. Tune downwards until you\n  get dropouts and xruns (also watch cpu%).\n* To avoid SD card corruption one should always shut down the system properly and not just pull out the 5V power. When\n  running headless you can either ssh in and type `sudo halt -p`, use a GPIO pin with a button and Python script, or\n  set up an OSC command from within SC that turns off the BBB. See\n  [here](https://github.com/blacksound/VTM/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Instructions#shutdown-for-raspberry-pi).\n  version of these instructions.\n* To quit sclang after starting via the commandline use `0.exit`.\n"

          "content": "Building SuperCollider for Bela\n======================================\n\nThis README covers _building_ SuperCollider for Bela.\nBy doing so, you will be able to use the Bela audio driver for scsynth, to use Bela's ultra-low-latency audio thread *instead* of jack/portaudio, as well as plugins to access the analog and digital channels of the Bela-cape.\nSee [here](https://learn.bela.io/using-bela/languages/supercollider/) for general information about _using_ SuperCollider on Bela.\n\nBuild requirements\n------------------\n\nSuperCollider on Bela will build on Bela image 0.3.0 and above and it uses Bela's API 1.9 or above.\nWhile it is possible to build the code on a Bela system (\"native\"), you are probably better off cross-compiling it from a more powerful machine.\n\n### Prerequisites [cross-compiling only]\n\nOn a Linux machine:\n\n- you need access to the files that are on Bela's filesystem. The easiest way to do this is to copy the whole filesystem from the board you want to build for, or mount that filesystem remotely with `sshfs`.\n- download a cross compiler that matches the one on the board version you are targeting. For Bela Images v0.3.x, use [gcc-6.3.1](http://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/6.3-2017.05/arm-linux-gnueabihf/gcc-linaro-6.3.1-2017.05-x86_64_arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.xz).\n- create a file with the cross-toolchain details, e.g.: `~/Toolchain-arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake` which contains something like this (edit the `SYSROOT` to point to the root of the Bela filesystem and `GCC_BASE` to point to the compiler you are going to use).\n\n```\nSET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)\nSET(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 1)\n\nset(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm )\nSET(CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE arm-linux-gnueabihf)\n\n# where is the target environment\nSET(SYSROOT \"$ENV{HOME}/bela-image-builder-stretch/rootfs/\")\n\n# RPATH - a list of directories which is linked into the executable,\n# supported on most UNIX systems.

You need to:\n* install an arm-linux-gnueabihf capabale `gcc-6.3` cross-compiler on your host.\n* then follow instructions here to setup a working distcc environment https://forum.bela.io/d/724-distcc-distributed-compilation-with-bela\n* on the host, launch `distccd` with something like `distccd --verbose --no-detach --daemon --allow 192.168.7.2 --log-level error --log-file ~/distccd.log` (and then `tail ~/distccd.log` for errors)\n* then on the board run the following before the `cmake` commands below:\n\n```\nexport DISTCC_HOSTS=\"192.168.7.1\"\nexport CC=\"distcc-clang\" # or other as appropriate, see forum post above\nexport CXX=\"distcc-clang++\" # or other as appropriate, see forum post above\n```\n\nNOTE: make sure you don't pass `-march=native` to the compiler when using `distcc`, or it will compile natively. Therefore, make sure you do NOT pass `-DNATIVE=ON` to `cmake`, as per below\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\n### Step 1: Obtain the source code\n\nSuperCollider is hosted on Github: https://github.com/SuperCollider/SuperCollider\n\nObtaining the SuperCollider source code can be done either by downloading a release tarball, or by cloning the repository.\n\nSuperCollider releases are available to download here: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases\n\nCloning the repository can be done with the following command:\n\n    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.git\n\nThe `--recurse-submodules` option will clone the repository's submodules which are needed to build SuperCollider. The submodules can also be obtained by navigating to the root of your locally cloned SuperCollider repository and running the following command:\n\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n\n**Note**: in order to run the commands above on Bela itself, you need to connect the device to the internet.\nAlternatively, if you are going to build natively, but the board is not connected to the internet, you can run them on an internet-connected machine and `scp` the whole folder to Bela.\n\n### Step 2: Make a build directory\n\nFirst, `cd` into the root of the SuperCollider source directory (where this file resides).\n\nCreate a build directory and `cd` into it:\n\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n\nYou can actually name this whatever you want, allowing you to have multiple independent build directories. If your SuperCollider source is also a git repository, the `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore files of the form `build*`.\n\n### Step 3: Set CMake flags\n\nHere we define the configuration of SuperCollider and we select which components we want to build.\nSuperCollider runs headless on Bela (so no Sc IDE), there is no support for SuperNova and no need for QT, so we only need to build `sclang`, `scsynth` and the UGens.\n\n#### Native \n\nHere's the command with `distcc` (it will infer the compilers from the `export ...` lines above (if you did set up `distcc`), or use the default compilers otherwise.\n\nNote that if you set `CC=clang` and `CXX=clang++` on Bela image v0.3.x (which has `clang-3.9`), you should add:\n```\n-DSC_ALBETON_LINK=OFF -DSC_CLANG_USES_LIBSTDCPP=ON\n```\nas explained in `README_LINUX.md`.\n\n```\ncmake .. -DNOVA_SIMD=ON -DSSE=OFF -DSSE2=OFF -DINSTALL_HELP=OFF -DNO_X11=ON -DSC_QT=OFF -DSC_IDE=OFF -DSC_EL=OFF \\\n\t-DSC_VIM=OFF -DSC_HIDAPI=OFF -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DNO_AVAHI=ON -DENABLE_TESTSUITE=OFF -DAUDIOAPI=bela \\\n\t\t-DSC_ABLETON_LINK=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/\n```\n\n#### Cross-compiling\n\n```\ncmake .. -DNOVA_SIMD=ON -DSSE=OFF -DSSE2=OFF -DINSTALL_HELP=OFF -DNO_X11=ON -DSC_QT=OFF -DSC_IDE=OFF -DSC_EL=OFF \\\n\t-DSC_VIM=OFF -DSC_HIDAPI=OFF -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DNO_AVAHI=ON -DENABLE_TESTSUITE=OFF -DAUDIOAPI=bela \\\n\t\t-DSC_ABLETON_LINK=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/Toolchain-arm-linux-gnueabihf.cmake\n```\n\n### Step 4: Build\n\nIf CMake ran successfully without errors, you are ready to move on to building. You can freely alternate between building and setting CMake flags.\n\nAfter setting your CMake flags, just run\n\n    make\n\nIf you are doing a native build with `distcc` you can try `make -j3` to improve the build speed.\n\nAnd to install, run, for a native build:\n\n    make install\n\nfor a cross-build, where you have Bela's live filesystem mounted locally via `sshfs` or other magic:\n\n\tDESTDIR=~/bbb/ make install\n\nBuilding a Debian package for Bela\n-------------------------\n\n- create a debian package to be installed on the board:\n```\ncpack -G DEB -D CPACK_PACKAGE_CONTACT=\"Your Name <your.name@domain.com>\" -D CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE=\"armhf\" -D CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja -D CPACK_STRIP_FILES=true\n```\n(the `CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR=Ninja` is a trick to prevent the `preinstall` target from rebuilding the whole thing slower (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57530945/2958741)).\n\nRunning it\n-------------------------\n\nJust run the executable like this:\n\n       scsynth -u 57110 -z 16 -B 0.0.0.0\n\nThe `-u` flag tells it which UDP port to listen on, with the `-z` flag we choose scsynth's internal blocksize and `-B 0.0.0.0` we allow `scsynth` to receive commands from any device on the network (which by default includes only Bela and your computer).\n\nSo now you should have scsynth running on the device. You should be able to send OSC commands to it from SuperCollider running on your main computer:\n\n    // These commands are to be run in SUPERCOLLIDER running on your MAIN computer. (I guess you could run them on the device too if you wanted.)\n    Server.default = Server.remote(\"belaServer\", NetAddr(\"192.168.7.2\", 57110));\n    SynthDef(\"funsound\", { Out.ar(0, 0.5 * Pan2.ar(SinOsc.ar(LFNoise1.kr(2).exprange(100, 1000)), LFNoise1.kr(2))) }).add;\n    x = Synth(\"funsound\");\n    SynthDef(\"bish\", { Out.ar(0, PinkNoise.ar * EnvGen.ar(Env.perc, Impulse.kr(2))) }).add;\n    y = Synth(\"bish\");\n\n    // then when you want to stop the sounds:\n    x.free;\n    y.free;\n\n    // You could use this to test mic input - be careful of feedback!\n    SynthDef(\"mic\", { Out.ar(0, SoundIn.ar([0,1])) }).add;\n    z = Synth(\"mic\");\n    z.free;\n\nBela I/O's\n==========\n\nI/O support for the Bela is implemented.\n\nThe startup flag ```-J``` defines how many analog input channels will be enabled, the startup flag ```-K``` how many analog output channels will be enabled, the startup flag ```-G``` how many digital channels will be enabled; by default all are set to 0.\n\nSo for all analog and digital channels to be enabled run scsynth like this:\n\n       scsynth -u 57110 -z 16 -J 8 -K 8 -G 16\n\nTo use the analog channels all as audio I/O\n\n       scsynth -u 57110 -z 16 -J 8 -K 8 -G 16 -i 10 -o 10\n\nThis will start scsynth with 10 inputs and outputs, inputs/outputs 2 - 9 are the analog pins\n\nTo use the analog channels all via the UGens only:\n\n       scsynth -u 57110 -z 16 -J 8 -K 8 -G 16 -i 2 -o 2\n\nThis will start scsynth with 2 audio inputs and outputs, the analog I/O will only be accessible through UGens, but are all enabled.\n\nIf you want higher sample rates of the analog I/O, you can set the number of channels to 4; the number of available channels is then 4.\n\n       scsynth -u 57110 -z 16 -J 4 -K 4 -G 16 -i 2 -o 2\n\nThe amount of analog inputs and outputs actually used will be rounded to a multiple of 4, so the actual options are 0, 4 or 8 analog channels. This is because in SuperCollider we cannot sample the analog channels faster than audio rate (right now).\n\nThe ```ServerOptions``` class has appropriate variables to set the command line arguments, so you can set them with (but also see the comment below):\n\n    s.options.numAnalogInChannels = 8;\n    s.options.numAnalogOutChannels = 8;\n    s.options.numDigitalChannels = 16;\n\n\nThe UGens ```AnalogIn```, ```AnalogOut```, ```DigitalIn```, ```DigitalOut```, ```DigitalIO``` give access to the pins; they all have helpfiles with examples of usage.\n\n\nExamples\n======================================================\n\nExample files are available in the folder ```examples/Bela```, and will be installed to ```/usr/share/SuperCollider/examples/Bela```.\nMore examples are available on [Bela](https://github.com/BelaPlatform/Bela/tree/master/examples/SuperCollider) and can be accessed through the Bela IDE.\n\nRunning scsynth *and* sclang\n======================================================\n\nYou can start the server as normal from the language. To set the settings for the analog I/O you should set them to some reasonable values. The defaults are to not pass the flags to scsynth.\n\n    s = Server.default;\n\n    s.options.numAnalogInChannels = 8;\n    s.options.numAnalogOutChannels = 8;\n    s.options.numDigitalChannels = 16;\n\n    s.options.blockSize = 16;\n    s.options.numInputBusChannels = 2;\n    s.options.numOutputBusChannels = 2;\n\n    s.waitForBoot({\n        \"THE SERVER IS BOOTED! Start of my actually interesting code\".postln;\n    });\n\nAlternatively, you can start scsynth manually, and then connect to it from a separate instance of sclang.\n\nSo make one connection and start scsynth:\n\n    scsynth -u 57110 -z 16 -J 8 -K 8 -G 16 -i 2 -o 2\n\nAnd another to start sclang:\n\n    sclang examples/Bela/bela_example_analogin_2.scd\n\nOptions Overview\n----------------------------\n\nHere is a breakdown of the options for running *scsynth* and how to set them up with either *scsynth* or *sclang*\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>param</th>\n<th>scsynth</th>\n<th>sclang</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>audio computation block size</td>\n<td>-z #</td>\n<td> s.options.blockSize = 16;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>number analog input channels enabled [0, 4, 8]</td>\n<td>-J #</td>\n<td>s.options.numAnalogInChannels = 0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>number analog output channels enabled [0, 4, 8]</td>\n<td>-K #</td>\n<td>s.options.numAnalogOutChannels = 0;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>number digital channels enabled</td>\n<td>-G #</td>\n<td>s.options.numDigitalChannels = 16;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>number of input buffer channels</td>\n<td>-i #</td>\n<td>s.options.numInputBusChannels = 2;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>number of output buffer channels</td>\n<td>-o #</td>\n<td>s.options.numOutputBusChannels = 2;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>max number of Bela oscilloscope channels</td>\n<td>-E #</td>\n<td>s.options.belaMaxScopeChannels = 4</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\nMonitoring its performance\n======================================================\nHere's a tip on how to check CPU load and \"mode switches\" for the running program, to make sure it's running properly in realtime etc. (A \"mode switch\" is something to be avoided: it means the code is dropping out of the Xenomai real-time execution and into normal Linux mode, which can be caused by certain operations in the realtime thread.)\n\n    watch -n 0.5 cat /proc/xenomai/sched/stat\n\nwhich produces output like:\n\n<pre>\nEvery 0.5s: cat /proc/xenomai/sched/stat                                                                                                               bela: Fri Jan 11 00:39:12 2019\n\nCPU  PID    MSW        CSW        XSC        PF    STAT       %CPU  NAME\n  0  0      0          835043     0          0     00018000   79.0  [ROOT]\n  0  14390  5          5          14         1     000480c0    0.0  scsynth\n  0  14405  1          69782      104649     0     00048046   14.3  bela-audio\n  0  0      0          744555     0          0     00000000    0.8  [IRQ16: [timer]]\n  0  0      0          34899      0          0     00000000    1.0  [IRQ181: rtdm_pruss_irq_irq]\n</pre>\n\nthe \"MSW\" column indicates mode switches; this number should NEVER increase in the bela-audio thread. It is fine if it increases on a task that runs occasionally, but keep in mind that each mode switch carries an additional overhead.\n\nAdditional notes\n======================================================\n\nBela's SuperCollider affects the interface with the UGens, therefore UGens built for \"generic\" SuperCollider may not run fine with SuperCollider built for Bela.\nWhen using UGens on Bela, always make sure you build them against Sc with `-DAUDIOAPI=bela` enabled.\n\nContributors to this document\n-----------------------------\n\n- nescivi (marije baalman)\n- dan stowell\n- giulio moro\n"

Jailbreak your iDevice (both blackrain on iphone and redsn0w for iOS 4.1 on 2nd gen iPod Touch are reported to work)\n\n2. Install OpenSSH and ldid from Cydia. You probably also want to install SBSettings for a convenient way to among other things switch SSH on and off. It's a must-have app for jailbroken iDevices. You should have SSH turned off at all times except when you really need it\n\n3. Change the SSH password! Running around with SSH on and the default password is a Major Security Problem\n\n4. Get a free developer account from Apple and download and install XCode\n\n5. Disable code signing. For sdk 3.0 and above you need to disable code signing by editing the file `/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS3.0.sdk/SDKSettings.plist`. Follow the instructions at http://thebigboss.org/hosting-repository/submit-your-app/compile-for-cydia-submission\n\n6. Open the iphone xcode projects,  in the project and in the SuperCollider target settings -> build, set code signing to “Don’t code sign”.\n\n7. Find the architecture settings also in the build tab of the project's and the targets SuperCollider info window and set it to the architecture of the device your iDevice (armv6 or armv7)\n\n - Alternatively, you can also build a \"fat\" binary that contains builds for both architectures and \"thin\" it afterwards:\n\n\tcd into you SuperCollider.app directory and type\n\t`lipo SuperCollider -thin [yourArchitecture] -output [newFileName]`\n\n\tThen replace the SuperCollider executable inside your app folder with the \"thinned\" one. Of course, you have to also name it SuperCollider. And I'm sure there's also a lipo command that automatically replaces the original file.\n\n8. Get the App on the iDevice. You can either use Cyberduck or follow these directions: http://blog.paulbetts.org/index.php/2008/07/22/running-your-iphone-sdk-app-on-iphone-without-the-app-store\n\n9. Follow the instructions in the link above to code sign the app. That will be:\n\t```\n\t$> chmod 755 /Applications/SuperCollider.app\n\t$> ldid -S /Applications/SuperCollider.app/SuperCollider\n\t```\n\n10. Logout of your device and close SSH\n\n11. Restart the springboard:\n\t```\n\t$> killall SpringBoard\n\t```\n\n\t- You can also tap respring in SBSettings\n\n\tIf the codesigning has worked correctly (remember to only use non-fat binaries), (and if there's no cold wind blowing from the northwest) you can now start SuperCollider.app from the Springboard and take the world by storm."

The Qt installer has a step that prompts for you to log in to a Qt Account, but you don't actually need to authenticate and you can safely click \"Skip\" at that step.\n\nAt the \"Select Components\" step, pop open Qt, select the latest version, and check the \"Desktop\" option. If you are building the IDE, also select \"QWebEngine.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the Qt installer does not allow you to deselect the multi-gigabyte QtCreator download.\n\nUsing Clang\n-----------\n\nSuperCollider can be compiled with Clang. By default on Linux clang will use libstdc++ instead of libc++ (`-DSC_CLANG_USES_LIBSTDCPP=ON`). You can set this option to off to use libc++ instead; this will however likely cause issues when linking with Qt6.\n\nBuilding\n--------\n\n### Step 1: Obtain the source code\n\nSuperCollider is hosted on Github: https://github.com/SuperCollider/SuperCollider\n\nObtaining the SuperCollider source code can be done either by downloading a release tarball, or by cloning the repository.\n\nSuperCollider releases are available to download here: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/releases\n\nCloning the repository can be done with the following command:\n\n    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.git\n\nThe `--recurse-submodules` option will clone the repository's submodules which are needed to build SuperCollider. The submodules can also be obtained by navigating to the root of your locally cloned SuperCollider repository and running the following command:\n\n    git submodule update --init --recursive\n\n### Step 2: Make a build directory\n\nFirst, `cd` into the root of the SuperCollider source directory (where this file resides).\n\nCreate a build directory and `cd` into it:\n\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n\nYou can actually name this whatever you want, allowing you to have multiple independent build directories. If your SuperCollider source is also a git repository, the `.gitignore` file is configured to ignore files of the form `build*`.\n\n### Step 3: Set CMake flags\n\nDepending on what SuperCollider components you wish to install, you can set CMake flags. You can set CMake flags on the command line using `cmake -DKEY=value ..`. You can also use cmake frontends like ccmake or cmake-gui, or simply edit the `CMakeCache.txt` file. CMake flags are persistent and you only need to run these commands once each.\n\nWe will cover a few important settings. There are others, which you can view with `cmake -LH ..`. We will document more of them in this README file soon.\n\n#### Nonstandard Qt locations\n\nIf you are installing sclang with GUI features and the IDE, and you installed Qt using the official Qt installer, you will need to tell SuperCollider where Qt is. To do so:\n\n    cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/qt6 ..\n\nThe location of `/path/to/qt6` will depend on how you installed Qt:\n\n- If you downloaded Qt from the Qt website, the path is two directories down from the top-level unpacked Qt directory, in a folder called `gcc`: `Qt/5.11.0/gcc_64/` (64-bit Linux) or `Qt/5.11.0/gcc/` (32-bit). By default, the Qt installer places `Qt/` in your home directory.\n\nIf you want to build without Qt entirely, run\n\n    cmake -DSC_QT=OFF ..\n\n#### Compiler optimizations\n\nIf you're building SC for production use and/or don't plan on using a debugger, make sure to build in release mode:\n\n    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\n\nThis sets the compiler to the best optimization settings. Switch back to the defaults using `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..`.\n\nIf you're compiling SC only for use on your own machine (that is, you aren't cross-compiling or packaging SC for distribution), it is recommended to turn on the `NATIVE` flag to enable CPU-specific optimizations:\n\n    cmake -DNATIVE=ON ..\n\n#### Install location\n\nBy default, SuperCollider installs in `/usr/local`, a system-wide install. Maybe you can't or don't want to use superuser privileges, or just want to install for a single user. To do so, set `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to the desired installation directory. One good place to put it would be `$HOME/usr/local`:\n\n    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/usr/local ..\n\nMake sure `~/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH` if you do this. You can do that by adding a line such as `PATH=$PATH:$HOME/usr/local/bin` to `~/.profile`.\n\n#### Speeding up repeated builds\n\nIf you are developing SC or you're constantly pulling in the latest changes, rebuilding SC repeatedly can be a drag. Installing `ccache` can speed up re-compilation. Here is how to configure cmake to use it:\n\n    cmake -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/lib/ccache/g++ -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/lib/ccache/gcc ..\n\nThis assumes your ccache executables are installed into `/usr/lib/ccache` - you may need to change the path to reflect your installation.\n\n#### Library suffix\n\nIn some situations, it is preferable to install libraries and plugins\nnot in the `lib` directory but in a suffixed one, e.g. `lib64`.\nIn such a case you can set the cmake variable `LIB_SUFFIX`.\nFor example if you wish to install into `lib64`:\n\n    cmake -DLIB_SUFFIX=64 ..\n\n### Step 4: Build\n\nIf CMake ran successfully without errors, you are ready to move on to building. You can freely alternate between building and setting CMake flags.\n\nAfter setting your CMake flags, just run\n\n    make\n\nThe `-j` option allows multiple jobs to be run simultaneously, which can improve compile times on machines with multiple cores. The optimal `-j` setting varies between machines, but a good rule of thumb is the number of cores plus one. For example, on a 4-core system, try `make -j5`.\n\nAnd to install, run\n\n    make install\n\nYou will need to use `sudo make install` if you are doing a system-wide installation, which is the default.\n\nAfter installing for the first time, please run\n\n    sudo ldconfig\n\nTo uninstall:\n\n    make uninstall\n\n(or `sudo make uninstall`).\n\nBuilding a Debian package\n-------------------------\n\nThe most up-to-date Debian packaging rules are maintained by the\nDebian Multimedia team. Repository (with debian/ folder):\n\nhttps://salsa.debian.org/multimedia-team/supercollider\n\n\nRunning scsynth or supernova (standalone)\n----------------------------\n\nRun `scsynth --help`  or `supernova --help` to get an option summary. Don't forget to\nstart jackd before starting the server. If you want to add\ndirectories to supercollider's search path or assign default jack\nports, set up your environment as described below.\n\nYou can specify the number of jack input/output channels created with\nthe options `-i` and `-o`, respectively.\n\nthe `-H` option can be used to specify a jack server to connect to and\nto set the jack client identifier. The format is either\n\n`<SERVER-NAME>:<CLIENT-NAME>`\n\nor just\n\n`<CLIENT-NAME>`\n\nwhen connecting to the default server.\n\n\nRunning sclang\n--------------\n\nSupercollider comes with its own powerful IDE. Run it with:\n\n```\n$> scide\n```\n\nAlternatively you can use sclang in combination with your preferred text\neditor out of emacs/vim/gedit. See the `README.md` files in `editors/*` for\ninstallation and usage. Another alternative is to simply run the\n`sclang` executable which will provide a readline-based interface.\n\n`sclang` executes the startup file `~/.config/SuperCollider/startup.scd` after class library\ninitialization. This file can contain statements to set up your\nsupercollider environment, like setting default variables. An example can\nbe found in `linux/examples/sclang.sc`.\n\nYou _have_ to have a directory `~/.local/share/SuperCollider`. This is where\na synthdefs directory is automatically created. It is also the place\nto put Extensions to the class library, in a folder called Extensions.\n\nThe runtime directory is either the current working directory or the\npath specified with the `-d` option.\n\n#### Headless operation\n\nEven though the standard distribution of SuperCollider is built with the Qt framework, `sclang` can still be run in terminal without the X server. In order to do that, the `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` environment variable needs to be set to `offscreen`:\n```shell\n$> export QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen\n$> sclang\n```\n\nEnvironment\n-----------\n\nThe jack audio driver interface is configured based on various\nenvironment variables:\n\n * SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS comma-separated list of jack ports that the server's inputs should connect by default\n\n   ```\n   $> export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS=\"system:capture_1,system:capture_2\"\n   ```\n\n   in order to connect the first ports of one jack client, it is possible to specify only the client name\n\n   ```\n   $> export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS=\"system\"\n   ```\n\n * SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS comma-separated list of jack ports that the server's outputs should be connected to by default.\n\n   ```\n   $> export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS=\"system:playback_1,system:playback_2\"\n   ```\n\n   In order to connect the first ports of one jack client, it is possible to specify only the client name\n\n   ```\n   $> export SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS=\"system\"\n   ```\n\nTwo additional environment variables substitute directories for the default\nsearch path for plugins and synth definitions, respectively. Directory\nnames are separated by ':' as in the Unix PATH variable:\n\n * SC_PLUGIN_PATH, SC_SYNTHDEF_PATH\n\n   ```\n   $> export SC_SYNTHDEF_PATH=\"./synthdefs:/home/sk/SuperCollider/synthdefs\"\n   ```\n\n\nContributors to this document\n-----------------------------\n\n- stefan kersten <sk AT k-hornz DOT de>\n- andi pieper\n- maurizio umberto puxeddu\n- rohan drape\n- mario lang\n- john yates\n- nescivi (marije baalman)\n- dan stowell\n- tim blechmann\n"

          "content": "Welcome to SuperCollider for macOS!\n===================================\n\nThese are installation and build instructions for the macOS version of James McCartney's SuperCollider synthesis engine (scsynth) and programming language (sclang).\n\nPre-compiled releases are available for download at:\n\nhttps://github.com/SuperCollider/SuperCollider/releases\n\nYou can also download a bleeding-edge build of the latest development branch\n[here](http://supercollider.s3.amazonaws.com/builds/supercollider/supercollider/osx/develop-latest.html).\n\nTable of contents\n-----------------\n\n * Prerequisites\n * Obtaining the source code\n * Build instructions\n * Diagnosing build problems\n * Frequently used cmake settings\n * Using cmake with Xcode or QtCreator\n * Using ccache with Xcode\n * Building without Qt or the IDE\n * sclang and scynth executables\n\nExecutables\n-----------\n\n`SuperCollider.app` is the IDE (integrated development environment) for writing and executing SuperCollider code.\n\nInside that application are the executables that make up SuperCollider itself:\n\n- `sclang`, the language interpreter including Qt GUI components\n- `SuperCollider`, the IDE executable launched by the app\n- `scsynth`, the original audio engine\n- `supernova`, the newer audio engine which supports multithreading\n\nPrerequisites:\n-------------\n\n- **Xcode** can be installed free from the Apple App Store or downloaded from: http://developer.apple.com.\n- If you do not have the **Xcode command line tools** installed already, install them with:\n  `xcode-select --install`\n- **homebrew** is recommended to install required libraries\n  See http://brew.sh for installation instructions.\n- **git, cmake >= 3.12, libsndfile, readline, and qt6 >= 6.2**, installed via homebrew:\n  `brew install git cmake libsndfile readline qt@6`\n\n- If you want to build with the *supernova* server, you need **portaudio** and **fftw** packages, which can also be installed via homebrew:\n  `brew install portaudio fftw`\n\nObtaining the source code\n-------------------------\n\nSuperCollider is hosted on Github: https://github.com/SuperCollider/SuperCollider\n\nFirst, clone the repository with git:\n\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/SuperCollider/SuperCollider.git\n\n`--recursive` specifies that it should also clone the git submodules.\n\nBuild instructions\n------------------\n\n    cd SuperCollider\n    mkdir -p build\n    cd build\n    cmake -G Xcode ..\n    # or, if you want to build with supernova:\n    cmake -G Xcode -DSUPERNOVA=ON ..\n    # then start the build\n    cmake --build . --target install --config RelWithDebInfo\n\nIf successful this will build the application into `build/Install/SuperCollider/`\n\nYou can see the available build options with ```cmake -LH```.\n\nTo install, you may move this to /Applications or use it in place from the build directory.\n\n**Qt 5.15 compatibility**: For the time being, SuperCollider can still be built against Qt 5.15. Note that in order to build with Qt5, Qt6 needs to be uninstalled or unlinked:\n\n    brew unlink qt@5\n    cmake -G Xcode -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=`brew --prefix qt@5` -DSUPERNOVA=ON ..\n    cmake --build . --target install --config RelWithDebInfo\n\nMore info on *supernova* can be found in the section **Frequently used cmake settings** below.\n\n**Note**: You can also open the produced SuperCollider.xcodeproj in Xcode, and build the \"Install\" scheme in place of the last step. Do make sure you run the previous configuration steps.\n\n#### Step by step explanation of the Build instructions:\n\n##### Create a `build` folder if one doesn't already exist:\n\n    mkdir -p build\n    cd build\n\n##### Prepare for building by making a configuration file:\n\n    cmake -G Xcode ..\n\n(The `..` at the end is easy to miss. Don't forget it!)\n\nThis specifies to cmake that we will be using Xcode to build. \n\n##### Build\n\n    cmake --build . --target install --config RelWithDebInfo\n\nCmake will build the application looking up configuration information in the file `CMakeCache.txt` in the specified directory\n(the current directory: `.` ). By specifying '--target install' you build all targets and trigger the creation of a portable\nbundle containing all files contained in the SC distribution. The default install location is `./Install`.\n\nThe flag `--config RelWithDebInfo` will build an optimized binary but will still include some useful debug information.\n\nBy default Xcode builds the application in debug mode which runs much slower and has a larger application size. It is intended for use with\nthe XCode debugger. For normal usage you will want an optimized release version.\n\nThe four possible build configs are:\n\n- Debug\n- RelWithDebInfo\n- Release\n- MinSizeRel\n\n\n\nDiagnosing Build Problems\n-------------------------\n\nThe most common build problems are related to incorrect versions of the core dependencies, or dirty states in your build folder.\n\n### Checking component versions:\n\n**Xcode**: `xcodebuild -version`, or the \"About\" dialog of the Xcode application. Any build from the 6.x series or greater should generally work.\n\n**cmake, qt, libsndfile, readline**: `brew info ____` will show you what you have installed - for example, `brew info qt@6` should show you the Qt6 version information.\n\n`brew upgrade ____` will update the dependency to a newer version.\n\nOther common homebrew problems can be fixed using `brew doctor`.\n\n\n### Dirty build states\n\nWhile it's generally safe to re-use your build folder, changing branches, build tools, cmake settings, or the versions of your dependencies can sometimes put you in a state where you can no longer build. The solution is to clean your build folder - the common ways to do this, in order of severity:\n\n1. `rm CMakeCache.txt` (delete your cmake settings for that build)\n2. `xcodebuild clean --target install` or `make clean` (clean your intermediate build files)\n3. `rm -r ./Install` (delete the output of your build)\n4. `cd ..; rm -r ./build` (delete your entire build folder)\n\nRemoving the CMakeCache.txt should fix most build problems. After running each one of these, you must re-run the two cmake commands shown in the build instructions above (configure and rebuild).\n\nIf you wish to build multiple git branches you should usually create a new build folder for each branch you're building. In practice, though, you can usually switch between similar branches and rebuild by simply deleting your CMakeCache.txt.\n\n### GitHub Actions continuous integration\n\nThe code on github is tested anytime a contributor pushes new changes, so if a mistake was made in the cutting edge development version and something is broken, then you should be able to see this by visiting the GitHub Actions status page for the `develop` branch:\n\nhttps://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/actions/workflows/actions.yml?query=branch%3Adevelop\n\nIf the latest build status is failing, then you can switch your local copy to a previous commit that is still working (until the developers get a chance to fix the problem):\n\n- locate the most recent passing build in the GitHub Actions,\n- find it's git commit id (e.g. `595b956`), and\n- check out that change in git: `git checkout 595b956`\n- build\n\n### If all else fails\n\nPost to the user list stating what git hash you have checked out and all xcode version and library information and most importantly the error messages.\n\nSimply posting \"the latest checkout is broken\" won't help. We need the exact compile error message.\n\n\nFrequently used cmake settings\n------------------------------\n\nThere are more settings in the build configuration you may want to adjust. In order to\nsee a useful list of your options, you can run:\n\n    cmake -L ..\n\nThis configures the build using default settings or settings stored in the file\nbuild/CMakeCache.txt, prints explanatory return statements and produces a list of\nvariables the value of which you might want to change.\n\nIn order to see all the command line options `cmake` offers, type:\n\n    cmake --help\n\nIt is not necessary to pass in all required arguments each time you run cmake,\nas cmake caches previously set arguments in the file CMakeCache.txt. This is\nhelpful, but also something to keep in mind if unexpected things happen.\n\nIf you feel uncomfortable with the command line, you might want to try cmake\nfrontends like  `ccmake` or `cmake-gui`. You can also configure your build by\nmanually editing build/CMakeCache.txt.\n\n\nCommon arguments to control the build configuration are:\n\n  * Control the location where SC gets installed. The following line moves it to the Applications folder\n    (which means you need to use `sudo`):\n\n    `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Applications`\n\n  * Enable compiler optimizations for your local system\n\n    `-DNATIVE=ON`\n\n  * Build the *supernova* server:\n\n    `-DSUPERNOVA=ON`\n\n    Using supernova requires the `portaudio` audio backend, so you need to install it\n    (Homebrew and MacPorts both provide packages).\n\n    *Note*: When you build with supernova, an alternative server executable and a supernova\n    version of each plugin is built. If you also use the sc3-plugins package, make sure to\n    compile them with supernova support too.\n\n    Within SC you will be able to switch between scsynth and supernova by evaluating one of:\n\n    `Server.supernova`\n    `Server.scsynth`\n\n    Check sc help for `ParGroup` to see how to make use of multi-core hardware.\n\n  * By default the build will only be compatible with the macOS (and\n    subsequent versions) on which the compiler was run. To build with compatibility\n    for previous versions of macOS, you can use e.g.:\n\n    `-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.10`\n\n  * Homebrew installations of libsndfile should be detected automatically. To link to a\n    version of libsndfile that is not installed in /usr/local/include|lib, you can use:\n\n    `-DSNDFILE_INCLUDE_DIR='/path/to/libsndfile/include'`\n    `-DSNDFILE_LIBRARY='/path/to/libsndfile/lib/libreadline.dylib'`\n\n  * Normally, homebrew installations of readline are detected automatically, and building with\n    readline is only required if you plan to use SuperCollider from the terminal. To link to a\n    non-standard version of readline, you can use:\n\n    `-DREADLINE_INCLUDE_DIR='/path/to/readline/include'`\n    `-DREADLINE_LIBRARY='/path/to/readline/lib/libreadline.dylib'`\n\n\nUsing cmake with Xcode or QtCreator\n-----------------------------------\n\nXcode projects are generated by appending: `-G Xcode`. The build instructions above use the Xcode toolchain, which is well-tested and generally recommended if you're planning to debug or hack on SC.\n\nYou may also want to make the expected SDK-Version and location explicit, using:\n\n`-DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=`\n\nThis is often useful to point to an older SDK even with a newer Xcode installed. These are generally located in the\n\n`/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs`\n\nof an Xcode.app package.\n\nYou can build without using XCode using `make`, by omitting the `-G Xcode` - in this case, your build command\nis `make` rather than `xcodebuild`\n\nQt Creator has very good `cmake` integration and can build `cmake` projects without requiring a `cmake` generated project file. If you have Qt6 via homebrew installed, you can install Qt Creator by running:\n\n    brew install qt-creator\n\nUsing ccache with Xcode\n-----------------------\n\nAlthough cmake does not support using `ccache` with Xcode out of the box, this project is set up to\nallow it with the option `-DRULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE=ccache`. This can speed up build times\nsignificantly, even when the build directory has been cleared.\n\nBuilding without Qt or the IDE\n------------------------------\n\nThe Qt framework is used for the SC-IDE, and to provide a graphical toolkit for the sclang language interpreter for users to build their own GUIs.\n\nThe 3.8 release does not currently support building on macOS without also building the IDE.\nIt is also not currently possible to build sclang without Qt.\n\nThis should be fixed at some point (its a build tool configuration issue). Until then these build flags do not work on macOS:\n\n`-DSC_IDE=OFF`\n\n`-DSC_QT=OFF`\n\nThey do however work on Linux and Windows.\n\nBuilding with native JACK backend\n------------------------------\n\nIf you want to use `scsynth` or `supernova` on macOS with JACK, but _without_ the JackRouter driver, you can build them with the native JACK backend. **In that case you will not be able to boot `scsynth`/`supernova` without booting JACK first.** JackRouter allows any macOS application to stream audio to/from JACK, but at the time of writing this (early 2019) it is outdated and the development has stalled.\n\nFirst you need to install JACK, either through `homebrew`:\n\n```\nbrew install jack qjackctl\n```\n\nor by installing the `JackOSX` package. Please note, JACK from `homebrew` is `jack1` and does _not_ include JackRouter. `JackOSX` is `jack2` and it does include JackRouter. `jack1` and `jack2` implement the same API, but you should have only one of them installed at a time.\n\nIn order to build with JACK, you need to add the `-DAUDIOAPI=jack` flag to cmake.\n\nAfter running cmake configuration proceed with the build process as usual.\n\n### Running SuperCollider with JACK\n\nWhen `jack` is installed via `homebrew`, you need to add jack's path to the `$PATH` environment variable in `sclang`:\n\n```supercollider\n\"PATH\".setenv(\"echo $PATH\".unixCmdGetStdOut ++ \":/usr/local/bin\");\n```\nPlease note, this is not needed when using the JackOSX package.\n\nOptionally, you can have `scsynth`/`supernova` automatically connect to system inputs/outputs by setting appropriate environment variables (refer to the Linux section of the \"Audio device selection\" reference in SuperCollider help):\n\n```supercollider\n// connect all input channels with system\n\"SC_JACK_DEFAULT_INPUTS\".setenv(\"system\");\n// connect all output channels with system\n\"SC_JACK_DEFAULT_OUTPUTS\".setenv(\"system\");\n```\n\nNow you can start JACK, either using `JackPilot` app (from JackOSX package), `qjackctl` (from `homebrew`) or from command line:\n\n\n```\njackd -d coreaudio\n# or\njackd -d coreaudio -r48000 -p512 # specifying sample rate and buffer size\n```\n\nThen start `scsynth`/`supernova` as usual.\n\n### Caveats\n\nJACK installed with `homebrew` can only use a single device for both input and output. In order to use it with the internal soundcard on macOS, one needs to create an aggregate device that includes both input and output. JACK from `JackOSX` does not have this limitation.\n\nsclang and scynth executables\n-----------------------------\n\nThe executables `sclang`, `scsynth` and (if available) `supernova` are inside the application bundle:\n\n`SuperCollider.app/Contents/MacOS/sclang`\n`SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/scsynth`\n`SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/supernova`\n\nThe SuperCollider class library and help files are in:\n\n`SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources`\n\nIn previous versions of SuperCollider these resources lived in the top folder next to SuperCollider.app. To make a standard self-contained app bundle with correct library linking, these have now been moved into the app bundle.\n\nIf you need to access them from the Finder, ctrl-click SuperCollider.app and choose \"Show package contents\" from the context menu.\n\nTo access them in the Terminal:\n\n    cd /path/to/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources\n\nor\n\n    cd /path/to/SuperCollider.app/Contents/MacOS\n\n##### Adding scsynth and sclang to your path\n\nTo have `sclang` and `scsynth` available system-wide, you can create shell scripts and put them somewhere that is in your PATH (eg. `/usr/local/bin` or `~/bin`)\n\nFor `sclang`:\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    cd /full/path/to/SuperCollider.app/Contents/MacOS\n    exec ./sclang $*\n\nAnd for `scsynth`:\n\n    #!/bin/sh\n    cd /full/path/to/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources\n    export SC_PLUGIN_PATH=\"/full/path/to/SuperCollider.app/Contents/Resources/plugins/\";\n    exec ./scsynth $*\n\n###### Why not just symlink them ?\n\n- If you have Qt installed system-wide, sclang will load those as well as the Qt frameworks included in the application bundle. It will then fail with an error message like:\n\n> You might be loading two sets of Qt binaries into the same process. Check that all plugins are compiled against the right Qt binaries. Export DYLD_PRINT_LIBRARIES=1 and check that only one set of binaries are being loaded.\nThis application failed to start because it could not find or load the Qt platform plugin \"cocoa\".\n\n- scsynth will not find the included \"plugins\", unless given explicitly\n  with the -U commandline flag or using the SC_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable as shown above.\n"

Connect USB power from a power supply\n\n### Step 2: Update the system, install required libraries\n\nFor a GUI-less build, first ssh into the RPi from your laptop by opening a terminal and typing:\n\n    ssh pi@raspberrypi # default password is 'raspberry'\n\nIn a terminal, type (or copy-and-paste):\n\n    sudo raspi-config # change password and optionally edit hostname and enable ssh and/or vnc\n    sudo apt-get update\n    sudo apt-get upgrade\n    sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\n\nInstall required libraries:\n\n    # For GUI builds:\n    sudo apt-get install libjack-jackd2-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libavahi-client-dev \\\n        libreadline-dev libfftw3-dev libxt-dev libudev-dev libncurses5-dev cmake git qttools5-dev qttools5-dev-tools \\\n        qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qjackctl\n    # For GUI-less builds:\n    sudo apt-get install libsamplerate0-dev libsndfile1-dev libasound2-dev libavahi-client-dev \\\n        libreadline-dev libfftw3-dev libudev-dev libncurses5-dev cmake git\n\n### Step 3: GUI-less builds only: compile and install jackd (no d-bus)\n\n    cd ~ # or cd into the directory where you'd like to build jack2\n    git clone https://github.com/jackaudio/jack2 --depth 1\n    cd jack2\n    ./waf configure --alsa --libdir=/usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/\n    ./waf build\n    sudo ./waf install\n    sudo ldconfig\n    cd ..\n    rm -rf jack2\n    sudo sh -c \"echo @audio - memlock 256000 >> /etc/security/limits.conf\"\n    sudo sh -c \"echo @audio - rtprio 75 >> /etc/security/limits.conf\"\n    exit # and ssh in again to make the limits.conf settings work\n\n### Step 4: Compile and install SuperCollider\n\n    cd ~ # or cd into the directory where you'd like to clone and build supercollider\n    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider.git\n    cd supercollider\n    mkdir build && cd build\n\n    # For a GUI-less build:\n    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DSC_EL=OFF -DSC_VIM=ON -DNATIVE=ON \\\n        -DSC_IDE=OFF -DNO_X11=ON -DSC_QT=OFF ..\n\n    # For a GUI build:\n    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DSUPERNOVA=OFF -DSC_EL=OFF -DSC_VIM=ON -DNATIVE=ON \\\n        -DSC_USE_QTWEBENGINE:BOOL=OFF ..\n\n    cmake --build . --config Release --target all -- -j3 # use -j3 flag only on RPi3 or newer\n    sudo cmake --build . --config Release --target install\n    sudo ldconfig\n\n### Step 5: Set up JACK\n\n    # `-dhw:0` is the internal soundcard. Use `-dhw:1` for USB soundcards. `aplay -l` will list available devices.\n    # Use `nano ~/.jackdrc` to edit jack settings.\n\n    # For GUI builds:\n    echo /usr/bin/jackd -P75 -p16 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p1024 -n3 > ~/.jackdrc\n\n    # For GUI-less builds:\n    echo /usr/local/bin/jackd -P75 -p16 -dalsa -dhw:0 -r44100 -p1024 -n3 > ~/.jackdrc\n\nFor GUI builds, another way to set up and start jack is to open a terminal and type `qjackctl`. Click 'setup' to\nselect soundcard and set periods to 3 (recommended). Then start jack before the SC IDE by clicking the play icon.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo use SuperCollider, just open a terminal and execute `scide` (GUI) or `sclang` (GUI-less).\n\nWhen you boot the server jack should start automatically with the settings in `~/.jackdrc`.\n\n**Done!** See below for other usage notes and tips.\n\nRunning a GUI build headless\n----------------------------\n\nIf you want to ssh in and start SuperCollider headless, run:\n\n    export DISPLAY=:0.0\n    sclang\n\nsc3-plugins\n-----------\n\nTo compile and install sc3-plugins, follow the instructions in the [sc3-plugins README](https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins).\n\nAutostart\n---------\n\nTo automatically run SuperCollider code at system boot:\n\n    cat >~/autostart.sh <<EOF\n    #!/bin/bash\n    export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH\n    export DISPLAY=:0.0\n    sleep 10 # can be lower (5) for rpi3\n    sclang ~/mycode.scd\n    EOF\n\n    chmod +x ~/autostart.sh\n    crontab -e # and add the following line to the end:\n        @reboot cd /home/pi && ./autostart.sh\n\n    nano ~/mycode.scd # And add your code inside a waitForBoot. For example:\n        s.waitForBoot{ {SinOsc.ar([400, 404])}.play }\n\n    sudo reboot # the sound should start after a few seconds\n\nLogin with ssh and run `killall jackd sclang scsynth` to stop the sound.\n\nBenchmarks\n----------\n\nThese are rough benchmark tests. The server should be booted and jackd running with settings: `-P75 -p1024 -n3 -r44100`\n\nAlso for comparison it is important to set CPU scaling to 'performance', by running:\n\n    echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor\n\nStart sclang or scide and run:\n\n    s.boot\n    {1000000.do{2.5.sqrt}}.bench // ~0.56 for rpi3 headless, ~0.7 for rpi3 scide, ~1.7 for rpi0 headless, ~3.8 for rpi0 scide\n    a= {Mix(50.collect{RLPF.ar(SinOsc.ar)});DC.ar(0)}.play\n    s.avgCPU // run a few times. ~12% for rpi3, ~18% for rpi2, ~79% for rpi1, ~50% for rpi0\n    a.free\n\nWith the default cpu scaling (ondemand) these benchmarks perform much worse, but 'ondemand' also saves battery life so\ndepending on your application, this might be the preferred mode.\n\nTo set 'performance' scaling mode permanently see the \"Gotcha...\" section of [this StackExchange\npost](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/9034/how-to-change-the-default-governor#9048).\n\nNotes and Troubleshooting\n-------------------------\n\nThis applies to both GUI and GUI-less builds above:\n\n* An easy way to burn the zip file (no need to unpack) to an SD card is to use [etcher](http://etcher.io).\n* The internal soundcard volume is by default set low (40). Type `alsamixer` in terminal and adjust the pcm volume to\n  85 with the arrow keys. Press escape to exit.\n* The audio quality of rpi's built-in sound is terrible. Dithering helps a bit so add `-zs` to the jackd command if\n  you are using the built-in sound.\n* If building with `-j 3` stops or returns an error the compiler might just have run out of memory. Try to reboot and\n  run the make command again without `-j 3` or decrease the gpu memory in raspi-config under advanced (set it to 16).\n* If you get `WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!` when trying to ssh in, type `ssh-keygen -R\n  raspberrypi` to reset.\n* For lower latency, set a lower blocksize for jackd. Try, for example `-p512` or `-p128`. Tune downwards until you\n  get dropouts and xruns (also watch cpu%).\n* To avoid SD card corruption one should always shut down the system properly and not just pull out the power. When\n  running headless you can either ssh in and type `sudo halt -p`, use a GPIO pin with a button and Python script, or\n  set up an OSC command from within SC that turns off the RPi. See\n  [here](https://github.com/blacksound/VTM/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Instructions#shutdown-for-raspberry-pi).\n* For the older Raspbian Jessie system use a [previous](https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider.github.io/blob/1f578b5fa71e1acae0ce40d14bc0ef116062093d/development/building-raspberrypi.md)\n  version of these instructions.\n* To quit sclang after starting via the commandline use `0.exit`.\n"

Visit a lively community at sccode.org:\n\n    http://sccode.org/\n\nListen to music composed with SuperCollider on SoundCloud:\n\n    https://soundcloud.com/groups/supercollider\n\nThere are several SuperCollider Facebook groups, some SuperCollider tweets, e.g.\n@sc140tweets. In addition you are strongly encouraged to subscribe to the two SC\nmailing lists 'sc-users' and 'sc-dev'. You will get friendly and qualified\nreplies there, as well as interest, and encouragement for your projects:\n\n    http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/ea-studios/research/supercollider/mailinglist.aspx\n\n\nInstalling SuperCollider\n========================\n\nFor SC itself just run the downloaded installer. If necessary select an\nalternative install path when prompted during installation. In order to\nuninstall, use the default procedure on Windows (Control panel -> Uninstall a\nprogram) or run Uninstall.exe from within the SC installation folder. Note\nthat files created in the 'user support directory' are not deleted (see below\nfor details and an explanation).\n\nIMPORTANT: in order to use the Quarks extension system you *need* to install\nGit *and* add it to the PATH. The Git installer will prompt you to the addition.\nFor SC it is enough to add Git itself to the path, the additional unix tools\n(curl, find etc.) are not required.\n\nGit for Windows is available from\n\n    http://git-scm.com/downloads\n\n\nSystem Requirements\n-------------------\n\n### Operating System\n\n - Windows 10\n - Windows 8\n - Windows 7\n - Windows Vista\n\n### Sound card\n\nMost sound cards running under Windows will work fine - the sound card should\nbe one that is supported by [PortAudio][portaudio]. For professional\nuse do some research and find a card that allows for low latency. If you have\nissues with latency, consult http://www.portaudio.com/docs/latency.html\nfor advice on how to tune your operating system to achieve the best results.\nThe portaudio build in SC supports various Windows audio APIs, among which you\ncan chose. Usually you get best results and biggest control over latency by\nusing the ASIO driver. If your soundcard does not provide an ASIO driver you\nshould give *[ASIO4ALL][asio4all]* a try. See SC help for how to select the audio\ninterface to be used by SC.\n\n\nUsing the SuperCollider IDE\n---------------------------\n\nTo start up the IDE use the start menu link or run the scide.exe program found\nwithin the installation folder. On first start-up expect several firewall\nwarnings to pop up. The SuperCollider components - the language interpreter\n'sclang', the sound server 'scsynth' and the IDE 'scide' - communicate among\neach other over the network, so you will get a warning for each of the three\nexecutables. If you are new to SuperCollider, inspect the help system and look\nfor the tutorials. You can open the help system using Ctrl+D. This keyboard\nshortcut is context sensitive - if your cursor is on a term from the\nsupercollider language ('sclang'), the help system will likely open with the page\nexplaining that term. Of course there is also the menu entry 'Help' -> 'Show\nHelp Browser'.\n\nConfiguration- and support files\n--------------------------------\n\nAn important folder containing application related user data (for example\nextensions, quarks, Help files, plugins, configuration files, synthdefs) is\nlocated in the Windows 'local application data' folder. In SC-speak this folder\nis called the `userAppSupportDir`. This location is a bit tricky to find when\nnot using SC-IDE because its grandparent `AppData` is hidden by default. You\ncan see it in the environment variable LOCALAPPDATA. In a command prompt,\nexecute:\n\n    echo %LOCALAPPDATA%\n\nYou will likely see (the grandpa referred to earlier):\n\n    C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\n\nThe userAppSupportDir is in the subfolder `Local\\SuperCollider`:\n\n    C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Local\\SuperCollider\n\nThis folder is user writable and *not* deleted by uninstalling. Therefore your\nsettings, quarks, and plugins persist through updates. This is usually good,\nbut if you have binary \"plugins\" and update a minor version, e.g. 3.6 to 3.7,\nthe plugins may not work any more, and cause errors during SC start-up. There\nare more files in the `userAppSupportDir` that can cause trouble after updates,\nso you want to be aware of the possibility. In the IDE it is very easy to access\nthe folder. There is a menu entry -> `Open user support directory`). You can\nalso ask `sclang` where this folder is located. Type this in the SC-IDE:\n\n    Platform.userAppSupportDir\n\n\nExtensions and Quarks\n---------------------\n\nExtensions and Quarks are bundles of classes, and optionally plugins and\nhelp files that extend the functionality of core SC. The old school way of\nintegrating them into SC is to move them to a folder called `Extensions`  in the\n`userAppSupportDir` (soft linking is not supported any more).\n\nThe more flexible and recommended way since SC 3.7 does not restrict you to a\nsingle parent folder in a hidden system location. Any folder may be included\namong the folders scanned by SC at start-up (\"compiled by the interpreter\nsclang\"). New folders are integrated into SC by adding them to the list of\n\"include folders\" listed in a file called `sclang_config.yaml` in the\n`userAppSupportDir`. This file can be edited manually, but you might find it\neasier to add or remove folders via the 'settings' dialog in the IDE, or:\n\nThe community driven *Quarks* system provides an automated way to add, remove\nand also distribute extensions. It \"clones\" extensions from repositories. By\ndefault it looks in a central repository called \"Quarks\", located on Github:\n\n    https://github.com/supercollider-quarks\n\nUnder the hood it speaks `sclang` and uses Git, so there is even some version\ncontrol included. It also provides a management GUI that writes to the\n`sclang_config.yaml` mentioned above.\n\n*Note*: Each time `sclang_config.yaml` is modified (by editing, via a menu or by\nusing the Quarks system) the interpreter has to be restarted (\"rebooted\") so\nthat sclang can learn which files are available. This can be done via the menu\nentry 'Language -> Restart Interpreter'. For an overview of the Quarks system\nsee 'Help -> Using Quarks'.\n\nEnjoy SuperCollider!\n\n\nBuilding SuperCollider for Windows\n==================================\n\nSuperCollider uses [CMake][cmake] as its build system. The main toolchain\nsupported by the development team is Visual Studio - Microsoft's IDE for C++ -\nwhich also includes Visual C++, the official Microsoft C++ compiler. Use of\nother build environments and toolchains (such as MinGW, gcc, and Cygwin) is not\ncurrently supported.\n\nRequired and Optional Components\n--------------------------------\n\nYou will need to install these packages manually if you do not already have\nthem. When you are given the option, make sure to choose the 32-bit or 64-bit\nversion of each library as appropriate.\n\nRequired components:\n\n- **[Git][Git]** for Windows\n- **[CMake][cmake]** >= 3.12.\n- **[Visual Studio 15 2017][VS2017]** or later.\n- **[Qt][Qt]** >= 6.2. We recommend using the latest version. Make sure that the\n  version you select matches the architecture (e.g. x64 vs arm64) and compiler ABI\n  you are building with. This varies per Qt version.\n- **[libsndfile][libsndfile]** >= 1.0.25.\n- The **[Windows SDK][Windows 10 SDK]** for your edition of Windows\n\nOptional, but highly recommended:\n\n- **[fftw][fftw]** >= 3.3.4\n- **[Asio SDK][asiosdk]** >= 2.3, for Asio support in PortAudio\n\nOptional components:\n\n- **DirectX SDK** [v.9][dx9sdk] for Direct Sound support in Portaudio\n- **[NSIS][nsis]** to create an installation executable. Make sure to add\n  `makensis` to your `PATH`!\n\nOther development tools:\n\n- a Unix line-ending friendly text editor like **[Atom][atomeditor]** or\n  **[Notepad++][notepad++]**. There are SuperCollider packages available\n  for Atom.\n- **[7-zip][7-zip]** to extract .tar and .gz format archives\n\nPreparing to build\n------------------\n\nFirst obtain the source code by checking out the repository:\n\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider.git\n\nIf you checkout different stages of the source code history, at some point\nswitching to different stages of submodules might be required. In this case use:\n\n    git submodule update\n\nNote that a slightly patched version of PortAudio source is provided as\nsubmodule. PortAudio can support up to five different backends: MME, DSound,\nWDM-KS, ASIO and WASAPI. For ASIO support, you will need to install the ASIO\nSDK; for DSound, install the DirectX SDK (see the preceding section).\n\n### Arranging the components\n\n*Note:* creating the folder structure *exactly as given here* could save you\nfrom headaches if CMake cannot find them for whatever reason.\n\nCreate a new folder next to where you cloned SuperCollider. If you're making a\n32-bit build, call it `x86`; use `x64` for 64-bit. Next, move the installed\nfiles of `libsndfile` (by default, placed in `C:\\Program Files\\Mega-Nerd\\libsndfile`)\nand the library for `fftw` so that they match the\nfollowing folder structure *exactly*:\n\n    supercollider\n    x64 (or x86)\n        libsndfile\n            bin\n            include\n            lib\n        fftw\n\nIn order to get support for ASIO drivers, follow this directory structure:\n\n    supercollider\n        external_libraries\n            portaudio\n                portaudio_submodule\n                asiosdk\n                    asio\n                    common\n                    ...\n            ...\n\nFFTW does not provide build files for Visual Studio. In the **Developer Command\nPrompt for VS2019** (or VS2017; note that this is not `cmd.exe`), `cd` to the\ndirectory where FFTW is installed and, for a **64-bit** build:\n\n    lib /machine:x64 /def:libfftw3f-3.def\n\nFor a **32-bit** build:\n\n    lib /def:libfftw3f-3.def\n\nThe SC build only uses the single precision FFTW library (fftw3f).\n\n*Note*: if you compile FFTW yourself, all files must end up in the root fftw\ndirectory.\n\nConfiguration and Building\n--------------------------\n\n*Note:* This section assumes familiarity with the command line. The section below titled\n\"Avoiding the command line\" may be helpful if that doesn't describe you.\n\n*Note:* You should always use forward slashes for paths passed to CMake.\n\n**Confirm the location of your Qt install before executing these commands.** You\nmay need to modify them if you installed Qt somewhere else. The following\ncommands should be executed starting from the root directory of the\nSuperCollider repository.\n\n    SET PATH=C:\\Qt\\6.2\\msvc2017_64\\bin;%PATH%\n    SET CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\\Qt\\6.2.0\\msvc2017_64\n    mkdir build\n    cd build\n    cmake -G \"Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64\" ..\n    cmake --build . --config Release\n\nFor the final step, you can also build from within Visual Studio:\n\n    start SuperCollider.sln\n\nAdditional build settings\n-------------------------\n\nListed here are common additional configurations you may want to use. For a\nmore complete list, use `cmake --help` and/or see the section \"More `cmake`:\nbuilding supernova, qt-less, verbosity and more\" below.\n\n### Build type\n\nThe `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` controls optimization level and whether or not debugging\ncode (asserts, info messages, and other similar code) is included in the\nexecutable. The configuration is specified either in Visual Studio before\nbuilding or in the build command given to CMake:\n\n    cmake --build . --config <config>\n\nThe four options for \\<config\\> are:\n\n- `Debug`: no optimization, debugging code enabled\n- `Release`: full optimization, no debugging code\n- `RelWithDebInfo`: \"release with debug info.\" Full optimization, debugging code\n  enabled.\n- `RelMinSize`: \"release, minimal size.\" Like `Release`, but optimized for\n  minimal executable size.\n\nThe `Debug` configuration is used to develop the C++ codebase. For developing\nthe SuperCollider core libraries, `Release` should be fine. Using a `Debug`\nbuild in production is strongly discouraged, as it will be many times slower\nthan `Release`.\n\n### SuperNova\n\nIf you want to build supernova, add `-D SUPERNOVA=ON`\n\n    cmake -D SUPERNOVA=ON ..\n\n### Other targets (install, installer)\n\nIf you used the basic instructions above, you will end up with three target\nfolders (four if supernova is built). You can run these executables to develop\nSuperCollider, but, as the Qt libraries are not copied to the target folders,\nyou *must* keep Qt6 in your environment PATH when running sclang or sc-ide.\nThe target folders are:\n\n    sc-ide:    build-folder\\editors\\scide\\<build configuration>\n    sclang:    build-folder\\lang\\<build configuration>\n    scsynth:   build-folder\\server\\scsynth\\<build configuration>\n    supernova: build-folder\\server\\supernova\\<build configuration>\n\nOther targets (like plugins and external libraries) do not provide executables\nand thus cannot be run. If you use a development IDE (Qt Creator), it should\nrecognize the target executable automatically when you \"Run\" or \"Debug\" one of\nthe targets containing an executable. The target to be run is set in the\nProjects/Run-pane accessible from the \"Mode selector\"-ribbon. You should also\nset the working directory there to allow sclang find the server (for more\ninformation on using QtC see the walkthrough below).\n\nIf you want to run SuperCollider independently of the build environment:\n\n    cmake --build . --target install\n\nThis will create a self-contained, portable application which bundles all the\nrequired libraries.\n\nIf you want to create a binary installer, first build the target install, then\nmake sure `makensis`, the command-line tool for NSIS, is in your PATH. Finally,\n\n    cmake --build . --target installer\n\nThe SuperCollider installer executable will be built in the directory path:\n\n    <...>\\build\\Install\\SuperCollider.exe\n\nThe exact name will vary depending on what architecture and build configuration\nyou specified.\n\nNote that for just passing SC to a friend it is not really necessary to create\nan installer. You can copy the main SuperCollider folder created during install\nto another machine. The binary installer just packages this folder and adds a\nfew installation details like registering the uninstaller in the system and\nremoving some registry settings during uninstall. The userAppSupportDirectory\nwill be created from scratch if SuperCollider doesn't find it during start-up.\nWhether you copy the SC install folder, or use the full installer, you will\nalways loose the local customizations and additions stored in the\nuserAppSupportDirectory. The new Quarks system provides means to make porting\nof extension/Quark groups easier.\n\n### PortAudio\n\nYou can study the files `external_libraries\\portaudio\\portaudio_submodule\\CMakeLists.txt`\nand `external_libraries\\portaudio\\CMakeLists.txt` to\nlearn about the options that the build provides. With default settings, all APIs\nthat *work out of the box* are enabled and only the library for static linking\nis built. In the VS-build all APIs are enabled. For MinGW, WASAPI is omitted\nand some features of DSound's full duplex mode are unavailable.  If you would\nlike to tweak the PortAudio build you can single it out from the SC build with:\n\n    cmake --build . --target portaudio\n\n*Note:* MSYS2 provides a portaudio package, but it only comes with MME and\nDSound support out of the box. If you want ASIO or WDM-KS, you need to build\nPortAudio within MSYS2. Users have experienced issues using the WASAPI backend\nto build in MinGW-based environments. Use Visual Studio if you need WASAPI.\n\n### Ccache\n\nCcache speeds up recompilation by caching previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is being done again. Ccache added partial support for MSVC in version 4.6.1. When the ccache executable is found in the PATH during the configuration step, it will be used to speed up the build process.\n\nNOTE: there's a caveat when using ccache installed with \"chocolatey\" package manager. The current implementation of ccache with MSVC and CMake requires copying `ccache.exe` into the build directory. This is done automatically by CMake during the configure step. However, when ccache is installed with chocolatey, what CMake finds is actually a chocolatey \"shim\" - an executable that redirects to the original file. Copying the \"shim\" into the build directory does not work, as the \"shim\" is not able to find the original executable afterwards. The solution to this is to add the path to the actual ccache.exe earlier in the PATH. This can be done in the command prompt with e.g. ```set PATH=C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\lib\\ccache\\tools\\ccache-4.6.3-windows-x86_64\\;%PATH%```. Note that the path needs to be adjusted for the currently installed version of ccache.\n\nCommon build problems\n---------------------\n\nThese are likely the most common causes of build problems:\n\n- After run- or debug-sessions, sometimes scsynth or sclang \"zombies\" stay\nin memory. That will create file-access errors during build. End the process\nthe in the task manager.\n- Make sure you are using the correct toolchain and libraries; double-check the\ninstructions above in \"Required Software\", paying special attention to any\nversion restrictions for your particular build toolchain.\n- Dynamic/runtime-library mismatch. This can happen if dependencies and\ncore SC require different versions of the same runtime library. Reach out\nfor libraries that do not depend on MinGW runtimes or make sure all components\nin the build can use the same runtimes.\n- Architecture mismatches. This does not only concern target system architecture\n(32- or 64-bit) but also the toolchain used to compile SC and Qt. They have to\nmatch as closely as possible. SC built with VS requires the msvc2013_64 or\nmsvc2013 package.\n- Dirty states in your build folder (usually resulting from changes in the build\nconfiguration). See below for how to fix this.\n- cmake finds and uses different libraries on your system than the ones intended\nfor the build. See below for ways to identify these problems.\n\nWhen asking for build help, please mention the installed versions of the\ncomponents you used to build SC!\n\n### Dirty build states\n\nWhile you are developing SC code, it's generally safe to reuse your build\nfolder; the build will complete *much* faster. If you change branches, build\ntools, cmake settings, or the versions of your dependencies, things are less\nsafe, the build configuration might have gone out of sync with the files used in\nthe build, without CMake being aware of it. There are a few ways to clean your\nbuild. In order of increasing severity:\n\n1. Delete individual entries from CMakeCache.txt to make sure they are rewritten\n2. Delete all stored configuration settings for that build: `del CMakeCache.txt`\n3. Remove the compiled object files from the build (forces recompile):\n`cmake --build . --target clean`\n4. Delete everything in the build folder, via File Explorer or `rmdir build /s /q`\n\nGenerally, clearing the CMakeCache.txt and rerunning `cmake` should be enough to\nfix many build problems. Switching git branches that only contain changes to\ncode in SuperCollider proper should usually not require this kind of repair.\n\n### Wrong libraries found\n\nWhile some precautions have been taken to prevent wrong finds, it is hard to\ncompletely exclude the possibility (or comes at the price of lesser\nflexibility). Wrong or unplanned finds carry big risks: the libraries could be\nof an unsupported version, wrong architecture, or missing the right header\nfiles. If you overlook a wrong find, and the build succeeds, you will likely\nget an error message at SC start-up. This is actually a good thing, because it\nallows to identify the actual problem. Far worse are generic error messages or\nmysterious crashes somewhere along the way because of a misfit.\n\nThe two most likely types of wrong finds occur either at the very beginning of\nthe build, when CMake find-modules try to identify the libraries required for\nthe build on your system, or at the very end (during \"install\"), when a CMake\nutility (bundle utilities) tries to find the libraries required to allow your\nbuild to work outside of the build environment (*standalone* in the meaning of\n*build environment independent* or *autonomous*).\n\nThere are two relatively easy ways to identify wrong finds at the beginning:\n\n- use `cmake-gui` and look up the paths to all libraries in the list of build\noptions presented in the central pane (if you are in doubt about the\nsignificance of envirnment settings when using CMake-Gui, please refer to\nthe walkthrough 'Avoiding the command line: From CMake-Gui to Visual Studio'.\nThe aspects relating to environment settings are relevant for other use cases\nas well)\n- study the file CMakeCache.txt in the root build folder. The quickest way to\nfind the relevant entries is by searching for the library names (sndfile,\nfftw and Qt6). Look for paths pointing to headers (include_dir),\n(import-) libraries, dll's and dll-directories.\n\nYou can change build settings both in CMake-Gui and by editing CMakeCache.txt.\nCMakeCache.txt - the cmake configuration \"cache\" - also contains hints as to the\nfunction of the variables. You can directly edit this file, and new values will\nbe used on reconfiguration of the build. This is equivalent to passing in\nvariable assignments with the flag `-D` on the command line. These values will\nbe stored in CMakeCache.txt and replace values assigned by CMake's search\nroutines. It must be said though, that you are likely to be better of, if you\nidentify the cause of the wrong find and fix it, rather than manually edit a\nconfiguration generated automatically.\n\n*Note*: if you reconfigure the build by running `cmake` after system changes\n(like deleting unwanted libraries or changing the path order), CMake will\nusually *not* overwrite values that have already been stored in the cache file.\nThe cache serves to store values expected to be readable globally during the\nbuild, *and* values that have been passed into the configuration via the flag\n`-D`. During the build cache values are prioritized over values any cmake\nroutine might produce. This priority order helps to protect manual edits of the\nbuild configuration, which can be done with `-D`, in CMake-Gui or by editing\nCMakeCache.txt. So keep in mind that implementing a different logic to create a\nvalue for a cmake variable (or e.g. moving a library to a place where it will be\nfound by cmake) will not necessarily become effective in the next configure run.\nIf the cache already contains a value assigned to that variable it will continue\nto use that value. A safe fix for this kind of problems is to delete the entire\ncache file, but it is usually sufficient to delete the variable(s) that should be\nreassigned values.\n\nIf you get wrong finds because of a conflicting system configuration (Qt4,\ndifferent toolchains, individual libraries in high priority system locations\n(e.g. Windows\\system32 or Windows\\sysWow64) or in early PATH positions.\nSometimes adding the parent folder of the intended library to the front of the\nenvironment path can help. If nothing works, temporarily renaming the offending\nlibraries can take them out of the game. In principle the build system tries to\nanticipate these problems and prevent them. So if you bump into a new case,\nplease report this on one of the SC mailing lists, or add an issue in SC's\nissue-tracker on Github.\n\nThe second candidate for wrong finds is the fixup_bundle utility at the very end\nof the install process. Remember, for developing SC the \"install\" step (building\nthe target \"install\") is not required, SC can be run in the respective target\nfolders - using and depending on the build environment settings. The development\nIDEs should be able to find the correct executable if you hit \"run target\". But\nif you want to start SC from the file explorer, or use a copy on another\ncomputer, you will need to \"install\" and then run from/copy the generated\ninstallation folder.\n\nOn Windows the bundle utility just reads out the dynamic libraries required to\nrun an executable, tries to find them in the system, and copies them to the\nfolder in which the executable resides. This is the safest way to guarantee that\nSC can be used independently of the build environment, because Windows\nexecutables always look for libraries in their own working directory *first*.\nFixup_bundle just identifies libraries by their names (version and architecture\nare not verified). When it tries to find the libraries in the system, the\nenvironment PATH is taken into consideration with relatively high priority.\nTherefore it is theoretically possible that fixup_bundle finds different\nlibraries from the ones used at build time. As a result your build will work,\nbut the install won't. Even worse: the error messages produced in this case\nare far less specific than the ones produced if a library is simply missing.\n\nFortunately it is not too difficult to identify wrong finds of fixup_bundle,\nbecause it produces output that tells exactly, which libraries were copied to\nthe executable folder. Further more it is the last install step, you just need\nto scroll up the cmake build output. So if you get obscure Windows system\nmessages at SC start up, try to scroll up the install output, and go over the\nlast segment, starting with `fixup_qt5_executable` and/or `fixup_bundle`. If you\nlost the output, just repeat `cmake --build . --target install`. Going over that\nlist you might be able to spot cases where required libraries were copied from\nunintended places. A quick workaround to get SC running in such cases is to\nreplace the wrong library by the correct one. A better workaround is to adjust\nyour build environment, so that you don't have to repeat the replacement after\neach install. Adding the overlooked library's parent folder to the head of the\nenvironment PATH should usually do the job. Again, the build system was\nconstructed to anticipate such errors and prevent them. All directories\ncontaining libraries are passed to fixup_bundle and should be treated with\nhigher priority than the environment path. So if you bump into a case, please\nreport it to the SC community. Or even better: create a pull request on Github\nthat enhances the build system.\n\nYou can find the status of the current automated build from the `develop` branch at the GitHub Actions page:\n\nhttps://github.com/supercollider/supercollider/actions/workflows/actions.yml?query=branch%3Adevelop\n\nWalkthroughs\n------------\n\n### The trial-error approach: building sc3-plugins and passing build settings to `cmake`\n\nsc3-plugins is a popular collection of binary extension to SC, providing many\nadditional UGens. They are hosted in the SuperCollider repository on Github:\n\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/supercollider/sc3-plugins.git\n\nLike the core SuperCollider repo, this source collection contains sub-modules\nthat may need to be re-synchronized when traversing the source history. The\ncommand is:\n\n    submodule update\n\nInitialization and population of the submodules was automatically done because\nauf the flag `--recursive` at the initial clone. If at any point this is\nrequired again (message \"submodule missing\"), the command is:\n\n    submodule init\n\nGit will usually tell, when a resynchronization is required. If cmake reports\nmissing files during the build, it might be related to un-initialized and/or\nun-populated submodules.\n\nThis walkthrough expects that you have a working SC build environment in place.\nsc3-plugins do not have additional dependencies, so you are set. Furthermore Qt\nis not required, which makes things a bit easier. On the other hand the CMake\nfind-modules provided with sc3-plugins often fail, so that more manual\nadjustment is likely to be required.\n\nIn order to find out which CMake variables need values, we can do a trial run.\nFor this to be meaningful we need to\n\n  - add the toolchain binary path to the environment path before running `cmake`\n  - specify the generator (element after flag `-G`)\n  - point `cmake` to the source (last element in `cmake` command, cannot be\n    omitted on subsequent runs). For MinGW do:\n\n        $> SET PATH=C:\\Qt\\Tools\\mingw482_32\\bin;%PATH%\n        $> mkdir sc3-plugins-build\n        $> cd sc3-plugins-build\n        $> cmake -G \"MinGW Makefiles\" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..\\sc3-plugins\n\n    For VS Studio the toolchain need not be added to the path. You just need\n    to specify the generator like so:\n\n    $> cmake -G \"Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64\" ..\\sc3-plugins\n\nCMake will likely return two or three errors:\n\n    FFTW3F_INCLUDE_DIR=...NOT_FOUND\n    FFTW3F_LIBRARY=...NOT_FOUND\n    SC_PATH=...NOT_FOUND\n\nWe know the SC path, and we also know the location of the 32-bit fftw library,\nwhich was used in the SC build. The expected library is likely dynamic, so we\nneed to specify the .dll (no .dll.a available) file in the `bin` folder. Let's\ndo another trial run with the added information:\n\n    $> cmake -DFFTW3F_INCLUDE_DIR=..\\x86\\fftw -DFFTW3F_LIBRARY=..\\x86\\fftw\\libfftw3f-3.dll -DSC_PATH=..\\supercollider ..\\sc3-plugins\n\n*Note*: there should not be any spaces after the `=` in variable assignments.\nWhile cmake is lenient with spaces after the flags (`-D`, `-G` etc.), a\nspace after `=` is interpreted as a delimiter indicating the next element in\nthe command. The variable gets assigned \"nothing\" and the following path may\nbe wrongly interpreted as the path to the source. Another rule concerning spaces:\nif a *path* contains a space, it must be enclosed in quotation marks.\n\nWe shouldn't get any more errors, time to build!\n\nNote that CMake stores the variables you set manually in a file called\n`CMakeCache.txt`, located in the build folder. It is not required to re-enter\nvalues that have been stored there (except you want to overwrite them with\ndifferent values, of course). It is possible to change configuration values by\nediting this file. If you get stuck and decide to configure the build from\nscratch, you can delete that file and restart. This way you can keep the files\nthat have already been built, while making sure that all configuration values\nyou add are generated from anew. This can save a lot of compile time. At times\nthough, you might experience that it is necessary to remove everything in the\nbuild folder.\n\nThere could also be variables that define build options without producing errors\nif no value is set. They can be listed by adding the flag `-L` to the configure\nrun:\n\n    $> cmake .. -L\n\nThis will show us amongst other things, that an option to build plugin versions\nfor the alternative audio server `supernova` is available. To add them to the\nbuild, just run:\n\n    $> cmake -DSUPERNOVA=ON ..\n\nThe old settings will stay in place.\n\nReady to build:\n\n    $> cmake --build . --target install\n\nThis works for both MinGW and VS. In the VS build you may want to specify\nthe build type:\n\n    $> cmake --build . --target install --config Release\n\n\nUnfortunately on Windows we will get an error at the end of this build, because\nCMake wants to install the files to the Windows default install location, which\nis the folder \"Program Files (x86)\". This path requires elevated access rights\nand contains an empty space, the install fails. Further more, installing the\nplugins to the application folder doesn't make much sense, we want to have them\naround in a folder we can easily add to the folders scanned by `scsynth` and/or\n`supernova`.\n\nIn order to correct this error, we need to rerun the configuration and set an\ninstall folder in user space that does not contain a space. The variable for\nthis purpose is CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:\n\n    $> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./Install ..\n\n    $> cmake --build . --target install\n\nThis will copy all files to the subfolder `Install` in the build folder. The\nsecond build should proceed very quickly as CMake only builds changed components\nfrom scratch.\n\nIf you execute a build command, CMake compares the time stamps of source files\nwith the time stamp of the last build, to determine if anything has changed. So\nif you don't need to verify that a reconfiguration was successful, you can just\nexecute the build command without running CMake manually. CMake will be triggered\nautomatically if required (according to what CMake believes is correct in\na certain situation - which isn't necessarily correct ;) ).\n\nOn the command line two things are important time savers: when entering paths,\ntab completion works, which helps avoiding typos. Also the history function\n(arrow up) is very useful. CMake will not always detect typos in path\nassignments. If a wrong path is entered, this will only become apparent in the\nbuild (\"header not found\" etc.). CMake-Gui makes setting variables a lot\nmore comfortable, but you have to make sure to set the system- or shell-\nenvironment values mentioned above before running `cmake-gui`. Important to\nunderstand here is that the environment variables have to be set in a place,\nwhere CMake-Gui *inherits* them. If you set them at the command line (in a\n\"shell\") you need to start CMake-Gui from that shell (by entering `cmake-gui`).\nIf you start CMake-Gui from the Windows Start Menu, the environment variables\nmust be set on system level. The same is obviously true for a development IDE.\n\n### Avoiding the command line: from CMake-Gui to Visual Studio (environment and GUI-applications)\n\nIf you think you prefer to avoid the command line, there is the tempting option\nof running CMake-Gui from the Windows Start Menu. While this is possible, there\nis an important caveat: when run from the Windows Start Menu, CMake-Gui runs in\nthe environment defined by the overall system set during login. This means you\ncannot set the path on the command line (in a *shell*), but have to make the\npath adjustments on system level (using Control Panel/System/Advanced System\nSettings/Environment Variables). Setting the PATH on system level brings along\nsome risks that need to be managed carefully, most importantly: adding Qt6 (or a\ntoolchain) at the head of the system PATH can cause other applications that may\ndepend on similar path settings, to malfunction. This can be easily corrected by\nremoving the offending entry when done with SC development (and avoiding the\nconflicting application in the meantime), but this might not always be possible.\nSo we need to keep in mind: While working on a SC build with changed *system\nenvironment* settings, other applications might get into trouble. Most common\ncases are applications that depend on some implicit Qt install added to the\nPATH, or MinGW applications that require MinGW runtime libraries that don't fit\nthe ones used in our build. It is not best practice to rely on the path to find\nlibraries, but it is quite common, especially among free applications stemming\nfrom the unix world, where people are used to a homogenous system, in which all\napplications use the same shared libraries. To avoid potential trouble, you\nmight want to make your environment adjustments on the command-line *and* start\n`cmake-gui` form that same shell.\n\nOnce CMake-Gui is running it will need to know (just like on the command line):\n\n1. the Qt location\n  - While Qt can be added via the PATH as well, it is safer to define an\n    environment variable \"CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\", that contains the path\n    to the parent folder of the \"Qt-system\" we are using. The Qt-architecture\n    must fit the build system, in this case Microsoft Visual Studio 2013, 64-bit.\n    In a standard install, the path is likely to be:\n\n        C:\\Qt\\6.2\\msvc2017_64\n\n    You can modify the Windows environment variables by hitting Win-key-x,\n    choosing `System` -> `Advanced System Settings` -> `Environment Variables`.\n    Apply the `SET CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\\Qt\\6.2\\msvc2017_64` logic to this\n    dialog. Note that there is no `bin` in the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, this is *not*\n    a binaries search path, but an anchor path for CMake to work out all\n    relevant Qt locations.\n    After the addition it might be necessary to re-login. You should experiment\n    as to whether this is necessary on your system, with your Windows version.\n    Applications behave different as to whether they instantly react to system\n    environment changes or stick to the environment set up at login or system\n    boot. So far it looks as if cmake-gui, Visual Studio and also the file-\n    explorer are among the applications that sense environment changes\n    instantly, but your experience may differ.\n\n    Only start CMake-Gui *after* this adjustment has been made.\n\n2. the path to the build folder and the SC source\n  - they can be comfortably selected in the two text boxes at the top of\n    the window.\n\n3. the generator to use\n  - The generator can be selected in a dialog that opens, when you hit the\n    'Configure' button. Make sure to pick the 64-bit toolchain.\n\n4. the path to the toolchain\n  - In the case of Visual Studio CMake can reliably deduct the toolchain-path\n    from an environment variable set by Visual Studio. This could only be an issue\n    if you have several versions of Visual Studio installed on your system.\n\nAfter the required assignments have been made, CMake-Gui will attempt to\nconfigure the build. If this attempt returns errors, you will have provide\nadditional values. After the configuration CMake-Gui will present you with a\nlong list of cmake variables alongside with the values assigned to them as\nstored in the cache. In the box at the bottom you can scroll through the output\nCMake produced during configuration and analyse it. At this stage it is good to\nscroll through the central pane and check for the paths related to the\n\"smaller\" libraries (libsndfile, fftw) and the Qt6 related paths. Do they fit\nthe locations we expect? If not, you may try to correct it in the window\npresented. On the other hand, errors in this stage are more likely to be caused\nby conflicts with your system settings, typos in paths or the like. In that\ncase it is better to fix the error at its root, as such mistakes are likely to\ncause build errors later on. Common causes are conflicting Qt and MinGW\ninstalls, or alternative versions of the smaller dependencies that were\ndetected by CMake. In that case you will have to work out, how to correct\nthings while both keeping your overall system functional, and allowing for a\nsuccessful SC build.\n\nIf everything looks okay, you need to hit \"generate\" to create the files used to\nbuild by VS. CMake-Gui introduces a distinction between 'configure' and\n'generate'. If we use trial-error mode, this is quite useful, as generating\nVS project files can take quite some time.\n\n*Note*: not every \"NOT-FOUND\" entry necessarily indicates an error. At least in\ntheory only NOT-FOUNDs *creating a CMake error* should be problem.\n\n*Note*: If you come back after changing your library locations, the safest\nthing is to delete the build settings cache (`CMakeCach.txt` in the build\nfolder) and rerun the configuration from scratch. Otherwise old settings might\nstick. You can delete the file yourself or use the more radical \"delete cache\"\nin CMake-gui's file menu, which will delete the entire build folder. You may\nalso want to restart CMake-Gui, as it keeps manually entered settings for a\nsubsequent run regardless of whether the cache has been deleted or not. That can\nbe helpful at times, and confusing in other situations.\n\n*Note*: resist the temptation to enable all options that seem promising. Some of\nthem don't work in the Windows build. Usually SuperCollider's default values are \na considered choice that should only be changed for a good reason (see the\nwalkthrough for \"More CMake\" for some options that do work).\n\nCMake will generate a solution file in the build folder. Use it to start VS, and\nyou are ready to develop and build in this feature rich IDE. If you started\nCMake-Gui from a command line/shell, should start Visual Studio from that shell\nas well, to run Visual Studio in the same environment as CMake-Gui:\n\n    $> start SuperCollider.sln\n\nIf you set the environment on Windows system level, you can start Visual Studio\nin your preferred way. Once the \"solution file\" is open in Visual Studio, you\nare ready to build. You can either chose \"Build->Build solution\" or right-click\nthe *target* \"ALL_BUILD\", or \"Supercollider\" and select \"BUILD\". Once the build is\ncompleted you should be able to run any of the targets that contain executables:\n\n    SuperCollider\n    sclang\n    scsynth\n\nThe targets can be selected most comfortably in the \"Solution Explorer\".\nRight-click the wished target and select \"Debug\". The application should come up\nafter a while. If you find that VS has problems finding the target-executable,\nyou will have to adjust some configuration settings. Right-click the target and\nchose 'Configure'. You will find an option to select the target executable path.\nNote that these are VS user settings not passed on to CMake. While in theory it\nwould be possible to have CMake generate VS user settings, it is hard to keep\nCMake generated VS user-settings in sync with changes made from within Visual\nStudio. Therefore you should not expect CMake to know anything about the changes\nyou made within Visual Studio.\n\nIn order to boot the server from scide or sclang, it is necessary to set the\nworking directory for the respective target. This can be done in the \"Debug\"\npane of the target properties dialog.\n\n*Important Note*: provided the build environment is set up properly (the main\nsetting is the requirement to have the Qt6/bin folder in the PATH of the current\nenvironment), the various SC components can be run directly in the target\nfolders. If you want to run SC outside of the build environment, or copy the\nbuild to a different computer, you need to build the target \"install\". This step\nwill create a autonomous install of SuperCollider, without any outside\ndependencies except files guaranteed to be available on every Windows system.\nBuilding the install target takes some time, as all SC files are copied to a\nseparate install folder, and a CMake utility, \"bundle utilities\", tries to\ndetect all libraries that the SC executables require to run. The bundle utility\ncopies those to the install folder, as that is the only way to guarantee that\nthey will be available wherever SC is run. Copying the libraries to the SC\ninstall folder also guarantees that exactly these libraries are used by SC, and\nnot some other version or architecture that may be \"findable\" via the current\nsystem/environment search PATH.\n\n\n### Using Qt Creator\n\nQtC is likely the IDE with the best CMake-, as well as Qt integration, therefore\nit fits our requirements very well. The base steps, namely pointing to the\ntoolchain and Qt are handled as part of defining \"kits\", and controlled via\ncomfortable selection dialogs. You can open a CMake project directly, and run\n`cmake` from within the IDE, quite similar to how you would work with CMake-Gui.\nQtC automatically creates environment variables adjusted to the kit used (i.e.\nQt6 and the toolchain are found and added to the PATH as required), without\ninterfering with the overall system. You can \"run\" the SC targets containing\nexecutables directly from within QtC. In order to start the server from the\nSC-IDE or sclang, you will have to set the \"working directory\" to the target\nfolder in the Projects/Run pane.\n\nQtC can handle a CMake project once it knows the location of the\n`CMakeLists.txt` file in the source root folder. It does not require a dedicated\ngenerator, but uses the \"MinGW Makefiles\" one automatically. It can configure\nthe build using CMake in a similar way as CMake-Gui does. You can also do trial\nCMake runs, and add variable assignments in a text input box (preceded by `-D`).\nWhile not presenting the build options in a neat list, it allows you to edit the\nCMakeLists.txt files themselves in a meaningful context.\n\nIn a kit, among other things (debugger, source control system and more), you can\nselect one (among potentially several) Qts on your system, and chose a toolchain\nto combine with. If your Qt is installed in a standard location, it is likely\nthat QtC already created a kit at start-up that fits the needs. While QtC can be\nused to build with the MS toolchain, it is the more likely choice when building\nwith MinGW. So before opening the SC project, we may need to create the right kit:\nQt5.5.1-mingw492_32 combined with mingw482_32. This can be done in Tools ->\nOptions -> Kits and should be self-explanatory.\n\nNext step is to open the project (File -> Open File or Project) by pointing to\nthe root CMake script (CMakeLists.txt) in the top parent folder of the SC\nsource. Then QtC will prompt you for a build folder and run `cmake`. This dialog\nis well adapted to the trial-error approach of aggregating the required variable\nassignments for the build (see \"CMake-Gui to VS\", or \"Building sc3-plugins\").\nOnce CMake returns no errors you should be ready to build.\n\nFor managing your build you will typically visit the \"Project Pane\". It offers\ntwo sub-panes where you can make choices relating to build definition and install/\ndeployment. It is the place to add predefined alternative kits with a dedicated\nbuild folder (for alternative builds), modify the environment in which the build\nis executed, or add more build steps or targets (e.g. install, installer).\nYou can also chose individual targets to be built here. Each build step can be\nconveniently clicked on or off. You may also assign additional build steps to\nthe second project pane \"run\", where install related steps are best placed. This\nis also the place to select the target that is started when SC is \"Run\" or\n\"Debug\"ged from the mode selector ribbon. Note though that the steps defined there\nare executed each time you hit \"Run\" or \"Debug\", so it is not always helpful to\nhave these steps active during a development cycle.\n\nIn order to create a binary installer, you will want to add the (custom) target\n`installer`. It creates a binary containing all files required to run SC autonomously\n(NSIS required). But if you are not working on the installer itself, you will likely\nonly want to activate that step at the end of a development cycle.\n\n\n### More `cmake`: building supernova, qt-less, verbosity and more\n\nLearn more about the CMake options by running `cmake --help`. A good window into\nthe SC build configuration is the file CMakeCache.txt in the build folder. The\nmost comprehensive information is of course contained in the CMakeLists.txt\nfiles scattered over the project source tree, starting from the source root\nfolder. A longer list of variables defined for the SC build is retrieved by\nadding the flags -L or -LA ('list advanced') to the command `cmake ..`.\n\nThe file CMakeCache.txt can be manually edited and is the best place to verify\nthat variables have been assigned the values expected. Keep in mind that the\n`clean` step does not delete or change this file. This simplifies configuration,\nbut may also cause trouble if wrong values are kept. To make sure CMake\ngenerated values are updated correctly, remove the respective variables from\nthe file or delete the entire file. To make sure object files are recompiled,\n\"build\" the `target clean`. To avoid any contamination by an old build, delete\nthe entire build folder. Of course each of these measures significantly extends\nthe time needed to complete a build.\n\nIf you get mysterious build failures (i.e. no CMake error message that helps),\nsometimes increasing cmake output verbosity during the build gives you\ninformation that helps working out what went wrong:\n\n    cmake --build . -- VERBOSE=1\n\nYou can pass other make/mingw32-make/msbuild arguments after \"--\". To speed up\nyour build \"-j4\" with MinGW (\"-m4\" with VS) might work:\n\n    cmake --build . -- -j4\n\nCommonly used variables to modify the build configuration are:\n\n* Location where SC gets \"installed\", which in this context means: where the\n  SC files - including required external libraries - get copied to if you\n  build the target \"install\". The default location is set to './Install'.\n  If you maintain multiple builds you could either use different build trees\n  or install to different folders. Change this for example like so:\n\n      -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=./x86/AllPullRequests\n\n  This installs the files to a subfolder x86/AllPullRequests of the build-\n  directory. Note that CMake uses forward slash as folder separator on all\n  platforms. You may also specify an absolute path here. Building the install\n  target is a precondition to creating a binary installer. Apart from copying\n  all SC files to an install folder, it executes a command that pulls in all\n  required libraries to run SC without depending on shared libraries other\n  than the system libraries guaranteed to be available on every Windows system.\n  The binary installer adds some comfort, enhances SC system integration and\n  cleanup on uninstall, but it is not required to run SC autonomously.\n\n* Enable compiler optimizations for your local system (could cause a faster\n  binary, but could also cause build problems. Don't use this if building for\n  computers with different CPUs than your own)\n\n      -D NATIVE=ON                             # gcc/mingw only\n\n* Build the *supernova* server:\n\n      -D SUPERNOVA=ON\n\n  *Note*: When you build with supernova, an alternative server executable and\n  a supernova version of each plugin is built. If you also use the 'sc3-plugins'\n  package, make sure to compile them with supernova support too.\n\n  Within SC you will be able to switch between scsynth and supernova by\n  evaluating one of lines below and then booting the server as usual:\n\n      Server.supernova\n      Server.scsynth\n\n  Check SC help for `ParGroup` to see how to make use of multi-core hardware.\n\n  *Note*: If you experience problems getting the supernova plugins recognized\n  (plugins related error at supernova boot), try placing them in a folder called\n  \"plugins\" in the \"userAppSupportDirectory\\Extensions\" folder. It may also be\n  required to separate binary plugins and classes. The class files may reside\n  anywhere in the Extensions folder (or in any \"included\" class folder), whereas\n  the binary plugins should reside in a folder \"plugins\" (this mirrors the situation\n  in the application directory)\n\n* It is possible to build SuperCollider without the IDE, and even without Qt\n  (and implicitly without the IDE). This is not controlled via build targets,\n  but via CMake variables:\n\n      -DSC_IDE=OFF\n\n  This will not build the IDE, but keep Qt in sclang. With the more radical\n  setting:\n\n      -DSC_QT=OFF\n\n  SC will not link to Qt at all, and implicitly build without the IDE. This\n  build variation is used in low resources environments and graphic-less use\n  scenarios of SC. In the Qt-less build some Qt/GUI related classes are\n  removed from the SCClassLibrary to avoid primitive not found errors at\n  sclang start-up. The removed classes can be found in the folder\n  SCClassLibrary/scide_scqt. If you need to run code with elements considered\n  deprecated in SC3.7, you can move the deprecated/3.7 folder back into place.\n  You should remove the unsupported Document-class related entries to avoid\n  (non-fatal) errors at sclang start-up.\n\n  You cannot use the Help browser in Qt-less SC. An option is, to render Help\n  with sclang (`SCDoc.renderAll`) and run it in a browser. There is also the\n  option to build, or pre-render the entire documentation during build time to a\n  subfolder \"RenderedHelp\" in the build folder. This is enabled by setting\n  \"SC_DOC_RENDER\" to on:\n\n      -DSC_DOC_RENDER=ON\n\n  You can also avoid *installing* the (unrendered) HelpSource:\n\n      -DINSTALL_HELP=OFF\n\n* Server-only: Currently there is no straightforward way to build server-only.\n  Even if you mark only the server target (and the plugins), sclang is pulled\n  in as well. So a bit of patience is required. You can turn off Qt\n  (`-DSC_QT=OFF`) to save on the dependencies. To make it easier to assemble a\n  server bundle, the custom target \"install_server_only\" is provided. It can be\n  used in place of the comprehensive \"install\". The custom target will copy\n  scsynth's target folder and run fixup_bundle on scsynth to pull in required\n  libraries.\n\n  *Note VS*: As this is not a proper install, the MS runtime libraries\n  (msvcp120.dll and msvcr120.dll) are not copied. If required, get\n  them from a full SC install, or from the VS/VC/redist folder.\n\n* SClang-no-Qt: the modifications to the SCClassLibrary are only done\n  automatically in the build to the target folder. If you run the target\n  \"install\", you get the unmodified class library. The changes are just:\n\n    - move or delete Common/GUI and JITLib/GUI\n\nMore options can be explored by studying CMakeCache.txt in the build folder,\nor file CMakeLists.txt in the root folder of the SC source.\n\n\n### Recalling environment- and build settings on the command line\n\nWhile using the command line for the build provides a safe, low system impact\nway of doing your thing, it does require a lot of typing, especially if you need\nto do this each time you re-enter a build shell (i.e. open a command line window ;) )\n\nThe solution is: store the commands required to make the environment settings in\na batch-file (.bat or .cmd) and never type those settings again. Simple Windows\nbatch-files are basically series of commands in their own line each. You can run\na batch-file automatically upon opening a command line window, by passing the\npath to the batch file to the command that opens the command window (after the\nflag /k). This can further be automated by storing the start-cmd in a link\nopening a command line window. Just copy the link called \"Command prompt\" and\naccess the properties for that link. The \"Target\" input-box can take the command\nthat opens the command line window *and* runs your batch file, e.g.:\n\n    %COMSPEC% /A /Q /K %USERPROFILE%\\qtenvQt5.5mingw492_32.bat\n\nIf the batch file contains these lines:\n\n    echo off\n    echo Setting up environment for Qt usage...\n    echo Qt 5.5 mingw492_32 paired with MinGW 4.8.2\n    set PATH=C:\\Qt\\5.5\\mingw492_32\\bin;C:\\Qt\\Tools\\mingw482_32\\bin;%PATH%\n    set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\\Qt\\5.5\\mingw492_32\n\nYou are set to start the environment for the MinGW build system with a\nsingle click. But there is more, e.g. DOSKEY, the Windows alternative to\nUnix' `alias`, e.g.:\n\n    DOSKEY cmDb=cmake -G \"MinGW Makefiles\" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\n    DOSKEY cmRl=cmake -G \"MinGW Makefiles\" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\n    DOSKEY mk=cmake --build .\n    DOSKEY mki=cmake --build . --target install\n    DOSKEY cds=cd %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\n    DOSKEY cdbdb=cd %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\\build_MW_Db\n    DOSKEY cdbrl=cd %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\\build_MW_Rl\n    DOSKEY cdd=cd %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\deployment\\mingw492_32\n\nThese lines create a VS environment:\n\n    echo off\n    echo Setting up environment for Qt usage...\n    set PATH=C:\\Qt\\5.5\\msvc2013_64\\bin;%PATH%\n    set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=C:\\Qt\\5.5\\msvc2013_64\n    echo Running vcvarsall.bat to complete environment setup!\n    call \"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio 12.0\\VC\\vcvarsall.bat\"\n    echo Done!\n    cd /D %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\n    DOSKEY cm=cmake -G \"Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64\" %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\n    DOSKEY mkDb=cmake --build . --config Debug\n    DOSKEY mkRl=cmake --build . --config Release\n    DOSKEY mkDbI=cmake --build . --config Debug --target Install\n    DOSKEY mkRlI=cmake --build . --config Release --target Install\n    DOSKEY cds=cd %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\n    DOSKEY cdb=cd %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\supercollider\\build_VS\n    DOSKEY cdd=cd %USERPROFILE%\\Projects\\sc\\deployment\\msvc2013_64\n\nAnother option are batch-files that construct CMake arguments and execute the\nbuild. If for some reason you need to enter many of those and/or can't keep the\nbuild folder with the cache file, this can come in handy. Here is a example that\nallows to edit all paths to dependencies. They go into a single environment\nvariable (`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`) that CMake will read. The lines here contain\nrandom assignments to demonstrate some possibilities. Note that the batch files\nabove use Windows path syntax, while the one below uses forward slash for\nCMake:\n\n    set CMAKE_GENERATOR=\"Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64\"\n    set QT_HOME=C:/Qt/5.5\n    set QT_FLAVOUR=msvc2013_64\n    set QT_PREFIX_PATH=%QT_HOME%/%QT_FLAVOUR%\n    set SNDFILE_PREFIX_PATH=\"C:/Program Files/nerd/libsndfile\"\n    set FFTW_PREFIX_PATH=%USERPROFILE%/fftw\n    set CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%QT_PREFIX_PATH%;%SNDFILE_PREFIX_PATH%;%FFTW_PREFIX_PATH%\n    cmake --build .\n    start Supercollider.sln\n\nAnother way of storing CMake command line arguments is creating a \"toolchain\"\nfile. This is the CMake suggested method. Please look up the CMake documentation\nif you require an advanced configuration, and are interested in this approach.\n\n### Readline support\n\nPreviously Windows builds of SuperCollider did not support command line mode for sclang due to unavailability of the `readline` library. Currently it is possible to install `readline` using [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg). Follow these steps to build SC with the `readline` library (note that the following commands assume using MSVC):\n- install `vcpkg`, if not installed already\n- install the library using `vcpkg`:  \n`vcpkg install readline --triplet=x64-windows`\n- set `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable to point to the root `vcpkg` directory:  \n`SET VCPKG_ROOT=c:\\path\\to\\vcpkg`\n- readline should be picked up by CMake during the configuration stage\n\nNote: \n- For 32-bit builds use `x86-windows` instead of `x64-windows` triplet when installing `readline`\n- At the time of writing this, `readline` would not build using a triplet for MinGW\n\nKnown issues\n============\n\n- using shell commands from SC only works in a quite limited way (and always did).\n  .unixCmd expects a unix shell, only for essential requirements workarounds\n  are in place on Windows.\n\nOutro\n=====\n\nThanks to James McCartney, for making this great piece of audio\nsoftware publicly and freely available.\n\n\n[7-zip]: http://www.7-zip.org (unixy decompression tool)\n[asio4all]: http://www.asio4all.com/ (ASIO4ALL, generic ASIO driver)\n[asiosdk]: http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html (ASIO SDK v2.3)\n[atomeditor]: https://atom.io/ (free unixy text editor with SuperCollider package)\n[bleeding edge 32 bit]: http://supercollider.s3.amazonaws.com/builds/supercollider/supercollider/win32/develop-latest.html\n[bleeding edge 64 bit]: http://supercollider.s3.amazonaws.com/builds/supercollider/supercollider/win64/develop-latest.html\n[cmake]: http://www.cmake.org/download/\n[conemu]: https://conemu.github.io/ (free console emulator)\n[dependency walker]: http://www.dependencywalker.com/ (inspect missing library errors)\n[dx9sdk]: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812 (MS DirectX 9 SDK, June 2010)\n[fftw]: http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html\n[Git]: http://git-scm.com/download/win (Git for Windows)\n[libsndfile]: http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/\n[msys2]: https://msys2.github.io/\n[notepad++]: http://notepad-plus-plus.org (free unixy text editor)\n[NSIS]: http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download (create installer)\n[portaudio]: http://www.portaudio.com/\n[Qt]: http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2 (Qt official distribution, choose online installer)\n[SC]: https://supercollider.github.io (Main SC-site)\n[SC mailing lists]: http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/facilities/ea-studios/research/supercollider/mailinglist.aspx\n[SC repo]: https://github.com/supercollider/supercollider (SC source repository on Github with issue tracker)\n[SC help]: http://doc.sccode.org/Help.html (SC online help)\n[VS]: https://my.visualstudio.com/downloads\n[VS2017]: https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/ (Visual Studio)\n[Windows 8 SDK]: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-8-1-sdk (Windows 8.1 SDK including debugger used by Qt Creator)\n[Windows 10 SDK]: https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk  (Windows 10 SDK including debugger used by Qt Creator)\n[libsndfile readme]: https://github.com/erikd/libsndfile/blob/master/README.md (libsndfile readme)\n"
