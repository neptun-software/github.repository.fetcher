Clone the source code:\n    ```sh\n    git clone https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse.git\n    ```\n2. Configuration:\n    ```sh\n    cd s3fs-fuse\n    ./autogen.sh\n    ./configure\n    ```\n    Depending on the TLS library (OpenSSL/GnuTLS/NSS), add `--with-openssl`, `--with-gnutls` or `--with-nss` when executing `configure`. (If omitted, it is equivalent to `--with-openssl`.)\n3. Building:\n    ```sh\n    make\n    ```\n4.

Install [WinFsp](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp) to your machine.\n2. Install dependencies onto MSYS2:\n\n   ```sh\n   pacman -S git autoconf automake gcc make pkg-config openssl-devel libcurl-devel libxml2-devel libzstd-devel\n   ```\n\n3. Clone this repository, then change directory into the cloned one.\n4. Copy WinFsp files to the directory:\n\n   ```sh\n   cp -r \"/c/Program Files (x86)/WinFsp\" \"./WinFsp\"\n   ```\n\n5. Write `fuse.pc` to resolve the package correctly:\n\n   ```sh\n   cat > ./fuse.pc << 'EOS'\n   arch=x64\n   prefix=${pcfiledir}/WinFsp\n   incdir=${prefix}/inc/fuse\n   implib=${prefix}/bin/winfsp-${arch}.dll\n\n   Name: fuse\n   Description: WinFsp FUSE compatible API\n   Version: 2.8.4\n   URL: http://www.secfs.net/winfsp/\n   Libs: \"${implib}\"\n   Cflags: -I\"${incdir}\"\n   EOS\n   ```\n\n6.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10.

This file is offered as-is,\nwithout warranty of any kind.\n\nBasic Installation\n==================\n\n   Briefly, the shell commands `./configure; make; make install' should\nconfigure, build, and install this package.  The following\nmore-detailed instructions are generic; see the `README' file for\ninstructions specific to this package.  Some packages provide this\n`INSTALL' file but do not implement all of the features documented\nbelow.  The lack of an optional feature in a given package is not\nnecessarily a bug.  More recommendations for GNU packages can be found\nin *note Makefile Conventions: (standards)Makefile Conventions.\n\n   The `configure' shell script attempts to guess correct values for\nvarious system-dependent variables used during compilation.  It uses\nthose values to create a `Makefile' in each directory of the package.\nIt may also create one or more `.h' files containing system-dependent\ndefinitions.  Finally, it creates a shell script `config.status' that\nyou can run in the future to recreate the current configuration, and a\nfile `config.log' containing compiler output (useful mainly for\ndebugging `configure').\n\n   It can also use an optional file (typically called `config.cache'\nand enabled with `--cache-file=config.cache' or simply `-C') that saves\nthe results of its tests to speed up reconfiguring.  Caching is\ndisabled by default to prevent problems with accidental use of stale\ncache files.\n\n   If you need to do unusual things to compile the package, please try\nto figure out how `configure' could check whether to do them, and mail\ndiffs or instructions to the address given in the `README' so they can\nbe considered for the next release.  If you are using the cache, and at\nsome point `config.cache' contains results you don't want to keep, you\nmay remove or edit it.\n\n   The file `configure.ac' (or `configure.in') is used to create\n`configure' by a program called `autoconf'.  You need `configure.ac' if\nyou want to change it or regenerate `configure' using a newer version\nof `autoconf'.\n\n   The simplest way to compile this package is:\n\n  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type\n     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.\n\n     Running `configure' might take a while.  While running, it prints\n     some messages telling which features it is checking for.\n\n  2. Type `make' to compile the package.\n\n  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with\n     the package, generally using the just-built uninstalled binaries.\n\n  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and\n     documentation.  When installing into a prefix owned by root, it is\n     recommended that the package be configured and built as a regular\n     user, and only the `make install' phase executed with root\n     privileges.\n\n  5. Optionally, type `make installcheck' to repeat any self-tests, but\n     this time using the binaries in their final installed location.\n     This target does not install anything.  Running this target as a\n     regular user, particularly if the prior `make install' required\n     root privileges, verifies that the installation completed\n     correctly.\n\n  6. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the\n     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the\n     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for\n     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is\n     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly\n     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get\n     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came\n     with the distribution.\n\n  7. Often, you can also type `make uninstall' to remove the installed\n     files again.  In practice, not all packages have tested that\n     uninstallation works correctly, even though it is required by the\n     GNU Coding Standards.\n\n  8. Some packages, particularly those that use Automake, provide `make\n     distcheck', which can by used by developers to test that all other\n     targets like `make install' and `make uninstall' work correctly.\n     This target is generally not run by end users.\n\nCompilers and Options\n=====================\n\n   Some systems require unusual options for compilation or linking that\nthe `configure' script does not know about.  Run `./configure --help'\nfor details on some of the pertinent environment variables.\n\n   You can give `configure' initial values for configuration parameters\nby setting variables in the command line or in the environment.  Here\nis an example:\n\n     ./configure CC=c99 CFLAGS=-g LIBS=-lposix\n\n   *Note Defining Variables::, for more details.\n\nCompiling For Multiple Architectures\n====================================\n\n   You can compile the package for more than one kind of computer at the\nsame time, by placing the object files for each architecture in their\nown directory.  To do this, you can use GNU `make'.  `cd' to the\ndirectory where you want the object files and executables to go and run\nthe `configure' script.  `configure' automatically checks for the\nsource code in the directory that `configure' is in and in `..'.  This\nis known as a \"VPATH\" build.\n\n   With a non-GNU `make', it is safer to compile the package for one\narchitecture at a time in the source code directory.  After you have\ninstalled the package for one architecture, use `make distclean' before\nreconfiguring for another architecture.\n\n   On macOS 10.5 and later systems, you can create libraries and\nexecutables that work on multiple system types--known as \"fat\" or\n\"universal\" binaries--by specifying multiple `-arch' options to the\ncompiler but only a single `-arch' option to the preprocessor.  Like\nthis:\n\n     ./configure CC=\"gcc -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64\" \\\n                 CXX=\"g++ -arch i386 -arch x86_64 -arch ppc -arch ppc64\" \\\n                 CPP=\"gcc -E\" CXXCPP=\"g++ -E\"\n\n   This is not guaranteed to produce working output in all cases, you\nmay have to build one architecture at a time and combine the results\nusing the `lipo' tool if you have problems.\n\nInstallation Names\n==================\n\n   By default, `make install' installs the package's commands under\n`/usr/local/bin', include files under `/usr/local/include', etc.  You\ncan specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by giving\n`configure' the option `--prefix=PREFIX', where PREFIX must be an\nabsolute file name.\n\n   You can specify separate installation prefixes for\narchitecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If you\npass the option `--exec-prefix=PREFIX' to `configure', the package uses\nPREFIX as the prefix for installing programs and libraries.\nDocumentation and other data files still use the regular prefix.\n\n   In addition, if you use an unusual directory layout you can give\noptions like `--bindir=DIR' to specify different values for particular\nkinds of files.  Run `configure --help' for a list of the directories\nyou can set and what kinds of files go in them.  In general, the\ndefault for these options is expressed in terms of `${prefix}', so that\nspecifying just `--prefix' will affect all of the other directory\nspecifications that were not explicitly provided.\n\n   The most portable way to affect installation locations is to pass the\ncorrect locations to `configure'; however, many packages provide one or\nboth of the following shortcuts of passing variable assignments to the\n`make install' command line to change installation locations without\nhaving to reconfigure or recompile.\n\n   The first method involves providing an override variable for each\naffected directory.  For example, `make install\nprefix=/alternate/directory' will choose an alternate location for all\ndirectory configuration variables that were expressed in terms of\n`${prefix}'.  Any directories that were specified during `configure',\nbut not in terms of `${prefix}', must each be overridden at install\ntime for the entire installation to be relocated.  The approach of\nmakefile variable overrides for each directory variable is required by\nthe GNU Coding Standards, and ideally causes no recompilation.\nHowever, some platforms have known limitations with the semantics of\nshared libraries that end up requiring recompilation when using this\nmethod, particularly noticeable in packages that use GNU Libtool.\n\n   The second method involves providing the `DESTDIR' variable.  For\nexample, `make install DESTDIR=/alternate/directory' will prepend\n`/alternate/directory' before all installation names.  The approach of\n`DESTDIR' overrides is not required by the GNU Coding Standards, and\ndoes not work on platforms that have drive letters.  On the other hand,\nit does better at avoiding recompilation issues, and works well even\nwhen some directory options were not specified in terms of `${prefix}'\nat `configure' time.\n\nOptional Features\n=================\n\n   If the package supports it, you can cause programs to be installed\nwith an extra prefix or suffix on their names by giving `configure' the\noption `--program-prefix=PREFIX' or `--program-suffix=SUFFIX'.\n\n   Some packages pay attention to `--enable-FEATURE' options to\n`configure', where FEATURE indicates an optional part of the package.\nThey may also pay attention to `--with-PACKAGE' options, where PACKAGE\nis something like `gnu-as' or `x' (for the X Window System).  The\n`README' should mention any `--enable-' and `--with-' options that the\npackage recognizes.\n\n   For packages that use the X Window System, `configure' can usually\nfind the X include and library files automatically, but if it doesn't,\nyou can use the `configure' options `--x-includes=DIR' and\n`--x-libraries=DIR' to specify their locations.\n\n   Some packages offer the ability to configure how verbose the\nexecution of `make' will be.  For these packages, running `./configure\n--enable-silent-rules' sets the default to minimal output, which can be\noverridden with `make V=1'; while running `./configure\n--disable-silent-rules' sets the default to verbose, which can be\noverridden with `make V=0'.\n\nParticular systems\n==================\n\n   On HP-UX, the default C compiler is not ANSI C compatible.  If GNU\nCC is not installed, it is recommended to use the following options in\norder to use an ANSI C compiler:\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc -Ae -D_XOPEN_SOURCE=500\"\n\nand if that doesn't work, install pre-built binaries of GCC for HP-UX.\n\n   On OSF/1 a.k.a. Tru64, some versions of the default C compiler cannot\nparse its `<wchar.h>' header file.  The option `-nodtk' can be used as\na workaround.  If GNU CC is not installed, it is therefore recommended\nto try\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc\"\n\nand if that doesn't work, try\n\n     ./configure CC=\"cc -nodtk\"\n\n   On Solaris, don't put `/usr/ucb' early in your `PATH'.  This\ndirectory contains several dysfunctional programs; working variants of\nthese programs are available in `/usr/bin'.  So, if you need `/usr/ucb'\nin your `PATH', put it _after_ `/usr/bin'.\n\n   On Haiku, software installed for all users goes in `/boot/common',\nnot `/usr/local'.  It is recommended to use the following options:\n\n     ./configure --prefix=/boot/common\n\nSpecifying the System Type\n==========================\n\n   There may be some features `configure' cannot figure out\nautomatically, but needs to determine by the type of machine the package\nwill run on.  Usually, assuming the package is built to be run on the\n_same_ architectures, `configure' can figure that out, but if it prints\na message saying it cannot guess the machine type, give it the\n`--build=TYPE' option.  TYPE can either be a short name for the system\ntype, such as `sun4', or a canonical name which has the form:\n\n     CPU-COMPANY-SYSTEM\n\nwhere SYSTEM can have one of these forms:\n\n     OS\n     KERNEL-OS\n\n   See the file `config.sub' for the possible values of each field.  If\n`config.sub' isn't included in this package, then this package doesn't\nneed to know the machine type.\n\n   If you are _building_ compiler tools for cross-compiling, you should\nuse the option `--target=TYPE' to select the type of system they will\nproduce code for.\n\n   If you want to _use_ a cross compiler, that generates code for a\nplatform different from the build platform, you should specify the\n\"host\" platform (i.e., that on which the generated programs will\neventually be run) with `--host=TYPE'.\n\nSharing Defaults\n================\n\n   If you want to set default values for `configure' scripts to share,\nyou can create a site shell script called `config.site' that gives\ndefault values for variables like `CC', `cache_file', and `prefix'.\n`configure' looks for `PREFIX/share/config.site' if it exists, then\n`PREFIX/etc/config.site' if it exists.  Or, you can set the\n`CONFIG_SITE' environment variable to the location of the site script.\nA warning: not all `configure' scripts look for a site script.\n\nDefining Variables\n==================\n\n   Variables not defined in a site shell script can be set in the\nenvironment passed to `configure'.  However, some packages may run\nconfigure again during the build, and the customized values of these\nvariables may be lost.  In order to avoid this problem, you should set\nthem in the `configure' command line, using `VAR=value'.  For example:\n\n     ./configure CC=/usr/local2/bin/gcc\n\ncauses the specified `gcc' to be used as the C compiler (unless it is\noverridden in the site shell script).\n\nUnfortunately, this technique does not work for `CONFIG_SHELL' due to\nan Autoconf bug.  Until the bug is fixed you can use this workaround:\n\n     CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash /bin/bash ./configure CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/bash\n\n`configure' Invocation\n======================\n\n   `configure' recognizes the following options to control how it\noperates.\n\n`--help'\n`-h'\n     Print a summary of all of the options to `configure', and exit.\n\n`--help=short'\n`--help=recursive'\n     Print a summary of the options unique to this package's\n     `configure', and exit.  The `short' variant lists options used\n     only in the top level, while the `recursive' variant lists options\n     also present in any nested packages.\n\n`--version'\n`-V'\n     Print the version of Autoconf used to generate the `configure'\n     script, and exit.\n\n`--cache-file=FILE'\n     Enable the cache: use and save the results of the tests in FILE,\n     traditionally `config.cache'.  FILE defaults to `/dev/null' to\n     disable caching.\n\n`--config-cache'\n`-C'\n     Alias for `--cache-file=config.cache'.\n\n`--quiet'\n`--silent'\n`-q'\n     Do not print messages saying which checks are being made.  To\n     suppress all normal output, redirect it to `/dev/null' (any error\n     messages will still be shown).\n\n`--srcdir=DIR'\n     Look for the package's source code in directory DIR.  Usually\n     `configure' can determine that directory automatically.\n\n`--prefix=DIR'\n     Use DIR as the installation prefix.  *note Installation Names::\n     for more details, including other options available for fine-tuning\n     the installation locations.\n\n`--no-create'\n`-n'\n     Run the configure checks, but stop before creating any output\n     files.\n\n`configure' also accepts some other, not widely useful, options.  Run\n`configure --help' for more details.\n\n"

Alternatively, s3fs supports a custom passwd file.\nFinally s3fs recognizes the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`\nenvironment variables.\n\nThe default location for the s3fs password file can be created:\n\n* using a `.passwd-s3fs` file in the users home directory (i.e. `${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs`)\n* using the system-wide `/etc/passwd-s3fs` file\n\nEnter your credentials in a file `${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs` and set\nowner-only permissions:\n\n```\necho ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY > ${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs\nchmod 600 ${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs\n```\n\nRun s3fs with an existing bucket `mybucket` and directory `/path/to/mountpoint`:\n\n```\ns3fs mybucket /path/to/mountpoint -o passwd_file=${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs\n```\n\nIf you encounter any errors, enable debug output:\n\n```\ns3fs mybucket /path/to/mountpoint -o passwd_file=${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs -o dbglevel=info -f -o curldbg\n```\n\nYou can also mount on boot by entering the following line to `/etc/fstab`:\n\n```\nmybucket /path/to/mountpoint fuse.s3fs _netdev,allow_other 0 0\n```\n\nIf you use s3fs with a non-Amazon S3 implementation, specify the URL and path-style requests:\n\n```\ns3fs mybucket /path/to/mountpoint -o passwd_file=${HOME}/.passwd-s3fs -o url=https://url.to.s3/ -o use_path_request_style\n```\n\nor(fstab)\n\n```\nmybucket /path/to/mountpoint fuse.s3fs _netdev,allow_other,use_path_request_style,url=https://url.to.s3/ 0 0\n```\n\nNote: You may also want to create the global credential file first\n\n```\necho ACCESS_KEY_ID:SECRET_ACCESS_KEY > /etc/passwd-s3fs\nchmod 600 /etc/passwd-s3fs\n```\n\nNote2: You may also need to make sure `netfs` service is start on boot\n\n## Limitations\n\nGenerally S3 cannot offer the same performance or semantics as a local file system.  More specifically:\n\n* random writes or appends to files require rewriting the entire object, optimized with multi-part upload copy\n* metadata operations such as listing directories have poor performance due to network latency\n* non-AWS providers may have [eventual consistency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eventual_consistency) so reads can temporarily yield stale data (AWS offers read-after-write consistency [since Dec 2020](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/12/amazon-s3-now-delivers-strong-read-after-write-consistency-automatically-for-all-applications/))\n* no atomic renames of files or directories\n* no coordination between multiple clients mounting the same bucket\n* no hard links\n* inotify detects only local modifications, not external ones by other clients or tools\n\n## References\n\n* [CSI for S3](https://github.com/ctrox/csi-s3) - Kubernetes CSI driver\n* [docker-s3fs-client](https://github.com/efrecon/docker-s3fs-client) - Docker image containing s3fs\n* [goofys](https://github.com/kahing/goofys) - similar to s3fs but has better performance and less POSIX compatibility\n* [s3backer](https://github.com/archiecobbs/s3backer) - mount an S3 bucket as a single file\n* [S3Proxy](https://github.com/gaul/s3proxy) - combine with s3fs to mount Backblaze B2, EMC Atmos, Microsoft Azure, and OpenStack Swift buckets\n* [s3ql](https://github.com/s3ql/s3ql/) - similar to s3fs but uses its own object format\n* [YAS3FS](https://github.com/danilop/yas3fs) - similar to s3fs but uses SNS to allow multiple clients to mount a bucket\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n* [FAQ wiki page](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse/wiki/FAQ)\n* [s3fs on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/s3fs)\n* [s3fs on Server Fault](https://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/s3fs)\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (C) 2010 Randy Rizun <rrizun@gmail.com>\n\nLicensed under the GNU GPL version 2\n"
