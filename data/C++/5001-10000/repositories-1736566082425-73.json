Update Version Number\n\nThe front-end Uses [lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) for versioning and CHANGELOG generation, but cannot use its publishing functionality because it needs to update the terminal package.\n\nUpdate version and CHANGELOG usage:\n\n```bash\nnpx lerna version [VERSION] --force-publish --conventional-commits --tag-version-prefix='' --no-push\n```\n\n* `[version]` - The version number to be released, such as 2.1.0.\n* `--conventional-commits` - Generates a CHANGELOG based on the conventional commit specification.\n* `--tag-version-prefix` - it is changed to a null character, so that the generated version number tag is not preceded by the default `v`\n* `--no-push` - it does not push tags to remote.\n\n## 2. Rollback commit and delete auto-generated tag\n\nAfter Lerna generates the version number and CHANGELOG, it needs to roll back the version, and all the published changes need to be merged into a commit.\n\n```bash\ngit reset --soft HEAD^\n```\n\nDelete the tag at the same time, after a while update need to regenerate the tag\n\n```bash\ngit tag -d [VERSION]\n```\n\n## 3. Update native version number\n\nThe native version number is mainly located in the following files, which need to be updated to the version number to be released\n\niOS\n\n* [hippy.podspec](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/hippy.podspec#L11)\n* [HippyBridge.mm](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/ios/sdk/base/HippyBridge.mm#L45)\n\nAndroid\n\n* [gradle.properties](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy/blob/master/android/sdk/gradle.properties#L25)\n\n修改安卓的abi配置，支持armeabi-v7a和arm64-v8a\n```\nINCLUDE_ABI_ARMEABI_V7A=true\nINCLUDE_ABI_ARM64_V8A=true\n```\n\n## 4. Update built-in packages and verify functionality\n\nThe new front-end SDK is then compiled with\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nIf some code updated under `core/js`, you need to compile the core code with\n\n```bash\nnpm run buildcore\n```\n\nThen update the dependencies under the target `examples` and update the built-in packages of the native. Generally speaking, the built-in hippy-react-demo is the default, but be sure to check that hippy-vue-demo functions properly.\n\n```bash\nnpm run buildexample hippy-react-demo\n```\n\n## 5. Resubmit when everything is ready\n\nCheck again that all files have been modified correctly\n\n```bash\ngit status\n```\n\nSubmit document modification\n\n```bash\ngit add [FILES]\n```\n\nEnter a commit message that conforms to [Convention Commit](https://conventionalcommits.org/) specifications\n\n```bash\ngit commit -m 'chore(release): released [VERSION]'\n```\n\ntag (如果是大版本, 在主干打tag, 如果是hotfix，在hotfix分支打tag，然后把changelog合回主干)\n\n```bash\ngit tag -a [VERSION] -m \"version release xxx\"\n```\n\nCommit the code and prepare to publish the PR merge into the master branch.\n\n```bash\ngit push origin branch       # 提交代码\ngit push origin tag          # 提交 tag\n```\n\n## 6. Publish\n\n* Front End Publishing to npmjs.com\n\n  ```bash\n  npx lerna exec \"npm publish\"\n  ```\n\n  > If npm secondary authentication is active, you will be asked to input a one-time password.\n\n* iOS published to CocoaPods.org\n\n  * If you do not have a CocoaPod account, register first\n\n  ```bash\n    pod trunk register [EMAIL] [NAME]\n  ```\n\n  * Then publish\n\n  ```bash\n   pod trunk push hippy.podspec\n  ```\n\n  > If the parameter check fails when publishing, you can prefix the `pod` command `COCOAPODS_VALIDATOR_SKIP_XCODEBUILD=1` parameter\n\n* Android released to Maven Central, the original jCenter repository has been abandoned [version query](https://search.maven.org/search?q=com.tencent.hippy).\n\n  * Follow [the steps for publishing Maven Central](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/362205023) and sign up for [sonatype](https://oss.sonatype.org).\n  * Increase the system environment variable configuration\n\n    ```bash\n    SIGNING_KEY_ID=gpg公钥key后8位\n    SIGNING_PASSWORD=gpg密钥对密码\n    SIGNING_SECRET_KEY_RING_FILE=gpg文件存放路径, 如/Users/user/.gnupg/secring.gpg\n    OSSRH_USERNAME=sonatype账号\n    OSSRH_PASSWORD=sonatype密码\n    ```\n\n  * Run build `Clean Project`\n  * `Android gradle.properties` turns on the `#PUBLISH_ARTIFACT_ID=hippy-debug` comment, and the Gradle Task executes `other` => `assembleDebug` before `publishing` => `publish`\n  * `Android gradle.properties` turns on the `#PUBLISH_ARTIFACT_ID=hippy-common` comment, and the Gradle Task executes `other` => `assembleRelease` before `publishing` => `publish`\n  * After the success of the release of the SDK will be in the `staging` state of Sonatype, in the left side `Staging Repositories` of the Sonatype Staging Repositories to find just released repository, if you want to test before Release, can be under the `Content` will `aar` download, replace `examples` => `android-demo` => `example` => `libs` under the aar(name to `android-sdk-release.aar`)\n\n    ```bash\n      // annotation local reference in `setting.gradle` \n      // include 'android-sdk'\n      // project(':android-sdk').projectDir = new File('../../ android/sdk')\n\n      --------------\n\n      // `android-demo` => `example` => `build.gradle` dependencies can be changed as follow to use local aar file\n      if (1) {\n        api (name: 'android-sdk-release', ext: 'aar')\n      } else {\n         api project(path: ':android-sdk')\n      }\n    ```\n\n  * After successful verification, Close the repository of `Staging Repositories``Close` and click `Release`.\n  * After the success of the Release can be searched in the Repository to the corresponding version of aar, Maven home page need to wait for more than 2 hours to synchronize\n"

Hippy is quite friendly to Web developers, especially those who are familiar with React or Vue. With Hippy, developers can create the cross-platform app easily.\n\nHippy is now applied in [Tencent](http://www.tencent.com/) major apps such as Mobile QQ, Mobile QQ Browser, Tencent Video App, QQ Music App, and Tencent News, reaching hundreds of millions of ordinary users.\n\n## 💯 Advantages\n\n* Designed for Web developers, officially support Web frameworks like `React` and `Vue`.\n* Same APIs for different platforms.\n* Excellent performance with JS engine binding communication.\n* Build-in recyclable component with better performance.\n* Smoothly and gracefully migrate to Web browser.\n* Fully supported Flex [Layout engine](https://github.com/Tencent/taitank).\n\n## 🔨 Getting started\n\n### Preparing environment\n\nMake sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) installed locally.\n\nRun `git clone https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy.git` and `npm install` at project root directory.\n\n> The Hippy repository applies [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to manage so,gz,otf files, make sure you have installed [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) first.\n\nFor macOS developers:\n\n* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with iOS sdk: build the iOS app.\n* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with NDK: build the android app.\n* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): run the build scripts.\n\n[homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is recommended to install the dependencies.\n\nFor Windows developers:\n\n* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with NDK: build the android app.\n* [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/): run the build scripts.\n\n> Windows can't run the iOS development environment so far.\n\n### Build the iOS simulator with js demo\n\nFor iOS, we recommend to use iOS simulator when first try. However, you can change the Xcode configuration to install the app to iPhone if you are an iOS expert.\n\n1. `cd` to `driver/js/`.\n\n2. Run `npm run init`.\n\n   > This command is combined with `npm install && npx lerna bootstrap && npm run build`.\n   >\n   > `npm install`: Install the project build scripts dependencies.\n   >\n   > `npx lerna bootstrap`: Install dependencies of each npm package.（Hippy uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage multi js packages, if `lerna` command is not found, execute `npm install lerna -g` first.）\n   >\n   > `npm run build`: Build each front-end sdk package.  \n\n3. Choose a demo to build with `npm run buildexample [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo|hippy-vue-next-demo]`.\n\n4. Install CocoaPods with `brew install cocoapods`, install cmake with `brew install cmake`, then execute `pod install` command at `framework/examples/ios-demo` directory, which will create `HippyDemo.xcworkspace` files and install Cocoapods dependencies.\n\n5. Start the Xcode and build the iOS app with opening `framework/examples/ios-demo/HippyDemo.xcworkspace`.\n\n> If `Step 2` throw error, you can `cd` to `driver/js/examples` hippy-react-demo or hippy-vue-demo, and run `npm install` to install demo dependencies first.\n>\n> More details for [iOS SDK integration](https://hippyjs.org/#/ios/integration?id=ios-%e9%9b%86%e6%88%90).\n\n### Build the Android app with js demo\n\nFor Android, we recommend using the real cellphone for better develop experience, because Hippy is using [X5](https://x5.tencent.com/) JS engine which can't support x86 simulator, as well as ARM simulator has a low performance.\n\nBefore build the android app, please make sure the SDK and NDK is installed, And *DO NOT* update the build toolchain.\n\n1. `cd` to `driver/js/`.\n\n2. Run `npm run init`.\n\n   > This command is combined with `npm install && npx lerna bootstrap && npm run build`.\n   >\n   > `npm install`: Install the project build scripts dependencies.\n   >\n   > `npx lerna bootstrap`: Install dependencies of each npm package.（Hippy uses [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) to manage multi js packages, if `lerna` command is not found, execute `npm install lerna -g` first.）\n   >\n   > `npm run build`: Build each front-end sdk package.  \n\n3. Choose a demo to build with `npm run buildexample [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo|hippy-vue-next-demo]`.\n4. Open the `Hippy Project` at root directory with Android Studio.\n5. Connect Android phone with USB cable and make sure USB debugging mode is enabled(Run `adb devices` on the computer terminal to check cellphone connection status).\n6. Open the project with Android Studio, run and install the apk.\n\n> If `Step 2` throw error, you can `cd` to `driver/js/examples` hippy-react-demo, hippy-vue-demo or hippy-vue-next-demo, and run `npm install` to install demo dependencies first.\n>\n> If you encounter the issue of `No toolchains found in the NDK toolchains folder for ABI with prefix: mips64el-linux-android`, here is the [solution](https://github.com/google/filament/issues/15#issuecomment-415423557).\n>\n> More details for [Android SDK integration](https://hippyjs.org/#/android/integration?id=android-%e9%9b%86%e6%88%90).\n\n### Debug the js demo\n\n1. Follow [Build the iOS simulator with js demo](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy#build-the-ios-simulator-with-js-demo) or [Build the Android app with js demo](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy#build-the-android-app-with-js-demo) first to build the App.\n2. `cd` to `driver/js/`.   \n3. Run `npm run init:example [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo|hippy-vue-next-demo]`.\n4. Run `npm run debugexample [hippy-react-demo|hippy-vue-demo|hippy-vue-next-demo] dev`.\n\n> Or you can `cd` to `driver/js/examples/hippy-react-demo`, `driver/js/examples/hippy-vue-demo` or `driver/js/examples/hippy-vue-next-demo` directory to run `npm run hippy:debug` and `npm run hippy:dev` instead.\n>\n> On example debug mode, npm packages such as @hippy/react, @hippy/vue, @hippy/vue-next are linked to `driver/js/packages` > `[different package]` > `dist`(not node_modules), so if you have changed js package source code and want to make it take effect in target example, please call `npm run build` again.\n>\n> More details for debugging can be read in [Hippy Debug Document](https://hippyjs.org/#/guide/debug).\n\n### Build the js production demo\n\n1. Follow [Build the iOS simulator with js demo](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy#build-the-ios-simulator-with-js-demo) or [Build the Android app with js demo](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy#build-the-android-app-with-js-demo) first to build the App.\n2. `cd` to `driver/js/examples/hippy-react-demo`, `driver/js/examples/hippy-vue-demo` or `driver/js/examples/hippy-vue-next-demo`.\n3. Run `npm install` to install demo js dependencies.\n4. Run `npm run hippy:vendor` and `npm run hippy:build` in sequence to build the production `vendor.[android|ios].js` and `index.[android|ios].js`.\n\n> Hippy demo uses DllPlugin to split the common chunk and app chunk.\n\n## 📁 Documentation\n\nTo check out [hippy examples](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy/tree/master/examples) and visit [hippyjs.org](https://hippyjs.org).\n\n## 📅 Changelog\n\nDetailed changes for each release version are documented in the [project release notes](https://github.com/Tencent/Hippy/releases).\n\n## 🧱 Project structure\n\n```text\nHippy\n├── devtools                                                      # Devtools for Hippy.\n├── dom                                                           # DOM Layer for Hippy.\n├── driver                                                        # Different UI Driver Layers for Hippy.\n│   └── js                                                     # JS Driver Layer for Hippy.\n│       ├── examples                                                # Related examples for JS Driver.\n│       ├── include\n│       ├── packages                                                # Related JS Packages for JS Driver.\n│       │   ├── hippy-react\n│       │   ├── hippy-react-web\n│       │   ├── hippy-vue\n│       │   ├── hippy-vue-css-loader\n│       │   ├── hippy-vue-loader\n│       │   ├── hippy-vue-native-components\n│       │   └── hippy-vue-router\n│       └── src\n├── framework\n│   ├── android\n│   ├── examples\n│   │   ├── android-demo\n│   │   └── ios-demo\n│   └── ios\n├── layout                                                      # Layout engine for Hippy.\n├── modules\n│   ├── android\n│   └── footstone\n├── renderer                                                    # Different Renderers for Hippy.\n│   ├── flutter\n│   └── native\n│       ├── android\n│       └── ios\n└── static\n```\n\n## 🤝 Contribution\n\nDevelopers are welcome to contribute to Tencent's open source, and we will also give them incentives to acknowledge and thank them.
