At the moment only local presets under `~/.config/easyeffects` are automatically loaded in the Presets Menu. In the future we will implement a new system to install, manage and import Community Presets.\n\n \n## 7.0.6\n### 2023-07-28\n\n\n### Features:\n- An \"Experimental Features\" section was added to our preferences window.\n- The native window of the LSP plugins can be used. This is an experimental feature intended only for advanced users. So expect some bugs.\n- Fractional semitone values can now be used in the Pitch Shift effect.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- The input/output device dropdown in our PipeWire tab is updated when the system default device changes and `Use Default` is enabled. This fixes issue https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1989.\n\n### Other notes:\n\n \n## 7.0.5\n### 2023-06-11\n\n\n### Features:\n- A new `Level Meter` plugin based on `libebur128` has been added.\n- The Pitch plugin now uses the library SoundTouch instead of Rubberband. Hopefully some of the mysterious crashes that were happening with Rubbernand are not going to happen anymore.\n- Improved compatibility with recent PipeWire versions. More information at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/pipewire/-/issues/3196\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- Active Equalizer filters are not set to `Bell` type anymore when the number of bands changes.\n\n### Other notes:\n- Rabberband is not a dependency anymore since it has been replaced by SoundTouch.\n\n \n## 7.0.4\n### 2023-05-01\n\n\n### Features:\n- The presets menu now asks for confirmation before saving/deleting a preset file.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- The plugin reset should not make its controls innefective anymore.\n\n### Other notes:\n- Speex is no longer incorrectly listed as a build dependency (speexdsp is still a build dependency)\n- RNNoise is no longer an autodependency. It is now required by default, if not available it must be explicitly disabled with -Denable-rnnoise=false\n\n \n## 7.0.3\n### 2023-04-06\n\n\n### Features:\n- Updated translations.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- A small mistake was done in the last release. Making a new one to make sure people have the right branch in the package\n\n \n## 7.0.2\n### 2023-04-06\n\n\n### Features:\n- The Equalizer \"sort bands\" feature is now ordering bands on GSettings, so the result can be saved into presets.\n- Improved performance when resetting keys.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- Fixed the \"Large Empty Hall\" preset selection in the Reverberation effect.\n- Fixed some misuses of PipeWire's API that can potentially fix some random bugs some users are facing.\n\n### Other notes:\n- As we are removing code deprecated by `GTK 4.10` the minimum GTK version has been increased.\n\n \n## 7.0.1\n### 2023-02-26\n\n\n### Features:\n- The spectrum plugin update rate was improved. Different sampling rates should lead to similar update frequencies visually.\n- The update interval used by level meters and the spectrum can be customized by the user.\n- The equalizer band gain slider value can be updated in larger steps. Fine grain control is still possible through the keyboard up/down keys.\n- Small improvements to the echo canceller.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- The echo canceller probes were not being linked to the soundcard after the move to multiple filters intances. This should be fixed now.\n\n\n \n## 7.0.0\n### 2022-11-02\n\n\n### Features:\n- It is now possible to add more than one filter instance to the effects pipeline.\n- A new `Speech Processor` plugin based on the Speex library was added. Besides providing noise suppression it also can detect voice activity. It is a decent alternative to the cases whre the rnnoise library does not work well.\n- Improved compatibility with Linux Studio Plugins `1.2.3`.\n- GraphicEQ presets can be imported into the Equalizer effect.\n- The application name has been changed to `Easy Effects` to adhere to the naming conventions of GNOME Human Interface Guidelines.\n- The documentation has been updated.\n- Improved presets autoloading.\n- The Autogain silence threshold can now be configured by the user.\n- Dry and wet controls added to the Stereo Tools effect.\n- The echo canceller now has a residual noise suppression control also based on the Speex library.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- When the mouse was hovering over a chart the wrong value for the x axis coordinate was being shown. This regression is fixed.\n\n### Other notes:\n- Because of the new multiple instances feature, the preset format has changed, but the old one is still compatible to be loaded. Anyway take in consideration that saving the current preset will always write it in the new format.\n\n \n## 6.3.0\n### 2022-09-02\n\n\n### Features:\n- Multiband Gate implementation has been migrated from CALF to Linux Studio Plugins.\n- The preset autoloading code compatibility with bluez5 devices has been improved.\n- Wet/dry controls were added for some plugins\n- Effect interface is no longer loaded when the related lv2 plugin is not installed on the system. In its place a status message to the user is shown.\n- The documentation has been updated\n- Improved debug messages\n- Updated translations\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n### Other notes:\n\n \n## 6.2.8\n### 2022-07-25\n\n\n### Features:\n- Improved translations\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- Fixed a bug where EasyEffects could crash when closing its window while effects were being applied.\n\n### Other notes:\n\n \n## 6.2.7\n### 2022-07-18\n\n\n### Features:\n- The bypass state can be saved to the preset file. The reasons why this was done can be seen at https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1039\n- The preset autoloading code compatibility with usb devices has been improved.\n- A dialog is shown to the user when a preset fails to load or a preset/impulse file fails to be imported.\n- The SideChain Gate plugin from `Linux Studio Plugins` is now used instead of the one from Calf Studio.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- EasyEffects should not crash anymore when the user locale is not properly configured.\n- A workaround was implemented in our icon to deal with the lack of proper SVG support in QT.\n\n### Other notes:\n\n \n## 6.2.6\n### 2022-06-22\n\n\n### Features:\n- When effects are disable to an application we now set its target metadata to null. This will allow the media session\n manager (wireplumber) to properly move the stream to a new device.\n- A new configuration option was added. It allows EasyEffects to ignore streams whose purpose is to monitor sink\n devices. This will help to fix some of problems our users were having when using OBS.\n- The code that shows the stream sample format has been improved\n- The rnnoise library is now optional. This should help package maintainers to build\n a Debian package. See https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1000 for more information.\n- Our logs now show the source code line where the messages are being printed\n### Bug fixes:\n- The \"enable effects\" checkbox in our window was not being updated when third party programs like pavucontrol\n moved the stream away from our virtual devices. This should be fixed now.\n- Fixed a crash that could happen when the maximum autogain history was changed.\n- Avoid crashes when pw-mididump is running\n\n \n## 6.2.5\n### 2022-04-30\n\n\n### Features:\n- The interface of the pitch plugin was improved\n- Our application icon is now compatible with desktops that uses QT\n- Our blocklist code will use the `application.id` tag if the stream sets it\n- In order to avoid problems with the mouse scroll the entries in the applications list shown in our `Players/Recorders` tab do not show a volume scale anymore. More details about the problem and the solution for it can be found on https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1211 and https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1427\n- When no application is available for display in the `Players/Recorders` a message will be shown to the user\n- Many translation updates\n### Bug fixes:\n- Fixed a bug where EasyEffects crashed when the number of points displayed in the spectrum was changed while our pipeline was active and the spectrum widget was visible\n- The pipeline latency value displayed in our window could be wrong in some situations. This was fixed.\n\n \n## 6.2.4\n### 2022-03-07\n\n\n### Features:\n- There is a new setting allowing the user to select an inactivity timeout for the pipeline. When no client is playing to or recording from our devices the filters will be unlinked after the timeout is reached. This is done to make sure we do not waste CPU power processing silence.\n- The autogain plugin now allows the user to select which of the three loudness are used to calculate the geometric mean.\n- The autogain plugin now allows the maximum history to be set and does not use `libebur128` histogram mode anymore. This should avoid the cases where the `Integrated` loudness gets stuck forever in the same value.\n- EasyEffects icon has been updated in a way that should make it visible in QT desktops.\n### Bug fixes:\n- The command line option that returns the global bypass state is working again.\n\n \n## 6.2.3\n### 2022-01-29\n\n\n### Features:\n- The crossfeed filter should deal better with PipeWire's dynamic latency switches. Jumps in volume level should not happen anymore in these situations.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- Fixed a bug that prevented mono microphones from properly working with EasyEffects\n\n \n## 6.2.2\n### 2022-01-27\n\n\n### Features:\n- Support for the next PipeWire release `0.3.44`\n- The autogain filter should deal better with PipeWire's dynamic latency switches. Jumps in volume level should not happen anymore in these situations.\n- We added an option that allows the volume and mute state of our virtual devices to be reset when EasyEffects starts. It should help with the cases were our devices are muted by the audio server for unknown reasons.\n- Better support for computer suspending.\n- Updated translations\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- Fixed a bug where trying to create an autoloading profile without having presets caused the application to crash.\n\n \n## 6.2.1\n### 2022-01-05\n\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- Fixed a bug where setting a equalizer band `quality` to `zero` would lead to an application crash.\n\n \n## 6.2.0\n### 2022-01-04\n\n\n### Features:\n- LibAdwaita is used to create some parts of our window and for handling the switching between dark and light themes.\n- The settings menu has been redesigned using LibAdwaita widgets.\n- Equalizer APO preset import feature has been improved to apply not only the Bell filter, but also other supported ones (at the moment only the Bandpass filter is not available in LSP plugin).\n- The `Reset All Settings` function in our menu should work in Flatpak now.\n- We have a new option that allows the user to disable our menus `autohide`. This may help to workaround some bugs Popover menus currently have on gtk4.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- More robust parsing to import APO presets saved with comma as thousands separator in central frequency band.\n\n### Other notes:\n\n- The fmt library is a new dependency https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt. At least while the c++ compilers do not implement its features. This is expected to happen in the next years.\n- GTKMM and GLIBMM are not a dependency anymore. We now use gtk4 directly.\n\n \n## 6.1.5\n### 2021-11-17\n\n\n### Features:\n- It is now possible to combine impulse responses in the Convolver interface. A new impulse file is generated and it should be visible in the impulse list.\n- Improved `x axis` drawings in our plots. Now the number of labels is adjusted dynamically depending on our window width.\n- The documentation has been updated reflecting the new EasyEffects features. Old references about PulseEffects have been removed. The documentation button has been added in the menu section.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- When a spinbutton is filled with an out of range value, now it is updated with the lowest/highest value rather than resetting to the previous one.\n- The application window now remembers the maximized state and restores it on the next opening event.\n\n### Other notes:\n\n- The `tbb` library is a new dependency https://www.threadingbuildingblocks.org\n\n \n## 6.1.4\n### 2021-10-16\n\n\n### Features:\n- The Limiter and the Multiband Compressor plugins can now use an optional external sidechain.\n- The Autogain plugin now allows the user to select which Loudness is used as reference for the volume correction.\n- The APO Profile Import feature of Equalizer plugin now parses the \"Pre Amplification\" parameter.\n- Optional Cubic Volume can be enabled in General Settings.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- The Spectrum plugin was supposed to enter passthrough whenever it was not visible, but this was happening only when our window was closed.\n- Improved support for Assistive Technology.\n- The probes used in some filters like the Compressor and the Limiter were not being relinked after changing the order of the plugins in the pipeline. It should be working now.\n\n \n## 6.1.3\n### 2021-10-03\n\n\n### Features:\n- PipeWire monitor streams are now excluded and removed from the applications list.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- Hopefully crashes like the one reported at https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1172 are fixed.\n- Prevented a case in which Spectrum was crashing.\n- Pavucontrol is not added anymore to input applications list on systems with localization different than English.\n\n \n## 6.1.2\n### 2021-09-20\n\n\n### Features:\n- Improved compatibility with WirePlumber. This is needed to run on systems that decided to use it instead of the built-in PipeWire session manager. More information at https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1144.\n\n \n## 6.1.1\n### 2021-09-17\n\n\n### Features:\n- When trying to add an autoloading profile for a device already in the list its target preset will be updated. This way we can change the profile preset without having to remove and recreating it.\n- The preset autoloading support implementation was redesigned again. It should work on more hardware now. For more information see https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1051.\n- If the Limiter or the Maximizer are set in the last position of the plugin stack, new plugins are added at the second to last position in order to prevent hardware damage on eventually high output level.\n- Removing an application from the blocklist, its previous enabled state is restored.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- Sometimes when removing imported models from the noise reduction plugin the current used model was not properly updated. This should be fixed now.\n- When editing presets files in an external editor, duplicated entries won't be shown in our presets menu.\n- Now the blocklist is correctly set when switching presets.\n- Now the status of the global bypass button is correctly updated when changing plugin stack.\n- Missing icons on the system should not be shown inside the application info UI (if an application icon could not be shown even if you're sure it's correctly installed, please open an issue).\n- Some icons not showing in Plasma DE with Breeze icon theme should appear now.\n\n \n## 6.1.0\n### 2021-08-17\n\n\n### Features:\n- Updated Chinese translation.\n- Updated Italian translation.\n- Added support for the compressor parameter `Boost Amount`\n- The multiband compressor plugin now uses the stereo multiband compressor plugin from Linux Studio Plugins instead of the one from Calf Studio.\n- The limiter plugin now uses the stereo limiter plugin from Linux Studio Plugins instead of the one from Calf Studio.\n- LV2 filters now are spawned in PipeWire graph only when loaded the first time. Once loaded, they remain connected until EasyEffects shutdown.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- The echo canceller sampling rate is now properly set.\n- The threshold parameter from the deesser plugin is now saved to the preset file.\n- Improved band splitting for crystalizer with new default intensity values.\n- Depending on the input gain or output gain values the corresponding level bars could not be aligned.\n- When adding more equalizer bands they are set to `Bell` instead of `Off`.\n- Equalizer APO presets loading is now working properly on locales different than C.\n- Improved linking management between port filter nodes in PipeWire.\n- The crystalizer plugin signal amplification was too high before. It should be within more reasonable levels now.\n\n \n## 6.0.3\n### 2021-07-16\n\n\n### Features:\n- Improved the resampler used in the plugins that require one(like the rnnoise plugin)\n- Updated translations\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- Setting multiple autoloading presets should be fine now\n- Transient windows are now properly set for some plugins dialogs\n- The convolver impulse response menu was improved to workaround an issue where the impulse files was not loaded when only one was available in the menu, see https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/1011\n- Fixed a bug that could make the pitch plugin to not be properly initialized\n- The saturation warning should not displace its neighbor widgets anymore\n- Fixed the locale in a few widgets\n- Fixed wrong alignment in a few widgets\n\n \n## 6.0.2\n### 2021-07-11\n\n\n### Features:\n- The Loudness plugin is being used again for the reasons described at https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/820. This means that http://drobilla.net/plugins/mda/Loudness is an optional dependency again.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- Fixed a segmentation fault that happened when optional dependencies were not installed\n\n \n## 6.0.1\n### 2021-07-09\n\n\n### Features:\n- Improved equalizer interface.\n- Now we use a sidechain LSP compressor that allows the user to select and external source as the sidechain input.\n- We now support the LSP compressor `Boosting` mode.\n- When `split-channels` is enabled in the equalizer the imported APO preset will be applied only to the channel being visualized in the window. This will allow to import different presets for each channel instead of just settings the same values to both.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n\n- Fixed some segmentation faults that could happen when creating a preset autoloading profile or removing presets\n\n \n## 6.0.0\n### 2021-07-07\n\n\n### Features:\n- This is one of the biggest releases that I have ever made. The amount of changes is so big that it is hard to talk about everything here.\n- The following are just the most import ones. People interested on the journey that got us here can take a look at https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/904 and https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/issues/874.\n- The application and its repository have been renamed from PulseEffects to `EasyEffects`\n- gtkmm3 was replaced by gtkmm4\n- Gstreamer was replaced by native PipeWire filters.\n- Many features were reimplemented from scratch. The preset autoloading is one example. Another remarkable change will be seen in the plugins selection menu. Now the user can show in the window only the plugins that he/she wants to use.\n- Boost is no longer a dependency. The price paid for that was a little change in our presets structures. With some patience it is possible to edit PulseEffects presets in a text editor and make them work in EasyEffects. Hopefully someone will come up with a script for this in the feature.\n- New libraries are being used and some of the librarires that were optional before are now required\n"

          "content": "# Introduction to Easy Effects Community Presets\n\nFrom `7.2.0` version, Easy Effects introduces the new system of Community\nPresets which is an easy way for users to try and use presets made by the\ncommunity.\n\nThe Presets menu popover of the graphical application shows an additional tab\nwhere community presets are listed.\nThe difference with Local Presets is that community ones are intended to be\neasily installed since not all users were able to find presets on the internet,\nwhich were practically reported in one of the subpage of the Github project\n(that linked other repositories where the user should manually download them on\nthe local storage).\nNow it should be easier to discover them making a search on the repository or\nyour favorite distribution.\n\nInstead the Local Presets list is intended to save self-made presets and/or a\nselected choice of presets imported by the community list.\nImporting presets locally is essential when the user wants to autoload and\nassociate them to a specific device.\nIndeed, Community Presets **cannot be autoloaded**.\n\nIn order to list the Community Presets, the user should install one or more\npackages made and maintained by other Easy Effects users.\nThe packages can be shipped by Linux distributions in their specific\nrepositories.\n\n# Guidelines for packagers of Easy Effects Community Presets\n\nThe followings are the guidelines that packagers should respect in order to make\ntheir presets available inside Easy Effects.\n\n## How to make a package\n\n- The package should contain an `easyeffects` directory installed under one of\nthe paths listed in the `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` environment variable.\n- The `easyeffects` directory above mentioned may contain the following\nsubfolders:\n- - `output`: for presets files (with `.json` extension) applied to output\ndevices (showed only in the popover of the Output window).\n- - `input`: for presets files (with `.json` extension) applied to input\ndevices (showed only in the popover of the Input window).\n- - `irs`: for impulse response files (with `.irs` extension) used by the\nConvolver effect.\n- - `rnnoise`: for model files (with `.rnnn` extension) used by the\nNoise Reduction effect.\n- The folders above mentioned should contain a subdirectory with the name\nassociated to the installed package. In example:\n- - `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/package-name`\n- The name of the package should be something descriptive e.g.\n`easyeffects-presets-LoudnessEqualizer`. If your package contains a group of\npresets without a particular \"theme\", naming a package\n`easyeffects-USERNAME-presets` is reasonable.\n\n<!--\n### Flatpak\n\nFlatpak extension packages do not use `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`, and instead place and\nsearch for files under a different directory (detailed in examples below).\nBesides this detail, Flatpak and distribution packages should behave the same in\nregard to community presets.\n\nIn order to publish a Flatpak preset package on Flathub you do the following\ngeneral steps:\n\n1. Create AppStream MetaInfo file (should be stored in your preset repository as\nit is not Flatpak-specific).\n2. Create Flatpak json manifest file\n3. Submit to Flathub, described following\n[Flathub's guide](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission/).\n\n#### Step by step instructions\n\n1. Decide on a name. It should be e.g.\n`io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets.PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME`. For example\n`io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets.LoudnessEqualizer` for a specific preset or\n`io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets.wwmm` for a group of presets without a\nparticular \"theme\". The name must be consistent across the files used for\nFlatpak otherwise the package will not build/work properly.\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> Flatpak uses `io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets` as the extension point name\n(which preset packages must use), while `com.github.wwmm.easyeffects` is the\nname of the Easy Effects package itself. This is necessary since `com.github.*`\nis only allowed for backwards compatibility reasons on Flathub, and newer\npackages must use `io.github.*`.\n\n2. Clone the Flathub repo for new submissions following\n[Flathub's guide](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission/).\n\n3. Create the AppStream MetaInfo file, which should go in your preset\nrepository, not the Flathub repository.\nName it `io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets.PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME.metainfo.xml`.\nReplace `PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME`, `PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME_PRETTY`,\n`DEVELOPER_NAME_ID`, `DEVELOPER_NAME`, and `REPO_URL`.\nYou may optionally add more information to this file (which may help improve\nvisibility of the package on Flathub/software stores) as described in the\n[appstream docs](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/).\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<component type=\"addon\">\n  <id>io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets.PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME</id>\n  <extends>com.github.wwmm.easyeffects</extends>\n  <name>PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME_PRETTY Easy Effects Presets</name>\n  <developer id=\"DEVELOPER_NAME_ID\">\n    <name>DEVELOPER_NAME</name>\n  </developer>\n  <summary>Some helpful and brief summary which gives crucial information</summary>\n  <url type=\"homepage\">REPO_URL</url>\n  <url type=\"vcs-browser\">REPO_URL</url>\n  <url type=\"help\">REPO_URL</url>\n  <metadata_license>CC0-1.0</metadata_license>\n  <project_license>MIT</project_license>\n</component>\n```\n\n4. Create the Flatpak manifest file named\n`io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets.PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME.json`, this should go in\nyour Flathub repository. Replace `PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME`, `PRESET_FILE_NAME`,\n`REPO_NAME`, `REPO_URL`, and `LATEST_COMMIT`.\nAn example of `REPO_NAME` is `wwmm/easyeffects` and `REPO_URL` could be\n`https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects.git`.\nYou can add more `install` commands in `build-commands` if you want to install\nmultiple presets. Make sure you carefully install to the correct directory for\neach type of preset, with the options of `input`, `output`, `irs`, and\n`rnnoise`. If the preset repo is not on GitHub remove or replace the\n`x-checker-data` section.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"id\": \"io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets.PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME\",\n    \"runtime\": \"com.github.wwmm.easyeffects\",\n    \"sdk\": \"org.freedesktop.Sdk//23.08\",\n    \"branch\": \"stable\",\n    \"runtime-version\": \"stable\",\n    \"build-extension\": true,\n    \"separate-locales\": false,\n    \"modules\": [\n        {\n            \"name\": \"presets\",\n            \"buildsystem\": \"simple\",\n            \"build-commands\": [\n                \"install -Dm644 io.github.wwmm.easyeffects.Presets.PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME.metainfo.xml -t ${FLATPAK_DEST}/share/metainfo\",\n                \"install -Dm644 PRESET_FILE_NAME.json -t ${FLATPAK_DEST}/input/PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME\",\n                \"install -Dm644 PRESET_FILE_NAME.json -t ${FLATPAK_DEST}/output/PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME\",\n                \"install -Dm644 PRESET_FILE_NAME.json -t ${FLATPAK_DEST}/irs/PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME\",\n                \"install -Dm644 PRESET_FILE_NAME.json -t ${FLATPAK_DEST}/rnnoise/PRESET_PACKAGE_NAME\"\n            ],\n            \"sources\": [\n                {\n                    \"type\": \"git\",\n                    \"url\": \"REPO_URL\",\n                    \"commit\": \"LATEST_COMMIT\",\n                    \"x-checker-data\": {\n                        \"type\": \"json\",\n                        \"url\": \"https://api.github.com/repos/REPO_NAME/commits\",\n                        \"commit-query\": \"first( .[].sha )\",\n                        \"version-query\": \"first( .[].sha )\",\n                        \"timestamp-query\": \"first( .[].commit.committer.date )\"\n                    }\n                }\n            ]\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n```\n\n5. It is also necessary to add the following file called `flathub.json` in the\nFlathub repo. The skip icons check is stricly necessary, since unlike a normal\napp we are not providing icons.\nWe also recommend enabling a Flathub bot to automatically merge PRs with updates\nfrom the upstream repo. Given these are only preset files, this should not be a\nvery risky thing to do and avoids manual maintenance hassle.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"skip-icons-check\": true,\n    \"automerge-flathubbot-prs\": true\n}\n\n```\n\n6. Now you can submit this to Flathub via a PR, following\n[Flathub's instructions](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission/).\n-->\n\n## Guidelines for package directories structure\n\nThe package name should be unique to avoid misunderstandings between different\npackages. Therefore try to use a name which is exclusive to your package.\nEasy Effects can still distinguish and list presets from packages having the\nsame name but installed in different `XDG_DATA_DIR`.\nNevertheless this would confuse users seeing multiple presets with the same\npackage name in the menu list. For this reasons we recommend to try to use\nunique package names.\nSo choose a name that you know it won't be used by other packagers, maybe\nincluding your nickname.\n\nIn example:\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/Digitalone`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/vchernin`\n\n### How Easy Effects looks for Community Presets\nBasically Easy Effects scans every directory with the package name looking for:\n- Files with the `.json` extention.\n- - The packager should take care of the integrity of those `.json` files being\ntext files that can be correctly parsed by the application in order to be loaded\nwithout errors.\n- The scan takes place only in the first and the second level of the directory\nwith the package name. In other words, the presets files contained in the folder\nitself and its subfolder.\n\nIn example, the following presets are correctly loaded and listed:\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets/generic-pop.json`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets/generic-rock.json`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets/device-1/pop.json`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets/device-1/rock.json`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets/device-2/pop.json`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets/device-1/rock.json`\n\nFiles with the wrong extention or presets placed more in depth are not shown.\nIn example, the followings are ignored:\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets/rock.txt`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/output/wwmm-presets/device-3/alternative/rock.json`\n\n### How Easy Effects looks for additional files\nThe package may contain also impulse responses and models for presets with\nConvolver and Noise Reduction (RNNoise) effects.\n\nThey should be placed in the package structure following the same scheme\nreported above. For example:\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/irs/wwmm-presets/impulse.irs`\n- `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects/rnnoise/wwmm-presets/model.rnnn`\n\nFrom version `7.2.0` the mechanism to detect those files has been changed.\nIf you are going to ship a preset containing Convolver and/or RNNoise\nwith specific associated files, make sure to include those files inside the\npackage. But, more importantly, **make sure to build/save the preset with a\nversion >=`7.2.0`**.\n\nMore in detail, Easy Effects presets does not save the path anymore, but only\nthe name of the additional files (without extension).\nPreviously, the path was stored in the preset JSON file as `kernel-path`, and\nnow the replacement key which only stores the name is `kernel-name`.\nSo if you see `kernel-path` in a preset JSON file it probably needs to be\nupdated by saving the preset with a version >=`7.2.0`.\n\nWhen a preset is loaded,\nthe application searches the specified file, first in the local directory,\nthen in `XDG_DATA_DIR/easyeffects`.\nTherefore it's recommended to use a unique name for additional files. If you\nship `model.irs` inside your package and the user has a different impulse\nresponse with the same filename locally, they will listen something different\nwhen trying you preset.\n"

Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.

For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0.

Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\n    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

See [the wiki](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/Package-Repositories) for a full list.\n\n### Flatpak\n\nAlternatively, click here to install via Flatpak:\n\n<a href='https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.wwmm.easyeffects'><img width='240' alt='Download Easy Effects on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.png'/></a>\n\nFlatpak packages support most Linux distributions and are sandboxed. The Easy Effects Flatpak package also includes all available plugins.\n\nIf your distribution does not yet include packages required to build Easy Effects, Flatpak is a convenient option.\n\n## Warning\n\n**Do not set** Easy Effects virtual devices as your default audio input/output.\nEasy Effects is designed assuming that your hardware stays as default device.\n\n## Help\n\nA comprehensive set of help pages are included in the application itself, accessed via the hamburger menu in the top right. If the help pages are inaccessible ensure the [yelp](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/yelp) package is installed.\n\nThe latest version of the help pages can also be [seen here](https://wwmm.github.io/easyeffects).\n\n## Changelog\n\nFor information about changes between versions, take a look at our [changelog](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## Frequently asked questions\n\nTake a look at our [FAQ](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/FAQ) to see\nif you are facing a known issue.\n\n## Community presets\n\nSee the wiki: [Community presets](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/Community-presets)\n\nThis page also has instructions for converting PulseEffects presets to Easy Effects presets.\n\nGuildelines for package maintainers: [Guidelines](COMMUNITY_PRESETS_GUIDELINES.md)\n\n## Command-line options\n\nSee the wiki: [Command Line Options](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/Command-Line-Options)\n\n## GNOME Shell extension\n\nSee the wiki: [Preset Selector GNOME Extension](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/Preset-Selector-GNOME-Extension)\n\n## Reporting bugs\n\nSee the wiki: [Reporting Bugs](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/Reporting-bugs)\n\n## Translating Easy Effects\n\nSee the wiki's [Translating Easy Effects](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/Translating-EasyEffects) article for detailed instructions.\n\n## Installing from source\n\nTo install from source, see the wiki's [Installing from Source](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/Installation-from-Source) article for detailed instructions.\n\n## CI artifacts\n\nFlatpak bundles and Arch packages for testing and development purposes are built for PRs and pushes to master.\nSee the [installation instructions](https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/wiki/Package-Repositories#ci-artifacts).\n\n## License\n\nEasy Effects is licensed under GNU General Public License version 3 or later.
