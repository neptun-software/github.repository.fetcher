          "content": "**Why a set coding style is important** <br>\nThis project is an open source project. To get open source working as intended, many people should be able to comprehend the code. This implies that there is a well documented and uniform flow of code.\nThat does not necessarily mean that a contributor should not write optimised yet cryptic code - one should always care about performance.  However, other developers need to understand the code which means complicated parts of code **must** have good documentation.\n\n**Why we require that EVERYTHING is documented**<br>\nWhat is simple to some might appear very complicated to others. Documentation helps these others. Anyone should be able to improve the code. But the main reason is, that when patch contributors want their patches added to the common codebase, the code needs to be reviewed by one or more developers. Documentation makes reviewing much easier.\n\n## Coding style for OpenTTD\n### Functions\n* Function names use [CamelCase](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelcase) without underscores.\n* Opening curly bracket **{** for a function starts on the next line.\n* Use Foo() instead of Foo(void).\n* Prefer using \"const\" for reference and compound parameters when appropriate.\n* If a member function can be a const function, make it so.\n```c++\nvoid ThisIsAFunction()\n{\n}\n```\n\n### Variables\n* Variable names are all lowercase, and use \"_\" as separator.\n* Global variables are preceded by an underscore. (\"_\") Use descriptive names because leading underscores are often used for system / compiler variables.\n* Own members of classes should always be referenced using \"this->\"\n* Pointers and references should have their reference symbol next to the name (compatibility with current code).\n* Variables that are declared below one another should have their type, name or reference operator, and assignment operator aligned by spaces.\n* There are set names for many variables. Those are (but not limited to): Vehicle *u, *v, *w; Station *st; Town *t; Window *w; Engine *e.\n* For multiple instances, use numbers \"*t1, *t2\" or postfixes \"*st_from, *st_to\".\n* Declare variables upon first usage.\n* Declare iterators in their loop.\n* There is a space between '*' and 'const' in \"const pointers\"\n```c++\nint     number         = 10;\nVehicle *u_first_wagon = v->next;\nint     value          = v->value;\n\nuint32 _global_variable = 3750;\n\nstatic const char * const _global_array[] = {\n\t\"first string\",\n\t\"second string\",\n\t\"another string\",\n\t\"last string followed by comma\",\n};\n\nprotected:\n\tchar protected_array[10];\n\nfor (int i = 0;;);\n```\n\n* Give the variables expedient names, this increases the readability of the code\n```c++\nbool is_maglev_train = true;\nif (!is_maglev_train) DoSomething();\n```\n\n* Some people like to introduce copies of variables to increase readability, which can waste memory. However, in some cases, especially in code pieces which are often called, it makes sense to cache some calculated variables.\n```c++\n/* Unoptimized code:\n * foo is not touched inside the loop!\n */\nfor (uint8 i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {\n\t/* Do something */\n\tif (value_to_check == (foo * 4) % 5 + 6) DoSomething();\n\t/* Do something else */\n}\n\n/* Better:\n * The used value of foo is calculated outside the loop.\n */\nconst uint32 bar = (foo * 4) % 5 + 6;\nfor (uint8 i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {\n\t/* Do something */\n\tif (value_to_check == bar) DoSomething();\n\t/* Do something else */\n}\n```\n\n### Enumerations / static consts\n* Enumerations store integers that belong logically together (railtypes, string IDs, etc.).\n* Enumeration names also use CamelCase.\n* Unscoped enumerators are all caps with \"_\" between the words.\n* Scoped enumerators are use CamelCase.\n* Enums are not used to store single numbers.\n* Enums have consecutive numbers OR\n* Enums have consecutive powers of two. Powers of two (bits) are written in hex or with the shift operator.\n* Enums may have special enumerators: \"_BEGIN\", \"\\_END\", and \"INVALID\\_\").  See example.\n* The invalid always has 0xFF, 0xFFFF, 0xFFFFFFFF as a value.\n* Other special values are consecutively less than the invalid.\n* Variables that hold enumerators should have the type of the enumeration.\n```c++\nenum DiagDirection {\n\tDIAGDIR_BEGIN = 0,\n\tDIAGDIR_NE  = 0,\n\tDIAGDIR_SE  = 1,\n\tDIAGDIR_SW  = 2,\n\tDIAGDIR_NW  = 3,\n\tDIAGDIR_END,\n\tINVALID_DIAGDIR = 0xFF,\n\tBROKEN_DIAGDIR = 0xFE,\n};\n\nenum {\n\tDEPOT_SERVICE       = (1 << 0),\n\tDEPOT_MASS_SEND     = (1 << 1),\n\tDEPOT_DONT_CANCEL   = (1 << 2),\n\tDEPOT_LOCATE_HANGAR = (1 << 3),\n};\n\nDiagDirection enterdir = DIAGDIR_NE;\n```\n\n* Numbers that store single or uncorrelated data are static consts. Those may use the naming conventions of enums.\nExample:\n```c++\nstatic const int MAXIMUM_STATIONS = 42;\n```\n\n* Enums are useful in GUI code: When widgets are enumerated, they are easier to access during many operations. Additionally changes caused by modified widget sequences require less code adapting. If a widget is used like this, its enum name should be present in a comment behind the corresponding widget definition.\n```c++\n/** Enum referring to the widgets of the build rail depot window */\nenum BuildRailDepotWidgets {\n\tBRDW_CLOSEBOX = 0,\n\tBRDW_CAPTION,\n\tBRDW_BACKGROUND,\n\tBRDW_DEPOT_NE,\n\tBRDW_DEPOT_SE,\n\tBRDW_DEPOT_SW,\n\tBRDW_DEPOT_NW,\n};\n/* ... */\n/** Widget definition of the build rail depot window */\nstatic const Widget _build_depot_widgets[] = {\n{   WWT_CLOSEBOX,   RESIZE_NONE,     7,     0,    10,     0,    13, STR_00C5, STR_..},   // BRDW_CLOSEBOX\n{    WWT_CAPTION,   RESIZE_NONE,     7,    11,   139,     0,    13, STR_...,  STR_...},  // BRDW_CAPTION\n{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,     7,     0,   139,    14,   121, 0x0,      STR_NULL}, // BRDW_BACKGROUND\n{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,    71,   136,    17,    66, 0x0,      STR_..},   // BRDW_DEPOT_NE\n{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,    71,   136,    69,   118, 0x0,      STR_..},   // BRDW_DEPOT_SE\n{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,     3,    68,    69,   118, 0x0,      STR_..},   // BRDW_DEPOT_SW\n{      WWT_PANEL,   RESIZE_NONE,    14,     3,    68,    17,    66, 0x0,      STR_..},   // BRDW_DEPOT_NW\n{   WIDGETS_END},\n};\n```\n\n* Comments on the enum values should start with \"///<\" to enable doxygen documentation\n```c++\nenum SomeEnumeration {\n\tSE_BEGIN = 0,        ///< Begin of the enumeration, used for iterations\n\tSE_FOO = 0,          ///< Used for xy\n\tSE_BAR,              ///< Another value of the enumeration\n\tSE_SUB,              ///< Special case for z\n\tSE_END,              ///< End of the enumeration, used for iterations\n};\n```\n\n### Control flow\n* Put a space before the parentheses in **if**, **switch**, **for** and **while** statements.\n* Use curly braces and put the contained statements on their own lines (e.g., don't put them directly after the **if**).\n* Opening curly bracket **{** stays on the first line, closing curly bracket **}** gets a line to itself (except for the **}** preceding an **else**, which should be on the same line as the **else**).\n* When only a single statement is contained, the brackets can be omitted. In this case, put the single statement on the same line as the preceding keyword (**if**, **while**, etc.). Note that this is only allowed for if statements without an **else** clause.\n* Non-trivial fall throughs must be documented, using a `[[fallthrough]]` attribute.\n* The NOT_REACHED() macro can be used in default constructs that should never be reached.\n* Unconditional loops are written with **`for (;;) {`**\n\n```c++\nif (a == b) {\n\tFoo();\n} else {\n\tBar();\n}\n\nif (very_large_checks &&\n\t\tspread_over_two_lines) {\n\tFoo();\n}\n\nif (a == b) Foo();\n\nswitch (a) {\n\tcase 0: DoSomethingShort(); break;\n\n\tcase 1:\n\t\tDoSomething();\n\t\t[[fallthrough]];\n\n\tcase 2:\n\t\tDoMore();\n\t\tb = a;\n\t\tbreak;\n\n\tcase 3: {\n\t\tint r = 2;\n\n\t\tDoEvenMore(a);\n\t\t[[fallthrough]];\n\t}\n\n\tcase 4: {\n\t\tint q = 345;\n\n\t\tDoIt();\n\t\tbreak;\n\t}\n\n\tdefault:\n\t\tNOT_REACHED();\n}\n\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n\tFoo();\n\tBar();\n}\n```\n\n### Classes\n* Classes names also use CamelCase.\n* Classes should have \"public\", \"protected\", and \"private\" sections.\n* Within these section the order is: types, static const members, static members, members, constructors / destructors, static methods, methods.\n* Deviations from above order are allowed when the code dictates it (e.g. a static const is needed for a typedef)\n* Methods and members ought to be grouped logically.\n* All those sorting rules sometimes conflict which one another. Please use common sense what increases legibility of the code in such a case.\n* The method implementation should indicate if it is virtual or similar by using a comment.\n* Very short methods can have one-line definition (if defined in the class scope).\n```c++\nclass ThisIsAClass {\npublic:\n\ttypedef Titem_   *ItemPtr;\nprivate:\n\tstatic const int MAX_SIZE = 500;\n\tint              size;\n\tItemPtr          *items;\n\npublic:\n\texplicit ThisIsAClass();\n\t~ThisIsAClass();\n\n\tint GetSize() { return this->size; }\n\tvirtual void Method();\n};\n\n/*virtual*/ void Class::Method()\n{\n\tthis->size *= 2;\n}\n```\n\n### Templates\nTemplates are a very powerful C++ tool, but they can easily confuse beginners. Thus:\n* Templates are to be documented in a very clear and verbose manner. Never assume anything in the documentation.\n* the template keyword and the template layout get a separate line. typenames are either \"T\" or preceded by a \"T\", integers get a single capital letter or a descriptive name preceded by \"T\".\n```c++\ntemplate <typename T, typename Tsomething, int N, uint8_t Tnumber_of_something>\nint Func();\n```\n\n* If you are writing one or more template class in the dedicated header file, use file.hpp for its name instead of file.h. This will let others know that it is template library (includes also implementation), not just header with declarations.\n\n### Code Comment Vertical Alignment\n\nWhen adding code or comments to an existing formatted section, follow the existing style if possible without editing the preexisting lines.\n\nIf your addition cannot be aligned with existing code, do not align the comments with anything and use only a single space between the code and the comment.\n\nGood:\n\n```c++\nenum Vehicle {\n\tBUS,  ///< Take the bus.\n+\tCAR,  ///< Drive your car.\n\tBIKE, ///< Ride your bike\n+\tTRAIN, ///< Catch the train.\n}\n```\n\n\"Car\" is shorter than Bike which allows you to easily align the new comment. \"Train\" is longer.  It is *NOT* desirable to change the vertical comment alignment of this enum.\n\nBad:\n\n```c++\nenum Vehicle {\n-\tBUS,  ///< Take the bus.\n-\tBIKE, ///< Ride your bike\n+\tBUS,   ///< Take the bus.\n+\tCAR,   ///< Drive your car.\n+\tBIKE,  ///< Ride your bike\n+\tTRAIN, ///< Catch the train.\n}\n```\n\nOpenTTD used to vertically-align inline Doxygen comments as shown above. OpenTTD has since stopped strictly following this rule to keep diffs smaller and reduce pollution to the git blame history for non-functional changes.\n\n### Other important rules\n* Put a space before and after binary operators: \"a + b\", \"a == b\", \"a & b\", \"a <<= b\", etc.. Exceptions are \".\", \"->\" and \"[]\" (no spaces) and \",\" (just space after it).\n* Put parenthesis where it improves readability: \"*(b++)\" instead of \"*b++\", and \"if ((a & b) && c == 2)\" instead of \"if (a & b && c == 2)\".\n* Do not put external declarations in implementation (i.e. cpp) files.\n* Do not typedef enums and structs.\n* Don't treat non-flags as flags: use \"if (char_pointer != nullptr && *char_pointer != '\\0')\", not \"if (char_pointer && *char_pointer)\".\n* Use \"free(p)\" instead of \"if (p != nullptr) free(p)\". \"free(nullptr)\" doesn't hurt anyone.\n* No trailing whitespace. The Github workflows will not allow tabs or space on the end of lines.\n* Only use tabs to indent from the start of the line.\n* Line length is unlimited. In practice it may be useful to split a long line. When splitting, add two tabs in front of the second part.\n* The '#' of preprocessor instructions goes into the first column of a line. Indenting is done after the '#' (using tabs again).\n* Use /* */ for single line comments.\n* Use // at the end of a command line to indicate comments.\n** However, use /* */ after # preprocessor statements as // causes warnings in some compilers and/or might have unwanted side effects.\n* C++ is defined using the ASCII character set. Do not use other character sets, not even in comments.\n* OpenTTD includes some Objective-C sources (*.mm, used by OSX), which has a special object method invocation syntax: \"[ obj doStuff:foo ]\". Please use spaces on the inside of the brackets to differentiate from the C array syntax.\n\n## Documentation\nWe use [Doxygen](http://doxygen.org/) to automatically generate documentation from the source code. It scans the source files for *recognizable* comments.\n* **Make your comments recognizable.**\nDoxygen only comments starting with the following style:\n```c++\n/**\n///<\n```\n\nUse /** for multi-line comment blocks. Use ///< for single line comments for variables. Use //!< for single-line comments in the NoAI .hpp files.\nFor comments blocks inside a function always use /* */ or //. Use // only if the comment is on the same line as an instruction, otherwise use /* */.\n\n### Files\n* Put a @file command in a JavaDoc style comment at the start of the file, followed by a description.\n```c++\n/**\n * @file\n * This is the brief description.\n * This is the detailed description here and on the following lines.\n */\n```\n> ### Warning\n> If a file lacks a **file comment block** then NO entities in that file will be documented by Doxygen!\n\n### Functions\n* The documentation should be as close to the actual code as possible to maximise the chance of staying in sync.\n\t* Comments for functions go in the .cpp file.\n\t* Comments for inlines go in the .h/.hpp file.\n* Small inlines can have a short 3 or 4 line JavaDoc style comment.\n* Completely document larger functions.\n* Document obvious parameters and return values too!\n\n```c++\n/**\n * A brief explanation of what the function does and/or what purpose it serves.\n * Then follows a more detailed explanation of the function that can span multiple lines.\n *\n * @param foo Explanation of the foo parameter\n * @param bar Explanation of the bar parameter\n * @return The sum of foo and bar (@return can be omitted if the return type is void)\n *\n * @see SomeOtherFunc()\n * @see SOME_ENUM\n *\n * @bug Some bug description\n * @bug Another bug description which continues in the next line\n *           and ends with the following blank line\n *\n * @todo Some to-do entry\n */\nstatic int FooBar(int foo, int bar)\n{\n\treturn foo + bar;\n}\n```\n\n### Classes\n* Document structs similarly to functions:\n```c++\n/**\n * A short description of the struct.\n * More detailed description of the its usage.\n *\n * @see [link to anything of interest]\n */\nstruct foo {\n}\n```\n\n### JavaDoc structural commands\n\nThis table shows the commands you should use with OpenTTD.  The full list is [here](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/commands.html).\n\n| Command | Action | Example |\n| ------- | -------- | ------- |\n| **@attention** | Starts a paragraph where a message that needs attention may be entered. The paragraph will be indented. | @attention Whales crossing! |\n| **@brief** | Starts a paragraph that serves as a brief description. For classes and files the brief description will be used in lists and at the start of the documentation page. For class and file members, the brief description will be placed at the declaration of the member and prepended to the detailed description. A brief description may span several lines (although it is advised to keep it brief!). | @brief This is the brief description. |\n| **@bug** | Starts a paragraph where one or more bugs may be reported. The paragraph will be indented. Multiple adjacent @bug commands will be joined into a single paragraph. Each bug description will start on a new line. Alternatively, one @bug command may mention several bugs. | @bug Memory leak in here? |\n| **@note** | Starts a paragraph where a note can be entered. The paragraph will be indented. | @note Might be slow |\n| **@todo** | Starts a paragraph where a TODO item is described. The description will also add an item to a separate TODO list. The two instances of the description will be cross-referenced. Each item in the TODO list will be preceded by a header that indicates the origin of the item. | @todo Better error checking |\n| **@warning** | Starts a paragraph where one or more warning messages may be entered. The paragraph will be indented. | @warning Not thread safe! |\n| | <small>**Function related commands**</small> | |\n| **@return** | Starts a return value description for a function. | @return a character pointer |\n| **@param** | Starts a parameter description for a function parameter with name <parameter-name>. Followed by a description of the parameter. The existence of the parameter is checked and a warning is given if the documentation of this (or any other) parameter is missing or not present in the function declaration or definition.<br><br>The @param command has an optional attribute specifying the direction of the attribute. Possible values are \"in\" and \"out\". | @param  n    The number of bytes to copy<br>@param[out] dest The memory area to copy to.<br>@param[in]  src  The memory area to copy from. |\n| **@see** | Starts a paragraph where one or more cross-references to classes, functions, methods, variables, files or URL may be specified. Two names joined by either :: or # are understood as referring to a class and one of its members. One of several overloaded methods or constructors may be selected by including a parenthesized list of argument types after the method name. [Here](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/autolink.html) you can find detailed information about this feature. | @see OtherFunc() |\n| **@b** | Displays the following word using a bold font. Equivalent to &lt;b&gt;word&lt;/b&gt;. To put multiple words in bold use &lt;b&gt;multiple words&lt;/b&gt;.| ...@b this and @b that... |\n| **@c / @p** | Displays the parameter <word> using a typewriter font. You can use this command to refer to member function parameters in the running text. To have multiple words in typewriter font use &lt;tt&gt;multiple words&lt;/tt&gt;. | ... the @p x and @p y coordinates are used to... |\n| **@arg / @li** | This command has one argument that continues until the first blank line or until another @arg / @li is encountered. The command can be used to generate a simple, not nested list of arguments. Each argument should start with an @arg / @li command. | @arg @c AlignLeft left alignment.<br>@arg @c AlignCenter center alignment.<br>@arg @c AlignRight right alignment |\n| **@n** | Forces a new line. Equivalent to and inspired by the printf function. |@n |\n\n### More on Doxygen and JavaDoc\n\nDoxygen knows two different kinds of comments:\n* *Brief descriptions*: one-liners that describe the function roughly ([example](http://docs.openttd.org/annotated.html))\n* *Detailed descriptions*: as the name suggests, these contain the detailed function/purpose of the entity they describe ([example](http://docs.openttd.org/structBridge.html))\n\nYou can omit either one or put them into different places but there's only one brief and one detailed description allowed for the same entity.\n\nDoxygen knows three modes for documenting an entity:\n* Before the entity\n* After the entity\n* In a different file\n\nThe latter is a little harder to maintain since the prototype of the entity it describes then is stored in several places (e.g. the .h file and the file with the descriptions). Also while it makes the code easier to read it also makes it easier to omit the important step of updating the description of an entity if it was changed - and we all know why that shouldn't happen ;)<br>\nBecause of those reasons, we will only use the first two documentation schemes.\n\n\nDoxygen supports both Qt and JavaDoc comment styles:\n* Qt style example: **int i; //!< The counter for the main loop**\n* JavaDoc style example: **int i; /*\\*< The counter for the main loop \\*/**\n\nIt also supports more comment styles but those two are the ones which are standardized. For OTTD we'll be using the JavaDoc style. One of the reasons is that it has a feature that the Qt style doesn't offer: JavaDoc style comment blocks will automatically start a brief description which ends at the first dot followed by a space or new line. Everything after that will also be part of the detailed description.\n\nThe general structure of a JavaDoc style comment is\n```c++\n/**\n * This is the brief description. And this sentence contains some further explanations that will appear in the detailed description only.\n */\n```\n\nand the resulting descriptions of that block would be:\n* *Brief description*: This is the brief description.\n* *Detailed description*: This is the brief description. And this sentence contains some further explanations that will appear in the detailed description only.\n\nThe distinction between the brief and detailed descriptions is made by the dot followed by a space/newline, so if you want to use that inside the brief description you need to escape the space/newline:\n```c++\n/**\n * This is a brief description (e.g.\\ using only a few words). Details go here.\n */\n```\n\nIf you're doing a one-line comment, use:\n```c++\nint i; ///< This is the description.\n```\n\nAlso in the comment block you can include so-called structural commands which tell Doxygen what follows. In general, their area of effect begins after the command word and ends when a blank line or some other command is encountered. Also, multiple occurrences of the same structural command within a comment block or the referring entity will be joined in the documentation output usually.\n\n## Commit message\nTo achieve a coherent whole and to make changelog writing easier, here are some guidelines for commit messages.\nThere is a check-script on the git server (also available for clients, see below) to make sure we all follow those rules.\n\nThe first line of a message must match:\n```\n<keyword>( #<issue>|<commit>(, (#<issue>|<commit>))*)?: ([<component>])? <details>\n```\n\nKeywords can either be player-facing, NewGRF / Script author-facing, or developer-facing.\n\nFor player-facing changes, we have these keywords:\n* Feature: Adding a significant new functionality to the game. This can be small in code-size, but is meant for the bigger things from a player perspective.\n* Add: Similar to Feature, but for small functionalities.\n* Change: Changing existing behaviour to an extent the player needs to know about it.\n* Fix: Fixing an issue with the game (as seen by the player).\n* Remove: Completely removing a functionality.\n* Revert: Reverting an earlier Feature / Add / Change / Fix / Remove.\n* Doc: Update to (player-facing) documentation, like in the `docs/` folder etc.\n* Update: Translator commits.\n\nFor NewGRF / Script author-facing changes, we use the same keywords as player-facing changes, followed by `[NewGRF]` / `[Script]` component.\nThis also means the commit is aimed (and worded) towards the NewGRF / Script authors, rather than players.\n\nFor developer-facing changes, we have these keywords:\n* Codechange: Changes to the code the player is not going to notice. Refactors, modernization, etc.\n* Cleanup: Similar to Codechange, but when it is more about removing old code, rather than an actual change.\n* Codefix: Fixing problems in earlier commits that the player is not actually going to notice. Wrong comments, missing files, CI changes.\n\nIf you commit a `Fix` for an [issue](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues), add the corresponding issue number in the form of #NNNNN.\n\nIn the case of `Fix`es, if you know the hash of the commit in which the bug was introduced (eg regression), please mention that hash (the first 7 characters) as well just after the keyword (or, if present, after the issue number).\nFinding the trouble-causing commit is highly encouraged as it makes backporting / branching / releases that much easier.\n\nDo not mention two keywords; if two apply, pick one that best represents the commit (for example, \"Fix #123\" is mostly always better than \"Revert\", even if both are true).\n\nThe `<details>` part starts with a capital and does not end with a dot.\nTry to be descriptive to what the player will notice, not to what is actually being changed in the code.\nSee `changelog.md` for inspiration.\n\nTo further structure the changelog, you can add components. Example are:\n* \"Network\" for network specific changes.\n* \"NewGRF\" for NewGRF additions.\n* \"Script\" for AI / GS additions.\n* \"YAPF\", \"NPF\", for changes in these features.\n* \"MacOS\", \"Linux\", \"Windows\", for OS-specific changes.\n* \"CI\", \"CMake\", for changes to the (build) infrastructure.\n\nFurther explanations, more details, etc. don't go into the first line. Use a new line for those.\n\nComplete examples:\n* `Fix: [YAPF] Infinite loop in pathfinder`\n* `Fix #5926: [YAPF] Infinite loop in pathfinder`\n* `Codefix 80dffae: Warning about unsigned unary minus`\n* `Fix #6673, 99bb3a9: Store the map variety setting in the savegame`\n* `Codefix #5922: ClientSizeChanged is only called via WndProcGdi which already has the mutex`\n* `Codechange #1264, #2037, #2038, #2110: Rewrite the autoreplace kernel`\n\n\n## Other tips\n### Remove trailing whitespace\nTo find out if/where you have trailing whitespace, you can use the following (unix/bash) command:\n```\ngrep -n -R --include \"*.[ch]\" '[ \t]$' * | grep --invert-match \".diff\" | grep --invert-match \".patch\"\n```\nAutomatically removing whitespace is also possible with the following shell script (Note that it only checks .c, .cpp, .h, .hpp and .mm files):\n```\n#!/bin/sh\nIFS='\n'\nfor i in Makefile `find . -name \\*.c -o -name \\*.cpp -o -name \\*.h -o -name \\*.hpp -o -name \\*.mm`\ndo\n  (\n\techo '%s/[ \t]\\{1,\\}$/'\n\techo w\n\techo q\n  ) | ed $i 2> /dev/null > /dev/null\ndone\n```\n\n### Install the client-side git commit hooks\n\nThe client-side hooks perform various checks when you commit changes locally.\n* Whitespace and indentation checks.\n* **Coding style** checks.\n\nGet the hooks:\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD-git-hooks.git openttd_hooks\n```\n\nInstall the hooks, assuming \"openttd\" is your work tree folder:\n```\ncd openttd/.git/hooks\nln -s -t . ../../../openttd_hooks/hooks/*\n```\n\n"

          "content": "# Compiling OpenTTD\n\n## Required/optional libraries\n\nOpenTTD makes use of the following external libraries:\n\n- (encouraged) breakpad: creates minidumps on crash\n- (encouraged) zlib: (de)compressing of old (0.3.0-1.0.5) savegames, content downloads,\n   heightmaps\n- (encouraged) liblzma: (de)compressing of savegames (1.1.0 and later)\n- (encouraged) libpng: making screenshots and loading heightmaps\n- (optional) liblzo2: (de)compressing of old (pre 0.3.0) savegames\n\nFor Linux, the following additional libraries are used:\n\n- (encouraged) libcurl: content downloads\n- libSDL2: hardware access (video, sound, mouse)\n- libfreetype: loading generic fonts and rendering them\n- libfontconfig: searching for fonts, resolving font names to actual fonts\n- harfbuzz: handling of right-to-left scripts (e.g. Arabic and Persian) (required libicu)\n- libicu: handling of right-to-left scripts (e.g. Arabic and Persian) and\n   natural sorting of strings\n\nIf you are building a dedicated-server only, you don't need the last four.\n\nOpenTTD does not require any of the libraries to be present, but without\nliblzma you cannot open most recent savegames and without zlib you cannot\nopen most older savegames or use the content downloading system.\n\n## Windows\n\nYou need Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or more recent.\n\nYou can download the free Visual Studio Community Edition from Microsoft at\nhttps://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/.\n\nOpenTTD needs the Platform SDK, if it isn't installed already. This can be\ndone during installing Visual Studio, by selecting\n`Visual C++ MFC for x86 and x64` (and possibly\n`Visual C++ ATL for x86 and x64` depending on your version). If not, you\ncan get download it as [MS Windows Platform SDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk).\n\nInstall the SDK by following the instructions as given.\n\nDependencies for OpenTTD on Windows are handled via\n[vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/). First you need to install vcpkg\nby following the `Quick Start` instructions of their\n[README](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/blob/master/README.md).\n\nAfter this, you can install the dependencies OpenTTD needs. We advise to use\nthe `static` versions, and OpenTTD currently needs the following dependencies:\n\n- breakpad\n- liblzma\n- libpng\n- lzo\n- zlib\n\nTo install both the x64 (64bit) and x86 (32bit) variants (though only one is necessary), you can use:\n\n```ps\n.\\vcpkg install --triplet=x64-windows-static\n.\\vcpkg install --triplet=x86-windows-static\n```\n\nYou can open the folder (as a CMake project). CMake will be detected, and you can compile from there.\nIf libraries are installed but not found, you need to set VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET in CMake parameters.\nFor Visual Studio 2022 you also need to set CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE.\n(Typical values are shown in the MSVC project file command line example)\n\nAlternatively, you can create a MSVC project file via CMake. For this\neither download CMake from https://cmake.org/download/ or use the version\nthat comes with vcpkg. After that, you can run something similar to this:\n\n```powershell\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake.exe .. -G\"Visual Studio 17 2022\" -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=\"<location of vcpkg>\\vcpkg\\scripts\\buildsystems\\vcpkg.cmake\" -DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=\"x64-windows-static\"\n```\n\nChange `<location of vcpkg>` to where you have installed vcpkg. After this\nin the build folder are MSVC project files. MSVC can rebuild the project\nfiles himself via the `ZERO_CHECK` project.\n\n## All other platforms\nMinimum required version of CMake is 3.16.\nBy default this produces a Debug build with assertations enabled.\nThis is a far slower build than release builds.\n\n```bash\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ..\nmake\n```\n\nFor more information on how to use CMake (including how to make Release builds),\nwe urge you to read [their excellent manual](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/user-interaction/index.html).\n\n## CMake Options\n\nVia CMake, several options can be influenced to get different types of\nbuilds.\n\n- `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo`: build a release build. This is\n   significantly faster than a debug build, but has far less useful information\n   in case of a crash.\n- `-DOPTION_DEDICATED=ON`: build OpenTTD without a GUI. Useful if you are\n   running a headless server, as it requires less libraries to operate.\n- `-DOPTION_USE_ASSERTS=OFF`: disable asserts. Use with care, as assert\n   statements capture early signs of trouble. Release builds have them\n   disabled by default.\n- `-DOPTION_TOOLS_ONLY=ON`: only build tools like `strgen`. Does not build\n   the game itself. Useful for cross-compiling.\n\n## Supported compilers\n\nEvery compiler that is supported by CMake and supports C++20, should be\nable to compile OpenTTD. As the exact list of compilers changes constantly,\nwe refer to the compiler manual to see if it supports C++20, and to CMake\nto see if it supports your compiler.\n\n## Compilation of base sets\n\nTo recompile the extra graphics needed to play with the original Transport\nTycoon Deluxe graphics you need GRFCodec (which includes NFORenum) as well.\nGRFCodec can be found at\nhttps://www.openttd.org/downloads/grfcodec-releases/latest.html.\n\nHaving GRFCodec installed can cause regeneration of the `.grf` files, which\nare written in the source directory. This can leave your repository in a\nmodified state, as different GRFCodec versions can cause binary differences\nin the resulting `.grf` files. Also translations might have been added for\nthe base sets which are not yet included in the base set information files.\nTo avoid this behaviour, disable GRFCodec (and NFORenum) in CMake cache\n(`GRFCODEC_EXECUTABLE` and `NFORENUM_EXECUTABLE`).\n\n## Developers settings\n\nYou can control some flags directly via `CXXFLAGS` (any combination\nof these flags will work fine too):\n\n- `-DRANDOM_DEBUG`: this helps with debugging desyncs.\n- `-fno-inline`: this avoids creating inline functions; this can make\n  debugging a lot easier.\n- `-O0`: this disables all optimizations; this can make debugging a\n  lot easier.\n- `-p`: this enables profiling.\n\nAlways use a clean buildfolder if you changing `CXXFLAGS`, as this\nvalue is otherwise cached. Example use:\n\n`CXXFLAGS=\"-fno-inline\" cmake ..`\n"

Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.\n\n* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of \"+1\" or \":thumbsup:\".\nUse [GitHub's \"reactions\" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments) instead.\nWe reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.\n\n* Please **do not** open issues or pull requests regarding add-on content in NewGRF, GameScripts, AIs, etc.\nThese are created by third-parties.  Please try [irc](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Development/IRC%20channel), [Discord](https://discord.gg/openttd), or the [forums](https://www.tt-forums.net/) to discuss these.\n\n* Please use [the web translator](https://translator.openttd.org/) to submit corrections and improvements to translations of the game.\n\n\n## Bug reports\n\nA bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.\nGood bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!\n\nGuidelines for bug reports:\n\n0. Please don't report issues with games where you changed NewGRFs mid-game. (This can be verified with the `gamelog` console command in-game.)\n\n1. Please don't report issues with modified versions of OpenTTD (patchpacks, unofficial ports, and similar).\n\n2. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been\nreported.\n\n3. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest `nightly` build of OpenTTD, available from https://www.openttd.org\n\n4. **Isolate the problem** — ideally create reproducible steps with an attached savegame and screenshots. Try to use few or no NewGRFs, AIs etc if possible.\n\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information.\nPlease try to be as detailed as possible in your report.\n\n* What is your environment?\n* What steps will reproduce the issue?\n* Which operating system(s) experience the problem?\n* What would you expect to be the outcome?\n\nAll these details will help people to fix any potential bugs.\n\nExample:\n\n> Short and descriptive example bug report title\n>\n> A summary of the issue and the OS environment in which it occurs. If\n> suitable, include the steps required to reproduce the bug.\n>\n> 1. This is the first step\n> 2. This is the second step\n> 3. Further steps, etc.\n>\n> Attached savegame\n> Attached screenshots showing the issue\n> Crashlogs if the bug causes a crash\n>\n> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being\n> reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as\n> causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their\n> merits).\n\n\n## Feature requests\n\nBefore opening a feature request, please take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the [scope and goals](./CONTRIBUTING.md#project-goals) of the project.\n\nIt's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature.\n\nPlease provide as much detail and context as possible.\nThis means don't request for a solution, but describe the problem you see and how/why you think it should be fixed.\n\nFor feature request we have a strict policy.\n\nKeeping issues around with \"a good idea\" or \"not really a bug but we should maybe fix it\" turns out to have the reversed effect: nobody looks at it anymore.\n\nAlthough we really appreciate feedback and ideas, we will close feature requests that we don't expect to fulfill in the next year.\n\nMany of those ideas etc do have a place on the [forums](https://www.tt-forums.net); and if enough people like it, someone will stand up and make it.\n\nIt's usually best to discuss on [Discord](https://discord.gg/openttd) before opening a feature request or working on a large feature in a fork.\nDiscussion can take time, but it can be productive and avoid disappointment. :)\n\n\n## Pull requests\n\nGood pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic help.\n\nPull requests should fit with the [goals of the project](./CONTRIBUTING.md#project-goals).\n\n**Please do ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g. implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language), otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the project's developers might not want to merge into the project.\n\nEvery pull request should have a clear scope, with no unrelated commits.\n\n[Code style](./CODINGSTYLE.md) must be complied with for pull requests to be accepted; this also includes [commit message format](./CODINGSTYLE.md#commit-message).\n\nAdhering to the following process is the best way to get your work included in the project:\n\n1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the project, clone your fork, and configure the remotes:\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/<your-username>/OpenTTD.git openttd\ngit clone https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD-git-hooks.git openttd_hooks\ncd openttd\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD.git\ncd .git/hooks\nln -s ../../../openttd_hooks/hooks/* .\n```\n\n2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:\n\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\n```\n\n3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to\ncontain your feature, change, or fix:\n\n```bash\ngit checkout upstream/master -b <topic-branch-name>\n```\n\n4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit message guidelines](./CODINGSTYLE.md#commit-message) or your code is unlikely to be merged into the main project.\nUse Git's [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-rebase) feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.\n\n5. Locally rebase the upstream development branch into your topic branch:\n\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master\n```\n\n6. Push your topic branch up to your fork the first time:\n\n```bash\ngit push --set-upstream origin <topic-branch-name>\n```\n\nAnd any time after that:\n\n```bash\ngit push\n```\n\n7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description against the `master` branch.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a pull request or patch, you agree to the [License](#license) and the [Privacy Notice](CONTRIBUTING.md#privacy-notice).\n\n\n### Pull request validation\n\nContinuous integration (CI) tools monitor pull requests, and help us identify build and code quality issues.\n\nThe results of the CI tests will show on your pull request.\n\nBy clicking on Details you can further zoom in; in case of a failure it will show you why it failed.\nIn case of success it will report how awesome you were.\n\nTip: [commit message format](./CODINGSTYLE.md#commit-message) is a common reason for pull requests to fail validation.\n\n\n### Are there any development docs?\n\nThere is no single source for OpenTTD development docs. It's a complex project with a long history, and multiple APIs.\n\nA good entry point is [Development](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Development/) on the OpenTTD wiki; this provides links to wiki documentation and other sources.\n\nThe GitHub repo also includes some non-comprehensive documentation in [/docs](./docs).\nThese include:\n- When to [change other languages and when not to](./docs/eints.md).\n- The [savegame format](./docs/savegame_format.md).\n- The [release process](./docs/releasing_openttd.md).\n- Some [notes on the link graph algorithm](./docs/linkgraph.md).\n- The [network game coordinator](./docs/game_coordinator.md).\n- How to use [the admin port for network games](./docs/admin_network.md), also useful for multiplayer server hosts.\n- The [performance metrics and logging features](./docs/logging_and_performance_metrics.md), also useful for add-on developers.\n- How [symbol server and analysis works](./docs/symbol_server.md).\n- And several miscellaneous files detailing internal data structures and graphics measurements and palettes.\n\nYou may also want the guide to [compiling OpenTTD](./COMPILING.md).\n\n\n## Project goals\n\n### What are the goals of the official branch?\n\nThe main goals of the official branch are:\n\n- Stay faithful to the original gameplay from Transport Tycoon Deluxe\n- Improve the user interface\n- Allow extending the gameplay with add-ons / mods via supported content APIs\n- Provide a (relatively) stable core for both players of the official branch, and for authors of add-ons and maintainers of patchpacks\n\nIn contrast, extending or altering the gameplay of the base game is not encouraged.\n\nThe rationale behind these goals is that people have different opinions about what OpenTTD is and what it should be.\nWhen it comes to gameplay, there are at least these groups of people:\n\n- *Model railway (mostly singleplayer)*: build \"realistic\" landscapes, roleplay a world, or even replicate historical scenarios\n- *Economical challenge (mostly singleplayer)*: run a business with economical challenges\n- *Transport challenge (singleplayer or cooperative multiplayer)*: build efficient track layouts with high cargo throughput and tons of vehicles\n- *Competitive speed run (competitive multiplayer)*: maximize some goal in some limited amount of time\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay features there are at least these groups of interests:\n\n- *Control freak:* micromanagement like conditional orders, refitting and loading etc.\n- *Casual:* automatisation like cargodist, path based signalling etc.\n\nTo please everyone, the official branch tries to stay close to the original gameplay; after all, that is what brought everyone here.\nThe preferred method to alter and extend the gameplay is via add-ons like NewGRF and GameScripts.\n\nFor a long time, the official branch was also open to features which could be enabled/disabled, but the corner-cases that came with some configurations have rendered some parts of the code very complicated.\nToday, new features have to work with all the already existing features, which is not only challenging in corner cases, but also requires spending considerable more work than just \"making it work in the game mode that I play\".\n\nThe preferred method to introduce new gameplay features is to extend the content APIs, supporting ever more add-on content / mods.\n\nThis moves conflict-solving away from the codebase to content authors / players.\nIt is more accepted for add-ons not working together than the base game not working with certain setting combinations.\n\nIn general the game should allow anything that doesn't violate basic rules, but it should warn players if they take potentially dangerous or \"stupid\" actions.\n\nFor example, players are not prevented from starting vehicles without orders, but will receive a warning about vehicles having too few orders.\nThis lack of limitation has led to players challenging themselves to create networks where all vehicles have no orders, increasing gameplay possibilities.\n\n### I do not agree with the goals of the official branch, what can I do instead?\n\nFork!  There is a rich history of experimental patches for OpenTTD.\n\nMany of these will never be accepted for core, but are creative and interesting ways to modify OpenTTD.\n\nSometimes patches are combined into long-running patchpacks, modified OpenTTD versions which can be downloaded by anyone, or modified OpenTTD clients for dedicated multiplayer servers.\n\nOne of the reasons to keep core relatively stable is to make life easier for patch authors and patchpack maintainers where possible.\n\nPatchpack discussions and related topics may be found in community sites such as [TT-Forums development section](https://www.tt-forums.net/viewforum.php?f=33).\n\n\n## Legal stuff\n\n### License\n\nBy contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the [GPL v2](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/master/COPYING.md).\n\n\n### Privacy Notice\n\nWe would like to make you aware that contributing to OpenTTD via git will permanently store the name and email address you provide as well as the actual changes and the time and date you made it inside git's version history.\n\nThis is inevitable, because it is a main feature of git.\nIf you are concerned about your privacy, we strongly recommend to use \"Anonymous &lt;anonymous@openttd.org&gt;\" as the git commit author.

See [our readme](./README.md) for details\n\nGNU General Public License\n==========================\n\n_Version 2, June 1991_\n_Copyright © 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,_\n_51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA_\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n### Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** copyright the software, and\n**(2)** offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n**0.** This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n**1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n**2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n* **a)** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n* **b)** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n* **c)** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n**3.** You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n* **a)** Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n* **b)** Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n* **c)** Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n**4.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n**5.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n**6.** Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n**7.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n**8.** If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n**9.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n**10.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n### NO WARRANTY\n\n**11.** BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.

It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w` and `show c`; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n    `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n    <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

On some platforms OpenTTD will be available via your OS package manager or a similar service.\n\n\n## 1.2) OpenTTD gameplay manual\n\nOpenTTD has a [community-maintained wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/), including a gameplay manual and tips.\n\n\n## 1.3) Supported platforms\n\nOpenTTD has been ported to several platforms and operating systems.\n\nThe currently supported platforms are:\n\n- Linux (SDL (OpenGL and non-OpenGL))\n- macOS (universal) (Cocoa)\n- Windows (Win32 GDI / OpenGL)\n\nOther platforms may also work (in particular various BSD systems), but we don't actively test or maintain these.\n\n### 1.3.1) Legacy support\nPlatforms, languages and compilers change.\nWe'll keep support going on old platforms as long as someone is interested in supporting them, except where it means the project can't move forward to keep up with language and compiler features.\n\nWe guarantee that every revision of OpenTTD will be able to load savegames from every older revision (excepting where the savegame is corrupt).\nPlease report a bug if you find a save that doesn't load.\n\n## 1.4) Installing and running OpenTTD\n\nOpenTTD is usually straightforward to install, but for more help the wiki [includes an installation guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Installation).\n\nOpenTTD needs some additional graphics and sound files to run.\n\nFor some platforms these will be downloaded during the installation process if required.\n\nFor some platforms, you will need to refer to [the installation guide](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Manual/Installation).\n\n\n### 1.4.1) Free graphics and sound files\n\nThe free data files, split into OpenGFX for graphics, OpenSFX for sounds and\nOpenMSX for music can be found at:\n\n- [OpenGFX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/opengfx-releases/latest)\n- [OpenSFX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/opensfx-releases/latest)\n- [OpenMSX](https://www.openttd.org/downloads/openmsx-releases/latest)\n\nPlease follow the readme of these packages about the installation procedure.\nThe Windows installer can optionally download and install these packages.\n\n\n### 1.4.2) Original Transport Tycoon Deluxe graphics and sound files\n\nIf you want to play with the original Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files you have to copy the data files from the CD-ROM into the baseset/ directory.\nIt does not matter whether you copy them from the DOS or Windows version of Transport Tycoon Deluxe.\nThe Windows install can optionally copy these files.\n\nYou need to copy the following files:\n- sample.cat\n- trg1r.grf or TRG1.GRF\n- trgcr.grf or TRGC.GRF\n- trghr.grf or TRGH.GRF\n- trgir.grf or TRGI.GRF\n- trgtr.grf or TRGT.GRF\n\n\n### 1.4.3) Original Transport Tycoon Deluxe music\n\nIf you want the Transport Tycoon Deluxe music, copy the appropriate files from the original game into the baseset folder.\n- TTD for Windows: All files in the gm/ folder (gm_tt00.gm up to gm_tt21.gm)\n- TTD for DOS: The GM.CAT file\n- Transport Tycoon Original: The GM.CAT file, but rename it to GM-TTO.CAT\n\n\n## 1.5) Add-on content / mods\n\nOpenTTD features multiple types of add-on content, which modify gameplay in different ways.\n\nMost types of add-on content can be downloaded within OpenTTD via the 'Check Online Content' button in the main menu.\n\nAdd-on content can also be installed manually, but that's more complicated; the [OpenTTD wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/) may offer help with that, or the [OpenTTD directory structure guide](./docs/directory_structure.md).\n\n\n### 1.5.1) Social Integration\n\nOpenTTD has the ability to load plugins to integrate with Social Platforms like Steam, Discord, etc.\n\nTo enable such integration, the plugin for the specific platform has to be downloaded and stored in the `social_integration` folder.\n\nSee [OpenTTD's website](https://www.openttd.org), under Downloads, for what plugins are available.\n\n\n### 1.6) OpenTTD directories\n\nOpenTTD uses its own directory structure to store game data, add-on content etc.\n\nFor more information, see the [directory structure guide](./docs/directory_structure.md).\n\n### 1.7) Compiling OpenTTD\n\nIf you want to compile OpenTTD from source, instructions can be found in [COMPILING.md](./COMPILING.md).\n\n\n## 2.0) Contact and Community\n\n'Official' channels\n\n- [OpenTTD website](https://www.openttd.org)\n- [OpenTTD official Discord](https://discord.gg/openttd)\n- IRC chat using #openttd on irc.oftc.net [more info about our irc channel](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Development/IRC%20channel)\n- [OpenTTD on Github](https://github.com/OpenTTD/) for code repositories and for reporting issues\n- [forum.openttd.org](https://forum.openttd.org/) - the primary community forum site for discussing OpenTTD and related games\n- [OpenTTD wiki](https://wiki.openttd.org/) community-maintained wiki, including topics like gameplay guide, detailed explanation of some game mechanics, how to use add-on content (mods) and much more\n\n'Unofficial' channels\n\n- the OpenTTD wiki has a [page listing OpenTTD communities](https://wiki.openttd.org/en/Community/Community) including some in languages other than English\n\n\n### 2.1) Multiplayer games\n\nYou can play OpenTTD with others, either cooperatively or competitively.\n\nSee the [multiplayer documentation](./docs/multiplayer.md) for more details.\n\n\n### 2.2) Contributing to OpenTTD\n\nWe welcome contributors to OpenTTD.  More information for contributors can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n### 2.3) Reporting bugs\n\nGood bug reports are very helpful.  We have a [guide to reporting bugs](./CONTRIBUTING.md#bug-reports) to help with this.\n\nDesyncs in multiplayer are complex to debug and report (some software development skils are required).\nInstructions can be found in [debugging and reporting desyncs](./docs/debugging_desyncs.md).\n\n\n### 2.4) Translating\n\nOpenTTD is translated into many languages.  Translations are added and updated via the [online translation tool](https://translator.openttd.org).\n\n\n## 3.0) Licensing\n\nOpenTTD is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.0.\nFor the complete license text, see the file '[COPYING.md](./COPYING.md)'.\nThis license applies to all files in this distribution, except as noted below.\n\nThe squirrel implementation in `src/3rdparty/squirrel` is licensed under the Zlib license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/squirrel/COPYRIGHT` for the complete license text.\n\nThe md5 implementation in `src/3rdparty/md5` is licensed under the Zlib license.\nSee the comments in the source files in `src/3rdparty/md5` for the complete license text.\n\nThe fmt implementation in `src/3rdparty/fmt` is licensed under the MIT license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/fmt/LICENSE.rst` for the complete license text.\n\nThe nlohmann json implementation in `src/3rdparty/nlohmann` is licensed under the MIT license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/nlohmann/LICENSE.MIT` for the complete license text.\n\nThe OpenGL API in `src/3rdparty/opengl` is licensed under the MIT license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/opengl/khrplatform.h` for the complete license text.\n\nThe catch2 implementation in `src/3rdparty/catch2` is licensed under the Boost Software License, Version 1.0.\nSee `src/3rdparty/catch2/LICENSE.txt` for the complete license text.\n\nThe icu scriptrun implementation in `src/3rdparty/icu` is licensed under the Unicode license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/icu/LICENSE` for the complete license text.\n\nThe monocypher implementation in `src/3rdparty/monocypher` is licensed under the 2-clause BSD and CC-0 license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/monocypher/LICENSE.md` for the complete license text.\n\nThe OpenTTD Social Integration API in `src/3rdparty/openttd_social_integration_api` is licensed under the MIT license.\nSee `src/3rdparty/openttd_social_integration_api/LICENSE` for the complete license text.\n\nThe atomic datatype support detection in `cmake/3rdparty/llvm/CheckAtomic.cmake` is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license.\nSee `cmake/3rdparty/llvm/LICENSE.txt` for the complete license text.\n\n## 4.0 Credits\n\nSee [CREDITS.md](./CREDITS.md)\n"

So let the client wait a tiny bit after sending the 'I am leaving' packet and before gracefully closing the connection [FS#4601] (r22387)\n- Fix: When the last AI company gets removed, the 'dead' state was not reset in the AI debug window [FS#4602] (r22386)\n- Fix: Recolouring of silicon bridge was done incorrectly (r22380, r22379, r22378)\n- Fix: Crash when clicking a removed company in the vehicle list dropdowns [FS#4592] (r22373)\n- Fix: Keep better accounting of the order in which clients joined; client cannot be starved from joining and they get shown the amount of clients waiting in front of them (r22372, r22370, r22369, r22368, r22367, r22366, r22365, r22364, r22363, r22362, r22361)\n- Fix: Make sure saving has completely and utterly finished before starting a new one. Otherwise you could start a save, which would be marked as done by the previous save stopping and then yet another save could be started... and that could create a deadlock [FS#4596] (r22371)\n- Fix: Delete the client list popup when the client got removed (instead of previously selecting some other client) (r22360, r22359, r22358)\n- Fix: When inserting automatic orders, do not create consecutive duplicate orders (r22333, r22332, r22331, r22330, r22329, r22328, r22327)\n- Fix: Destinations of conditional orders were update incorrectly when deleting orders in front of the conditional orders, if the target order was the order just before of the conditional order (r22326)\n- Fix: Vehicles skipped orders when inserting automatic orders failed (r22324)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] When determining refittability use the cargo translation table of the GRF setting the refitmask instead of the GRF defining the action 3 (r22316)\n- Fix: Make road vehicles, ships and aircraft skip orders if they are leaving a depot and heading to the same one again; just like trains (r22309)\n- Fix: Waiting on a server could kick the client, or rather the client would kick itself due to an unexpected packet [FS#4574] (r22308)\n- Fix: When drawing the town authority window, check whether the availability of the actions changed, and force a complete redraw in that case (r22307)\n- Fix: The 'freeform edges' setting could be enabled when there were buoys on the northern border [FS#4580] (r22297)\n- Fix: Reset Window::scrolling_scrollbar when raising scrollbar buttons [FS#4571] (r22294)\n\n\n### 1.1.0 (2011-04-01)\n\n- Fix: In the scenario editor you could build a ship depot using the appropriate hotkey.

Calling window code directly from command scope uses wrong _current_company and might issue nested DoCommands() which interfere with the running command [FS#4523] (r22141, r22140, r22135, r22134)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Skipping only the invalid part of an action14 failed, the rest of the action was skipped instead (r22138)\n- Fix: Spectators had crashes when closing buoy windows (r22131)\n- Fix: Build-station-window showed wrong selection when reopening [FS#4530] (r22128)\n- Fix: Canals would get drawn as land in the smallmap when using the owner window (r22127)\n- Fix: The animation-ness of two goldmine tiles were swapped, causing the wheeltower to not work properly, and the bottom corner to show the wrong sprite [FS#4528] (r22125)\n- Fix: CommandQueue::Pop() did not update 'last'; popping the last item caused the queue to disconnect unless there was only one item [FS#4522] (r22123)\n- Fix: When a NOT_REACHED in saveload can be reached due to an invalid savegame, use SlErrorCorrupt instead. In other words, do not crash but show an error message (r22122)\n- Fix: In case of high frame_freq one could get commands executed after a new network game was started (r22121)\n- Fix: [NoAI] Prevent AIs from getting consistently over their allowed amount of operations by subtracting the amount they went over 'budget' from the budget for the next 'tick' (r22120)\n- Fix: The refit window was not correctly updated after selecting with Ctrl+Click [FS#4525] (r22118)\n- Fix: CanRemoveRoadWithStop() failed for _current_company = OWNER_TOWN, and for OWNER_NONE-owned road (r22117)\n\n\n### 1.1.0-RC1 (2011-02-18)\n\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Test all possible industry layouts during construction and prospecting [FS#4131] (r22012, r22010)\n- Feature: Wheel scrolling in the console (r21982)\n- Feature: Console command to reset the engine pool. It removes the traces of engines which are no longer associated to a NewGRF, and can be used to e.g. 'fix' scenarios which were screwed up by the author. You can only use it when there are no vehicles in the game though (r21975)\n- Feature: Add a setting to enable/disable funding local road reconstruction (r21974)\n- Feature: Introduce 'minimal' number of industries as a replacement for the old 'none' setting in the new game window (r21969)\n- Change: When loading old savegames with long trains set the maximum train length to the length of the longest train (r22061)\n- Change: Always report mammoth trains are disabled to NewGRFs, and allow the maximum train length to be modified in multiplayer as well [FS#4471] (r22004)\n- Fix: Remove invalid keycodes when reading hotkeys.cfg [FS#4510] (r22094)\n- Fix: The server list did not get sorted with one item in it, so the 'position in the list' variable was never updated causing problems when using the keyboard shortcuts for scrolling [FS#4514] (r22093)\n- Fix: When deleting towns, only relocate objects during DC_EXEC (r22087)\n- Fix: [Windows] If fullscreen fails with current resolution, use desktop resolution [FS#4489] (r22081)\n- Fix: The owner view of the smallmap was not updated after a company colour change (r22079)\n- Fix: Maximum train length interfered with wagon replacement when wagon removal was turned on [FS#4499] (r22078)\n- Fix: NewGRFs with invalid multi-tile houses could cause a valid 1x1 house following it to be seen as multi-tile, causing crashes [FS#4501] (r22075)\n- Fix: Immediately update the train weight when you change the multiplier for train cargo weight (r22073)\n- Fix: Some hotkey names in hotkey.cfg for the scenario editor toolbar were completely bogus (r22071)\n- Fix: Crashes when disconnecting after requesting the map [FS#4503] (r22070)\n- Fix: Delete all savegame packets, not just the first one (r22069)\n- Fix: Return 'connection lost' instead of 'okay' when SendPackets closed the connection, so we do not try to do anything else with the closed socket (r22068)\n- Fix: Do not hold a mutex when sending packets and thus possibly closing the connection as that wants to acquire the mutex again (r22067)\n- Fix: Verify we can allocate an Order, OrderList, CargoPacket, CargoPayment, and others before we actually try to do so (all corner cases) [FS#4468] (r22066, r22057, r22047, r22042, r22040, r22033, r22031, r22026, r22025, r22024, r22023, r22022)\n- Fix: Crash when disconnecting and reconnecting while the server is still saving the savegame [FS#4497] (r22064)\n- Fix: Memory leak when saving with LZMA or zlib fails mid-way (r22062)\n- Fix: Make the send chat message window follow the position of the status bar (r22059)\n- Fix: Metric and imperial HP are not the same. As imperial HP are used internally, set a conversion rate for metric HP [FS#4408] (r22056)\n- Fix: [Squirrel] Some invalid squirrel code caused the squirrel compiler to crash [FS#4490] (r22055)\n- Fix: The land area information window was not updated after a language change (r22053)\n- Fix: Roads under road stops would get a wrong owner after overbuilding (r22051)\n- Fix: In ancient savegames, e.g. TTO savegames, non primary vehicles (wagons and such) could have unitnumbers or even orders. However, these orders would not be updated when a station is removed. As such some savegames have wagons with current orders to invalid stations which triggers trouble in the load conversion. So, trash any orders/unitnumbers a non-primary vehicle has [FS#4496] (r22050)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Company 0 does not always exist, so put temporary vehicles in a valid company (r22048)\n- Fix: Make sure order indices stay in range when copying, sharing, unsharing or deleting all orders [FS#4487] (r22046)\n- Fix: Update the consist cache when a part of a train is flipped in the depot [FS#4493] (r22044)\n- Fix: Invalidate the right windows when a part of a train is flipped in the depot (r22043)\n- Fix: Tab completion in chat did not cycle through all possible options (r22038)\n- Fix: Crash when watching the vehicle view of a vehicle that has multiple sequential nearest depot orders (or consists of a single nearest depot order) when there is no depot with index 0 [FS#4488] (r22034)\n- Fix: The server list got not resorted/redrawn after NewGRFs were downloaded [FS#4482] (r22029)\n- Fix: When paused and having the allowed actions while paused setting on 'no actions' cheating money would fail [FS#4479] (r22016)\n- Fix: Only show one AI per unique ID instead of all versions in the output of 'openttd -h' (r22007)\n- Fix: Smoke/sparks of trains would be shown under bridges, or rather through bridges [FS#4480] (r22006)\n- Fix: When the difference between force and resistance is smaller than the mass(*4) there would be no acceleration anymore, even when at higher (or lower) speed the force and resistance balance out better [FS#4473] (r21997)\n- Fix: [YAPF] Under some circumstances vehicles could be lost [FS#4472] (r21996)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Make computations of closest-land/water-distances handle waterish tiles more correctly (r21994)\n- Fix: When building a lock on dry land costs for clearing water were deducted rather than for building canals (r21993)\n- Fix: AIs trying to change the AIOF_GOTO_NEAREST_DEPOT flag for existing orders triggered an assert.

For example do not show trams when there is no tram NewGRF loaded (r21817)\n- Change: Keep aqueducts and road/tram tunnels and bridges after removing a company (r21780)\n- Fix: Distant-join station would build at the wrong location when having persistent building turned on and selecting a 'second' location for the station tile [FS#4430] (r21864)\n- Fix: Slowing down of trains was done by reducing the speed by 10%, but also when you are just 1% too fast, so limit the slowdown till the new maximum speed [FS#4423] (r21847)\n- Fix: Left-mouse-button dragging would switch over to other viewports instead of staying locked to the viewport you started on [FS#4419] (r21837)\n- Fix: When a train was reversed while inside a tunnel/bridge, it would not have (re)set the GOINGUP/DOWN bits after leaving the tunnel/bridge (r21836)\n- Fix: Desync debug savegames might not be actually saved in case threading is enabled, which is enabled by default [FS#4427] (r21833)\n- Fix: Service orders for trains/aircraft would (sometimes) not get a time when autofilling [FS#4414] (r21831)\n- Fix: Crash with the small map window on big endian platforms [FS#4417] (r21830)\n- Fix: The expectations from the 'always build infrastructure' setting name/description did not match the behaviour [FS#4007] (r21826)\n- Fix: Allow dragging of combo signals (again) [FS#4378] (r21816)\n- Fix: [YAPF] Apply a pathfinder penalty for back of one-way path signals so those are not preferred over other possibilities [FS#3908] (r21815)\n- Fix: Check GRF version from action 8, and disallow usage of GRFs with versions above 7 (r21814)\n- Fix: Crash when displaying the owner view [FS#4411] (r21813)\n- Fix: Do not create automatic orders when there are no manual orders, and remove unreached automatic orders when reaching an ordered waypoint or depot [FS#4404] (r21809, r21808)\n- Fix: Loading a TTO savegame failed after loading a TTDP savegame (r21799, r21798)\n- Fix: The size (in characters) of the string inputs was too small for loading some TTD savegames (r21797)\n- Fix: Drive through road stop state was not properly converted from TTDPatch savegames [FS#4398] (r21796)\n- Fix: Broken usage of GetTileOwner() caused wrong conversion of old savegames (r21793)\n- Fix: Terraforming limit was off-by-one when terraforming a single tile height [FS#4407] (r21791)\n- Fix: TTDPatch savegames can have train waypoints encoded as buoys [FS#4398] (r21790)\n- Fix: When the font misses the fallback character '?', use the sprite font's '?' instead [FS#4405] (r21789)\n- Fix: Crash due to invalid rail station width and height data stored in TTDPatch savegames [FS#4398] (r21786)\n- Fix: Crash when converting savegame with custom waypoint name (r21784)\n- Fix: Diagonal tile iterator failed for A * 0 selections [FS#4396] (r21768)\n- Fix: Do not limit tile clearing during bankruptcy [FS#4397] (r21767)\n- Fix: PBS reservation was not shown on road crossings with NewGRF railtypes [FS#4369] (r21765)\n- Remove: The 'stopall' console command, as its functionality was broken. Group start/stop commands can be used instead [FS#4409] (r21804)\n\n\n### 1.1.0-beta3 (2011-01-09)\n\n- Feature: Configurable limit amount of tiles that can be cleared/terraformed by a company [FS#4331] (r21728)\n- Feature: Show a list of companies in the owner legend and allow them to be toggled for visibility (r21720, r21718)\n- Feature: Console command 'list_ai_libs' to get a list of recognised AI libraries [FS#4372] (r21703)\n- Feature: Allow changing the AI configuration in the scenario editor / in game [FS#4362] (r21696)\n- Change: Tune 'realistic' acceleration even more to make more trains reach their top speed, and make it behave more like TTDPatch (r21712)\n- Change: Display the minimum height of the tile in the LandInfo window instead of the height of the northern corner. So it is more useful for NewGRF and AI developers, and maybe more transparent for players (r21711)\n- Fix: The diagonal iterator would iterate twice over some tiles [FS#4395] (r21747)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Canal variable 83 accessed water random bits also for non-water tiles (e.g. watery industries or objects) (r21746)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Canal variable 80 shall return consistent heights within a lock (r21745)\n- Fix: Allow Ctrl+Clicking automatic orders for scrolling to their destination (r21744)\n- Fix: Coast tiles were not drawn under bridges [FS#4386] (r21743)\n- Fix: Make clearing refit orders work again [FS#4388] (r21739)\n- Fix: Start loading when cur_order_index points to the destination station, i.e. after deleting not-reached automatic orders [FS#4384] (r21738)\n- Fix: A loading order was also marked as 'not part of orders' when the order before the current order was deleted (r21737)\n- Fix: Admin bots were not always notified of password changes [FS#4377] (r21727)\n- Fix: Vehicle sprite was cached into a 16 bit variable, causing incorrect sprites to be displayed (r21709)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Report TTDPatch flag 4A (newobjects) as set (r21708)\n- Fix: The old ship pathfinder is too stupid to provide 'lost' notices; it would even get lost while following its own path [FS#4370] (r21706)\n- Fix: Do not perform any more checks after the connection is closed [FS#4374] (r21704)\n- Fix: Changing AI settings ingame was impossible when the difficulty level was other than custom (r21694)\n- Fix: Due to an error in the Debian changelog building of Debian/Ubuntu packages failed (r21682)\n\n\n### 1.1.0-beta2 (2010-12-31)\n\n- Feature: Command logging using the admin interface (r21668)\n- Feature: Concept of automatic station orders; add stub orders for intermediate stations and remove them when not visiting them anymore. This allows you to see what trains visit a station without actually having to order a vehicle to stop at all stations (r21642)\n- Add: [NoAI] AIEventTownFounded (r21664)\n- Add: [NoAI] AIRail::GetName() to get the name of a railtype (r21663)\n- Add: [NoAI] AITown::IsCity() so AIs can find out which towns grow faster than others (r21654)\n- Change: Do not show price to build a bridge in the scenario editor as they are free to build there [FS#4358] (r21673)\n- Change: Do not highlight tile when selecting a vehicle to clone or an order to skip to (r21616)\n- Fix: Estonia introduced the Euro in 2011 (r21670)\n- Fix: Autofill timetable had side effects in test mode, possibly causing desyncs in MP [FS#4354] (r21660)\n- Fix: Cargo payment graph was not properly invalidated when payment rate changed [FS#4351] (r21658)\n- Fix: Use a bool instead of uint8 to store a bool and use the dedicated accessor function when reading boolean settings [FS#4345] (r21656)\n- Fix: Infinite loop in the road pathfinder due to bouncing around in an 'one way' trap; two one ways pointing towards each other making it impossible to leave [FS#4338] (r21651)\n- Fix: Make '[centre|main] view' consistent, and make '[main|global] view' consistent [FS#4339] (r21650)\n- Fix: Newly created skip-to order was created at wrong place (r21633)\n- Fix: Ships with the old pathfinder would easily show up as lost, even when it would eventually find a path. Now also the distance from the 'end' of the pathfinding run to the destination is compared to the current distance to the destination; if the distance to the destination at the end of the pathfinder run is less than the current distance from the destination the ship will not be marked as lost. This means that the ships with the old pathfinder will less likely get marked as lost, but due to the design of the old ship pathfinder there 'lostness' is merely a best guess. When you still get a lost message you need to build buoys to guide the ship pathfinder [FS#4325] (r21631)\n- Fix: Version detection of subversion branches and tags got broken (r21630)\n- Fix: Crash under certain circumstances when using autorail [FS#4327] (r21619)\n\n\n### 1.1.0-beta1 (2010-12-24)\n\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Variable 7B for accessing 60+x variables while taking the parameter from the accumulator (r21604)\n- Feature: Allow to refit only the selected part of a train consist (r21567)\n- Feature: Store the used OpenTTD version, base graphics set, NewGRFs and AIs in the PNG screenshots (r21558, r21553)\n- Feature: Make the delay of the chat messages timing out unrelated to the number of passed game days, i.e. do not stop ageing chat messages when the server is paused, and make the timeout user configurable [FS#532] (r21513, r21512)\n- Feature: Vehicle lost messages for ships and road vehicles [FS#1956] (r21511, r21510)\n- Feature: Diagonal tile clearing and terraforming by pressing Ctrl [FS#730] (r21500)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Use the station graphics property to determine a fallback for the depot sprites [FS#4279] (r21473)\n- Feature: Add explicit make 'shared orders' an option in the orders menu (r21464)\n- Feature: Make it more clear that you are stopping a shared order, and make it possible retain the order list upon unsharing [FS#3711] (r21461)\n- Feature: Hotkey Ctrl+W for returning to the main menu [FS#3217] (r21459)\n- Feature: Scroll to the inserted order [FS#4215] (r21457)\n- Feature: Building while paused always works in the scenario editor [FS#1521] (r21430)\n- Feature: Perform the compression of savegames to send to the client asynchronously. This will reduce the lag of the other clients to the time it takes to make the memory dump and it will speed up downloading the map as the download starts earlier (possibly with a slightly lower bandwidth due to slow compression) [FS#4284] (r21399)\n- Feature: Do not store savegames to disk when transferring it from the server to a client (r21398, r21397)\n- Feature: Use alphabetical order when sorting industries by type at the industry directory window (r21389)\n- Feature: Allow entering of the new year in a text box when cheating the year [FS#4289] (r21388)\n- Feature: Support for limiting the amount of (accepted) incoming data for a server (r21363)\n- Feature: Natural sorting of strings using ICU [FS#4214] (r21344)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Implement action0 visual effect properties for ships and RVs (r21240)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Support callback 0x10 for RVs and ships (r21238)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Make positioning of diesel fumes and electric sparks actually work (r21230)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Support OpenTTD's genders, cases and plurals (r21216, r21211, r21209)\n- Feature: Display mail capacity when refitting an aircraft to passengers (r21214)\n- Feature: Make the statusbar's location configurable [FS#4201] (r21179)\n- Feature: Forced construction of missing industries (r21175)\n- Feature: Do not build industries during economic recession (r21169)\n- Feature: Use desired industry counts rather than relative probability to decide which industry to build (r21168)\n- Feature: Allow to sort purchase lists for trains and road vehicles by tractive effort (r21105)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add CB36 support for road vehicle property 0x15 (Speed) (r21100)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Implement stringcode 9A 0C (station name), 9A 0D (weight) (r21086, r21085)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add CB36 support for road vehicle properties 0x13 (Power), 0x14 (Weight) and 0x18 (Tractive effort) (r21058)\n- Feature: XZ/LZMA2 savegame support. New default reduces savegame size by 10 to 30% with slightly more CPU usage. With maximum settings it reduces savegame size by 20 to 30%, but that takes 7 to 14 times longer. Map saving + downloading takes, on average, 5% less (r21044)\n- Feature: Chat directly to the server or a bot/admin/IRC channel monitoring the server (r21000)\n- Feature: Remote administration (r20975-r20963)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] The concept of minimum loadable version to NewGRFs when choosing compatible NewGRFs (r20960, r20958)\n- Feature: Centre new extra viewports on the tile below the mouse.

Air drag for vehicles with air drag not set or set to zero will use a default value depending on their max speed (r20303, r20302, r20301, r20300, r20299)\n- Feature: More user-friendly gui to change NewGRF parameters (r20258)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for static NewGRF information, i.e. Action 14 (r20250)\n- Feature: Display suppliers and customers of an industry or cargo (r20206)\n- Feature: Allow horizontal resizing for all vehicle lists [FS#3955] (r20174)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Information (var 4A) about the current railtype a train is on (r20165)\n- Feature: Tooltips are shown by hovering the mouse over a widget instead of by right clicking on it [FS#3913]\n- Feature: Customisable hotkeys (r20055)\n- Feature: Wrap console lines when they are too long [FS#3816] (r20046)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Variable 43 depot build date for railtypes [FS#3886] (r20003)\n- Feature: Show some savegame details when selecting items in saveload GUIs (r19984)\n- Feature: Open vehicle view when clicking on the caption of vehicle news (r19944)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Access to industry founder (var A7) during callbacks 28 and 2F (r19901)\n- Feature: Add highlighting of drag destination in depot and order GUI gui [FS#3705] (r19889, r19888)\n- Feature: Configure NewGRFs from a single window (r19841)\n- Feature: Give depots an unique name in the same manner buoys and waypoints are named.

That is: The random bits the house/industry will start with, if construction succeeds [FS#3477] (r19744)\n- Feature: A simple sprite alignment helper. It does not store the new offsets anywhere so as soon as the sprite is reloaded the offsets are gone (use a bigger sprite cache if this happens). Also anything that reloads NewGRFs (new games, loading games or (re)applying NewGRFs) clears the sprite cache and as such resets the offsets (r19723)\n- Feature: New base costs for building/clearing canals, building/clearing aqueducts and building/clearing locks (r19720)\n- Feature: Ctrl+click on a vehicle to start/stop it (r19714)\n- Feature: NewGRF debugging/inspecting of (primarily) enabled callbacks and values of variables (r19709)\n- Feature: Graphs with negative values are no longer forced to have the zero axis in the middle, resizeable graphs (r19662, r19631)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Support callback 36 for aircraft speed also in the build menu (r19660)\n- Feature: Add an input box to the AI Debug window where you can input a break string [FS#3496] (r19544)\n- Feature: Add buttons to enable/disable all cargoes at the cargo payment rates graph (r19542)\n- Feature: Sort industries alphabetically at the smallmap legend, fund industry list; sort cargoes alphabetically at cargo payment graph, build vehicles cargo filter dropdown, station ratings and refit options (r19541, r19540, r19436, r19535, r19522, r19503)\n- Feature: Console command 'reload_newgrfs'; only available when NewGRF developer tools are enabled (r19515)\n- Feature: Enter the starting year in the scenario editor by clicking at the date panel (r19397)\n- Feature: Configurable slope steepness for road vehicles from 0% to 10%, default is 7% (r19346)\n- Feature: Realistic acceleration for road vehicles (r19345)\n- Feature: Allow to (over)build and remove multiple road stops using drag and drop (r19231, r19230, r19229)\n- Feature: Show warnings and errors in console as well, not only in a message box (r19225)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Action 0/1/2/3 support for NewGRF airporttiles (r19194)\n- Add: [NoAI] AIOrder::IsVoidOrder to find void '(Invalid Order)' orders (r20389)\n- Add: Support for MSVC 2010 (r20032)\n- Add: [NoAI] AIIndustry::GetIndustryID(TileIndex) (r19773)\n- Change: Make it possible to start actions that require selecting stuff (landscaping, vehicle cloning, etc) in the viewport while paused. As side-effect you will get an error message explaining the command cannot be executed because the game is paused instead of seemingly nothing happening when you click. Additional side effect of this is that you can make use of the measurement tooltip while paused [FS#4292] (r21480)\n- Change: Make building aqueducts behave more like building tunnels.

Also check some minimal requirements (engine availability, refittability) and a heuristic for the needed money when sending vehicles for autoreplace [FS#1762] (r18551, r18549)\n- Fix: Do not account for path reservation costs when entering a signal block via a 'block' signal. This way you will not get double penalties, both red signals and reservation costs, for the block signalled tracks [FS#2722] (r18535)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] An industry NewGRF that defined a too small size for action0 prop 0A could cause a crash (r18527)\n- Fix: Allegro does not like to work with extmidi, so warn the user about that [FS#3272] (r18520)\n- Fix: When you pass a signal at danger, in a PBS controlled area, do not try to do the 'safe' thing and stop, but continue going; the user wanted the train to pass the signal at danger so they have to suffer the consequences.

Now find a sub cargo type with the exact same name and use that, otherwise fallback to 0. So cargo sub types can be maintained via autoreplace *if* the new vehicle supports the same cargo sub type [FS#3159] (r18499)\n- Fix: Cloning of vehicles could create vehicles with invalid cargo sub types for the build year of the vehicle. Fall back to another cargo sub type with the exact same name, otherwise fallback to cargo sub type 0 [FS#2616] (r18498)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Direction is accounted for long before motion counter is updated (r18479)\n- Fix: Moving vehicles around/selling vehicle in the train depot could create states that are not allowed by the NewGRF attach callback [FS#3146] (r18472, r18470)\n- Fix: Unselect an AI in the AI Settings window when it falls out of the range of active AIs [FS#3357] (r18436)\n- Fix: Road vehicles would not pick an empty drive through stop. Now they will *if* the penalty for driving around is less than the occupancy penalty [FS#1944] (r18404)\n- Fix: Long (articulated) road vehicles could block loading of others when the following road vehicle already got 'permission' to go to the next bay even when it could not reach it [FS#1495] (r18404)\n- Fix: The tree 'which one to draw' hash was not anywhere near random and thus showed a very visible repeated pattern when only one tree type was used [FS#3343] (r18398)\n- Fix: [NoAI] Make AIIndustryType::GetConstructionCost() return -1, if the industry is neither buildable nor prospectable (r18276)\n- Fix: Use free type ascender/descender metrics to position font offset correctly (r18096)\n- Fix: Make the 'pause' chat message when actually executing the pause command. This to prevent showing paused and especially unpaused to be shown when the state does not change. Output now mentions whether pause changes keep the game paused and what reasons for pausing there 'currently' are (r18052)\n- Fix: [NoAI] Improve behaviour of (AIEngine|AIEventEnginePreview)::GetCargoType() and AIEngine::CanRefitCargo() wrt. articulated vehicles (r17898)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] CB15 and CB36 (capacity) were not always called when they should [FS#3255] (r17897)\n- Fix: Invalidate cache of vehicle vars 40-43 after testruns of certain commands, that change them temporarily (r17894)\n- Fix: [OSX] The splash image was not displayed if the Quartz video driver was used (r17793)\n- Fix: Do not let aircraft drive a while over the grass when landing at high altitude airports [FS#3259] (r17762\n- Fix: Make the -c <config file> location relative to the current directory instead of the directory of the binary [FS#3247] (r17686)\n- Fix: Some semaphore signals fell outside of the signal GUI. Now the signals are properly centred which should make that problem go away [FS#3242] (r17657)\n- Fix: Some inconsistencies with the difficulty settings in the scenario editor. Also re-enable changing some difficulty settings (e.g. max loan) in the scenario editor [FS#3219] (r17644)\n- Fix: Do not accept cargo produced in the same industry; generalise and improve the check used only for valuables (r17437)\n- Fix: Pay only for cargo actually delivered, not for all cargo unloaded at station; can differ with 'stockpiling' industries (r17436)\n- Fix: Improve movement of aircraft; do not make turns bigger than 45 degrees while in flight, do not move while turning on the ground (r17415, r17405)\n- Fix: Crash in order GUI when changing some orders with both the mouse and keyboard at the exact same time [FS#2859] (r17384)\n- Fix: Trains would not show smoke if the load/unload counter was not 0, though there does not seem to be a reason to check that variable anyhow anymore [FS#3162] (r17352)\n- Fix: One was not offered to take over bankrupt companies anymore; caused by the introduction NoAI, although NewAI had the same problem too [FS#2769] (r17345)\n- Fix: Minor improvements of the airport state machines (r17338, r17337, r17334)\n- Fix: Road vehicles forgetting their servicing order when the path takes them away (in bird distance) from their destination first [FS#3057] (r17333)\n- Fix: Mention of Ctrl modifier was missing from some tooltips [FS#3120] (r17300, r17297)\n- Fix: Keep vehicle news and viewports following vehicles, when autoreplacing/renewing them [FS#3048] (r17147)\n- Fix: Inconsistency between signs of stations and waypoints [FS#3081] (r17040)\n- Fix: NewGRF stations would be triggering assertions for waypoints all over the place when using the more advanced station types [FS#2996] (r16909)\n- Fix: Skipping a 'nearest depot order' because none could be found could cause multiple orders to get skipped [FS#2925] (r16457)\n- Fix: Makedepend cannot handle the amount of files we have and it also miss some dependencies. So use our custom implementation of makedepend (r16307)\n- Fix: Autopause and manual pausing conflict with each other, new game + pause on new game + autopause make the game not unpause on the first join [FS#2864] (r16242)\n- Remove: [NoAI] AIVehicle::SkipToVehicleOrder as it was a duplicate of AIOrder.SkipToOrder (r18504)\n- Remove: OPF for RVs and NTP for trains; both the oldest path finders (r18362)\n- Remove: Support for gcc2. It has not been able to compile OpenTTD for months. All attempts to do another workaround failed (r16492)\n\n\n## 0.7.x\n\n### 0.7.5 (2009-12-23)\n\n(None)\n\n\n### 0.7.5-RC1 (2009-12-14)\n\n- Add: Some missing latin-ish characters from the OpenGFX set (r18431)\n- Change: Recolour the bubble generator just like any other industry [FS#3349] (r18409)\n- Fix: Read after free in case no network connection could be made with the content server (r18493)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Initialisation of cargo payment was broken for NewGRF cargoes [FS#3344] (r18475)\n- Fix: [NoAI] AIOrder::SkipToOrder did not properly resolve ORDER_CURRENT (r18471)\n- Fix: When moving a wagon and only the last part of a dual headed engine you could split the dual headed engine over two vehicles. This could be used to crash servers [CVE-2009-4007] (r18462)\n- Fix: [Windows] Forgot to load the symbol from SDL.dll (r18439)\n- Fix: Do not run the 'jam protection' for vehicles in a depot [FS#3360] (r18428)\n- Fix: [Windows] The help window would be too large in some cases [FS#3327] (r18424)\n- Fix: Under some circumstances a pointer could be left untouched and then freed.

So now we search the font using the localised name and use the English name for the final 'validation' only (r15757)\n- Fix: Number of houses in house variables 0x44, 0x60 and 0x61 were incorrect after 0xFF had been reached and could desync clients joining afterwards (r15755)\n- Fix: Crash when clicking the small area between the savegame list and the save button in the save game window [FS#2742] (r15753)\n- Fix: Do not try to (un)draw the cursor when the screen is not ready (r15752)\n- Fix: The big UFO sometimes landed just outside the map. Instead of landing, just disappear (fly away) in those cases (r15750)\n- Fix: Crash because submarines would sometimes start far outside of the map [FS#2739] (r15748)\n- Fix: Road ownership getting lost when removing a road stop [FS#2736] (r15747)\n- Fix: Update threading code for OS/2, add mutex support, fix compilation (r15746, r15745)\n- Fix: When town generator failed to create requested number of towns, there were too many cities (r15744)\n\n\n### 0.7.0-RC1 (2009-03-16)\n\n- Feature: Pop up the AI Debug Window if one of the AIs crashed and show a message that the user should report the crash [FS#2728] (r15708)\n- Feature: Allow the number of towns that will be generated in the generate world window to be customised [FS#2672] (r15695)\n- Fix: Enabling freeform edges could cause submarines to get stuck on land tiles (r15733)\n- Fix: Centring on a vehicle did not respect its z coordinate (r15725)\n- Fix: Do not show passenger-/mail-capacity if the aircraft carries only cargo (r15705)\n- Fix: Blame NewGRFs returning inconsistent information in purchase-list/after building before users have a chance to blame OpenTTD for incorrectly autorenewing/-replacing [FS#2595] (r15701)\n- Fix: Just sell the old engines after autorenew/replace. Do not bother about trains exceeding the trainlimit, which will be sold anyway [FS#2721] (r15692)\n- Fix: Do not crash when the generate map does not contain a suitable location for a town [FS#2720] (r15689)\n- Fix: Do not crash when someone substitutes the 'map generation' sprites with garbage [FS#2720] (r15685)\n- Fix: Vehicle images would be determined during the process of moving the vehicle which means that only the (orientation) data for the vehicles in front of it is valid. Now the data for the vehicles behind the vehicle are valid too [FS#2546] (r15677)\n- Fix: It was possible to remove rail tunnels/bridges and aqueducts build by rival companies [FS#2718] (r15667)\n- Fix: Sorting of engines in the purchase list did not use the same numbers as the GUI showed, e.g. articulated parts were not taken into account when ordering by capacity [FS#2689] (r15666)\n- Fix: Handling of aircraft crash counter did not take account of the reduced number of calls (from 6 down to 2) to the aircraft event handler, resulting in crashed aircraft taking three times longer than they should to clear. Compensate by increasing the counter by 3 on every call instead of 1 (r15665)\n- Fix: Growing of vsize as (some) threads were not properly released (r15663)\n- Fix: Do not mark a company as having ratings in a town when querying the cost of a command (r15662)\n\n\n### 0.7.0-beta2 (2009-03-10)\n\n- Feature: Allow downloading scenarios and heightmaps via the in game content download (r15632)\n- Feature: When cloning a vehicle with a custom name, add and/or increment a number at the end of name and assign it to the new vehicle (r15621)\n- Feature: Show scenarios/heightmaps from both your home directory and installation directory (r15615)\n- Feature: Allow building road stops on road/tram tracks of competitors (r15601)\n- Feature: Show required/already-delivered cargo needed for town-growth in town-view-window and only if it is really needed (r15559)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Support vehicle vars 0x47 and 0xF2 in purchase list (r15542)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Show the cargo subtype in the vehicle details window (r15480)\n- Change: The background of the the waypoint sign is now in the company colour (r15593)\n- Change: Allow the default debug level of 6 for a dedicated server to be overridden by -d (if used after -D) (r15543)\n- Change: [NewGRF] To decide whether a vehicle is refittable do not test its current capacity for being zero, but always use the 'capacity property' (r15541)\n- Fix: [Squirrel] Almost infinite loop in garbage collection (r15659)\n- Fix: Undeterministic file sorting when the date is equal for all files [FS#2716] (r15657)\n- Fix: Changing vehicle.dynamic_engines when there are already vehicles can cause crashes (r15656, r15586)\n- Fix: Only ever call any vehicle callbacks after the whole articulated engine has been built (except 0x16) (r15654)\n- Fix: C++'s new (this) is seldom a good idea as destructors of member variables are not run causing memory leaks [FS#2706] (r15652)\n- Fix: [OSX] Hack around an OSX stupidity in < 10.4 w.r.t. signals by not having any signal handling support for OSX < 10.4 (r15648)\n- Fix: Add an EngineOverrideManager to give the term 'compatible NewGRF' again some sense and to not crash because of trivial changes [FS#2612] (r15645)\n- Fix: Closing a network connection twice in the case that sending packets starts failing while disconnecting [FS#2710] (r15644)\n- Fix: Game crashes when network pools are empty, so always allocate at least one pool block [FS#2712] (r15641)\n- Fix: Do not allow more than 64 road vehicles to reserve a slot at a single road stop. 255 + 1 gives trouble, but 64 is even more than the road stop would be able to handle within the slot timeout time [FS#2707] (r15635)\n- Fix: Kicking/banning a client from the Client list window crashed the server [FS#2705] (r15628)\n- Fix: UTF8 string handling could cause buffer overruns [FS#2698] (r15626)\n- Fix: When trying to reserve a self-crossing path the failed reservation was sometimes not cleared completely [FS#2701] (r15619)\n- Fix: Towns would only build houses where the grid would not be, even when they are not allowed to build roads and the user 'implements' another layout [FS#2661] (r15604)\n- Fix: Crash when using an extraordinarily large sprite as cursor [FS#2696] (r15601)\n- Fix: Crash when opening viewport while scrolling the map and the mouse 'lands' on the window decoration of the viewport [FS#2695] (r15598)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Refit-info in purchase list did only check the first articulated part (r15592)\n- Fix: Change owner of waypoints and deleted stations when merging companies or when a company bankrupts (r15588)\n- Fix: Last activity time not properly updated causing downloads to be aborted after a minute [FS#2684] (r15580)\n- Fix: Force unload not working when trying to force unload at the station where you received the cargo [FS#2680] (r15574)\n- Fix: Theoretical buffer overflow when a company with too long name funded a road reconstruction (r15572)\n- Fix: When building signals by dragging from a pre/entry/combo block signal, the signal you started at became a normal block signal [FS#2674] (r15567)\n- Fix: Dependency information was not requested after the content state was reset causing the dependencies not always being selected (and thus downloaded) automatically [FS#2675] (r15565)\n- Fix: Crash when saving a preset with unknown NewGRFs [FS#2646] (r15561)\n- Fix: The font width cache was not updated when changing fonts causing the font spacing to be off when changing fonts in-game (auto font detection) (r15557)\n- Fix: -v null crashing in 2051 due to trying to show the high score of the spectator (r15554)\n- Fix: [NoAI] Crash when setting a depot order to the southern part of a ship depot [FS#2656] (r15551)\n- Fix: The keep_all_autosave setting was ignored for dedicated servers/spectators [FS#2651] (r15546)\n- Fix: If a buoy was placed directly in front of a dock, that dock was seen as a buoy and thus skipped once within 3 tiles [FS#2653] (r15545)\n- Fix: Extracting downloaded content did not work for Windows if one uses a non-ASCII path [FS#2650] (r15544)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] When articulated parts have no available default cargo, use the cargo type of the first part for livery selection [FS#2617] (r15541)\n- Fix: Testing of 'only_this' in CmdRefitRoadVeh() could be skipped by 'continue' (r15540)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] If an aircraft cannot carry any available cargo, it should not be available either instead of falling back to passenger/mail. Just like the other vehicle types also do (r15539)\n- Fix: Do not allow special sprite characters (e.g. the ship sprite) as characters in input like filenames or text that is sent over the network (r15537)\n- Fix: The local command queue did not get properly cleaned when leaving a game meaning you could end up executing commands of the previous network game [FS#2644] (r15529)\n- Fix: Do not try to find the AIs the server runs when joining a multiplayer server (r15525)\n- Fix: Use distance to closest station tile as estimate for YAPF too (NPF already does so). This makes it behave 'better' with wide stations [FS#2631] (r15518)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Wagonoverrides and articulated engine parts use the colour scheme of the engine, but not its recolour callback, nor its 2CC flag. Same applies to roadvehicles [FS#2642] (r15517)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Livery overrides for articulated parts of roadvehicles were not applied (r15516)\n- Fix: Make the join/spectate command require to be connected to a network game; in SP it could lead to crashes (r15514)\n- Fix: Generating a map with the original map generator with freeform edges on resulted in a crash [FS#2641] (r15511)\n- Fix: Pre-0.5 OpenTTD stored new_nonstop and full_load_any in a different way, savegame conversion was not working for them (r15500)\n- Fix: Crash when opening the game options when the currently loaded base graphics pack has less than 2 valid graphics files. For example when someone replaces all their original base graphics with custom work (but keeps the name) or renames the dos ones to windows or vice versa [FS#2630] (r15476)\n\n\n### 0.7.0-beta1 (2009-02-16)\n\n- Feature: Make it possible to have multiple windows with edit box open simultaneously (r15424)\n- Feature: Add ability to select which base graphics set is used from the Game Options window. The change takes effect when the window is closed. This option can only be used from the intro menu, as reloading graphics during a game may cause issues (r15389)\n- Feature: Do not draw superfluous catenary wires [FS#1761] (r15347)\n- Feature: Add option to group and subtotal expenses list in the company finance window (r15301)\n- Feature: Allow moving clients between companies/spectators by the server and the clients themselves (r15242)\n- Feature: Native support for Transport Tycoon (Original) savegames (r15216)\n- Feature: Allow terraforming of the tiles at the edges of the map (r15190)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Allow a grf to customise house name via callback 0x14D, during Tile Inquiry process (r15172)\n- Feature: Downloading content from a central server (content.openttd.org) where authors can upload their NewGRFS/AI etc. This should make joining servers that use only NewGRFs that are distributed via this system easier as the players can download the NewGRFs from within the game. It should also make it easier to see whether there are updates for NewGRFs and make the necessary updates (r15126)\n- Feature: Add support for IP range bans using CIDR notation (r15094)\n- Feature: An AI framework so people can write their own AIs. This also removes the old cheating and heavily broken AI (r15027)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Support var 0x45 (curvature info) also for road vehicles (r14945)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Automatically set last engine ageing year to the last 'introduction year plus half model life', to allow engines later than 2050 to appear (r14926)\n- Feature: Distant joining of stations (r14919)\n- Feature: Advanced setting to keep various building tools active, which are usually closed after placing an object (r14902)\n- Feature: Remove the window limit, but leave a configurable limit on the number of non-sticky non-vital windows (r14899)\n- Feature: Allow road vehicles to move multiple steps in a tick (code based on train movement code) and add support for RV prop 15. This gives RVs a maximum speed of 318mph instead 79mph. This only implements higher speeds, not 'realistic acceleration' (r14869)\n- Feature: Automatic reversing in front of block signals can now be disabled by setting pf.wait_oneway_signal respectively pf.wait_twoway_signal to 255 (r14852)\n- Feature: Few (optional) optimisations to making (initial) orders; like keeping goto selected [FS#1984] (r14827)\n- Feature: Make the road grids of town match, when all are using the same road layout of course [FS#2390] (r14821)\n- Feature: Pressing CTRL while dragging to build a bridge builds the last built bridge type if possible [FS#2238] (r14805)\n- Feature: Make the date format for default savegame/screenshot names configurable (r14792)\n- Feature: Allow scrolling with the left mouse button pressed (if enabled). Primarily useful for systems with touch screen (r14789)\n- Feature: Allow up to 15 companies (r14735)\n- Feature: Allow up to 255 clients in multiplayer games (r14730)\n- Feature: When the chosen language is not supported by the current font, try to find a font that does and use that instead (r14618)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Action0Industries property 24 (industry supplies default name for nearby station) (r14598)\n- Feature: Non-destructive autofill with option to keep waiting times [FS#1124] (r14592)\n- Feature: Stop-in-depot order; after this order you have to manually start the vehicle again (or sell it) (r14524)\n- Feature: Arrow key scrolling in the server list (r14517)\n- Feature: Initial support for handling bidirectional scripts and connecting Arabic characters (r14479)\n- Feature: Allow sorting vehicles by remaining life time (r14352)\n- Feature: Ability to reset name to default/automatic value (for vehicles, engines, towns, groups, stations, waypoints, managers and companies) (r14334)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add Variational Action 2 Variable 0x47 for houses, Coordinates of the house tile (r14294)\n- Feature: Allow overriding the palette of the base GRFs. This way you can play with NewGRFs made for the Windows palette with the DOS palettes base GRFs (and vice versa). Note that for this to work correctly ALL NewGRFs must use the same palette; mix and match is not yet supported (r14229)\n- Feature: Double click to join selected server/company (r14209)\n- Feature: Allow both the German as well as non-German toyland graphics as 'correct' and official graphics (r14197)\n- Feature: Allow people to create their own base graphics easily and without requiring code changes (r14197)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for property 0x13 for Bridges. In other words, one can now specifies a 16 bits cost multiplier (r14172)\n- Feature: Make it possible to choose between the DOS and Windows graphics packs while retaining the possibility to override the palette (r14151)\n- Feature: Increase the size of the console backlog. Now it'll only remove backlog items when there are more than a threshold and when they are there longer than (another) threshold (r14056)\n- Feature: Make it possible to filter list_patches output like it is done for other list_* console commands (r14041)\n- Feature: Path based signalling (r13926-13967)\n- Feature: Show [total-]cargo info in depot when [ctrl-]right-clicking on vehicle (r13923)\n- Feature: NewGRF presets, selected by a drop down list in the NewGRF window. Presets are saved in the config file (r13781)\n- Feature: Add a few extra columns with information to the server list (r13732)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 65 in Variational Action 2 Variables for Houses (r13603)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Implement var 63, variational action2 variable for Houses. Or, in more simple terms, the check for the animation frame of nearby house (r13519)\n- Feature: Aqueducts (r13464)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add var 0x69 for industries, long format construction date (r13443)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add long format introduction and maximum construction year for house (r13437)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add access to current long year and date from Action 7/9/D and VarAction2 (23/24 or A3/A4), and add access to (long format) building year, in Variational Action2 Variable 49 for Vehicles (r13376)\n- Feature: Splitting of the main toolbar when the resolution becomes very low so the buttons are still visible and usable (r13339)\n- Feature: Make news messages use a linked list instead of a moving circular buffer. This makes it possible to store more news messages in the history (r13317)\n- Feature: The number of news messages is reduced by removing every news message that is a configurable amount older than when it would not be shown in the newspaper popup/ticker, which is e.g. a month for industry production changes and half a year for subsidy offers. As a result the more important messages will stay longer in the message history (if longer than 30 messages) (r13317)\n- Feature: Allow to have more than only two airports per town. The number of airports is now controlled by the noise each of them generates, the distance from town's centre and how tolerant the town is (13226)\n- Feature: Introducing the so called 'engine pool' which primarily removes the fixed engine type limits and also happens to allow (with the patch option 'dynamic_engines') multiple NewGRF vehicle sets to coexist (r12924)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] The ability to play NewGRF sounds for industries and stations (r12817)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add some support for NewGRF station animation (r12798)\n- Feature: Sorting vehicle lists by road vehicle/train length (r12766)\n- Feature: Conditional 'skip/jump' orders (r12667)\n- Feature: Ability to send a vehicle (using default orders) to the nearest depot (r12661)\n- Feature: Ability to force a vehicle to not load or to not unload at a station (r12650)\n- Feature: Four different non-stop types, individually selectable per order. Replaces 'TTDP compatible order' setting (r12648)\n- Feature: Three different load type in a single game instead of two. One can choose full load all and full load any instead of full load being governed by the 'full load any' patch setting (r12648)\n- Feature: Financial and Player Selection Face windows are now remembering their position when toggling sizes (r12634)\n- Feature: Show what cargoes a station could be supplied with (r12596)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add random action 2 type 84. For vehicles only (r12452)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for var A2/22 for action 7/9/D: Difficulty level (r12449)\n- Feature: Add +/- toggle buttons to station cargo waiting list to show/hide the detailed transferred cargo information (r12446)\n- Feature: Open the time table when pressing the order button while pressing the CTRL key (r12441)\n- Feature: On Screen Keyboard for input fields so someone without a keyboard can enter text too [FS#1846] (r12425)\n- Change: When checking for unique names, compare only with manually set names [FS#1923] (r14958)\n- Change: Apply the 'warn if train's income is negative' setting to other vehicle types, too (r14835)\n- Change: When loading games in 'network' mode use the start date of the save game for the server and all clients when loading the NewGRFs instead of the current date. Prevents desyncs caused by action 7/9s skipping parts of the GRF based on the date or some other variables that can differ at NewGRF load time (r14769)\n- Change: Only say a engine/vehicle is refittable when it can be refitted to at least two cargo type or when it has subcargoes (r14683)\n- Change: [NewGRF] Since our NewGRF handling is better than it used to be, disable a NewGRF if unexpected sprites are reached (r14184)\n- Fix: A town could build a statue under a bridge [FS#2618] (r15397)\n- Fix: Multiple vehicles could be filling the timetable and only the data from one vehicle would be taken. Now only allow one to be filling at a time [FS#2466] (r15382)\n- Fix: When testing for parallel road two tiles away, do not move more than one tile along the road (r15381)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] The subcargo returned by vehicle variable 0x42 should be the most-common-subcargo of the most-common-cargo. If nothing is transported 0x..FFFF00 should be returned (r15378)\n- Fix: A tram circling around in a depot did never actually 'enter' the depot [FS#2605] (r15375)\n- Fix: Changing town road layout in-game caused ugly road networks [FS#2121] (r15340)\n- Fix: Company could never have auto-assigned colour 0 (dark blue) (r15281)\n- Fix: Deadlock (with wide fonts) or desync when generating manager name (r15279)\n- Fix: Close all windows *before* starting a new game/loading a game instead of doing that as one of the latest steps of loading the game. This caused, in some cases, the NewGRF settings to be reset when the game was already loaded resulting in instant desyncs when joining a network game [FS#2577] (r15256)\n- Fix: Aircraft could be 'loading in the air' or have zero speed while in air after converting old savegames [FS#2571] (r15230, r15227)\n- Fix: Tile error location not reset when levelling land causing a tile to be highlighted when there was nothing to flatten [FS#2542] (r15138)\n- Fix: Signs with sign 'Sign' were lost when converting from TTD savegames (r15137)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Add support for 8 byte action7/9 data, used as a mask for GRFID checks (r15114)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Keep industry variables 8E and 8F in sync with 93, when changing production using results 0D, 0E or 0F of callback 29 or 35 (r15103)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Disable a NewGRF from loading if it contains multiple Action 8s (r14979)\n- Fix: Wrong defaults for service interval when switching between service interval in days and service interval in percentages [FS#2508] (r14959)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Building new station parts did not allocate a new station spec effectively breaking variable 41. This was due to the limited number of station specs that we can have per station. This fix makes newly build station parts create a new spec until one cannot allocate new station specs anymore and it'll revert to the old behaviour (sharing station specs) [FS#1832] (r14956)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Station specs did not get deallocated when building a new station part over them (r14955)\n- Fix: Sharing/cloning/inserting of orders that the/a vehicle (in the shared list) cannot go to (wrong station type etc) [FS#1890] (r14954)\n- Fix: The 'animation state' of the bubbles was stored in a variable that was not stored in the savegame. Using a variable that gets saved in the savegame solves the desync and makes it a bit clearer [FS#2512] (r14931)\n- Fix: Abort dragging of vehicles in the group window when they are deleted [FS#2500] (r14925)\n- Fix: Do not unnecessarily reset the cursor, when a different vehicle is dragged (r14924)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] First create all articulated parts of roadvehicles, then call callback 36 capacity, also call it for all articulated parts (r14903)\n- Fix: Overflow of number of orders per vehicle [FS#2495] (r14830)\n- Fix: Off-by-one causing possible out-of-bounds reads (r14811)\n- Fix: In an MP game in SP mode no company would go bankrupt. Furthermore companies that passed the 'bankrupt' period (4 quarters) would not go bankrupt when loading the game back in MP.

But some compiler (MSVC) over optimised it and inverted this order [FS#1532] (r11627)\n- Fix: There were still some cases where one could not build a tram track, but the tram could become blocked [FS#1525] (r11621)\n- Fix: Do not make crossing red behind depot the train is entering [FS#1531] (r11619)\n- Fix: Buoys are just waypoints, so do not allow load/unload/transfer for them (r11618)\n- Fix: Sometimes large values could go off the chart [FS#1526] (r11616)\n- Fix: Temperate banks can only be built in towns (over a house) (r11615)\n\n\n### 0.6.0-beta2 (2007-12-09)\n\n- Feature: Allow setting a default password for new companies in network games (r11556)\n- Feature: Signal selection GUI for the ones that really like to use that over CTRL (r11547)\n- Feature: Make the bridge selection window resizable (r11539)\n- Feature: [OSX] Added support for using Quartz instead of Quickdraw in windowed mode on OS X 10.4 and higher (r11496)\n- Feature: Allow to resize on creation the smallmap gui in order to show all the types industry available, allow to enable/disable individually or all at once, the industries shown on small map (r11474)\n- Codechange: Send and store the passwords a little more secure to/in the servers (r11557)\n- Fix: Wrong error messages were shown when trying to build some industries in the scenario editor [FS#1524] (r11609)\n- Fix: [NewGRF] Do not trigger industries, but only the industry's tiles (r11608)\n- Fix: Wrong count of Kirby trains when a ship was build [FS#1482] (r11605)\n- Fix: Tiles were not marked dirty in some cases when removing a lock or flooding (r11582, r11604)\n- Fix: Make price for railtype conversion more realistic; conversion should not be more expensive than removing and rebuilding [FS#1481] (r11603)\n- Fix: Do not allow changing network only patches settings from console when not in network game (r11594)\n- Fix: IsSlopeRefused() result was half wrong causing banks to be built on wrong places (r11590)\n- Fix: When ship depots got destroyed they always returned to water, even when it should have been canals [FS#1514] (r11589)\n- Fix: The one way road button was not reset on abort (r11587)\n- Fix: Windows could get completely missing when one resized the window to something very small [FS#1484] (r11583)\n- Fix: Invalidate 'list trains/roadvehs/ships/planes' widgets when station part is added/removed so it does not become glitchy (r11577)\n- Fix: Flood train stations when there are no trains on border tiles too (r11574, r11570)\n- Fix: Reinitialise windows system before loading a savegame because not doing so can cause crashes [FS#1494] (r11572)\n- Fix: Road vehicle getting to the wrong side of a station when trying to overtake in there [FS#1493] (r11571)\n- Fix: Full paths sometimes did not work correctly [FS#1480] (r11568)\n- Fix: Break the chain before moving a vehicle after another in the same chain instead of causing an infinite loop [FS#1512] (r11566)\n- Fix: Aircraft sometimes stopped mid-air when the airport got destroyed [FS#1503] (r11562)\n- Fix: Group list was not updated when removing the last group [FS#1504] (r11561)\n- Fix: Overflow when drawing graphics with high company values [FS#1505] (r11558)\n- Fix: If ever the air/heliport is suddenly not available while the 'chopper' is descending, just go back into flying instead of stopping mid air [FS#1496] (r11546)\n- Fix: Cargo translation was sometimes done when it should not be done [FS#1501] (r11544)\n- Fix: [OSX] Detect statvfs at runtime (based on OSX version) instead of compile time. This should prevent a crash on OSX 10.3 with the precompiled binaries (in the load/save windows) (r11541)\n- Fix: [OSX] Do not try to compile the quartz video driver on OSX 10.3 as it will fail (r11540)\n- Fix: Do not do all kinds of 'updates' for town, waypoint, station and other signs when you have not converted the map to the 'current' format as that means you are going to read data in the 'old' format when you assume that it is in the 'current' format, which is eventually going to break (r11525)\n- Fix: Assertion when tram reversed at a station [FS#1485] (r11524)\n- Fix: The scrollbar of the network gui could run out of bounds (r11522)\n- Fix: [OSX] The cocoa video driver let the mouse cursor escape the window when using rmb scrolling (r11520)\n- Fix: Signs totally illegible when transparent signs is turned on and zoomed out more than one level [FS#1463] (r11507)\n- Fix: Selling vehicles could cause the window of others to scroll to that location [FS#1471] (r11506)\n- Fix: Do not do standard production change if callbacks 29/35 failed, disable smooth economy for industries using callbacks 29/35 (r11502)\n- Fix: Two small layout issues with the vehicle grouping GUI (r11478)\n- Fix: A road vehicle must not show that it is driving max speed when it is standing still waiting for the vehicle in from of it [FS#1451] (r11477)\n- Fix: OpenBSD has ALIGN already defined, causing compilation failures [FS#1450] (r11467)\n- Fix: Operator priority problem resulting in problematic autoroad placement in some cases (r11466)\n\n\n### 0.6.0-beta1 (2007-11-18)\n\n- Feature: Make news messages related to the industry (production) changes better configurable; you can now disable news messages popping up for industries you are not servicing (r11442)\n- Feature: When sorting stations by cargo sum, only sum the cargoes that are selected in the filter (r11437)\n- Feature: Show all players who have shares, not just the first two (r11435)\n- Feature: Make OpenTTD's sprites replaceable using Action 5 and make replacing contiguous subsets of sprites in for some types possible in Action 5 (r11433)\n- Feature: Allow town-bridges to be build on slopes (r11395)\n- Feature: Auto-road; same as auto-rail, but for road and trams and only on X and Y direction (r11339)\n- Feature: OpenTTD version checking for NewGRFs. This allows NewGRFs to do something different for different versions of OpenTTD, like disabling it for too low versions or loading different graphics (r11330)\n- Feature: Half tile- and anti-zig-zag-foundations (r11319)\n- Feature: Control-Clicking the Centre Main View button on the vehicle window allows the main viewport to follow the chosen vehicle (r11304)\n- Feature: User customisable faces (r11269)\n- Feature: Make more advanced rail types more expensive to build (r11265)\n- Feature: Implement the 'moreanimation' feature of TTDP, so we can properly support newindustries (r11228)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for newindustries (r11204)\n- Feature: Sort the NewGRFs by name, making searching a specific NewGRF a lot easier (r11175)\n- Feature: Add possibility to show the bounding boxes of sprites using CTRL-B so one can get a better understanding of the used bounding boxes to fix the glitches that still exist. Note that showing the bounding boxes is not glitch free; it only gives you some knowledge where the bounding boxes are (r11174)\n- Feature: Remove the arbitrary limit of 10 articulated parts for a vehicle (r11120)\n- Feature: Autoslope, changing of slopes of tiles that already have something build on them. Does not work for tiles of houses/industries/stations that do not allow autosloping (r11107)\n- Feature: Support for encapsulating files into a .tar file; you can pack all files in your data/ directory in how ever many .tar files you like, keeping the directory-structure equal to the unpacked version, and OpenTTD can handle them just like the files were unpacked (r11106)\n- Feature: Allow slopes under statues (r11069)\n- Feature: [OSX] Added more options for right click emulation (controlled from the interface tab in the patch window) (r10996)\n- Feature: Allow building and removing tracks and signals when there is a train on a parallel diagonal track that does not interact with this one (r10922)\n- Feature: Added TileHeight to the Land Area Information tool [FS#653] (r10878)\n- Feature: [OSX] OpenTTD will now pick the same language as finder is set to if no config file is found (r10851)\n- Feature: Provide an infrastructure to have resizable windows that are smaller than the default window size.

Now you can make groups of vehicles and perform all kinds of tasks on that given group (r9874)\n- Feature: Make 'improved loading' a proper improved loading instead of loading one (semi-)random vehicle at a time. Furthermore fill multiple vehicles at once when there is enough cargo to do so (r9838)\n- Feature: Add drag and drop removal of station tiles (r9810)\n- Feature: Support for 'curvature info', Action 2 for train, variable 45 (r9803)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add action 1, 2 and 3 support for canals (r9797)\n- Feature: Add the possibility to choose different road patterns for towns to use (r9779)\n- Feature: Add an option to automatically pause when starting a new game (r9734)\n- Feature: Add the concept of cities.

This shows all patches along with their current values (r9565)\n- Feature: Add more finer control to transparency options, including a new toolbar (r9563)\n- Feature: Add support for variable snow lines in the arctic climate, supplied by NewGRF files (r9371)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for newhouses (r9315)\n- Feature: [NewGRF] Add support for Action 13, which allows you to translate GRF-specific texts. The translations will only be shown if you are using a language with a GRF language id and if a string has not already been set specifically for the language you are using (r9037)\n- Feature: Translation dependent formatting of dates (r8906)\n- Feature: If an action 7/9 leads to skipping the rest of the file, disable the NewGRF if an action 8 has not been encountered yet (r8831)\n- Feature: Stop loading and disable the current NewGRF if a fatal error message in Action B is encountered. Also be more strict on the values accepted (r8830)\n- Feature: Build aircraft windows will no longer show aircraft that cannot use the airport in question (r8771)\n- Feature: Drive-through road stops (r8735)\n- Feature: Allow upgrading bridges by building a new bridge over the top (r8567)\n- Feature: Provide aircraft with vertical separation depending on their altitude and velocity (r8534)\n- Feature: When linking the terraform toolbar to the build toolbars place them side by side instead of on top of each other (r8436)\n- Feature: The vehicle build windows are now resizable in horizontal direction as well (r8331, r8336, r8338)\n- Feature: Automatically build semaphores before a configurable date, which can be set by each network player separately (r8151)\n- Feature: Increase sprite limit from 16384 sprites to 16777216 sprites (r8128, r8129)\n- Feature: Add the ability to load savegames when you do not have the exact GRF files in your list. GRF files that are found based on GRF ID (but not on matching md5sum) are used instead of disabling them. This does not affect MP games, there you still need an exact match (r8106)\n- Feature: Show the activated status of the GRF list after pressing 'apply' in the NewGRF window, instead of the local list (r8094)\n- Feature: The station list does now remember the sort settings (r8065)\n- Feature: Make it possible to override the bind address and port of a dedicated server from the command line (r7802)\n- Feature: Add command line option to prevent saving of high score and configuration on exit and a console command to manually initiate a configuration save (r7801)\n- Feature: Add support for tractive effort to 'realistic' acceleration (r7592)\n- Feature: Allow to build bridges of arbitrary rail/road combinations (including signals) (r7573)\n- Codechange: Do not allow configuration changes, that NewGRFs can directly use to change their behaviour, during network games as this can cause desyncs (r11452)\n- Codechange: Make opening a new toolbar not overlapping its parent one, by locating it under the parent, and aligned with the left side of it [FS#1310] (r11256)\n- Codechange: Do not brute force determine the first vehicle in the chain or previous vehicle, but do it by properly accounting the previous and first pointers when updating the next pointer. This gives a performance increase of about 15% when there are a lot of vehicles in the game (r11011)\n- Codechange: Cache expensive NewGRF station variables during sprite lookups/callbacks (r10509)\n- Codechange: Keep track of the origin, time of travel and accumulated feeder share (transfers) of individual pieces of cargo. This means that cargo is not thrown on a big pile when it is put in a station or unloaded at a station, however the GUI does not reflect these changes yet so you will not actually see it (r10266)\n- Codechange: Do not limit the cost of tunnels (r10248)\n- Codechange: Add new vehicle hash table for collision detection and finding vehicles on a tile. The hash area scanned is far smaller than the old hash table, which is now used for viewport updates only. This should give a significant performance improvement for games with many vehicles (r10111)\n- Codechange: Do not redraw all station tiles when cargo is added or removed if the station has no custom graphics (r10062)\n- Codechange: Add some support for NewGRF var 7D, temporary storage array (r9707)\n- Codechange: Add support for returning 'TTDPatch variables' (Action D) (r9701)\n- Codechange: Implement NewGRF callback 36, which allows changing of various properties which were previously static (r9671 and several others)\n- Codechange: Add support for multiple 'base' directories for NewGRF searching (r9560)\n- Codechange: Implement actions 1/2/3 for cargoes, callback handler and custom icon sprites (rmany)\n- Codechange: Rename the 'New <vehtype>' button of the global vehicle lists to 'Available <vehtype>' as it is a view-only list, not one from which you can purchase (rolling) stock (r8420)\n- Codechange: Remove the landscaping button from the build toolbars (r8143)\n- Codechange: [NewGRF] Do not mark as unsafe those NewGRFs that set their own parameters (via action D) and/or change only bridge sprite table layouts (action 0, property D) (r7831)\n- Fix: The CHANCE16 functions were biased; a 32768 in 65536 chance was really a 32769 in 65536 chance (r11454)\n- Fix: Do not create shores in canyons (r11438)\n- Fix: Starting OpenTTD with DOS files made it look weird out of the box (r11433)\n- Fix: Properly support genders coming from NewGRFs instead of crashing [FS#1430] (r11422)\n- Fix: Do not ignore the autorenew settings for new games when creating a new game [FS#1428] (r11415)\n- Fix: Do not do a 270 degree turn when 90 degrees is enough on a commuter airport [FS#1422] (r11408)\n- Fix: In rare cases OpenTTD could segfault when resizing and scroll the main window (r11405)\n- Fix: Manually replacing a vehicle with shared orders makes it lose it is order index and service interval [FS1384] (r11370)\n- Fix: Road vehicles must not drive through each other on bridges/in tunnels [FS#1258] (r11366)\n- Fix: When stopping a ship or aircraft, set their speed to 0 so they will not continue at the speed where they were stopped at [FS#1288] (r11365)\n- Fix: Cloning vehicles with non-standard sub-cargotypes (i.e. livery refits) failed [FS#1380] (r11362)\n- Fix: Loading too many GRFs was not handled gracefully causing crashes and such [FS#1377] (r11355)\n- Fix: Add missing elrail sprites for some rail build buttons/cursors (r11350)\n- Fix: Trees can now be planted on bare land without making it grassy, planting tree in desert does not make it grassy for the first tile-cycle and when a tree dies in desert, it no longer becomes a snowy tile for the first tile-cycle (r11244)\n- Fix: The explosion vehicles were placed too far to the south [FS#1312] (r11234)\n- Fix: One could sell vehicles that were crashed in a depot, which would still yield money/one could construct trains of crashed vehicles [FS#1307, FS#1228] (r11229, r11230)\n- Fix: Electric trains were not shown as stopped in depots when converting it from elrail -> normal rail [FS#1260] (r11167)\n- Fix: A lot of graphical glitches by changing some bounding boxes. It is not perfect yet, but a *very* good step into the right direction (r11128)\n- Fix: When autorenew is enabled and it cannot renew the vehicle anymore (because the player cannot build the engine), the ageing warnings as if autorenew is not enabled are shown [FS#553] (r11064)\n- Fix: Inconsistency between rail<->elrail conversions of different kinds of rail containing tiles (normal rail, stations, depots, etc) [FS#1182] (r11059)\n- Fix: Crash when having the Finance window opened of the player you are cheating to [FS#1177] (r11028)\n- Fix: Switching players (using the cheat) crashed on Big Endian machines [FS#1150] (r11023)\n- Fix: The canal border determination did not take oil rigs into consideration (r11022)\n- Fix: Do not display income/expenses when they do not belong to a 'valid' tile, like the money cheat/giving money [FS#1175] (r11021)\n- Fix: One could not give money when they had too much money or rather: when casting the amount of money to an int32 becomes negative [FS#1174] (r11020)\n- Fix: When determining the gender of a string, do not assume that the gender is in the front of the string when there can be case switching code at that location [FS#1104] (r10792)\n- Fix: Determining whether there is a tunnel going under the lowered area is only needed in two directions instead of all four, so take the directions (one for each axis) to the nearest border (along the given axis) [FS#1058] (r10686)\n- Fix: Graphical glitches when the 'link landscape toolbar' patch is turned on when opening one of the construction toolbars [FS#1076] (r10685)\n- Fix: Trolly AI did not know about steep slopes, and used wrong tileh in some cases [FS#1070] (r10655)\n- Fix: Be consistent with the space between the company name and the player number, i.e. always put a space between them [FS#1052] (r10627)\n- Fix: [YAPF] Ships received curve penalty for non-diagonal straight move (r10578)\n- Fix: Do not segfault when you quit in the end-of-the-game screen [FS#1020] (r10548)\n- Fix: When Cheat-Window is open and a new month happens, the window was not redrawn instantly (r10547)\n- Fix: You can now have both Available Train as Available Ship window open [FS#1026] (r10546)\n- Fix: Cargo payment rates overflow and cargo payment rates diverge from cost rates making it impossible to make any profit after a certain number of years. Both are solved by stopping the inflation after 170 years; there is absolutely no point in continuing the inflation after that as it only makes the game have overflows at some point that cannot be solved; using larger variables only delays the inevitable [FS#1028] (r10541)\n- Fix: Error dialogue was sometimes shown on all clients when a command failed instead of only the client that actually did the command [FS#1015] (r10501)\n- Fix: The network protocol check for required NewGRFs sent static NewGRFs too (r10414)\n- Fix: When landscape generating, allow for 200ms between screen updates instead of updating every 200ms. Previously slow screen updates would result in very slow map generation (r10396)\n- Fix: One could only build a limited number of stations before one had to rename them [FS#278] (r10320)\n- Fix: Acceleration not calculated properly when a train goes up a hill between tunnels [FS#786] (r10317)\n- Fix: [YAPF] Now it is no longer needed to invalidate the YAPF segment cache every tick in MP (read performance increase).

          "content": "# OpenTTD's known bugs\n\n## Table of contents\n\n- 1.0) About\n- 2.0) Known bugs\n\n## 1.0) About\n\nAll bugs listed below are marked as known. Please do not submit any bugs\nthat are the same as these. If you do, do not act surprised, because\nwe WILL flame you!\n\nThe current list of known bugs that we intend to fix can be found in our\nbug tracking system at https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/issues\nAlso check the closed bugs when searching for your bug in this system as we\nmight have fixed the bug in the mean time.\n\n## 2.0) Known bugs\n\nThis section lists all known bugs that we do not intend to fix and the\nreasons why we think that fixing them is infeasible. We might make some\nminor improvements that reduce the scope of these bugs, but we will not\nbe able to completely fix them.\n\n### No suitable AI can be found:\n\nIf you have no AIs and an AI is started the so-called 'dummy' AI will\nbe loaded. This AI does nothing but writing a message on the AI debug\nwindow and showing a red warning. There are basically two solutions\nfor this problem: Either you set the number of AI players to 0 so that\nno AI is started. You find that setting at the top of the window in the\n\"AI / Game Scripts Settings\" window.\n\nThe other solution is acquiring (downloading) some AI. The easiest way\nto do this is via the \"Check Online Content\" button in the main (intro)\nmenu or directly in the \"AI / Game Scripts Settings\" dialogue via the\n\"Check Online Content\" button.\n\n### After a while of playing, colours get corrupted:\n\nIn Windows 7 the background slideshow corrupts the colour mapping\nof OpenTTD's 8bpp screen modes. Workarounds for this are:\n\n* Switching to windowed mode, instead of fullscreen\n* Switching off background slideshow\n* Setting up the `32bpp-anim` or `32bpp-optimized` blitter\n\n### Custom vehicle type name is incorrectly aligned:\n\nSome NewGRFs use sprites that are bigger than normal in the \"buy\nvehicle\" window. Due to this they have to encode an offset for\nthe vehicle type name. Upon renaming the vehicle type this encoded\noffset is stripped from the name because the \"edit box\" cannot show\nthis encoding. As a result the custom vehicle type names will get\nthe default alignment. The only way to (partially) fix this is by\nadding spaces to the custom name.\n\n### Clipping problems [#119]:\n\nIn some cases sprites are not drawn as one would expect. Examples of\nthis are aircraft that might be hidden below the runway or trees that\nin some cases are rendered over vehicles.\n\nThe primary cause of this problem is that OpenTTD does not have enough\ndata (like a 3D model) to properly determine what needs to be drawn in\nfront of what. OpenTTD has bounding boxes but in lots of cases they\nare either too big or too small and then cause problems with what\nneeds to be drawn in front of what. Also some visual tricks are used.\n\nFor example trains at 8 pixels high, the catenary needs to be drawn\nabove that. When you want to draw bridges on top of that, which are\nonly one height level (= 8 pixels) higher, you are getting into some\nbig problems.\n\nWe can not change the height levels; it would require us to either\nredraw all vehicle or all landscape graphics. Doing so would mean we\nleave the Transport Tycoon graphics, which in effect means OpenTTD\nwill not be a Transport Tycoon clone anymore.\n\n### Mouse scrolling not possible at the edges of the screen [#383] [#3966]:\n\nScrolling the viewport with the mouse cursor at the edges of the screen\nin the same direction of the edge will fail. If the cursor is near the\nedge the scrolling will be very slow.\n\nOpenTTD only receives cursor position updates when the cursor is inside\nOpenTTD's window. It is not told how far you have moved the cursor\noutside of OpenTTD's window.\n\n### Lost trains ignore (block) exit signals [#1473]:\n\nIf trains are lost they ignore block exit signals, blocking junctions\nwith presignals. This is caused because the path finders cannot tell\nwhere the train needs to go. As such a random direction is chosen at\neach junction. This causes the trains to occasionally to make choices\nthat are unwanted from a player's point of view.\n\nThis will not be fixed because lost trains are in almost all cases a\nnetwork problem, e.g. a train can never reach a specific place. This\nmakes the impact of fixing the bug enormously small against the amount\nof work needed to write a system that prevents the lost trains from\ntaking the wrong direction.\n\n### Vehicle owner of last transfer leg gets paid for all [#2427]:\n\nWhen you make a transfer system that switches vehicle owners. This\nis only possible with 'industry stations', e.g. the oil rig station\nthe owner of the vehicle that does the final delivery gets paid for\nthe whole trip. It is not shared amongst the different vehicle\nowners that have participated in transporting the cargo.\n\nThis sharing is not done because it would enormously increase the\nmemory and CPU usage in big games for something that is happening\nin only one corner case. We think it is not worth the effort until\nsharing of stations is an official feature.\n\n### Forbid 90 degree turns does not work for crossing PBS paths [#2737]:\n\nWhen you run a train through itself on a X junction with PBS turned on\nthe train will not obey the 'forbid 90 degree turns' setting. This is\ndue to the fact that we can not be sure that the setting was turned\noff when the track was reserved, which means that we assume it was\nturned on and that the setting does not hold at the time. We made it\nthis way to allow one to change the setting in-game, but it breaks\nslightly when you are running your train through itself. Running a\ntrain through means that your network is broken and is thus a user\nerror which OpenTTD tries to graciously handle.\n\nFixing this bug means that we need to record whether this particular\nsetting was turned on or off at the time the reservation was made. This\nmeans adding quite a bit of data to the savegame for solving an issue\nthat is basically an user error. We think it is not worth the effort.\n\n### Duplicate (station) names after renaming [#3204]:\n\nAfter renaming stations one can create duplicate station names. This\nis done giving a station the same custom name as another station with\nan automatically generated name.\n\nThe major part of this problem is that station names are translatable.\nMeaning that a station is called e.g. '<TOWN> Central' in English and\n'<TOWN> Centraal' in Dutch. This means that in network games the\nrenaming of a town could cause the rename to succeed on some clients\nand fail at others. This creates an inconsistent game state that will\nbe seen as a 'desync'. Secondly the custom names are intended to fall\ncompletely outside of the '<TOWN> <name>' naming of stations, so when\nyou rename a town all station names are updated accordingly.\n\nAs a result the decision has been made that all custom names are only\ncompared to the other custom names in the same class and not compared\nto the automatically generated names.\n\n### Extreme CPU usage/hangs when using SDL and PulseAudio [#3294], OpenTTD hangs/freezes when closing, OpenTTD is slow, OpenTTD uses a lot of CPU:\n\nOpenTTD can be extremely slow/use a lot of CPU when the sound is\nplayed via SDL and then through PulseAudio's ALSA wrapper. Under the\nsame configuration OpenTTD, or rather SDL, might hang when exiting\nthe game. This problem is seen most in Ubuntu 9.04 and higher.\n\nThis is because recent versions of the PulseAudio sound server\nare configured to use timer-based audio scheduling rather than\ninterrupt-based audio scheduling. Configuring PulseAudio to force\nuse of interrupt-based scheduling may resolve sound problems for\nsome users. Under recent versions of Ubuntu Linux (9.04 and higher)\nthis can be accomplished by changing the following line in the\n`/etc/pulse/default.pa` file:\n        `load-module module-udev-detect`\nto\n        `load-module module-udev-detect tsched=0`\n\nNote that PulseAudio must be restarted for changes to take effect. Older\nversions of PulseAudio may use the module-hal-detect module instead.\nAdding tsched=0 to the end of that line will have a similar effect.\n\nAnother possible solution is selecting the \"pulse\" backend of SDL\nby either using `SDL_AUDIODRIVER=pulse openttd` at the command\nprompt or installing the `libsdl1.2debian-pulseaudio` package from\nUbuntu's Universe repository. For other distributions a similar\npackage needs to be installed.\n\n### OpenTTD not properly resizing with SDL on X [#3305]:\n\nUnder some X window managers OpenTTD's window does not properly\nresize. You will either end up with a black bar at the right/bottom\nside of the window or you cannot see the right/bottom of the window,\ne.g. you cannot see the status bar. The problem is that OpenTTD does\nnot always receive a resize event from SDL making it impossible for\nOpenTTD to know that the window was resized; sometimes moving the\nwindow will solve the problem.\n\nWindow managers that are known to exhibit this behaviour are GNOME's\nand KDE's. With the XFCE's and LXDE's window managers the resize\nevent is sent when the user releases the mouse.\n\n### Incorrect colours, crashes upon exit, debug warnings and smears upon window resizing with SDL on macOS [#3447]:\n\nVideo handling with (lib)SDL under macOS is known to fail on some\nversions of macOS with some hardware configurations. Some of\nthe problems happen only under some circumstances whereas others\nare always present.\n\nWe suggest that the SDL video/sound backend is not used for OpenTTD\nin combinations with macOS.\n\n### Train crashes entering same junction from block and path signals [#3928]:\n\nWhen a train has reserved a path from a path signal to a two way\nblock signal and the reservation passes a path signal through the\nback another train can enter the reserved path (only) via that\nsame two way block signal.\n\nThe reason for this has to do with optimisation; to fix this issue\nthe signal update has to pass all path signals until it finds either\na train or a backwards facing signal. This is a very expensive task.\n\nThe (signal) setups that allow these crashes can furthermore be\nconsidered incorrectly signalled; one extra safe waiting point for\nthe train entering from path signal just after the backwards facing\nsignal (from the path signal train) resolves the issue.\n\n### Crashes when run in a VM using Parallels Desktop [#4003]:\n\nWhen the Windows version of OpenTTD is executed in a VM under\nParallels Desktop a privileged instruction exception may be thrown.\n\nAs OpenTTD works natively on macOS as well as natively on Windows and\nthese native builds both don't exhibit this behaviour this crash is\nmost likely due to a bug in the virtual machine, something out of\nthe scope of OpenTTD. Most likely this is due to Parallels Desktop\nlacking support for RDTSC calls. The problem can be avoided by using\nother VM-software, Wine, or running natively on macOS.\n\n### Entry- and exit signals are not dragged [#4378]:\n\nUnlike all other signal types, the entry- and exit signals are not\ndragged but instead normal signals are placed on subsequent track\nsections. This is done on purpose as this is the usually more\nconvenient solution. There are little to no occasions where more\nthan one entry or exit signal in a row are useful. This is different\nfor all other signal types where several in a row can serve one\npurpose or another.\n\n### (Temporary) wrong colours when switching to full screen [#4511]:\n\nOn Windows it can happen that you temporarily see wrong colours\nwhen switching to full screen OpenTTD, either by starting\nOpenTTD in full screen mode, changing to full screen mode or by\nALT-TAB-ing into a full screen OpenTTD. This is caused by the\nfact that OpenTTD, by default, uses 8bpp paletted output. The\nwrong colours you are seeing is a temporary effect of the video\ndriver switching to 8bpp palette mode.\n\nThis issue can be worked around in two ways:\n* Setting fullscreen_bpp to 32\n* Setting up the 32bpp-anim or 32bpp-optimized blitter\n\n### Can't run OpenTTD with the -d option from a MSYS console [#4587]:\n\nThe MSYS console does not allow OpenTTD to open an extra console for\ndebugging output. Compiling OpenTTD with the --enable-console\nconfigure option prevents this issue and allows the -d option to use\nthe MSYS console for its output.\n\n### Unreadable characters for non-latin locales [#4607]:\n\nOpenTTD does not ship a non-latin font in its graphics files. As a\nresult OpenTTD needs to acquire the font from somewhere else. What\nOpenTTD does is ask the operating system, or a system library, for\nthe best font for a given language if the currently loaded font\ndoes not provide all characters of the chosen translation. This\nmeans that OpenTTD has no influence over the quality of the chosen\nfont; it just does the best it can do.\n\nIf the text is unreadable there are several steps that you can take\nto improve this. The first step is finding a good font and configure\nthis in the configuration file. See section 9.0 of README.md for\nmore information. You can also increase the font size to make the\ncharacters bigger and possible better readable.\n\nIf the problem is with the clarity of the font you might want to\nenable anti-aliasing by setting the small_aa/medium_aa/large_aa\nsettings to \"true\". However, anti-aliasing only works when a 32-bit\nblitter has been selected, e.g. `blitter = \"32bpp-anim\"`, as with the\n8 bits blitter there are not enough colours to properly perform the\nanti-aliasing.\n\n### Train does not crash with itself [#4635]:\n\nWhen a train drives in a circle the front engine passes through\nwagons of the same train without crashing. This is intentional.\nSignals are only aware of tracks, they do not consider the train\nlength and whether there would be enough room for a train in some\ncircle it might drive on. Also the path a train might take is not\nnecessarily known when passing a signal.\n\nChecking all circumstances would take a lot of additional\ncomputational power for signals, which is not considered worth\nthe effort, as it does not add anything to gameplay.\n\nNevertheless trains shall not crash in normal operation, so making\na train not crash with itself is the best solution for everyone.\n\n### Aircraft coming through wall in rotated airports [#4705]:\n\nWith rotated airports, specifically hangars, you will see that the\naircraft will show a part through the back wall of the hangar.\n\nThis can be solved by only drawing a part of the plane when being\nat the back of the hangar, however then with transparency turned on\nthe aircraft would be shown partially which would be even weirder.\n\nAs such the current behaviour is deemed the least bad.\nThe same applies to overly long ships and their depots.\n\n### Vehicles not keeping their \"maximum\" speed [#4815]:\n\nVehicles that have not enough power to reach and maintain their\nadvertised maximum speed might be constantly jumping between two\nspeeds. This is due to the fact that speed and its calculations\nare done with integral numbers instead of floating point numbers.\n\nAs a result of this a vehicle will never reach its equilibrium\nbetween the drag/friction and propulsion. So in effect it will be\nin a vicious circle of speeding up and slowing down due to being\njust at the other side of the equilibrium.\n\nNot speeding up when near the equilibrium will cause the vehicle to\nnever come in the neighbourhood of the equilibrium and not slowing\ndown when near the equilibrium will cause the vehicle to never slow\ndown towards the equilibrium once it has come down a hill.\n\nIt is possible to calculate whether the equilibrium will be passed,\nbut then all acceleration calculations need to be done twice.\n\n### Settings not saved when OpenTTD crashes [#4846]:\n\nThe settings are not saved when OpenTTD crashes for several reasons.\nThe most important is that the game state is broken and as such the\nsettings might contain invalid values, or the settings have not even\nbeen loaded yet. This would cause invalid or totally wrong settings\nto be written to the configuration file.\n\nA solution to that would be saving the settings whenever one changes,\nhowever due to the way the configuration file is saved this requires\na flush of the file to the disk and OpenTTD needs to wait till that\nis finished. On some file system implementations this causes the\nflush of all 'write-dirty' caches, which can be a significant amount\nof data to be written. This can further be aggravated by spinning\ndown disks to conserve power, in which case this disk needs to be\nspun up first. This means that many seconds may pass before the\nconfiguration file is actually written, and all that time OpenTTD\nwill not be able to show any progress. Changing the way the\nconfiguration file is saved is not an option as that leaves us more\nvulnerable to corrupt configuration files.\n\nFinally, crashes should not be happening. If they happen they should\nbe reported and fixed, so essentially fixing this is fixing the wrong\nthing. If you really need the configuration changes to be saved,\nand you need to run a version that crashes regularly, then you can\nuse the `saveconfig` command in the console to save the settings.\n\n### Not all NewGRFs, AIs, game scripts are found [#4887]:\n\nUnder certain situations, where the path for the content within a\ntar file is the same as other content on the file system or in another\ntar file, it is possible that content is not found. A more thorough\nexplanation and solutions are described in section 4.4 of README.md.\n\n### Mouse cursor going missing with SDL [#4997]:\n\nUnder certain circumstances SDL does not notify OpenTTD of changes with\nrespect to the mouse pointer, specifically whether the mouse pointer\nis within the bounds of OpenTTD or not. For example, if you \"Alt-Tab\"\nto another application the mouse cursor will still be shown in OpenTTD,\nand when you move the mouse outside of the OpenTTD window so the cursor\ngets hidden, open/move another application on top of the OpenTTD window\nand then Alt-tab back into OpenTTD the cursor will not be shown.\n\nWe cannot fix this problem as SDL simply does not provide the required\ninformation in these corner cases. This is a bug in SDL and as such\nthere is little that we can do about it.\n\n### Trains might not stop at platforms that are currently being changed [#5553]:\n\nIf you add tiles to or remove tiles from a platform while a train is\napproaching to stop at the same platform, that train can miss the place\nwhere it's supposed to stop and pass the station without stopping.\n\nThis is caused by the fact that the train is considered to already\nhave stopped if it's beyond its assigned stopping location. We can't\nlet the train stop just anywhere in the station because then it would\nnever leave the station if you have the same station in the order\nlist multiple times in a row or if there is only one station\nin theorder list (see #5684).\n\n### Some houses and industries are not affected by transparency [#5817]:\n\nSome of the default houses and industries (f.e. the iron ore mine) are\nnot affected by the transparency options. This is because the graphics\ndo not (completely) separate the ground from the building.\n\nThis is a bug of the original graphics, and unfortunately cannot be\nfixed with OpenGFX for the sake of maintaining compatibility with\nthe original graphics.\n\n### Involuntary cargo exchange with cargodist via neutral station [#6114]:\n\nWhen two players serve a neutral station at an industry, a cross-company\nchain for cargo flow can and will be established which can only be\ninterrupted if one of the players stops competing for the resources of\nthat industry. There is an easy fix for this: If you are loading at the\nshared station make the order \"no unload\" and if you're unloading make\nit \"no load\". Cargodist will then figure out that it should not create\nsuch a route.\n\n### Incorrect ending year displayed in end of game newspaper [#8625]\n\nThe ending year of the game is configurable, but the date displayed in\nthe newspaper at the end of the game is part of the graphics, not text.\n\nSo to fix this would involve fixing the graphics in every baseset,\nincluding the original. Additionally, basesets are free to put this\ntext in different positions (which they do), making a proper solution\nto this infinitely more complex for a part of the game that fewer than\n1% of players ever see.\n"
