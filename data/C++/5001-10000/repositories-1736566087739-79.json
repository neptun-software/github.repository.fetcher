Significantly faster and more robust than Ceres.\n* API documentation with auto-generated stubs for pycolmap.\n* Use PoseLib's minimal solvers for faster performance and improved robustness.\n* Experimental support for CUDA-based bundle adjustment through Ceres (disabled by default).\n* Support for reading 16-bit PNG grayscale images.\n* New RAD_TAN_THIN_PRISM_FISHEYE camera model in support of Meta's Project Aria devices.\n* Replace numerical with analytical Jacobian in image undistortion for better convergence.\n* Many more performance optimizations and other improvements. See full list of changes below.\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n* Fixed non-deterministic behavior of CUDA SIFT feature extractor. Broken since 3.10 release.\n* Fixed orientation detection of covariant/affine SIFT feature extractor. Broken since initial release.\n* Fixed point triangulator crashing due to bug in observation manager. Broken since 3.10 release.\n* Fixed sequential feature matcher overlap missing the farthest image. Broken since initial release.\n* Fixed rare deadlock during matching due to concurrent database access. Broken since 3.10 release.\n* Fixed little/big endian detection.

Improved robustness and faster incremental reconstruction process\n* Add ``image_deleter`` command to remove images from sparse model\n* Add ``image_filter`` command to filter bad registrations from sparse model\n* Add ``point_filtering`` command to filter sparse model point clouds\n* Add ``database_merger`` command to merge two databases, which is\n  useful to parallelize matching across different machines\n* Add ``image_undistorter_standalone`` to enable undistorting images\n  without a pre-existing full sparse model\n* Improved undistortion for fisheye cameras and FOV camera model\n* Support for masking input images in feature extraction stage\n* Improved HiDPI support in GUI for high-resolution monitors\n* Import sparse model when launching GUI from CLI\n* Faster CPU-based matching using approximate NN search\n* Support for bundle adjustment with fixed extrinsics\n* Support for fixing existing images when continuing reconstruction\n* Camera model colors in viewer can be customized\n* Support for latest GPU architectures in CUDA build\n* Support for writing sparse models in Python scripts\n* Scripts for building and running COLMAP in Docker\n* Many more bug fixes and improvements to code and documentation\n\n-----------------------\nCOLMAP 3.5 (08/22/2018)\n-----------------------\n* COLMAP is now released under the BSD license instead of the GPL\n* COLMAP is now installed as a library, whose headers can be included and\n  libraries linked against from other C/C++ code\n* Add hierarchical mapper for parallelized reconstruction or large scenes\n* Add sparse and dense Delaunay meshing algorithms, which reconstruct a\n  watertight surface using a graph cut on the Delaunay triangulation of the\n  reconstructed sparse or dense point cloud\n* Improved robustness when merging different models\n* Improved pre-trained vocabulary trees available for download\n* Add COLMAP as a software entry under Linux desktop systems\n* Add support to compile COLMAP on ARM platforms\n* Add example Python script to read/write COLMAP database\n* Add region of interest (ROI) cropping in image undistortion\n* Several import bug fixes for spatial

``src/exe/colmap.cc`` executable. The GUI can now be\n  started using the command ``colmap gui`` and other commands are available\n  as ``colmap [command]``. For example, the feature extractor is now available\n  as ``colmap feature_extractor [args]`` while all command-line arguments stay\n  the same as before. This should result in much faster project compile times\n  and smaller disk space usage of the program. More details about the new\n  interface are documented at https://colmap.github.io/cli.html\n* More complete depth and normal maps with larger patch sizes\n* Faster dense stereo computation by skipping rows/columns in patch match,\n  improved random sampling in patch match, and faster bilateral NCC\n* Better high DPI screen support for the graphical user interface\n* Improved model viewer under Windows, which now requires Qt 5.4\n* Save computed two-view geometries in database\n* Images (keypoint/matches visualization, depth and normal maps) can now be\n  saved from the graphical user interface\n* Support for PMVS format without sparse bundler file\n* Faster covariant feature detection\n* Many more bug fixes and improvements\n\n-----------------------\nCOLMAP 3.3 (11/21/2017)\n-----------------------\n* Add DSP (Domain Size Pooling) SIFT implementation.

COLMAP\nbuilds on top of existing works and when using specific algorithms within\nCOLMAP, please also cite the original authors, as specified in the source code,\nand consider citing relevant third-party dependencies (most notably\nceres-solver, poselib, sift-gpu, vlfeat).\n\n\nDownload\n--------\n\n* Binaries for **Windows** and other resources can be downloaded\n  from https://github.com/colmap/colmap/releases.\n* Binaries for **Linux/Unix/BSD** are available at\n  https://repology.org/metapackage/colmap/versions.\n* Pre-built **Docker** images are available at\n  https://hub.docker.com/r/colmap/colmap.\n* **Python bindings** are available at https://pypi.org/project/pycolmap.\n* To **build from source**, please see https://colmap.github.io/install.html.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n1. Download pre-built binaries or build from source.\n2. Download one of the provided datasets at https://demuc.de/colmap/datasets/\n   or use your own images.\n3. Use the **automatic reconstruction** to easily build models\n   with a single click or command.\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation is available at https://colmap.github.io/.\n\n\nSupport\n-------\n\nPlease, use GitHub Discussions at https://github.com/colmap/colmap/discussions\nfor questions and the GitHub issue tracker at https://github.com/colmap/colmap\nfor bug reports, feature requests/additions, etc.\n\n\nAcknowledgments\n---------------\n\nCOLMAP was originally written by [Johannes Schönberger](https://demuc.de/) with\nfunding provided by his PhD advisors Jan-Michael Frahm and Marc Pollefeys.\nThe team of core project maintainers currently includes\n[Johannes Schönberger](https://github.com/ahojnnes),\n[Paul-Edouard Sarlin](https://github.com/sarlinpe), and\n[Shaohui Liu](https://github.com/B1ueber2y).\n\nThe Python bindings in PyCOLMAP were originally added by\n[Mihai Dusmanu](https://github.com/mihaidusmanu),\n[Philipp Lindenberger](https://github.com/Phil26AT), and\n[Paul-Edouard Sarlin](https://github.com/sarlinpe).\n\nThe project has also benefitted from countless community contributions, including\nbug fixes, improvements, new features, third-party tooling, and community\nsupport (special credits to [Torsten Sattler](https://tsattler.github.io)).\n\n\nContribution\n------------\n\nContributions (bug reports, bug fixes, improvements, etc.) are very welcome and\nshould be submitted in the form of new issues and/or pull requests on GitHub.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nThe COLMAP library is licensed under the new BSD license.
