The details of the formatting are fixed in the\n`.clang-format` file at the root of this repository.\n\nWhen making changes to the source code, please always reformat the changed files using this tool in order to ensure a consistent formatting across the\ncode base.\n\n\n## Use of `auto`\n\nSince we are using a more modern C++ standard, the usage of the `auto` keyword is in principle possible. However we have decided that for the sake of\nreadability of the code we want to restrict its usage to the following cases:\n1. Usage of STL-iterators\n2. If the expression of the assignment already contains the type explicitly (e.g. because of a cast or by usage of e.g. `make_unique`)\n\nAn example of the first scenario would be\n```cpp\nauto it = myVector.begin();\n```\nAnd examples for the second case are\n```cpp\nauto myObj   = new MyObject();\nauto myOther = std::make_unique< MyOther >();\nauto number  = static_cast< int >(1.5);\n```\n\n\n## Smart pointers\n\nYou should always prefer smart-pointers over raw pointers. The general rule is: Never use `new` and `delete` explicitly.\n\nAlso prefer `std::unique_ptr` over `std::shared_ptr`, unless you are really intending for the object to have shared ownership.\n\nWhen it comes to passing pointers into functions, always pass as raw-pointer, unless you want to transfer ownership of the pointer to the function.\n\n\n## Pointer vs. Reference\n\nUse pointers only if `nullptr` is a valid option (and is therefore explicitly checked for). Whenever you are expecting that a passed value is set,\npass that value by reference instead in order to make sure that the semantics forbid passing `nullptr` to the function.\n\n\n## Qt vs. STL\n\nWherever feasible, you should prefer using types from the standard library (STL) instead of Qt-specific ones. Note that this only applies if you don't\nhave to pass that type (indirectly) into Qt functions that only accept Qt-specific types. In these cases, prefer Qt-types.\n\n"

          "content": "# Mumble Commit Message Guidelines\n\nA commit groups file changes with a title and description of the changes and additional metadata like change date, author, and committer.\n\nThese Commit Message Guidelines define and describe how changes shall be structured and described in commits.\nMost notably, the text form in which to title the changes.\n\n## General philosophy\n\n- **Each change goes into its own commit**. If you want to summarize what you did with this commit (in the commit message)\nand you start using the word \"and\", you probably want to split the commit up into 2 or more individual commits.\n\n- **Each commit should compile** (try to make each commit self-contained so that it is possible to compile the code at\neach commit).\n\n- **Take your time** when composing the commit message. In order to have a good git-history the commit messages are essential.\nAlso if you put effort into the commit-message, you'll save work when creating a PullRequest as the description is already available.\n\n\n## Commit message\n\nCommit messages must follow this scheme:\n\n```\nTYPE(Scope): Summary\n\nMessage Body\n\nFooter\n```\n\nThe blank lines in between are mandatory. A commit **must** include a `TYPE` and a `Summary` and **may**\nadditionally contain any of the other components listed here.\n\n\n### Subject line\n\nThe first line (\"Subject line\") should not exceed 50-70 characters. This is what gets displayed on GitHub at first glance, so it\nshould contain the most important information. In order for it to be as short and precise as possible, there is the `TYPE` and\noptionally a `Scope`. With these it should already be clear what this commit is about in general. The short `Summary` should\nthen include further information that is important to understand the general idea of this commit at a glance.\n\n\n#### TYPE\n\nThe `TYPE` is one of the following:\n\n| **TYPE** | **Description** | **Example** |\n| -------- | --------------- | ----------- |\n| BREAK    | A breaking change - not backwards-compatible | A change in protocol (e.g. change UDP message format) |\n| FEAT     | Introduction of a new feature (or extension of an existing one) | |\n| FIX      | A bug fix | |\n| FORMAT   | Change of formatting - does not influence how the code works | Change indentation of a line; Add braces around `if` body |\n| DOCS     | Changes to the documentation (either in-source or out-of-source) | Add a Doxygen comment to a function |\n| TEST     | Adds, changes or removes a test-case | |\n| MAINT    | Maintenance - Change of non-code files | Make changes to `.plist` or `.rc` files |\n| CI       | Changed something for the CI (continuous integration) | Update TravisCI to use newer ubuntu version |\n| REFAC    | Code refactoring | Rename variable `x` to `y` |\n| BUILD    | Changes related to the build process / buildsystem | Fix cmake script |\n| TRANSLATION | Translation updates and changes | Update translation files |\n| CHANGE   | Something was changed without falling into existing categories | Changed the default of a setting |\n| REVERT   | A previous commit had to be reverted because e.g. it was buggy | - |\n\nThe `TYPE` has to be in **all-uppercase** in order for it to stand out.\n\nIf you feel like you need to use 2 or more types for a single commit but *can't split it* into multiple commits, you can\ncombine types with `/`: `FEAT/CI: <Summary>`\n\n\n#### Scope\n\nWhat area is the change about. For now we don't have fixed scope keywords. A scope could be something like `ui`, `client`,\n`server`, `ice`, ...\n\n\n#### Summary\n\nThe `Summary` is the heart of the subject line. It should contain a **very brief** summary of what you did in that commit.\nIn order to make this as short as possible, you may use grammatically incorrect sentences\n(\"Add ability\" instead of \"add the ability\").\n\nIn general the `Summary` should answer the question \"Applying this commit will ...\" where \"...\" is your `Summary`.\n\nIf your `Summary` contains \"and\", you should probably split your commit up.\n\nNote: Issue references (such as #2305) **must not** be used in the `Summary`!\n\n\n### Message Body\n\nHere you give more details about the commit. Why is it necessary and what are the details of the change. You can use\nmultiple paragraphs for this and be as verbose as you want.\n\nThe `Message Body` should reference issues that are related to this change, but also provide a short summary of what that\nissue is about (so that it can be understood without having to open that issue).\n\nThe `Message Body` should contain enough information for someone to be able to look at this commit at some point in the\nfuture and know exactly what it does and why it was needed.\n\n\n### Footer\n\nThe `Footer` contains a list of issue references prefixed by a keyword like `Closes`, `Fixes` or `Implements`.\n\nEach reference should be on its own line:\n\n```\nImplements #1234\nCloses #2215\n```\n\nAdditionally the `Footer` may contain another paragraph indicating that a given commit was co-authored by other people.\nEach co-author should be listed in a new line like so:\n\n```\nCo-Authored-By: Author name <author@example.com>\nCo-Authored-By: Other author <other@example.com>\n```\n\n\n### References\n\nWe have used the term \"reference\" a few times in these guidelines. A *reference* has the form `#<ID>` where `<ID>` is the\nID GitHub assigns to the respective issue or PullRequest (it's the number that is displayed next to the title). You'll\nnotice that these references are actually turned into a link when viewing the commit message on GitHub. This is done\nautomatically by GitHub. You don't have to use a link in your commit message. In fact you *should not* use a link for\nthis purpose as this is just unnecessarily verbose and makes it hard to read the commit message outside of GitHub.\n\n\n### Examples\n\n```\nFEAT(client): Add possibility to change username\n\nCo-Authored-by: Gina Taylor <g.taylor@myspace.com>\n```\n```\nFEAT(client): Add possibility to change username\n\nAs requested in #1234 this commit implements the ability to change your\nusername while being connected to a server.\n\nFor that X and Y had to be implemented.\n\nThe change now works by sending a XYZ message to the server with the \"foo\"\nand \"bar\" fields set.\n\nImplements #1234\n```\n```\nFIX(client): Crash when loading settings\n```\n```\nMAINT: Add XY to README\n```\n\n-----\n\nThis guide was inspired by https://github.com/bluejava/git-commit-guide\n\n"

If you have some code that you would like to contribute, please go ahead and create a PR. While doing so,\nplease try to make sure that you follow our [commit guidelines](COMMIT_GUIDELINES.md).\n\nIf you are new to the Mumble project, you may want to check out the general [introduction to the Mumble source code](docs/dev/TheMumbleSourceCode.md).\n\n### Translating\n\nMumble supports various languages. We are always looking for qualified people to contribute translations.\n\nWe are using Weblate as a translation platform. [Register on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/accounts/register/), and join [our translation project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/mumble/).\n\n### Writing plugins\n\nMumble supports general-purpose plugins that can provide functionality that is not implemented in the main Mumble application. You can find more\ninformation on how this works and how these have to be created in the [plugin documentation](docs/dev/plugins/README.md).\n\n## Building\n\nFor information on how to build Mumble, check out [the dedicated documentation](docs/dev/build-instructions/README.md).\n\nMake sure to switch to the appropriate branch in this repository to get the correct build documentation. The current ``master`` branch contains\nthe unstable code for a future release of Mumble. If you want to build an already released stable version of Mumble, e.g. ``1.5.735``, select the\ncorresponding branch, e.g. ``1.5.x``, in the dropdown menu above. Alternatively, use the documentation in the respective release tarball.\n\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nIf you want to report a bug or create a feature request, you can open a new issue (after you have checked that there is none already) on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble/issues/new/choose).\n\n\n## Code Signing\n\nWe graciously acknowledge that this program uses free code signing provided by\n[SignPath.io](https://signpath.io?utm_source=foundation&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=mumble), and a free code signing certificate by the\n[SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org?utm_source=foundation&utm_medium=github&utm_campaign=mumble).\n\n## Windows\n\n### Running Mumble\n\nAfter installation, you should have a new Mumble folder in your\nStart Menu, from which you can start Mumble.\n\n### Running Mumble-Server\n\nDouble-click the icon to start ``mumble-server``. There will be a small icon on your\ntaskbar from which you can view the log.\n\nTo set the superuser password, run ``mumble-server`` with the parameters `-supw <password>`.\n\n\n## MacOS\n\n### Running Mumble\n\nTo install Mumble, drag the application from the downloaded\ndisk image into your `/Applications` folder.\n\n### Running Mumble-Server\n\n``mumble-server`` is distributed separately from the Mumble client on MacOS.\nIt is called Static OS X Server and can be downloaded from the main webpage.\n\nOnce downloaded it can be run in the same way as on any other Unix-like system.\nFor more information please see the \"Running mumble-server\" in the Linux/Unix section below.\n\n\n## Linux/Unix\n\n### Running Mumble\n\nIf you have installed Mumble through your distribution package\nrepository, you should be able to find Mumble in your start menu. No\nadditional steps are necessary.\n\n### Running Mumble-Server\n\n``mumble-server`` should be run from the command line, so start a shell (command prompt)\nand go to wherever you installed Mumble. Run ``mumble-server`` as\n\n```\nmumble-server [-supw <password>] [-ini <inifile>] [-fg] [v]\n\n-supw   Set a new password for the user SuperUser, which is hardcoded to\n        bypass ACLs. Keep this password safe. Until you set a password,\n        the SuperUser is disabled. If you use this option, mumble-server will\n        set the password in the database and then exit.\n\n-ini    Use an inifile other than mumble-server.ini, use this to run several instances\n        of mumble-server from the same directory. Make sure each instance is using\n        a separate database.\n\n-fg     Run in the foreground, logging to standard output.\n\n-v      More verbose logging.\n```\n\n#### Docker image\n\nOur official Docker image along with instructions on how to use it can be found at https://github.com/mumble-voip/mumble-docker\n\n\n### Server configuration\n\nYou can find an up-to-date ``mumble-server`` configuration template in [this repository](auxiliary_files/mumble-server.ini).\nFurther server configuration documentation can be found [on the project website](https://www.mumble.info/documentation/administration/).\n\n### OpenGL Overlay\n\nThe OpenGL overlay works by intercepting the call to switch buffers, and just\nbefore the buffer switch, we draw our nice GUI.\n\nTo load a game with the overlay enabled, start the game like this:\n```bash\nLD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libmumble.so.1.1 gamename\n```\n\nIf you have Mumble installed through the binary packages, this can be done by\nsimply typing:\n```bash\nmumble-overlay gamename\n```\n"
