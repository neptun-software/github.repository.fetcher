More specific guidance is included in the documents linked below.\n\nNote that all community interactions must abide by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## How we work with contributions\n\nFor reporting security issues please see the [Security Policy](docs/SECURITY.md).\n\nContributions from the community in the form of feature requests and bugs are handled according to our [contribution handling](docs/contribution_handling.md) guidelines.\n\n## New contributors\n\nWe mark the most straightforward issues with labels. These issues are the place to start if you are interested in contributing but new to the codebase.\n\n* [good first issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n* [help wanted](https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/labels/help%20wanted)\n\nAnother great way to help is by voting and commenting on feature proposals:\n\n* [feature request](https://github.com/Microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/labels/feature%20request)\n\n## Code contribution guidelines\n\n### Proposing new public APIs or UI\n\nPlease follow the [New Feature or API Process](docs/feature_proposal_process.md) before adding, removing, or changing public APIs or UI.  \nAll new public APIs, new UI, or breaking changes to existing features **must** go through that process before submitting code changes.  \nYou don't need to follow that process for bug fixes or other small changes.\n\n### Contribution bar\n\nThe WinUI team accepts code changes that improve WinUI or fix bugs, as long as they follow the processes outlined below and broadly align with our [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md).\n\nWhile we strive to accept all community contributions that meet the guidelines outlined here, please note that we may not merge changes that have narrowly-defined benefits due to compatibility risks and maintenance costs. We may also revert changes if they are found to be breaking.\n\n### Code contribution process\n\nFor details see:\n\n* [Setup and build environment](docs/developer_guide.md#Prerequisites)\n* [Source code structure](docs/source_code_structure.md)\n* [Contribution workflow](docs/contribution_workflow.md)\n* [Coding style and conventions](docs/code_style_and_conventions.md)\n\n### Contributor License Agreement\n\nMost contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.microsoft.com.\n\nWhen you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.\n\n### Copying files from other projects\n\nThe following rules must be followed for PRs that include files from another project:\n\n* The license of the file is [permissive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence).\n* The license of the file is left intact.\n* The contribution is correctly attributed in the [3rd party notices](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.TXT)\nfile in the repository, as needed.\n\n## Documentation and usage samples\n\nYou can also read and contribute to the WinUI documentation here:  \nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/toolkits/winui\n\nYou can find usage examples of the controls available in WinUI in the Xaml Controls Gallery app:  \n https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/  \n\n which can also be installed from the Windows Store:  \n https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt\n \n ## API spec discussions\n\nBefore new features are added to WinUI, we always perform a thorough API review and spec discussion. This can range from a single new API to an entire new control featuring dozens of new APIs. Joining such a spec discussion is a great opportunity for developers to help ensuring that new WinUI APIs will look and feel natural. In addition, spec discussions are the follow-up to feature proposals and will go into much finer details than the initial proposal. As such, taking part in these discussions gives developers the chance to be involved in the complete development process of new WinUI features - from their initial high-level inception right down to specific implementation/behavior details. These discussions take place in the WInUI repository, i.e. this repository.\n"

          "size": 5.1767578125,
          "content": "# Contributing ideas, feedback, and requests\n\nThe WinUI team greatly values public feedback. We combine this feedback with our own internal strategy goals, weighing it alongside our existing commitments, resources, and private partnerships, to deliver maximum value for you.\n\nThe guide below outlines how you can formulate this feedback for maximum effect and influence on WinUI's direction.\n\n## Phrasing constructively\n\nWhen experiencing a pain-point, it can be natural to focus on the negatives and resolving things from the perspective of the negative. However, telling the team what you'd like to *prevent* is less helpful and actionable than telling the team what you'd like to *achieve*. \n\nYour feedback is most effective when it is a constructive call to action on the team, and is clear and detailed – especially on the \"why\" so that we can make sure whatever it is that we arrive at together appropriately focuses on your goal and your intended outcome from start to finish. \n\n\n**Examples of constructively phrased feedback:**\n\nInstead of:\n\n  - The state of the platform is disappointing. I am not going to consider WinUI until my trust has been earned.\n\nTry this:\n  - Deprecation of past frameworks has left me burned. The following would go a long way in earning my trust because my company is trying to launch an app next year and will need it supported for at least 5 more: \n    - OSS\n    - High-confidence 5-year roadmap\n    - Guaranteed support timeline\n\n    This feedback provides clear actionable items that the WinUI team can take into consideration and address. \n    \n    \n## Sample areas where your feedback can have large impact\n\n- ### Features\n  - It's very helpful to specify the \"why\" behind your request, even if it seems obvious. Comparisons can help, but shouldn't replace explanation. \n  - Ex: \"I need `<`feature`>` so that I can achieve `<`goal`>`. Otherwise, I have to `<`alternative`>`.\"\n\n  There are also usually great opportunities to have feature-related impact in our [spec repo](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml-specs/tree/master). Here, you can give direct feedback and help shape the new features and APIs that we're currently building. \n\n- ### Future/Roadmap\n  - We strive to be transparent about our [product roadmap](https://aka.ms/winui3/feature-roadmap). Great examples of feedback to help us achieve this are:\n    - \"I'd like to know the roadmap through `<`timeframe`>`. Otherwise, I can't do `<`goal`>`. \"\n    - \"The roadmap `<`certain aspect - e.g., changes too much, not detailed enough, etc.`>`prevents me from being able to do `<`goal`>`. If you would instead `<`proposed alternative`>`, that would result in `<`clear benefit`>`.\"\n\n- ### Ecosystem\n  - It's helpful to be complete in explaining what another solution achieves for you and why it is important to you. \n    - Ex:\"I'd like WinUI 3 to work with `<`framework, language, library, technology, etc.`>`. Without this, I can't do `<`goal`>`.\"\n\n- ### Prioritization within WinUI\n  -  There is often trade-off required when adjusting priorities - please be clear in comparing what is more important vs. less important to you, and the reason why. \n      - Ex: \"I think `<`specific area or feature set`>` should be prioritized before `<`other specific area or feature set`>` so that I can achieve `<`goal`>`. Without this, I have to `<`alternative`>`. \"  \n\n- ### Engagement\n  - Engagement includes feedback about learning materials and resources. It is always helpful to know where you prefer to be engaged and how you prefer to learn. \n    - \"I would like to hear more about `<`specific topic`>` in `<`resource`>` so that I can achieve `<`goal`>`.\"\n    - \"`<`Resource`>` could be more inclusive and accessible if you considered `<`alternative`>` because `<`benefit`>`. Have you considered making these changes?\"\n   \n   Many of the resources we provide are also open source themselves! It can sometimes be more effective to leave feedback on the more specific repo. This includes:\n    - [documentation](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-uwp)\n    - [website (`gh-pages` branch of this repo)](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/tree/gh-pages)\n    - [Xaml Controls Gallery (sample app)](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/master)\n  \n\n- ### Team Process\n  - Team process includes feedback about our repo and overall communication. Suggestions for improvement and proposed alternatives are very helpful here. \n    - Ex: \"`<`specific aspect of team process - e.g., response frequency, format`>` of the repo is making it hard for me to achieve `<`goal`>`. Please consider doing `<`alternative`>` instead because that would help `<`action`>`\" \n\n\n## Mutual respect\n\nWe strive to be respectful & empathetic toward each other, and we extend this to our fantastic community as well.\n\nOur conduct guidelines help to ensure that discourse and feedback follows this same pattern of respect & empathy, and they also make it clear that non-constructive or hostile feedback is unacceptable. By following these guidelines, we can all enjoy the mutual respect that each WinUI team member, and each community member, deserve.\n\nRefer to our [conduct guidelines](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for more guidance here. \n"
