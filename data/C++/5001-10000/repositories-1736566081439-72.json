We will continue to fix critical bugs and address security issues.**\n\n## Welcome!\n\nThe C++ REST SDK is a Microsoft project for cloud-based client-server communication in native code using a modern asynchronous C++ API design. This project aims to help C++ developers connect to and interact with services.  \n\n## Getting Started\n\n[![Vcpkg package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/vcpkg/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![Homebrew package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/homebrew/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![Ubuntu 18.04 package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/ubuntu_18_04/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![Fedora Rawhide package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/fedora_rawhide/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![openSUSE Tumbleweed package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/opensuse_tumbleweed/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n[![Debian Testing package](https://repology.org/badge/version-for-repo/debian_testing/cpprestsdk.svg)](https://repology.org/metapackage/cpprestsdk)</br>\n\n[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/vclibs/cpprestsdk/_apis/build/status/Microsoft.cpprestsdk.Ubuntu)](https://dev.azure.com/vclibs/cpprestsdk/_build/latest?definitionId=1)\n\nWith [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg) on Windows\n```\nPS> vcpkg install cpprestsdk cpprestsdk:x64-windows\n```\nWith [apt-get](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/casablanca/2.8.0-2build2) on Debian/Ubuntu\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install libcpprest-dev\n```\nWith [dnf](https://apps.fedoraproject.org/packages/cpprest) on Fedora\n```\n$ sudo dnf install cpprest-devel\n```\nWith [brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/cpprestsdk.rb) on OSX\n```\n$ brew install cpprestsdk\n```\nWith [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/cpprestsdk.android/) on Windows for Android\n```\nPM> Install-Package cpprestsdk.android\n```\nFor other platforms, install options, how to build from source, and more, take a look at our [Documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki).\n\nOnce you have the library, look at our [tutorial](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/Getting-Started-Tutorial) to use the http_client. It walks through how to setup a project to use the C++ Rest SDK and make a basic Http request.\n\nTo use from CMake:\n```cmake\ncmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9)\nproject(main)\n\nfind_package(cpprestsdk REQUIRED)\n\nadd_executable(main main.cpp)\ntarget_link_libraries(main PRIVATE cpprestsdk::cpprest)\n```\n\n## What's in the SDK:\n\n*   Features - HTTP client/server, JSON, URI, asynchronous streams, WebSockets client, oAuth\n*   PPL Tasks - A powerful model for composing asynchronous operations based on C++ 11 features\n*   Platforms - Windows desktop, Windows Store (UWP), Linux, OS X, Unix, iOS, and Android\n*   Support for [Visual Studio 2015 and 2017](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with debugger visualizers\n\n## Contribute Back!\n\nIs there a feature missing that you'd like to see, or found a bug that you have a fix for? Or do you have an idea or just interest in helping out in building the library? Let us know and we'd love to work with you. For a good starting point on where we are headed and feature ideas, take a look at our [requested features and bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/issues).  \n\nBig or small we'd like to take your [contributions](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/Make-a-contribution-and-report-issues) back to help improve the C++ Rest SDK for everyone.\n\n## Having Trouble?\n\nWe'd love to get your review score, whether good or bad, but even more than that, we want to fix your problem. If you submit your issue as a Review, we won't be able to respond to your problem and ask any follow-up questions that may be necessary. The most efficient way to do that is to open an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/issues).  \n\n### Quick Links\n\n*   [FAQ](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki/FAQ)\n*   [Documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/wiki)\n*   [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk/issues)\n\nThis project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/).

It is highly recommended to use vcpkg or CMake instead to build the product library.\r\n* Added UWP versions of the Windows Store samples for VS2017.\r\n* Updated minimum required cmake version to 3.0.\r\n* Added CMake config-file support to installation. This should be consumed by doing:\r\n```cmake\r\nfind_package(cpprestsdk REQUIRED)\r\ntarget_link_libraries(my_executable PRIVATE cpprestsdk::cpprest)\r\n```\r\n* Fixed several race conditions and memory leaks in the ASIO `http_client`.\r\n* Fixed process termination bug around certain exceptional cases in all `http_client`s.\r\n* Improved handling of `/Zcwchar_t-` on MSVC. That doesn't make it a good idea.\r\n* Fixed use-after-free in the Windows Desktop `http_client` exposed by VS2017.\r\n* Totally overhaul the CMake buildsystem for much better support of Windows and more shared code between platforms.\r\n* PR#550 adds all remaining official HTTP status codes to `http::status_codes`.\r\n* PR#563 wraps SSL errors on Windows Desktop in `http_exception`s, with more readable descriptions.\r\n* PR#562 and PR#307 fixes building with LibreSSL.\r\n* PR#551 adds convenience wrappers `json::value::has_T_field(T)` for inspecting object values.\r\n* PR#549 fixes a race condition in the ASIO client during header parsing.\r\n* PR#495 fixes a memory leak during proxy autodetection on Windows Desktop.\r\n* PR#496 and PR#500 expand proxy autodetection to also consider Internet Explorer settings on Windows Desktop.\r\n* PR#498 fixes error when handling responses of type NoContent, NotModified, or from 100 to 199.\r\n* PR#398 enables specifying the User Agent used in OAuth2 requests.\r\n* PR#494 improves the BingRequest sample's handling of proxies.\r\n* PR#516 enables certificate revocation checks on Windows Desktop.\r\n* PR#502 improves compatibility with glibc 2.26.\r\n* PR#507 adds `http_request::get_remote_address()` to expose the client's IP address for `http_listener`.\r\n* PR#521 enables use of empty passwords on Windows in `web::credentials`.\r\n* PR#526 and PR#285 improve compatibility with openssl 1.1.0.\r\n* PR#527 fixes a bug in the ASIO `http_client` where the proxy is passed the same credentials as the target host.\r\n* PR#504 makes `uri_builder::to_string()` and `uri_builder::to_uri()` `const`.\r\n* PR#446 adds handling for the host wildchar `+` to the ASIO `http_listener`.\r\n* PR#465 improves compatibility with clang on Linux.\r\n* PR#454 improves compatibility with icc 17.0.\r\n* PR#487 fixes static library builds of `test_runner` on non-Windows platforms.\r\n* PR#415 handles malformed URL requests to the ASIO `http_listener` instead of crashing.\r\n* PR#393 fixes a race condition in the websocketpp `websocket_client`.\r\n* PR#259 fixes several races in the ASIO `http_listener` which result in memory leaks or use after free of the connection objects.\r\n* PR#376 adds `http_client_config::set_nativesessionhandle_options()` which enables customization of the session handle on Windows Desktop.\r\n* PR#365 updates our convenience OpenSSL build scripts for Android to use openssl 1.0.2k.\r\n* PR#336 makes the ASIO `http_client` more consistent with the Windows clients by not appending the port when it is default. This improves compatibility with AWS S3.\r\n* PR#251 dramatically improves UTF8/16 conversions from 6s per 1MB to 3s per 1GB (2000x improvement).\r\n* PR#246 enables TLS 1.1 and 1.2 on Windows 7 and Windows 8.\r\n* PR#308 enables limited IPv6 support to `http_client` and `http_server`, depending on the underlying platform.\r\n* PR#309 fixes a bug in base64 encoding that previously read beyond the input array, causing segfaults/AVs.\r\n* PR#233 adds compression support (deflate and gzip) for Windows Desktop and ASIO `http_client`s based on Zlib.\r\n* PR#218 fixes a memory leak in the UWP `http_client` when processing headers.\r\n* PR#260 fixes inappropriate handling of certain connections errors in the ASIO `http_listener`.\r\n\r\n-- cpprestsdk team <askcasablanca@microsoft.com>  SAT, 21 Oct 2017 00:52:00 -0800\r\n"
