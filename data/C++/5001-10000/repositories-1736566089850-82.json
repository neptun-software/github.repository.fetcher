Progress against the roadmap is tracked [here](https://github.com/orgs/o3de/projects/56/views/2).\n\n## Download and Install\n\nThis repository uses Git LFS for storing large binary files.  \n\nVerify you have Git LFS installed by running the following command to print the version number.\n```\ngit lfs --version \n```\n\nIf Git LFS is not installed, download and run the installer from: [https://git-lfs.github.com/](https://git-lfs.github.com/).\n\n### Install Git LFS hooks \n```\ngit lfs install\n```\n\n\n### Clone the repository \n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/o3de/o3de.git\n```\n\n## Building the Engine\n\n### Build requirements and redistributables\n\nFor the latest details and system requirements, refer to [System Requirements](https://o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/requirements/) in the documentation.\n\n#### Windows\n\n*   Visual Studio 2019 16.9.2 minimum (All editions supported, including Community): [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)\n    *   Check [System Requirements](https://o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/requirements/) for other supported versions.\n    *   Install the following workloads:\n        *   Game Development with C++\n        *   MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86\n        *   C++ 2019 redistributable update\n*   CMake 3.22.0 minimum: [https://cmake.org/download/#latest](https://cmake.org/download/#latest) (Release Candidate versions are not supported)\n\n#### Optional\n\n*   Wwise audio SDK\n    *   For the latest version requirements and setup instructions, refer to the [Wwise Audio Engine Gem](https://o3de.org/docs/user-guide/gems/reference/audio/wwise/audio-engine-wwise/) reference in the documentation.\n\n### Quick start engine setup\n\nTo set up a project-centric source engine, complete the following steps. For other build options, refer to [Setting up O3DE from GitHub](https://o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/setup/setup-from-github/) in the documentation.\n\n1.  Create a writable folder to cache downloadable third-party packages. You can also use this to store other redistributable SDKs.\n    \n1.  Install the following redistributables:\n    - Visual Studio and VC++ redistributable can be installed to any location.\n    - CMake can be installed to any location, as long as it's available in the system path.\n\n1.  Configure the engine source into a solution using this command line, replacing `<your build path>`, `<your source path>`, and `<3rdParty package path>` with the paths you've created:\n    ```\n    cmake -B <your build path> -S <your source path> -G \"Visual Studio 16\" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=<3rdParty package path>\n    ```\n    \n    Example:\n    ```\n    cmake -B C:\\o3de\\build\\windows -S C:\\o3de -G \"Visual Studio 16\" -DLY_3RDPARTY_PATH=C:\\o3de-packages\n    ```\n    \n    > Note:  Do not use trailing slashes for the <3rdParty package path>.\n\n1.  Alternatively, you can do this through the CMake GUI:\n    \n    1.  Start `cmake-gui.exe`.\n    1.  Select the local path of the repo under \"Where is the source code\".\n    1.  Select a path where to build binaries under \"Where to build the binaries\".\n    1.  Click **Add Entry** and add a cache entry for the <3rdParty package path> folder you created, using the following values:\n        1.  **Name:** LY_3RDPARTY_PATH\n        1.  **Type:** STRING\n        1.  **Value:** `<3rdParty package path>`\n    1.  Click **Configure**.\n    1.  Wait for the key values to populate. Update or add any additional fields that are needed for your project.\n    1.  Click **Generate**.\n    \n1.  Register the engine with this command:\n    ```\n    scripts\\o3de.bat register --this-engine\n    ```\n\n1.  The configuration of the solution is complete. You are now ready to create a project and build the engine.\n\nFor more details on the steps above, refer to [Setting up O3DE from GitHub](https://o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/setup/setup-from-github/) in the documentation.\n\n### Setting up new projects and building the engine\n\n1. From the O3DE repo folder, set up a new project using the `o3de create-project` command.\n    ```\n    scripts\\o3de.bat create-project --project-path <your new project path>\n    ```\n\n1. Configure a solution for your project.\n    ```\n    cmake -B <your project build path> -S <your new project source path> -G \"Visual Studio 16\"\n    ```\n\n    Example:\n    ```\n    cmake -B C:\\my-project\\build\\windows -S C:\\my-project -G \"Visual Studio 16\"\n    ```\n    \n    > Note:  Do not use trailing slashes for the <3rdParty cache path>.\n\n1. Build the project, Asset Processor, and Editor to binaries by running this command inside your project:\n    ```\n    cmake --build <your project build path> --target <New Project Name>.GameLauncher Editor --config profile -- /m\n    ```\n    \n    > Note: Your project name used in the build target is the same as the directory name of your project.\n\nThis will compile after some time and binaries will be available in the project build path you've specified, under `bin/profile`.\n\nFor a complete tutorial on project configuration, see [Creating Projects Using the Command Line Interface](https://o3de.org/docs/welcome-guide/create/creating-projects-using-cli/) in the documentation.\n\n## Code Contributors\n\nThis project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.
