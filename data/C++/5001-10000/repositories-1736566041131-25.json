          "content": "# 9.1.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Allows processing all clipboard changes (#2787, #2746).\n  If clipboard contains secret (for example is copied from a password manager),\n  `onSecretClipboardChanged()` script function is called with data containing\n  `mimeSecret` format set to `1`. Also ensures that callbacks are called\n  consistently for all clipboard changes with properly set formats\n  `mimeClipboardMode`, `mimeOutputTab` and `mimeCurrentTab`.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes editing multiple items (#2810).\n\n- Fixes synchronization plugin causing redundant UI updates and menu\n  misbehavior (#2649).\n\n- Fixes showing sub-menus for custom commands in tray menu (#2730).\n\n- Fixes switching tab if `onItemsLoaded()` is overridden (#2788).\n\n- Fixes theme option `hover_item_css` (#2687).\n\n- Avoids modifying data from display commands and causing redundant UI updates\n  (#2837).\n\n- Avoids sharing execute() state in case it is launched recursively.\n\n# 9.0.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Adds `editItem()` script function for editing any item format (#2672).\n\n- Item color is now shown in tray menu as the default icon (#2700).\n\n## Changed\n\n- Removes large margins in the tab tree.\n\n- Single action \"Toggle Tag …\" replaces the two separate actions \"Tag as …\" and\n  \"Remove tag …\" for each custom tag (this can make the item context menu a lot\n  more compact).\n\n- Selected items can now be accessed even from commands started from outside\n  the app using global commands or from command line.\n\n- The `dialog()` script function can now be used for asking Yes/No questions\n  without providing any fields. In such case, the function will return `true`\n  instead of `undefined` after accepting the dialog. For example:\n\n      const remove = dialog(\n        '.title', 'Remove Items',\n        '.label', 'Do you really want to remove all items?'\n      );\n\n      if (!remove)\n          abort();\n\n      // remove items ...\n\n- The `execute()` script function now throws an exception when command cannot\n  be executed instead of returning `undefine`.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Includes many performance improvements for working with large amount of items.\n\n- Fixes triggering menu items by number (#2569).\n\n- Fixes text color in the internal item editor (#2643).\n\n- Fixes showing global shortcuts in tray menu (#2382).\n\n- Fixes passing captured texts to automated commands (#2707).\n\n- Fixes duplicate synchronized items after tagging or modifying data.\n\n- Fixes situation when display commands stop updating items.\n\n- The pre-defined \"Move to tab\" action will be shown only if the current tab is\n  not the same as target tab (#2669). Previously, in such case the item was\n  removed unexpectedly.\n\n- Windows: Detect and ignore secrets from more apps (#2679).\n\n- Linux: Fixes storing previously synchronized clipboard (#2630).\n\n- Linux: Fixes storing selection when \"Store text selected using mouse\" option\n  is enabled but \"Run automatic commands on selection\" is disabled (#2651).\n\n- Linux: Fixes clipboard synchronization with Qt 6 GUI framework.\n\n- Linux: Fixes showing tab tree labels with Qt 6 GUI framework.\n\n# 8.0.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Tab item limit has been increased to 100,000 (#1144).\n\n- New macOS builds for M1/arm64 architectures are available (#1884).\n\n- New Debian/Raspbian builds for arm/arm64 architectures are available.\n\n- Allows overriding item activation using `paste()`.\n\n- Allows overriding script functions to handle some events: items\n  added/removed/changed (`onItemsAdded()`, `onItemsRemoved()`,\n  `onItemsChanged()`), tab items loaded (`onItemsLoaded()`), tab selected\n  (`onTabSelected()`) (#59).\n\n- Allows to cancel removing items by overriding `onItemsRemoved()` script\n  function. If the exit code is non-zero (for example `fail()` is called),\n  items will not be removed. But this can also cause a new items not to be\n  added if the tab is full.\n\n- Allows overriding current clipboard owner (`currentClipboardOwner()`) used by\n  the clipboard monitor process. By default it uses `currentWindowTitle()`.\n\n- Allows using Ctrl+C to copy items even if search entry box is focused unless\n  it has a selection (#2440).\n\n- Linux: Adds build option to disable X11 support (`cmake -DWITH_X11=OFF ...`)\n  (#2532).\n\n- Linux: Adds build option to disable autostart which is useful mainly for\n  Flatpak builds (#2517, #2518).\n\n## Changed\n\n- Windows binaries (which are 64 bit) are now by default installed to \"Program\n  Files\" instead of incorrect \"Program Files (X86)\". After installing the new\n  version, the **old path must be manually removed**.\n\n- Windows and macOS builds are now based on newer Qt 6.\n\n- Avoids accessing clipboard from password managers (#2282, #2495, #2500). This\n  disallows storing and processing such data. Specifically, the clipboard is\n  ignored if it contains following data: `Clipboard Viewer Ignore` on Windows,\n  `application/x-nspasteboard-concealed-type` on macOS,\n  `x-kde-passwordManagerHint` with `secret` value on Linux.\n\n- Large data items in tabs are now stored in separate location unless\n  Synchronize or Encryption plugins are active for the tab. This allows storing\n  more items in tabs while using less memory. The data path can be printed via\n  `copyq info data` command and overridden using `COPYQ_ITEM_DATA_PATH`\n  environment variable. To disable this functionality use `copyq config\n  item_data_threshold -1` - the default value is 1024 and items larger than\n  this amount of bytes are stored in the separate location.\n\n- Command dialog now shows advanced properties for built-in commands allowing\n  to copy the command line to set global shortcut in system.\n\n- Global shortcuts are now also visible in menus (#2382).\n\n- Avoids pasting all image formats as new item.\n\n- Display commands are now applied to tray menu items too.\n\n- Linux: Last stored text item is updated from any new mouse selection only if\n  the item content matches the start or the end of the selection (but not the\n  middle like previously). This may avoid some unexpected item updates.\n\n- Updates icon font from Font-Awesome 6.5.1.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes drag'n'drop ordering for plugins and commands. This could have caused a\n  missing icon, app crash or various inconsistencies.\n\n- Fixes managing keys with gpg 2.1 and above (#2463, #1208).\n\n- Fixes creating duplicate item with Synchronize plugin when adding a tag for\n  example (#2355).\n\n- Fixes conflicting notes and text with Synchronize plugin (#2355)\n\n- Fixes deleted global object after running scripts (#2542).\n\n- Wayland: Fixes copying images to another app instance.\n\n# 7.1.0\n\n## Changed\n\n- Image editor (if set) will now open instead of built-in text editor when\n  selecting Edit action on image items containing no text.\n\n- Encryption now uses larger/safer keys (#2385).\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes saving and opening empty encrypted tabs.\n\n- Fixes minimal size of dialogs (#2299).\n\n- Fixes importing commands with regular expressions containing slash characters\n  in scripts.\n\n- Fixes font weight with Qt 6.\n\n- Fixes closing the app with Qt 6.\n\n- Fixes the build and calling some script functions with Qt 6.5.\n\n- X11: Fixes crash when entering search with some keyboard layouts (#2171).\n\n# 7.0.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Windows installer has an option to install for current user or all users\n  (#1912).\n\n## Changed\n\n- The preferred format to edit is now \"text/plain;charset=utf-8\" with\n  \"text/plain\" as fallback. Additionally, if no such format is available,\n  \"text/uri-list\" is used.\n\n- Toggle Clipboard Storing menu item uses static text and icon instead of\n  changing these dynamically after each use (#2255).\n\n- Settings integrity is now handled solely by Qt. Previously, additional\n  `*.bak` files where created for configuration files.\n\n- Commands are no longer migrated to the new format on start. The old command\n  configuration file has been last used in version 3.9.0 (released on\n  2019-06-27).\n\n- Native notification text length is limited now to avoid slow downs when\n  showing notifications in some desktop environments. The limit is about\n  100,000 characters and 100 lines.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes Sort/Reverse Selected Items menu actions (#2267).\n\n- Fixes moving items to a tab in tab bar using drag'n'drop (#1246).\n\n- Fixes possibly buggy window manager frame geometry (#2247).\n\n# 6.4.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Items in menu can be additionally filtered using the item notes (#2170).\n\n- Items can be sorted with a custom order via scripting. For example:\n\n      var sel = ItemSelection().selectAll();\n      const texts = sel.itemsFormat(mimeText);\n      sel.sort(function(i,j){\n          return texts[i] < texts[j];\n      });\n\n## Changed\n\n- More shortcuts and even sequences of shortcuts can be now captured and\n  assigned. This uses new QKeySequenceEdit UI widget from Qt framework.\n\n- UI uses the preferred sans-serif system font in the dark theme.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes copying items in order they were selected (#2124).\n\n- Fixes re-selecting the edited item after external editor closes.\n\n- Fixes menu theme (#2139).\n\n- Avoids duplicating items from clipboard in synchronized tabs (#2236).\n\n- macOS: Fixes compatibility with macOS 10.15 (#2103).\n\n- Linux: Fixes synchronizing UTF-encoded text to/from primary selection (#2195)\n\n- Wayland: Avoids showing window after a screen is turned on.\n\n- Wayland: Avoids a rare crash while accessing clipboard data.\n\n- Wayland: Fixes pasting to some XWayland apps (#2234)\n\n- X11: Avoids app freeze when entering search mode (#2171).\n\n- X11: Fixes capturing quickly changing clipboard text (ignores unchanged\n  TIMESTAMP).\n\n# 6.3.2\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes potential crash when rendering an empty item list.\n\n# 6.3.1\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes rendering issues (#1728, #2093).\n\n- Fixes the space between row number and the item content. This is customizable\n  with `num_margin` theme option.\n\n- Fixes Qt 6 build.\n\n- Wayland: Fixes synchronizing selection with clipboard with UTF-8 text.\n\n- X11: Fixes tray window popup position on multi-monitor (#2038).\n\n# 6.3.0\n\n## Changed\n\n- UI margins are decreased leaving more space space for item content.\n\n- Script function `config()` now lists current values for each option (#412).\n  Example of new `copyq config` output:\n\n      ...\n      clipboard_notification_lines=3\n        Number of lines to show for new clipboard content.\n\n        Set to 0 to disable.\n      clipboard_tab=&clipboard\n        Name of tab that will automatically store new clipboard content.\n\n        Leave empty to disable automatic storing.\n      close_on_unfocus=false\n        Close main window when other application has focus\n      ...\n\n- FakeVim plugin improvements from upstream:\n\n    * Ignores only full-line comments in configuration file\n    * Support backslashes in substitute command patterns\n    * Partial support for multi-repeat command (:g, :v)\n\n- Improves rendering item list speed.\n\n- Updates icon font from Font-Awesome 6.2.0\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes showing window under mouse cursor (#2088).\n\n- In single-click-activate mode, multiple items can be selected while holding\n  Shift or Ctrl (#2056).\n\n- The pre-defined command \"Ignore items with no or single character\" now also\n  avoids synchronizing selection and showing popup if less than two characters\n  where copied.\n\n- Wayland: Fixes synchronizing selection with clipboard in various cases.\n\n- Wayland: Fixes possible crash when managed clipboard data changes while it is\n  accessed.\n\n# 6.2.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Tabs can now load at least some items from a partially corrupted data file\n  dropping the rest of the items.\n\n- Simpler and safer data saving uses Qt framework (`QSaveFile`).\n\n- New `Settings` class in scripts can be used to manage INI configuration\n  files (#1964).\n\n## Changed\n\n- Obscure untested Save button has been removed from Action dialog.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes restoring window geometry in a loop (#1946).\n\n- Fixes converting internal byte array representation in scripts in some rare\n  cases.\n\n- Fixes tray menu appearance to follow the configuration (#1896).\n\n- The search history popup menu for will be closed if mouse wheel scrolls and\n  mouse pointer is outside the menu (#1980).\n\n- macOS: Fixes pasting (#2012).\n\n- Windows: Fixes exiting the app on logout (#1249).\n\n- Windows: Workaround to treat native path separators properly and not as\n  special escape characters.\n\n# 6.1.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Users can now customize shortcuts for the built-in editor (#708).\n\n- Users can now set default style sheet for HTML items to override for example\n  color for hyperlinks with `a { color: lightblue }` (#1859). The new settings\n  can be found under Item configuration tab under Text sub-tab.\n\n## Changed\n\n- Window geometry (size and position) restoring is now simpler: The app sets\n  geometry only initially and when the current screen/monitor changes.\n\n  The mouse cursor position indicates the current screen. In case the app\n  cannot inspect the mouse pointer position (for example on some Wayland\n  compositors), it is left up to the window manager to decide to move the\n  window to another screen.\n\n  Users can still disable the automatic geometry by running the following\n  command (in Action dialog or terminal) and restarting the app:\n\n      copyq config restore_geometry false\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Fixes moving items in synchronized tabs after activating them from the\n  context menu (#1897).\n\n- Windows: Fixes tray icon tooltip (#1864).\n\n- Windows: External editor command now treats native path separators properly\n  (#1894, #1868).\n\n- macOS: Fixes crash when pasting from the main window or menu (#1847).\n\n- macOS: Older versions of macOS (down to 10.15) are now supported again\n  (#1866).\n\n- Wayland: Fixes using correct window title icon (#1910).\n\n- Wayland: Fixes retrieving UTF-8 encoded text from selection in environments\n  which supports it.\n\n- Wayland: Fixes restoring window size without breaking window position (window\n  position cannot be set in most or all Wayland compositors).\n\n# 6.0.1\n\n## Fixed\n\n- X11: Fixes global/system-wide shortcuts (#1860).\n\n# 6.0.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Native notifications now have lower urgency if the display interval is less\n  than 10 seconds. This makes clipboard change notification less intrusive.\n\n- Preview dock can be focused with Tab key (#1826). Escape, Tab or Shift+Tab\n  returns focus back to the item list.\n\n- All options are now documented/described when using command `copyq config`.\n\n- Command editor now supports highlighting multi-line strings enclosed by\n  backticks (#1845).\n\n- New option to disable restoring window/dialog geometry (app needs to be\n  restarted after changing the option):\n\n      copyq config restore_geometry false\n\n- macOS: New option to enable native tray menu (#1652):\n\n      copyq config native_tray_menu true\n\n- Support for building the source code with Qt 6 framework.\n\n## Changed\n\n- While search bar is focused, pressing Down or PageDown key now selects next\n  item without focusing the item list (#1834).\n\n- Internal commands (like \"\"Show/hide main window\", Pin/Unpin, Encrypt/Decrypt)\n  will now be automatically updated in following application releases or\n  whenever the language changes. The side-effect is that only icon, shortcuts,\n  enabled state and list order can be changed for these commands. Old internal\n  commands added in previous versions (5.0.0 and lower) of the app need to be\n  removed manually.\n\n- Increases the default delay for storing changed clipboard owner. This can\n  help save correct window title for new clipboard content when the window is\n  closed right after the copy operation. The delay can be changed using:\n\n      copyq config change_clipboard_owner_delay_ms 500\n\n- The application version now excludes the \"v\" prefix in UI and CLI.\n\n- Log Qt warnings by default (at Warning log level messages).\n\n- Linux: Other data formats are now stored for primary selection so as to\n  support some automatic commands properly (for example, ignore selection when\n  it contains a special format). Images and non-plain text formats are still\n  ignored for performance reasons.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Drag'n'drop operations are now properly ended (#1809).\n\n- Main window will now open only inside the visible screen area (#1768).\n\n- \"Clear Current Tab\" command will no longer show a message dialog if there are\n  pinned items (#1823).\n\n- Improves initial size for native tray menu.\n\n- Fixes removing backup file for old commands configuration.\n\n- Fixes broken item selection state (#1828).\n\n- Fixes hiding main window immediately when shown. This can be caused by long\n  animations in window manager.\n\n- Further performance improvements for logging, application startup and file\n  synchronization.\n\n- Linux: Native status icon (using D-Bus) is used by default instead of the\n  legacy tray icon. Application start delay/sleep hacks should no longer be\n  needed (#1526).\n\n- Wayland: Improved clipboard access.\n\n- Wayland: Fixes selection/clipboard synchronization.\n\n- Windows: Any application instance is now closed automatically before\n  installation.\n\n# v5.0.0\n\n## Added\n\n- Search matches similar accented characters (#1318). For example, searching\n  for \"vacsina\" would also show items containing \"väčšina\".\n\n- If the clipboard tab is renamed, clipboard will be still stored in the\n  renamed tab. Similarly if a specific tab is set for tray menu. This basically\n  modifies `clipboard_tab`, `tray_tab` options when renaming tabs.\n\n- New predefined command to clear the current tab.\n\n- Tabs can be reordered in Preferences (in addition to tab bar/tree).\n\n- Tabs can be reordered from command line or a script. For example:\n\n      copyq 'config(\"tabs\", [\"&clipboard\", \"work\", \"study\"])'\n\n- New buttons can move commands, tabs and plugins in configuration to top and\n  bottom with a single click. This previously required dragging item to the\n  top/bottom or multiple clicks on the move up/down buttons.\n\n- Script function `dialog()` supports non-editable combo box. For example:\n\n      var choice = dialog('.combo:Select', ['a', 'b', 'c'])\n\n- Script function `dialog()` restores last position and size of dialog\n  windows with matching title (set with `.title`).\n\n- Syntax highlighting for more script keywords.\n\n- New script class `ItemSelection` allows more powerful, consistent, safe and\n  fast handling of multiple items. Examples:\n\n      // move matching items to the top of the tab\n      ItemSelection().select(/^prefix/).move(0)\n\n      // remove all items from given tab but keep pinned items\n      ItemSelection(tabName).selectRemovable().removeAll();\n\n## Changed\n\n- Simpler lock file mechanism is used instead of a system semaphore and shared\n  memory lock (#1737). This allows to support more platforms.\n\n- Editor font from Appearance settings is used for the edit widget in Command\n  and Action dialogs (#1757).\n\n- Theme does not modify the scrollbar in item list by default (#1751).\n\n## Removed\n\n- Windows: Migrating old configuration from registry to file format is no\n  longer supported.\n\n## Fixed\n\n- Icons are rendered properly in About dialog. This uses correct icon font\n  from the app instead the one installed on the system.\n\n- Correct UI layout direction is used depending on the selected language\n  (#1696).\n\n- Automatic commands that use regular expressions for matching\n  window title or clipboard content are imported properly\n  (hluk/copyq-commands#45).\n\n- Native notifications are updated correctly when using existing notification\n  ID.\n\n- Bash completion script is installed to a correct path.\n\n- macOS: Fixes pasting/copying when using different keyboard layouts (#1733).\n\n- macOS: Avoids focusing own window before paste operation (#1601).\n\n- macOS: Tries to paste directly to the process ID if the window ID is not\n  available (#1395) (#1686).\n\n# v4.1.0\n\n- Old notification system can now be used instead of native/system\n  notifications (#1620). This can be disabled in Notifications tab in\n  Preferences.\n\n- Additional configuration file for notifications will not be created\n  automatically (#1638).\n\n- In scripting, `console` object can be used for logging, measuring elapsed\n  time and asserting conditions.\n\n- `plugins.itempinned.mimePinned` contains item data format for pinned items\n  (item is pinned if it contains the format).\n\n- Command completion menu contains more complete list of script\n  objects/function and better description.\n\n- Action dialog command, `action()` and commands (if \"Content\"/filter regular\n  expression is unset) now do not replace `%2` through `%9`. This allows\n  passing URLs without requiring to escape encoded characters like `%20` or\n  `%3A`.\n\n- Syntax highlighting for hexadecimal and boolean values in the command editor.\n\n- Fix moving the main window to different display/screen (#1624).\n\n- Windows: Native notifications are disabled on Windows 7 (#1623). This fixes\n  crash because of unsupported features.\n\n- Windows: Fixed crash when loading some themes (#1621).\n\n- Wayland: Restores last stored geometry for a window (since getting current\n  screen does not work).\n\n- MinGW Windows builds are available again (without native notification\n  support).\n\n# v4.0.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Synchronization plugin newly keeps order of new items consistent between\n  multiple application instances (#1558). Newly added items in one instance\n  will appear at the top of other instances.\n\n- Search now finds separate words if regular expressions are disabled (#1569).\n  Searching for \"foo bar\" will find items containing both \"foo\" and \"bar\" and\n  the relative position of words no longer matter.\n\n- System notification popups are now used instead of own implementation.\n\n- Item rows in main window and tray menu are now indexed from one instead of\n  zero by default (#1085). This can be reverted to the old behavior using\n  command `copyq config row_index_from_one false`.\n\n- A tag can be marked as \"locked\" in configuration. Items with such tags cannot\n  be removed until the tag is removed or \"unlocked\".\n\n- Command line completion for bash (#1460). Thanks, Jordan!\n\n- History combo box is focused when Action dialog opens to easily recall recent\n  commands. Note: Focusing combo boxes is not supported on macOS.\n\n- Web plugin has been completely dropped (unmaintained with performance and\n  possible security problems). Simple HTTP rendering is still supported by Text\n  plugin.\n\n- Advanced option `window_paste_with_ctrl_v_regex` to change default paste\n  shortcut Shift+Insert to Ctrl+V for specific windows (only on Windows and\n  Linux/X11). This is regular expression matching window titles.\n\n- New advanced options allow to set intervals and wait times for copying,\n  pasting and window focus:\n\n  * `script_paste_delay_ms` - delay after `paste()`, default is 250ms (#1577)\n  * `window_wait_before_raise_ms`\n  * `window_wait_raised_ms`\n  * `window_wait_after_raised_ms`\n  * `window_key_press_time_ms`\n  * `window_wait_for_modifiers_released_ms`\n\n- Format \"text/plain;charset=utf-8\" is now preferred to \"text/plain\".\n\n- FakeVim: Auto-indents when adding new lines.\n\n## Scripting\n\n- New scripting engine. This adds some new functionality, better ECMAScript\n  support, improved performance and would allow Qt 6 support in the future.\n\n- Argument `--start-server` to both starts the app if not yet running and runs\n  a command (#1590). For example, `copyq --start-server show` would show main\n  window even if the app was not started yet.\n\n- Accessing a missing plugin from script throws an human-readable error and\n  show an popup if uncaught (for example, \"plugins.itemtags\" could throw\n  \"Plugin itemtags is not installed\").\n\n- Script function `setPointerPosition()` throws an error if it fails to set the\n  mouse pointer position.\n\n- Fixes for `NetworkReply` objects to properly fetch data when needed (#1603).\n  Script functions `networkGet()` and `networkPost()` now wait for data to be\n  fetched. New script functions `networkGetAsync()` and `networkPostAsync()`\n  can be used to make asynchronous network request. Property\n  `NetworkReply.finished` can be used to retrieved completion status of a\n  request.\n\n- New script function `styles()` to list possible application styles and option\n  `style` to override the default or current style.\n\n## Platforms\n\n- Wayland support, notably clipboard access and window size restoring.\n\n- Windows: Builds are now 64bit (built by Visual Studio tools).\n\n- Linux: Selecting the app icon in the desktop environment using the installed\n  entry in the application menu or launcher, shows main window immediately.\n  Previously, the app started silently in tray or minimized state.\n\n- Linux/X11: Fixes copying from VirtualBox (#1565).\n\n- macOS: Fix version information (#1552).\n\n## User Interface\n\n- The default theme is kept consistent with system theme (#1613). This also\n  allows to use new special placeholders like `default_bg` and `default_text`\n  in custom style sheet files.\n\n- Command dialog always shows the command type at top.\n\n- Updated icons (Font Awesome 5.15.3).\n\n- FakeVim: Command line not supports better text interaction (select, copy,\n  cut, paste).\n\n## Fixes\n\n- Fix crashed with some custom system themes (#1521).\n\n- Fix importing old saved tabs/configuration (#1501).\n\n- Fix trailing spaces in copied commands.\n\n- Fix filtering shortcuts in preferences.\n\n- Fixes for window geometry restoring.\n\n- Tray menu items are updated only just before the menu is shown.\n\n- Avoid storing \"text/richtext\" by default since displaying of this format is\n  not supported.\n\n- Better performance when updating synchronized items.\n\n- Various appearance and theme fixes (#1559).\n\n## Various\n\n- Code base now follows C++17 standard.\n\n- GitHub Actions now continuously build and test for Linux and macOS, and\n  provide development builds for macOS.\n\n# v3.13.0\n\n- Newly, if a global shortcut is triggered when the main window is active, the\n  command will be executed with item selection and item data available (#1435).\n\n- New `focusPrevious()` script function to activate window that was focused\n  before the main window.\n\n- Export now write data to a temporary file before saving.\n\n- Display command are now also applied on item preview (e.g. to enable syntax\n  highlighting in the preview).\n\n- New command line option \"tray_menu_open_on_left_click\" to check default mouse\n  button behavior for tray icon (`copyq config tray_menu_open_on_left_click\n  true`).\n\n- New command line option \"activate_item_with_single_click\" to activate items\n  with single click (`copyq config activate_item_with_single_click true`).\n\n- New command line options \"filter_regular_expression\" and\n  \"filter_case_insensitive\" to change the item search behavior.\n\n- New command line option \"native_menu_bar\" to disable native/global menu bar\n  (`copyq config native_menu_bar false`).\n\n- Updated icons (Font Awesome 5.15.1)\n\n- Improved performance of loading the icon font.\n\n- Fix crash when exporting large amount of data (#1462).\n\n- Fix entering vi search mode (#1458).\n\n- Fix size of scrollable text area in item preview (#1472).\n\n- OSX: Broken native/global menu bar was replaced by default with application\n  menu bar (#1444). This can be changed with `copyq config native_menu_bar true`.\n\n- OSX: Mouse click on tray icon is now handled similarly to other platforms.\n  This can be changed with `copyq config tray_menu_open_on_left_click true`.\n\n# v3.12.0\n\n- Unsaved data are now saved whenever application is unfocused, otherwise\n  immediately after an item is edited and saved or after ~5 minute intervals if\n  items change. These intervals can be configured - use `copyq config` to list\n  options with `save_delay_` prefix. For example, disable storing after an item\n  is added (only when app is unfocused, exits or tab is unloaded):\n\n      copyq config save_delay_ms_on_item_added -1\n\n- Filter field in commands can now modify menu items. This is done by setting\n  properties to \"menuItem\" object. Example:\n\n      copyq:\n      menuItem['checkable'] = true\n      if (plugins.itempinned.isPinned.apply(this, selectedItems())) {\n          menuItem['checked'] = true\n          menuItem['text'] = 'Unpin'\n          menuItem['color'] = '#f00'\n          menuItem['tag'] = 'X'\n      } else {\n          menuItem['checked'] = false\n          menuItem['text'] = 'Pin'\n          menuItem['icon'] = ''\n      }\n\n- Application icon will no longer automatically change when there is an ongoing\n  operation (i.e. the icon snip animation). This caused performance issues in\n  some environments and it was not tested automatically so it often broke. When\n  clipboard storing is disabled the icon only changes opacity slightly.\n\n- New `preview()` script function shows/hides item preview.\n\n- Avoid terminating application on SIGHUP (#1383)\n\n- Use brighter bar for pinned items with a dark theme (#1398)\n\n- Improved notification text line wrapping (#1409)\n\n- Improved layout when showing many shortcut buttons (#1425)\n\n- Fix indentation when importing commands with CRLF (#1426)\n\n- Fix using the configured notification font (#1393)\n\n- Fix initial item size (avoid scroll bars)\n\n- Fix decrypting item with note\n\n- Fix hiding windows after changing \"Always on Top\" option\n\n- Fix tool bar flickering when browsing items\n\n- Fix crash when destroying main window\n\n- Fix rare crash when menu items change\n\n- FakeVim: Improved completion menu control with Vim emulation\n\n- FakeVim: Always start in normal mode\n\n- FakeVim: Fix searching backwards\n\n- Windows: Paste operation is now postponed until user releases shortcut\n  (#1412). This works better than releasing the shortcut keys automatically and\n  is consistent with behavior on Linux.\n\n- Windows: Fix SSL/TLS errors; `networkGet()` should now work with `https`\n  protocol\n\n- Windows: Fix native GUI style (#1427)\n\n# v3.11.1\n\n- Fix scrolling in selected text items (#1371)\n\n- Fix using application icon font instead of a system-installed on (#1369)\n\n- X11: Fix checking correct text before selection synchronization\n\n# v3.11.0\n\n- Tab character size can now be set (number of spaces) and maps more accurately\n  to space character width (#1341). The default value is 8 spaces which is\n  smaller than before. This can be changed on command line:\n\n      copyq config text_tab_width 4\n\n- New `move()` script function moves selected items within tab.\n\n- New `menuItems()` script function creates custom menus.\n\n- CSS stylesheet files to fully customize appearance\n\n- Allow keyboard navigation in item preview dock\n\n- \"Show Preview\" is now available in File menu instead of Item menu\n\n- Shortcuts Ctrl+P and Ctrl+N selects previous/next action in Action dialog.\n\n- New synchronized item/files are now added to item list ordered alphabetically\n  by filename which is faster and more consistent on multiple platforms than\n  ordering by modification-time (#833).\n\n- Improved performance when synchronizing items/files\n\n- Non-owned synchronized files at the end of item list are now dropped (but not\n  deleted) if the list is full.\n\n- Updated icons (Font Awesome 5.13.0)\n\n- Simpler item scrollbar style\n\n- Omit showing new notification under mouse pointer (#1310)\n\n- Duplicate \"CopyQ Error\" notification are not shown\n\n- Bind x to Delete in Vi style navigation mode\n\n- Left/Right arrow keys now work in FakeVim editor mode by default\n\n- FakeVim editor mode now supports cutting text to given register\n\n- If FakeVim editor mode is active in a dialog, Esc key allows to close the\n\n- Consistent window and dialog titles in application (\" - CopyQ\" suffix)\n  dialog.\n\n- Fix opening tray menu with empty search\n\n- Fix search in main window and tray with different keyboard layouts (#1316)\n\n- Fix restoring search when closing internal editor\n\n- Fix crash when synchronizing pinned items/files (#1311)\n\n- Fix pasting synchronized file instead of its content (#1309)\n\n- Fix enabling menu items with filters in commands (#1284)\n\n- Fix commands for removing tags from items (#1332)\n\n- Fix copying from item preview dock (#1326)\n\n- Fix position of main window on current screen (#1216)\n\n- Fix copying \"text/plain;charset=utf-8\" format as a text (#1324)\n\n- Fix preview search highlight in Appearance configuration (#1354)\n\n- Fix hover/mouse-over style for items (#1347)\n\n- Fix wrapping long notification text\n\n- Fix jitter when scrolling in item list\n\n- Fix item width\n\n- X11: Fix re-getting clipboard content after aborted (#1356)\n\n- Windows: Use builds with Qt 5.13\n\n# v3.10.0\n\n- Use environment variable `COPYQ_DEFAULT_ICON=1` to show the original\n  application icon instead of the one from current icon theme.\n\n- Avoid updating menu too unnecessarily\n\n- Drop using deprecated Qt API and require at least Qt 5.5 (meaning Ubuntu\n  14.04 and Debian 8 are no longer supported)\n\n- Use non-native color and font dialogs which fixes showing these in Gnome/Gtk\n\n- Fix GUI with fractional scaling\n\n- Fix updating tray menu (remove empty sections)\n\n- Fix editing synchronized file content instead of its path\n\n- OSX: Omit preventing system from entering the sleep mode\n\n- X11: Improve clipboard/selection synchronization\n\n- X11: Avoid reading clipboard in parallel in the monitor process\n\n# v3.9.3\n\n- New `loadTheme()` script function loads theme from INI file.\n\n- Currently selected item stays on top on PageUp/Down (less jittery list view\n  scrolling)\n\n- Performance improvements: Updates GUI only when necessary; dedicated\n  processes to run menu filters and display commands; reloads configuration\n  once when setting multiple options with `config()`\n\n- Skips using a command from a disabled plugin\n\n- Logs information on slow menu filters and display commands\n\n- Fix hiding item preview when disabled (caused an empty window to be shown)\n  and when no items are selected\n\n- Fix taking screenshots on multiple monitors\n\n- Fix duplicate show/hide tray menu items\n\n- Fix moving synchronized items to top when activated\n\n- Fix calling `onExit()` second time when on shutdown\n\n- Fix removing empty actions from history in Action dialog\n\n- Fix updating version from Git when rebuilding\n\n- OSX: Fix refocusing correct main window widget\n\n- Windows: Use Qt 5.12.5 builds (MinGW 7.3.0 32-bit, msvc2017 64-bit)\n\n# v3.9.2\n\n- Fix unnecessary tab reloading after expired.\n\n- Fix repeated menu updates.\n\n- Fix loading tabs with an empty item\n\n- Fix initializing expire timeout (it was always 0 or 1 minute)\n\n# v3.9.1\n\n- Commands are moved to a separate configuration file \"copyq-commands.ini\".\n\n- Horizontal tabs in the configuration dialog were replaced with a list of\n  sections so it's possible to view all of the sections even in a smaller\n  window.\n\n- New option `hide_main_window_in_task_bar` to hide window in task bar can be\n  set using `copyq config hide_main_window_in_task_bar true`.\n\n- New `logs()` script function prints application logs.\n\n- New `clipboardFormatsToSave()` script function allows to override clipboard\n  formats to save.\n\n- Some hidden options can be modified using `config()` script function.\n\n- Font sizes in items and editor are limited to prevent application freeze.\n\n- Application icons are cached so as to avoid creating icons for the snip\n  animation again.\n\n- Fix restoring tabs with some non-ASCII characters\n\n- Fix opening window on different screen with different DPI\n\n- Fix 100% CPU utilization on wide screens (5120x1440)\n\n- Fix icon size and GUI margins in Tabs configuration tab\n\n- X11: Fix stuck clipboard access\n\n- X11: Faster selection synchronization\n\n- OSX: Prevent showing font download dialog\n\n- OSX: Fix clipboard owner window title\n\n# v3.9.0\n\n- Large images in clipboard are no longer automatically converted to other\n  formats - it caused slowdowns and was mostly unnecessary since some usable\n  image format was provided.\n\n- The server/GUI process now provides the clipboard and no other process is\n  started (i.e. \"copyq provideClipboard\"). The other process helped to unblock\n  GUI in rare cases when an application requested large amount of clipboard\n  data, but it could cause some slowdowns to start the process.\n\n- Closing external editor focuses the edited item again (if the editor was open\n  from main window).\n\n- Only Global Shortcut commands are shown in tray menu.\n\n- Separate Global and Application shortcuts into tabs in configuration dialog.\n\n- New per-tab configuration allows disabling storing items on disk and limiting\n  number of items.\n\n- New script function unload() and forceUnload() allow unloading tabs from main\n  memory.\n\n- Tabs synchronized with a directory on disk are updated only when needed. An\n  update happens regularly when synced tab has focus or item data and are too\n  old. Update interval is 10s and can be changed by setting env variable\n  COPYQ_SYNC_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS (in ms).\n\n- X11: New option allows to disable running automatic commands on X11 selection\n  change.\n\n- Fix rare crash on exit.\n\n- Fix value returned by filter() after it's hidden\n\n- Fix memory leak (tool bar and menu items were not properly cleaned up)\n\n- Fix crash when opening content dialog with many formats\n\n- OSX: Fix pixelated UI rendering on retina displays.\n\n- Windows: Fix blocking Ctrl, Shift and other modifier keys after invoking\n  paste action. The downside is that it's no longer possible to invoke command\n  assigned to a global shortcut repeatedly without releasing these keys.\n\n- X11: Fix high CPU usage when mouse selection cannot be accessed.\n\n- X11: Fix assigning global shortcuts with keypad keys\n\n# v3.8.0\n\n- Custom settings from scripts (using settings() function) are now saved in\n  \"copyq-scripts.ini\" file in configuration directory. Existing configuration\n  needs to be moved manually from \"[script]\" section in the main configuration\n  file (\"copyq info config\" command prints the path) to \"[General]\" section to\n  the new file (in the same directory).\n\n- Correct clipboard owner (window title) is now used when the window is hidden\n  after copy operation (e.g. password manager copies password and hides its\n  window immediately).\n\n- New script functions onStart and onExit allow to defined commands run when\n  the application starts and exits.\n\n- New script functions pointerPosition and setPointerPosition to get/set mouse\n  cursor position on screen.\n\n- New script callback onClipboardUnchanged called when clipboard changes but\n  monitored content remains the same.\n\n- Block default shortcut overridden by a command while its filter command needs\n  to run.\n\n- Item selection is not cleared when main window hides in response to\n  activating an item or automatically when unfocused.\n\n- Clipboard dialog opens much faster and retrieves clipboard data only when\n  needed.\n\n- Clipboard dialog contains special clipboard formats and the whole list is\n  sorted - plain text first, HTML, other text, application, application\n  specific (`application/x-`), special (uppercase).\n\n- Detect encoding for other text formats.\n\n- Method text for ByteArray returns correctly formatted text from unicode\n  encoded data (e.g. UTF-8).\n\n- Show pin and tag menu items even if shortcut is not assigned (can be disabled\n  completely in Command dialog).\n\n- Hide encrypt/decrypt commands when keys for Encrypt plugin don't exist.\n\n- Command list is focused when Command dialog opens; the less important \"Find\"\n  field is smaller and moved below the list.\n\n- Process manager is completely redone and the dialog is no longer created at\n  application start (faster application start, smaller memory footprint).\n\n- Process manager has filter field for searching for commands.\n\n- Process manager has new column showing error message.\n\n- Process manager has color status icons for running, starting and failed\n  processes.\n\n- Next/Previous formats are no longer available (were rarely used and\n  untested).\n\n- Updated donation link: https://liberapay.com/CopyQ/\n\n- FakeVim, if enabled, is used for other multi-line text fields in the\n  application (e.g. item notes, command editor).\n- FakeVim, if in a dialog, binds save and quit command to the dialog buttons -\n  `:w` for Apply, `:wq` for OK, `:q` for Cancel.\n- FakeVim status bar shows an icon for errors and warnings.\n- FakeVim now handles set commands correctly.\n- FakeVim text cursor is gray if the editor is not focused.\n\n- Fix opening image editor for encrypted items.\n- Fix opening SVG image editor if the bitmap one is unset.\n- Fix stopping client processes properly.\n- Fix showing main window under mouse pointer (with showAt function).\n- Fix client crash when calling a method without instance (e.g. command \"copyq\n  ByteArray().size\").\n\n- OSX: Fix opening main window above full screen window.\n- OSX: Fix selecting item with Up/Down keys when searching.\n\n- X11: Fix setting wrong window title for own clipboard.\n- X11: Fix synchronizing selection if the change is quick.\n- X11: Fix tray icon on KDE.\n\n# v3.7.3\n- Search and item selection reset when main window is closed\n- Updated icons (Font Awesome 5.6.3)\n- Tray icon animation is not triggered if no automatic commands are run.\n- Improved color themes on some systems\n- Omit auto-hiding main window when it has a dialog open\n- Fix transparency of some icons\n- Fix size of menu when open on different screen\n- Fix window geometry restore and rendering issues\n- Fix auto-hide main window (e.g. on Gnome when using Activities)\n- X11: Fix small tray icon on Gnome\n- X11: Fix icon mask file name according to standard (\"copyq_mask\")\n\n# v3.7.2\n- Backspace deletes last character in tray menu search instead of clearing it\n  completely\n- Window title shows \"<ITEMS>\" label when non-text items are copied\n- Command dialog uses simpler layout for easier command editing\n- Command dialog shows simple command description\n- Remove empty lines at the end of copied and exported commands\n- New script functions to calculate hash: md5sum, sha1sum, sha256sum, sha512sum\n- Retrieving clipboard data is interrupted if it's slow\n- Editing commands no longer causes high CPU usage\n- Completion menu for command editor is resized once\n- Items are rendered faster and are shown with incorrect size initially while\n  scrolling instead of showing empty items\n- When Action dialog opens, the command editor is focused instead of the combo\n  box containing command history (this consistent with default focus behavior\n  on OS X)\n- Clipboard monitor process loads configuration only at start\n- Autostart option now works in the Flatpak package\n- OSX: Application no longer crashes when using the main window close button\n- X11: TIMESTAMP clipboard format is used to avoid retrieving unchanged content\n  unnecessarily\n- X11: Data installation path can be overridden with CMake options\n

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"
