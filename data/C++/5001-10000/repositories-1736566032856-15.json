The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable. More considerations\n     for the public:\n    wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensees\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public\nLicense\n\nBy exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree\nto be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons\nAttribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International Public License (\"Public\nLicense\"). To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\ncontract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\nacceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\nsuch rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\nmaking the Licensed Material available under these terms and\nconditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar\n     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material\n     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,\n     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring\n     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the\n     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights\n     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,\n     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or\n     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  c. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  d. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  e. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  f. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  g. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  h. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or\n     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such\n     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,\n     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material\n     available to the public including in ways that members of the\n     public may access the material from a place and at a time\n     individually chosen by them.\n\n  i. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright\n     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of\n     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,\n     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially\n     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  j. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce and reproduce, but not Share, Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material, You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n          For the avoidance of doubt, You do not have permission under\n          this Public License to Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database, provided You do not Share\n     Adapted Material;\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

Here are the differences between them.\n\n- NanaZip\n  - Only 64-Bit support.\n  - Only MSIX packaged version.\n  - Support the context menu in Windows 10/11 File Explorer.\n  - Support the file associations.\n  - Provide 7-Zip execution alias for helping users to migrate to NanaZip.\n  - Only support Windows 10 Version 2004 (Build 19041) or later.\n  - XAML-based GUI.\n\n- NanaZip Classic\n  - Have 32-Bit support.\n  - Only portable version.\n  - Don't have the context menu support.\n  - Don't have the file associations support.\n  - Don't have the 7-Zip execution alias support.\n  - Support Windows Vista RTM (Build 6000.16386) or later.\n  - Win32 GUI.\n\n## System Requirements\n\n- NanaZip (XAML-based GUI and MSIX package)\n  - Supported OS: Windows 10 Version 2004 (Build 19041) or later\n  - Supported Platforms: x86 (64-bit) and ARM (64-bit) \n\n- NanaZip Classic (Win32 GUI)\n  - Supported OS: Windows Vista RTM (Build 6000.16386) or later\n  - Supported Platforms: x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) and ARM (64-bit)\n\n- NanaZip Core (Core, Codecs, CLI and the Self Extracting Executables)\n  - Supported OS: Windows Vista RTM (Build 6000.16386) or later\n  - Supported Platforms: x86 (32-bit and 64-bit) and ARM (64-bit)\n\nNote: Except the Self Extracting Executables, the ucrtbase.dll with 10.0.19041.0\nversion or later need to be existed in the binary folder if you want to use\nNanaZip components on Windows versions earlier than Windows 10 Version 2004\n(Build 19041).\n\nWe chose Windows as the major platform for the NanaZip project supported\nbecause Windows has maintained a good and proven ABI and compatibility, and\nstands out in the history of computing. But we also care about the non-Windows\nplatform. Here are the policy for non-Windows platform support:\n\n- The modern flavor of NanaZip won't support non-Windows unless someone ported\n  WinRT XAML to POSIX. So, non-Windows support policy is only for NanaZip Core\n  and NanaZip Classic.\n- The developer team will try best to support Wine which has the Windows Vista\n  or later feature level. Currenly tested simply under Wine 9.x.\n- We don't support ReactOS and its derivatives because they are too hard to\n  support. But testing under the ReactOS and its derivatives may be interesting.\n\n## Download and Installation\n\nHere are some available installation methods for NanaZip.\n\n### Microsoft Store\n\nThis is the recommended way to install NanaZip.\n\nSearch and install `NanaZip` in Windows Store for the stable release, and `NanaZip\nPreview` for the preview release.\n\nAlso, you can also click the Microsoft Store link you needed.\n\n- [NanaZip](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9N8G7TSCL18R)\n- [NanaZip Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NZL0LRP1BNL)\n\n### MSIX Package\n\nYou also can download the MSIX Package in \n[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/releases).\n\nAfter you have downloaded the MSIX Package, you can double click to install it,\nor you can execute the following command in the PowerShell which is run as \nadministrator.\n\n> PowerShell -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass Add-AppxPackage -DeferRegistrationWhenPackagesAreInUse -ForceUpdateFromAnyVersion -Path `The path of the MSIX package`\n\nNote: All needed dependencies are included in the MSIX Package of NanaZip \nbecause we known that it's very difficult for users who do not have access to \nthe store to get our dependency packages, and we want to be robust and \ndeployable everywhere.\n\nIf you want to install NanaZip for all users, you can execute the following \ncommand in the PowerShell which is run as administrator.\n\n> PowerShell -NoLogo -NoProfile -NonInteractive -InputFormat None -ExecutionPolicy Bypass Add-AppxProvisionedPackage -Online -PackagePath `The path of the MSIX package` -LicensePath `The path of the XML license file`\n\nYou also can execute the following command in the Command Prompt which is run\nas administrator instead.\n\n> DISM.exe /Online /Add-ProvisionedAppxPackage /PackagePath:`The path of the MSIX package` /LicensePath:`The path of the XML license file`\n\nFor more information, please read documents for [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/dism/add-appxprovisionedpackage?view=windowsserver2022-ps) and \n[DISM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/dism-app-package--appx-or-appxbundle--servicing-command-line-options?view=windows-11)\n\nNote: Due to the policy from Microsoft Store, you need to run NanaZip with the\ninternet connection at the first time for getting the license if you install\nNanaZip without the internet connection, otherwise Windows won't launch NanaZip\nproperly.\n\nIf you want to uninstall NanaZip you installed for all users, you can execute\nthe following command in the PowerShell which is run as administrator.\n\n> Get-AppxPackage -Name *40174MouriNaruto.NanaZip* -AllUsers | Remove-AppxPackage -AllUsers -Confirm\n\n## Known issues\n\n- If you can't find NanaZip in the context menu, please restart all File \n  Explorer processes via Task Manager.\n- Due to the design of MSIX, drives' context menu in Explorer only show in\n  Windows 11(22H2)+.\n- Due to the issues in Desktop Bridge file system virtualization, you are \n  unable to use NanaZip in the Safe Mode of Windows.\n- Due to the policy from Microsoft Store, NanaZip is unable to disable Desktop \n  Bridge file system virtualization, so the file operations in \n  `%UserProfile%/AppData` will be redirected in Windows 10, and file operations\n  in directories other than `Local`, `LocalLow` and `Roaming` in \n  `%UserProfile%/AppData` will still be redirected in Windows 11.\n- Due to the Microsoft Store limitations, NanaZip 1.2 and later won't support \n  languages not mentioned in \n  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/publish/supported-languages.\n- If you turn off the Windows Firewall, NanaZip may fail to install.\n  (https://github.com/M2Team/NanaZip/issues/204)\n  (https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/12269)\n- Due to the System Settings limitations, starting with Windows 11+ \n  (Build 22000.1817+ & 22621.1555+), you can launch directly to the Settings \n  page for file association for NanaZip.\n  (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/launch-resume/launch-default-apps-settings)\n- Due to the Microsoft Store Licensing API implementation, you will find NanaZip\n  will try to access the Internet beginning with NanaZip 3.0 because NanaZip\n  needs to use that to check the Sponsor Edition addon licensing status.\n- For optimizing the user experience, NanaZip will only check the Sponsor \n  Edition addon licensing status at the first time your launch NanaZip File\n  Manager. You can click the sponsor button if you want to refresh the status\n  after you have purchased or redeemed the Sponsor Edition addon.\n\n## Documents\n\n- [License](License.md)\n- [Relevant People](Documents/People.md)\n- [Privacy Policy](Documents/Privacy.md)\n- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n- [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- [NanaZip Sponsor Edition](Documents/SponsorEdition.md)\n- [NanaZip Release Notes](Documents/ReleaseNotes.md)\n- [NanaZip Preview Release Notes](Documents/ReleaseNotesPreview.md)\n- [Versioning](Documents/Versioning.md)\n- [My Digital Life Forums](https://forums.mydigitallife.net/threads/84171)\n"
