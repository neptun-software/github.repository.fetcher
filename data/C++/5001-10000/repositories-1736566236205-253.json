          "content": "clip\n====\n\nclip (the _command line illustration processor_) is an open-source command line\nprogram and software library for creating charts and other data-driven\nillustrations.\n\n<h4>\n  <a href=\"https://clip-lang.org/getting-started\">Getting Started</a> &middot;\n  <a href=\"https://clip-lang.org/examples\">Examples</a> &middot;\n  <a href=\"https://clip-lang.org\">Documentation</a>\n</h4>\n\n\nIntroduction\n------------\n\nIn essence, clip is an automated drawing program; it reads a text file containing\na description of the chart or diagram and produces an image from it. This is best\nexplained by example, so here is how to draw a simple line chart using clip:\n\n```css\nclass: plot;\n\nlimit-x: 0 7200;\nlimit-y: 0 100;\n\naxes {\n  font: \"Roboto\";\n  position: left bottom;\n  label-placement-x: linear-interval(900 900 7000);\n  label-format-x: datetime(\"%H:%M:%S\");\n}\n\nlines {\n  data: \"test/testdata/timeseries.csv\";\n  stroke-width: 0.8pt;\n  color: #06c;\n}\n```\n\nThe input file from above (`example.clp`) can be processed with clip using the\nfollowing command:\n\n    $ clip --export output.svg example.clp\n\nThis is the resulting SVG file (`output.svg`):\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://clip-lang.org/examples/charts-scientific/multiple_y_axes\">\n    <img src=\"/doc/demo.svg\" width=\"80%\" alt=\"Demo Chart\" />\n  </a>\n</div>\n\nNote that this example is only intended to give you an idea of what the syntax\nlooks like; for an in-depth description of all parameters, please refer to\n[the documentation](https://clip-lang.org). More examples can be found on\n[the examples page](https://clip-lang.org/examples).\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nYou can find the full documentation and more examples at [clip-lang.org](https://clip-lang.org/).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n#### Compile from source\n\nTo build clip, you need an up-to-date C++ compiler, cmake, fmtlib, libharfbuzz,\nlibfreetype and cairo. Then run:\n\n    $ cmake .\n    $ make\n\nTo install the `clip` binary into your system, run `make install`:\n\n    $ make install\n\nTo run the test suite, run `make test`:\n\n    $ make test\n\n\nFor detailed installation instructions, have a look at the [Installation](https://clip-lang.org/documentation/installation/)\npage.\n\n\nFAQ\n---\n\n#### I'm getting build errors when compiling the code\n\nclip is written in C++17 and requires a reasonably modern C++ compiler and standard\nlibrary. In most cases where the code doesn't build it's due to some problem with\nthe local build environment. Still, we always appreciate bug reports via Github\nIssues so that we can improve our build system.\n\n#### The test suite fails on my machine because text placement is slightly offset\n\nThe test suite requires that you have the original Microsoft Arial TTF files\ninstalled on your machine. To verify that this is the case, run `fc-match\n'Arial,Helvetica,Helvetica Neue:style=Regular,Roman'` and check that it returns\nthe correct 'arial.ttf' file.\n\n#### What happened to the project name?\n\nThe project was started in 2011 and was initially called \"FnordMetric\". The\nfirst version from 8 years ago also included facilities for storing and\ntransforming data in addition to the charting code. Over time, the data\nprocessing parts were removed, leaving only the plotting code. However, as a\nconsequence, most of the search queries for the project name would return\noutdated information, resulting in a generally confusing and stale-feeling\nsituation. The best solution seemed to be to rename the project and so it was\nrenamed to \"clip\".\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\n  - Text rendering is based on the libre [freetype](https://www.freetype.org/)\n    and [harfbuzz](https://harfbuzz.org) stack.\n\n  - The structure of the plot elements is based on ideas from [The Grammar of\n    Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447) and the\n    [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) library.\n\n  - A number of concepts in clip are modelled after the\n    [CSS specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/)\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n    clip -- The command line illustration processor\n    https://clip-lang.org\n\n    Copyright (c) 2020, Paul Asmuth, Laura Schlimmer\n    All rights reserved.\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n"
