Whether you're a developer, a researcher, or simply enthusiastic about advancing\nthe field of software engineering with AI, there are many ways to get involved:\n\n- **Code Contributions:** Help us develop new core functionality, improve our agents, improve the frontend and other\ninterfaces, or anything else that would help make OpenHands better.\n- **Research and Evaluation:** Contribute to our understanding of LLMs in software engineering, participate in\nevaluating the models, or suggest improvements.\n- **Feedback and Testing:** Use the OpenHands toolset, report bugs, suggest features, or provide feedback on usability.\n\nFor details, please check [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nWe have a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that we expect all contributors to adhere to.\nLong story short, we are aiming for an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\nAll contributors are expected to contribute to building this sort of community.\n\n## 🛠️ Becoming a Maintainer\n\nFor contributors who have made significant and sustained contributions to the project, there is a possibility of joining\nthe maintainer team. The process for this is as follows:\n\n1. Any contributor who has made sustained and high-quality contributions to the codebase can be nominated by any\nmaintainer. If you feel that you may qualify you can reach out to any of the maintainers that have reviewed your PRs and ask if you can be nominated.\n2. Once a maintainer nominates a new maintainer, there will be a discussion period among the maintainers for at least 3 days.\n3. If no concerns are raised the nomination will be accepted by acclamation, and if concerns are raised there will be a discussion and possible vote.\n\nNote that just making many PRs does not immediately imply that you will become a maintainer. We will be looking\nat sustained high-quality contributions over a period of time, as well as good teamwork and adherence to our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n"

          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing to OpenHands! We welcome and appreciate contributions.\n\n## Understanding OpenHands's CodeBase\n\nTo understand the codebase, please refer to the README in each module:\n- [frontend](./frontend/README.md)\n- [evaluation](./evaluation/README.md)\n- [openhands](./openhands/README.md)\n   - [agenthub](./openhands/agenthub/README.md)\n   - [server](./openhands/server/README.md)\n\n## Setting up Your Development Environment\n\nWe have a separate doc [Development.md](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md) that tells you how to set up a development workflow.\n\n## How Can I Contribute?\n\nThere are many ways that you can contribute:\n\n1. **Download and use** OpenHands, and send [issues](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues) when you encounter something that isn't working or a feature that you'd like to see.\n2. **Send feedback** after each session by [clicking the thumbs-up thumbs-down buttons](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/feedback), so we can see where things are working and failing, and also build an open dataset for training code agents.\n3. **Improve the Codebase** by sending [PRs](#sending-pull-requests-to-openhands) (see details below). In particular, we have some [good first issues](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/labels/good%20first%20issue) that may be ones to start on.\n\n## What Can I Build?\nHere are a few ways you can help improve the codebase.\n\n#### UI/UX\nWe're always looking to improve the look and feel of the application. If you've got a small fix\nfor something that's bugging you, feel free to open up a PR that changes the [`./frontend`](./frontend) directory.\n\nIf you're looking to make a bigger change, add a new UI element, or significantly alter the style\nof the application, please open an issue first, or better, join the #frontend channel in our Slack\nto gather consensus from our design team first.\n\n#### Improving the agent\nOur main agent is the CodeAct agent. You can [see its prompts here](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/tree/main/openhands/agenthub/codeact_agent).\n\nChanges to these prompts, and to the underlying behavior in Python, can have a huge impact on user experience.\nYou can try modifying the prompts to see how they change the behavior of the agent as you use the app\nlocally, but we will need to do an end-to-end evaluation of any changes here to ensure that the agent\nis getting better over time.\n\nWe use the [SWE-bench](https://www.swebench.com/) benchmark to test our agent. You can join the #evaluation\nchannel in Slack to learn more.\n\n#### Adding a new agent\nYou may want to experiment with building new types of agents. You can add an agent to [`openhands/agenthub`](./openhands/agenthub)\nto help expand the capabilities of OpenHands.\n\n#### Adding a new runtime\nThe agent needs a place to run code and commands. When you run OpenHands on your laptop, it uses a Docker container\nto do this by default. But there are other ways of creating a sandbox for the agent.\n\nIf you work for a company that provides a cloud-based runtime, you could help us add support for that runtime\nby implementing the [interface specified here](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/openhands/runtime/base.py).\n\n#### Testing\nWhen you write code, it is also good to write tests. Please navigate to the [`./tests`](./tests) folder to see existing test suites.\nAt the moment, we have two kinds of tests: [`unit`](./tests/unit) and [`integration`](./evaluation/integration_tests). Please refer to the README for each test suite. These tests also run on GitHub's continuous integration to ensure quality of the project.\n\n## Sending Pull Requests to OpenHands\n\nYou'll need to fork our repository to send us a Pull Request. You can learn more\nabout how to fork a GitHub repo and open a PR with your changes in [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/forks-and-pull-requests-how-to-contribute-to-github-repos-8843fac34ce8).\n\n### Pull Request title\nAs described [here](https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json), a valid PR title should begin with one of the following prefixes:\n\n- `feat`: A new feature\n- `fix`: A bug fix\n- `docs`: Documentation only changes\n- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)\n- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature\n- `perf`: A code change that improves performance\n- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests\n- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)\n- `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)\n- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files\n- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit\n\nFor example, a PR title could be:\n- `refactor: modify package path`\n- `feat(frontend): xxxx`, where `(frontend)` means that this PR mainly focuses on the frontend component.\n\nYou may also check out previous PRs in the [PR list](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/pulls).\n\n### Pull Request description\n- If your PR is small (such as a typo fix), you can go brief.\n- If it contains a lot of changes, it's better to write more details.\n\nIf your changes are user-facing (e.g. a new feature in the UI, a change in behavior, or a bugfix)\nplease include a short message that we can add to our changelog.\n\n## How to Make Effective Contributions\n\n### Opening Issues\n\nIf you notice any bugs or have any feature requests please open them via the [issues page](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues). We will triage based on how critical the bug is or how potentially useful the improvement is, discuss, and implement the ones that the community has interest/effort for.\n\nFurther, if you see an issue you like, please leave a \"thumbs-up\" or a comment, which will help us prioritize.\n\n### Making Pull Requests\n\nWe're generally happy to consider all pull requests with the evaluation process varying based on the type of change:\n\n#### For Small Improvements\n\nSmall improvements with few downsides are typically reviewed and approved quickly.\nOne thing to check when making changes is to ensure that all continuous integration tests pass, which you can check before getting a review.\n\n#### For Core Agent Changes\n\nWe need to be more careful with changes to the core agent, as it is imperative to maintain high quality. These PRs are evaluated based on three key metrics:\n\n1. **Accuracy**\n2. **Efficiency**\n3. **Code Complexity**\n\nIf it improves accuracy, efficiency, or both with only a minimal change to code quality, that's great we're happy to merge it in!\nIf there are bigger tradeoffs (e.g. helping efficiency a lot and hurting accuracy a little) we might want to put it behind a feature flag.\nEither way, please feel free to discuss on github issues or slack, and we will give guidance and preliminary feedback.\n"

          "content": "# Development Guide\nThis guide is for people working on OpenHands and editing the source code.\nIf you wish to contribute your changes, check out the [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) on how to clone and setup the project initially before moving on.\nOtherwise, you can clone the OpenHands project directly.\n\n## Start the Server for Development\n### 1. Requirements\n* Linux, Mac OS, or [WSL on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)  [Ubuntu <= 22.04]\n* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) (For those on MacOS, make sure to allow the default Docker socket to be used from advanced settings!)\n* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) = 3.12\n* [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) >= 20.x\n* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer) >= 1.8\n* OS-specific dependencies:\n  - Ubuntu: build-essential => `sudo apt-get install build-essential`\n  - WSL: netcat => `sudo apt-get install netcat`\n\nMake sure you have all these dependencies installed before moving on to `make build`.\n\n#### Develop without sudo access\nIf you want to develop without system admin/sudo access to upgrade/install `Python` and/or `NodeJs`, you can use `conda` or `mamba` to manage the packages for you:\n\n```bash\n# Download and install Mamba (a faster version of conda)\ncurl -L -O \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"\nbash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\n\n# Install Python 3.12, nodejs, and poetry\nmamba install python=3.12\nmamba install conda-forge::nodejs\nmamba install conda-forge::poetry\n```\n\n### 2. Build and Setup The Environment\nBegin by building the project which includes setting up the environment and installing dependencies. This step ensures that OpenHands is ready to run on your system:\n\n```bash\nmake build\n```\n\n### 3. Configuring the Language Model\nOpenHands supports a diverse array of Language Models (LMs) through the powerful [litellm](https://docs.litellm.ai) library.\nBy default, we've chosen Claude Sonnet 3.5 as our go-to model, but the world is your oyster! You can unleash the\npotential of any other LM that piques your interest.\n\nTo configure the LM of your choice, run:\n\n   ```bash\n   make setup-config\n   ```\n\n   This command will prompt you to enter the LLM API key, model name, and other variables ensuring that OpenHands is tailored to your specific needs. Note that the model name will apply only when you run headless. If you use the UI, please set the model in the UI.\n\n   Note: If you have previously run OpenHands using the docker command, you may have already set some environmental variables in your terminal. The final configurations are set from highest to lowest priority:\n   Environment variables > config.toml variables > default variables\n\n**Note on Alternative Models:**\nSee [our documentation](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/llms) for recommended models.\n\n### 4. Running the application\n#### Option A: Run the Full Application\nOnce the setup is complete, this command starts both the backend and frontend servers, allowing you to interact with OpenHands:\n```bash\nmake run\n```\n\n#### Option B: Individual Server Startup\n- **Start the Backend Server:** If you prefer, you can start the backend server independently to focus on backend-related tasks or configurations.\n    ```bash\n    make start-backend\n    ```\n\n- **Start the Frontend Server:** Similarly, you can start the frontend server on its own to work on frontend-related components or interface enhancements.\n    ```bash\n    make start-frontend\n    ```\n\n### 6. LLM Debugging\nIf you encounter any issues with the Language Model (LM) or you're simply curious, export DEBUG=1 in the environment and restart the backend.\nOpenHands will log the prompts and responses in the logs/llm/CURRENT_DATE directory, allowing you to identify the causes.\n\n### 7. Help\nNeed help or info on available targets and commands? Use the help command for all the guidance you need with OpenHands.\n```bash\nmake help\n ```\n\n### 8. Testing\nTo run tests, refer to the following:\n#### Unit tests\n\n```bash\npoetry run pytest ./tests/unit/test_*.py\n```\n\n### 9. Add or update dependency\n1. Add your dependency in `pyproject.toml` or use `poetry add xxx`.\n2. Update the poetry.lock file via `poetry lock --no-update`.\n\n### 9. Use existing Docker image\nTo reduce build time (e.g., if no changes were made to the client-runtime component), you can use an existing Docker container image by\nsetting the SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE environment variable to the desired Docker image.\n\nExample: `export SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=ghcr.io/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.19-nikolaik`\n\n## Develop inside Docker container\n\nTL;DR\n\n```bash\nmake docker-dev\n```\n\nSee more details [here](./containers/dev/README.md).\n\nIf you are just interested in running `OpenHands` without installing all the required tools on your host.\n\n```bash\nmake docker-run\n```\n\nIf you do not have `make` on your host, run:\n\n```bash\ncd ./containers/dev\n./dev.sh\n```\n\nYou do need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) installed on your host though.\n"

We'd love to chat! Fill out\n> [this short form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet3VbGaz8z32gW9Wm-Grl4jpt5WgMXPgJ4EDPVmCETCBpJtQ/viewform)\n> to join our Design Partner program, where you'll get early access to commercial features and the opportunity to provide input on our product roadmap.\n\n![App screenshot](./docs/static/img/screenshot.png)\n\n## ⚡ Quick Start\n\nThe easiest way to run OpenHands is in Docker.\nSee the [Installation](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/installation) guide for\nsystem requirements and more information.\n\n```bash\ndocker pull docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.19-nikolaik\n\ndocker run -it --rm --pull=always \\\n    -e SANDBOX_RUNTIME_CONTAINER_IMAGE=docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/runtime:0.19-nikolaik \\\n    -e LOG_ALL_EVENTS=true \\\n    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\\n    -v ~/.openhands-state:/.openhands-state \\\n    -p 3000:3000 \\\n    --add-host host.docker.internal:host-gateway \\\n    --name openhands-app \\\n    docker.all-hands.dev/all-hands-ai/openhands:0.19\n```\n\nYou'll find OpenHands running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!\n\nFinally, you'll need a model provider and API key.\n[Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet](https://www.anthropic.com/api) (`anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`)\nworks best, but you have [many options](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/llms).\n\n---\n\nYou can also [connect OpenHands to your local filesystem](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/runtimes#connecting-to-your-filesystem),\nrun OpenHands in a scriptable [headless mode](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/headless-mode),\ninteract with it via a [friendly CLI](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/cli-mode),\nor run it on tagged issues with [a github action](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/how-to/github-action).\n\nVisit [Installation](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/installation) for more information and setup instructions.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> OpenHands is meant to be run by a single user on their local workstation.\n> It is not appropriate for multi-tenant deployments where multiple users share the same instance. There is no built-in isolation or scalability.\n>\n> If you're interested in running OpenHands in a multi-tenant environment, please\n> [get in touch with us](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSet3VbGaz8z32gW9Wm-Grl4jpt5WgMXPgJ4EDPVmCETCBpJtQ/viewform)\n> for advanced deployment options.\n\nIf you want to modify the OpenHands source code, check out [Development.md](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/blob/main/Development.md).\n\nHaving issues? The [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/troubleshooting) can help.\n\n## 📖 Documentation\n\nTo learn more about the project, and for tips on using OpenHands,\ncheck out our [documentation](https://docs.all-hands.dev/modules/usage/getting-started).\n\nThere you'll find resources on how to use different LLM providers,\ntroubleshooting resources, and advanced configuration options.\n\n## 🤝 How to Join the Community\n\nOpenHands is a community-driven project, and we welcome contributions from everyone. We do most of our communication\nthrough Slack, so this is the best place to start, but we also are happy to have you contact us on Discord or Github:\n\n- [Join our Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/openhands-ai/shared_invite/zt-2wkh4pklz-w~h_DVDtEe9H5kyQlcNxVw) - Here we talk about research, architecture, and future development.\n- [Join our Discord server](https://discord.gg/ESHStjSjD4) - This is a community-run server for general discussion, questions, and feedback.\n- [Read or post Github Issues](https://github.com/All-Hands-AI/OpenHands/issues) - Check out the issues we're working on, or add your own ideas.\n\nSee more about the community in [COMMUNITY.md](./COMMUNITY.md) or find details on contributing in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## 📈 Progress\n\nSee the monthly OpenHands roadmap [here](https://github.com/orgs/All-Hands-AI/projects/1) (updated at the maintainer's meeting at the end of each month).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a href=\"https://star-history.com/#All-Hands-AI/OpenHands&Date\">\n    <img src=\"https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=All-Hands-AI/OpenHands&type=Date\" width=\"500\" alt=\"Star History Chart\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n\n## 📜 License\n\nDistributed under the MIT License.
