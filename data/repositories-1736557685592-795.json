K9s continually watches Kubernetes\nfor changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with your observed resources.\n\n---\n\n## Note...\n\nK9s is not pimped out by a big corporation with deep pockets.\nIt is a complex OSS project that demands a lot of my time to maintain and support.\nK9s will always remain OSS and therefore free! That said, if you feel k9s makes your day to day Kubernetes journey a tad brighter, saves you time and makes you more productive, please consider [sponsoring us!](https://github.com/sponsors/derailed)\nYour donations will go a long way in keeping our servers lights on and beers in our fridge!\n\n**Thank you!**\n\n---\n\n[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/derailed/k9s?)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/derailed/k9s)\n[![golangci badge](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-web/blob/master/src/assets/images/badge_a_plus_flat.svg)](https://golangci.com/r/github.com/derailed/k9s)\n[![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/89e5a80e-dfe8-4426-acf6-6be781e0a12e)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-derailed-k9s-master)\n[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.com/derailed/k9s.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/derailed/k9s)\n[![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/derailed/k9s/status \"Docker Repository on Quay\")](https://quay.io/repository/derailed/k9s)\n[![release](https://img.shields.io/github/release-pre/derailed/k9s.svg)](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases)\n[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/mum4k/termdash/blob/master/LICENSE)\n[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/derailed/k9s/total.svg)](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/releases)\n\n---\n\n## Screenshots\n\n1.

Clone the repo\n 2. Build and run the executable\n\n      ```shell\n      make build && ./execs/k9s\n      ```\n\n---\n\n## Running with Docker\n\n### Running the official Docker image\n\n  You can run k9s as a Docker container by mounting your `KUBECONFIG`:\n\n  ```shell\n  docker run --rm -it -v $KUBECONFIG:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s\n  ```\n\n  For default path it would be:\n\n  ```shell\n  docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config quay.io/derailed/k9s\n  ```\n\n### Building your own Docker image\n\n  You can build your own Docker image of k9s from the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) with the following:\n\n  ```shell\n  docker build -t k9s-docker:v0.0.1 .\n  ```\n\n  You can get the latest stable `kubectl` version and pass it to the `docker build` command with the `--build-arg` option.\n  You can use the `--build-arg` option to pass any valid `kubectl` version (like `v1.18.0` or `v1.19.1`).\n\n  ```shell\n  KUBECTL_VERSION=$(make kubectl-stable-version 2>/dev/null)\n  docker build --build-arg KUBECTL_VERSION=${KUBECTL_VERSION} -t k9s-docker:0.1 .\n  ```\n\n  Run your container:\n\n  ```shell\n  docker run --rm -it -v ~/.kube/config:/root/.kube/config k9s-docker:0.1\n  ```\n\n---\n\n## PreFlight Checks\n\n* K9s uses 256 colors terminal mode. On `Nix system make sure TERM is set accordingly.\n\n    ```shell\n    export TERM=xterm-256color\n    ```\n\n* In order to issue resource edit commands make sure your EDITOR and KUBE_EDITOR env vars are set.\n\n    ```shell\n    # Kubectl edit command will use this env var.\n    export KUBE_EDITOR=my_fav_editor\n    ```\n\n* K9s prefers recent kubernetes versions ie 1.28+\n\n---\n\n## K8S Compatibility Matrix\n\n|         k9s        | k8s client |\n| ------------------ | ---------- |\n|     >= v0.27.0     |   1.26.1   |\n| v0.26.7 - v0.26.6  |   1.25.3   |\n| v0.26.5 - v0.26.4  |   1.25.1   |\n| v0.26.3 - v0.26.1  |   1.24.3   |\n| v0.26.0 - v0.25.19 |   1.24.2   |\n| v0.25.18 - v0.25.3 |   1.22.3   |\n| v0.25.2 - v0.25.0  |   1.22.0   |\n|      <= v0.24      |   1.21.3   |\n\n---\n\n## The Command Line\n\n```shell\n# List current version\nk9s version\n\n# To get info about K9s runtime (logs, configs, etc..)\nk9s info\n\n# List all available CLI options\nk9s help\n\n# To run K9s in a given namespace\nk9s -n mycoolns\n\n# Start K9s in an existing KubeConfig context\nk9s --context coolCtx\n\n# Start K9s in readonly mode - with all cluster modification commands disabled\nk9s --readonly\n```\n\n## Logs And Debug Logs\n\nGiven the nature of the ui k9s does produce logs to a specific location.\nTo view the logs and turn on debug mode, use the following commands:\n\n```shell\n# Find out where the logs are stored\nk9s info\n```\n\n```text\n ____  __.________\n|    |/ _/   __   \\______\n|      < \\____    /  ___/\n|    |  \\   /    /\\___ \\\n|____|__ \\ /____//____  >\n        \\/            \\/\n\nVersion:           vX.Y.Z\nConfig:            /Users/fernand/.config/k9s/config.yaml\nLogs:              /Users/fernand/.local/state/k9s/k9s.log\nDumps dir:         /Users/fernand/.local/state/k9s/screen-dumps\nBenchmarks dir:    /Users/fernand/.local/state/k9s/benchmarks\nSkins dir:         /Users/fernand/.local/share/k9s/skins\nContexts dir:      /Users/fernand/.local/share/k9s/clusters\nCustom views file: /Users/fernand/.local/share/k9s/views.yaml\nPlugins file:      /Users/fernand/.local/share/k9s/plugins.yaml\nHotkeys file:      /Users/fernand/.local/share/k9s/hotkeys.yaml\nAlias file:        /Users/fernand/.local/share/k9s/aliases.yaml\n```\n\n### View K9s logs\n\n```shell\ntail -f /Users/fernand/.local/data/k9s/k9s.log\n```\n\n### Start K9s in debug mode\n\n```shell\nk9s -l debug\n```\n\n### Customize logs destination\n\nYou can override the default log file destination either with the `--logFile` argument:\n\n```shell\nk9s --logFile /tmp/k9s.log\nless /tmp/k9s.log\n```\n\nOr through the `K9S_LOGS_DIR` environment variable:\n\n```shell\nK9S_LOGS_DIR=/var/log k9s\nless /var/log/k9s.log\n```\n\n## Key Bindings\n\nK9s uses aliases to navigate most K8s resources.\n\n| Action                                                                          | Command                       | Comment                                                                |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Show active keyboard mnemonics and help                                         | `?`                           |                                                                        |\n| Show all available resource alias                                               | `ctrl-a`                      |                                                                        |\n| To bail out of K9s                                                              | `:quit`, `:q`, `ctrl-c`       |                                                                        |\n| To go up/back to the previous view                                              | `esc`                         | If you have crumbs on, this will go to the previous one                |\n| View a Kubernetes resource using singular/plural or short-name                  | `:`pod⏎                       | accepts singular, plural, short-name or alias ie pod or pods           |\n| View a Kubernetes resource in a given namespace                                 | `:`pod ns-x⏎                  |                                                                        |\n| View filtered pods (New v0.30.0!)                                               | `:`pod /fred⏎                 | View all pods filtered by fred                                         |\n| View labeled pods (New v0.30.0!)                                                | `:`pod app=fred,env=dev⏎      | View all pods with labels matching app=fred and env=dev                |\n| View pods in a given context (New v0.30.0!)                                     | `:`pod @ctx1⏎                 | View all pods in context ctx1.

K9s leverages [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) to load its various configurations files. For information on the default locations for your OS please see [this link](https://github.com/adrg/xdg/blob/master/README.md). If you are still confused a quick `k9s info` will reveal where k9s is loading its configurations from. Alternatively, you can set `K9S_CONFIG_DIR` to tell K9s the directory location to pull its configurations from.\n\n  | Unix            | macOS                              | Windows               |\n  |-----------------|------------------------------------|-----------------------|\n  | `~/.config/k9s` | `~/Library/Application Support/k9s` | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\k9s`  |\n\n  > NOTE: This is still in flux and will change while in pre-release stage!\n\nYou can now override the context portForward default address configuration by setting an env variable that can override all clusters portForward local address using `K9S_DEFAULT_PF_ADDRESS=a.b.c.d`\n\n  ```yaml\n  # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml\n  k9s:\n    # Enable periodic refresh of resource browser windows.

Popeye itself uses a configuration called `spinach.yml`, but when integrating with K9s the cluster-specific file should be name `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/share/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/spinach.yml`.  This allows you to have a different spinach config per cluster.\n\n---\n\n## Node Shell\n\nBy enabling the nodeShell feature gate on a given cluster, K9s allows you to shell into your cluster nodes. Once enabled, you will have a new `s` for `shell` menu option while in node view. K9s will launch a pod on the selected node using a special k9s_shell pod. Furthermore, you can refine your shell pod by using a custom docker image preloaded with the shell tools you love. By default k9s uses a BusyBox image, but you can configure it as follows:\n\nAlternatively, you can now override the context configuration by setting an env variable that can override all clusters node shell gate using `K9S_FEATURE_GATE_NODE_SHELL=true|false`\n\n```yaml\n# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml\nk9s:\n  # You can also further tune the shell pod specification\n  shellPod:\n    image: cool_kid_admin:42\n    namespace: blee\n    limits:\n      cpu: 100m\n      memory: 100Mi\n```\n\nThen in your cluster configuration file...\n\n```yaml\n# $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/cluster-1/context-1\nk9s:\n  cluster: cluster-1\n  readOnly: false\n  namespace:\n    active: default\n    lockFavorites: false\n    favorites:\n    - kube-system\n    - default\n  view:\n    active: po\n  featureGates:\n    nodeShell: true # => Enable this feature gate to make nodeShell available on this cluster\n  portForwardAddress: localhost\n```\n\n---\n\n## Command Aliases\n\nIn K9s, you can define your very own command aliases (shortnames) to access your resources. In your `$HOME/.config/k9s` define a file called `aliases.yaml`.\nA K9s alias defines pairs of alias:gvr. A gvr (Group/Version/Resource) represents a fully qualified Kubernetes resource identifier. Here is an example of an alias file:\n\n```yaml\n#  $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/aliases.yaml\naliases:\n  pp: v1/pods\n  crb: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1/clusterrolebindings\n  # As of v0.30.0 you can also refer to another command alias...\n  fred: pod fred app=blee # => view pods in namespace fred with labels matching app=blee\n```\n\nUsing this aliases file, you can now type `:pp` or `:crb` or `:fred` to activate their respective commands.\n\n---\n\n## HotKey Support\n\nEntering the command mode and typing a resource name or alias, could be cumbersome for navigating thru often used resources.\nWe're introducing hotkeys that allow users to define their own key combination to activate their favorite resource views.\n\nAdditionally, you can define context specific hotkeys by add a context level configuration file in `$XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/hotkeys.yaml`\n\nIn order to surface hotkeys globally please follow these steps:\n\n1. Create a file named `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/hotkeys.yaml`\n2. Add the following to your `hotkeys.yaml`. You can use resource name/short name to specify a command ie same as typing it while in command mode.\n\n      ```yaml\n      #  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/hotkeys.yaml\n      hotKeys:\n        # Hitting Shift-0 navigates to your pod view\n        shift-0:\n          shortCut:    Shift-0\n          description: Viewing pods\n          command:     pods\n        # Hitting Shift-1 navigates to your deployments\n        shift-1:\n          shortCut:    Shift-1\n          description: View deployments\n          command:     dp\n        # Hitting Shift-2 navigates to your xray deployments\n        shift-2:\n          shortCut:    Shift-2\n          description: Xray Deployments\n          command:     xray deploy\n        # Hitting Shift-S view the resources in the namespace of your current selection\n        shift-s:\n          shortCut:    Shift-S\n          override:    true # => will override the default shortcut related action if set to true (default to false)\n          description: Namespaced resources\n          command:     \"$RESOURCE_NAME $NAMESPACE\"\n          keepHistory: true # whether you can return to the previous view\n      ```\n\n Not feeling so hot? Your custom hotkeys will be listed in the help view `?`.\n Also your hotkeys file will be automatically reloaded so you can readily use your hotkeys as you define them.\n\n You can choose any keyboard shortcuts that make sense to you, provided they are not part of the standard K9s shortcuts list.\n\n Similarly, referencing environment variables in hotkeys is also supported. The available environment variables can refer to the description in the [Plugins](#plugins) section.\n\n> NOTE: This feature/configuration might change in future releases!\n\n---\n\n## Port Forwarding over websockets\n\nK9s follows `kubectl` feature flag environment variables to enable/disable port-forwarding over websockets. (default enabled in >1.30)\nTo disable Websocket support, set `KUBECTL_PORT_FORWARD_WEBSOCKETS=false`\n\n---\n\n## FastForwards\n\nAs of v0.25.0, you can leverage the `FastForwards` feature to tell K9s how to default port-forwards. In situations where you are dealing with multiple containers or containers exposing multiple ports, it can be cumbersome to specify the desired port-forward from the dialog as in most cases, you already know which container/port tuple you desire. For these use cases, you can now annotate your manifests with the following annotations:\n\n@ `k9scli.io/auto-port-forwards`\n  activates one or more port-forwards directly bypassing the port-forward dialog all together.\n@ `k9scli.io/port-forwards`\n  pre-selects one or more port-forwards when launching the port-forward dialog.\n\nThe annotation value takes on the shape `container-name::[local-port:]container-port`\n\n> NOTE: for either cases above you can specify the container port by name or number in your annotation!\n\n### Example\n\n```yaml\n# Pod fred\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: fred\n  annotations:\n    k9scli.io/auto-port-forwards: zorg::5556        # => will default to container zorg port 5556 and local port 5566. No port-forward dialog will be shown.\n    # Or...\n    k9scli.io/port-forwards: bozo::9090:p1          # => launches the port-forward dialog selecting default port-forward on container bozo port named p1(8081)\n                                                    # mapping to local port 9090.\n    ...\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: zorg\n    ports:\n    - name: p1\n      containerPort: 5556\n    ...\n  - name: bozo\n    ports:\n    - name: p1\n      containerPort: 8081\n    - name: p2\n      containerPort: 5555\n    ...\n```\n\nThe annotation value must specify a container to forward to as well as a local port and container port. The container port may be specified as either a port number or port name. If the local port is omitted then the local port will default to the container port number. Here are a few examples:\n\n1. bozo::http      - creates a pf on container `bozo` with port name http. If http specifies port number 8080 then the local port will be 8080 as well.\n2. bozo::9090:http - creates a pf on container `bozo` mapping local port 9090->http(8080)\n3. bozo::9090:8080 - creates a pf on container `bozo` mapping local port 9090->8080\n\n---\n\n## Resource Custom Columns\n\n[SneakCast v0.17.0 on The Beach! - Yup! sound is sucking but what a setting!](https://youtu.be/7S33CNLAofk)\n\nYou can change which columns shows up for a given resource via custom views. To surface this feature, you will need to create a new configuration file, namely `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/views.yaml`. This file leverages GVR (Group/Version/Resource) to configure the associated table view columns. If no GVR is found for a view the default rendering will take over (ie what we have now). Going wide will add all the remaining columns that are available on the given resource after your custom columns. To boot, you can edit your views config file and tune your resources views live!\n\n> NOTE: This is experimental and will most likely change as we iron this out!\n\nHere is a sample views configuration that customize a pods and services views.\n\n```yaml\n# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/views.yaml\nviews:\n  v1/pods:\n    columns:\n      - AGE\n      - NAMESPACE\n      - NAME\n      - IP\n      - NODE\n      - STATUS\n      - READY\n  v1/services:\n    columns:\n      - AGE\n      - NAMESPACE\n      - NAME\n      - TYPE\n      - CLUSTER-IP\n```\n\n---\n\n## Plugins\n\nK9s allows you to extend your command line and tooling by defining your very own cluster commands via plugins. K9s will look at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/plugins.yaml` to locate all available plugins.\n\nA plugin is defined as follows:\n\n* Shortcut option represents the key combination a user would type to activate the plugin. Valid values are [a-z], Shift-[A-Z], Ctrl-[A-Z].\n* Override option make that the default action related to the shortcut will be overridden by the plugin\n* Confirm option (when enabled) lets you see the command that is going to be executed and gives you an option to confirm or prevent execution\n* Description will be printed next to the shortcut in the k9s menu\n* Scopes defines a collection of resources names/short-names for the views associated with the plugin. You can specify `all` to provide this shortcut for all views.\n* Command represents ad-hoc commands the plugin runs upon activation\n* Background specifies whether or not the command runs in the background\n* Args specifies the various arguments that should apply to the command above\n* OverwriteOutput boolean option allows plugin developers to provide custom messages on plugin stdout execution. See example in [#2644](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/pull/2644)\n* Dangerous boolean option enables disabling the plugin when read-only mode is set. See [#2604](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/issues/2604)\n\nK9s does provide additional environment variables for you to customize your plugins arguments. Currently, the available environment variables are as follows:\n\n* `$RESOURCE_GROUP` -- the selected resource group\n* `$RESOURCE_VERSION` -- the selected resource api version\n* `$RESOURCE_NAME` -- the selected resource name\n* `$NAMESPACE` -- the selected resource namespace\n* `$NAME` -- the selected resource name\n* `$CONTAINER` -- the current container if applicable\n* `$FILTER` -- the current filter if any\n* `$KUBECONFIG` -- the KubeConfig location.\n* `$CLUSTER` the active cluster name\n* `$CONTEXT` the active context name\n* `$USER` the active user\n* `$GROUPS` the active groups\n* `$POD` while in a container view\n* `$COL-<RESOURCE_COLUMN_NAME>` use a given column name for a viewed resource. Must be prefixed by `COL-`!\n\nCurly braces can be used to embed an environment variable inside another string, or if the column name contains special characters. (e.g. `${NAME}-example` or `${COL-%CPU/L}`)\n\n### Plugin Example\n\nThis defines a plugin for viewing logs on a selected pod using `ctrl-l` as shortcut.\n\n```yaml\n#  $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/plugins.yaml\nplugins:\n  # Defines a plugin to provide a `ctrl-l` shortcut to tail the logs while in pod view.\n  fred:\n    shortCut: Ctrl-L\n    override: false\n    overwriteOutput: false\n    confirm: false\n    dangerous: false\n    description: Pod logs\n    scopes:\n    - pods\n    command: kubectl\n    background: false\n    args:\n    - logs\n    - -f\n    - $NAME\n    - -n\n    - $NAMESPACE\n    - --context\n    - $CONTEXT\n```\n\n> NOTE: This is an experimental feature! Options and layout may change in future K9s releases as this feature solidifies.\n\n---\n\n## Benchmark Your Applications\n\nK9s integrates [Hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) from the brilliant and super talented [Jaana Dogan](https://github.com/rakyll). `Hey` is a CLI tool to benchmark HTTP endpoints similar to AB bench. This preliminary feature currently supports benchmarking port-forwards and services (Read the paint on this is way fresh!).\n\nTo setup a port-forward, you will need to navigate to the PodView, select a pod and a container that exposes a given port. Using `SHIFT-F` a dialog comes up to allow you to specify a local port to forward. Once acknowledged, you can navigate to the PortForward view (alias `pf`) listing out your active port-forwards. Selecting a port-forward and using `CTRL-B` will run a benchmark on that HTTP endpoint. To view the results of your benchmark runs, go to the Benchmarks view (alias `be`). You should now be able to select a benchmark and view the run stats details by pressing `<ENTER>`. NOTE: Port-forwards only last for the duration of the K9s session and will be terminated upon exit.\n\nInitially, the benchmarks will run with the following defaults:\n\n* Concurrency Level: 1\n* Number of Requests: 200\n* HTTP Verb: GET\n* Path: /\n\nThe PortForward view is backed by a new K9s config file namely: `$XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/benchmarks.yaml`. Each cluster you connect to will have its own bench config file, containing the name of the K8s context for the cluster. Changes to this file should automatically update the PortForward view to indicate how you want to run your benchmarks.\n\nBenchmarks result reports are stored in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY`\n\nHere is a sample benchmarks.yaml configuration. Please keep in mind this file will likely change in subsequent releases!\n\n```yaml\n# This file resides in  $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/benchmarks.yaml\nbenchmarks:\n  # Indicates the default concurrency and number of requests setting if a container or service rule does not match.\n  defaults:\n    # One concurrent connection\n    concurrency: 1\n    # Number of requests that will be sent to an endpoint\n    requests: 500\n  containers:\n    # Containers section allows you to configure your http container's endpoints and benchmarking settings.\n    # NOTE: the container ID syntax uses namespace/pod-name:container-name\n    default/nginx:nginx:\n      # Benchmark a container named nginx using POST HTTP verb using http://localhost:port/bozo URL and headers.\n      concurrency: 1\n      requests: 10000\n      http:\n        path: /bozo\n        method: POST\n        body:\n          {\"fred\":\"blee\"}\n        header:\n          Accept:\n            - text/html\n          Content-Type:\n            - application/json\n  services:\n    # Similarly you can Benchmark an HTTP service exposed either via NodePort, LoadBalancer types.\n    # Service ID is ns/svc-name\n    default/nginx:\n      # Set the concurrency level\n      concurrency: 5\n      # Number of requests to be sent\n      requests: 500\n      http:\n        method: GET\n        # This setting will depend on whether service is NodePort or LoadBalancer. NodePort may require vendor port tunneling setting.\n        # Set this to a node if NodePort or LB if applicable.

K9s needs minimally read privileges at both the cluster and namespace level to display resources and metrics.\n\nThese rules below are just suggestions. You will need to customize them based on your environment policies. If you need to edit/delete resources extra Fu will be necessary.\n\n> NOTE! Cluster/Namespace access may change in the future as K9s evolves.\n> NOTE! We expect K9s to keep running even in atrophied clusters/namespaces. Please file issues if this is not the case!\n\n### Cluster RBAC scope\n\n```yaml\n---\n# K9s Reader ClusterRole\nkind: ClusterRole\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: k9s\nrules:\n  # Grants RO access to cluster resources node and namespace\n  - apiGroups: [\"\"]\n    resources: [\"nodes\", \"namespaces\"]\n    verbs: [\"get\", \"list\", \"watch\"]\n  # Grants RO access to RBAC resources\n  - apiGroups: [\"rbac.authorization.k8s.io\"]\n    resources: [\"clusterroles\", \"roles\", \"clusterrolebindings\", \"rolebindings\"]\n    verbs: [\"get\", \"list\", \"watch\"]\n  # Grants RO access to CRD resources\n  - apiGroups: [\"apiextensions.k8s.io\"]\n    resources: [\"customresourcedefinitions\"]\n    verbs: [\"get\", \"list\", \"watch\"]\n  # Grants RO access to metric server (if present)\n  - apiGroups: [\"metrics.k8s.io\"]\n    resources: [\"nodes\", \"pods\"]\n    verbs: [\"get\", \"list\", \"watch\"]\n\n---\n# Sample K9s user ClusterRoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: ClusterRoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: k9s\nsubjects:\n  - kind: User\n    name: fernand\n    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  kind: ClusterRole\n  name: k9s\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n```\n\n### Namespace RBAC scope\n\nIf your users are constrained to certain namespaces, K9s will need to following role to enable read access to namespaced resources.\n\n```yaml\n---\n# K9s Reader Role (default namespace)\nkind: Role\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: k9s\n  namespace: default\nrules:\n  # Grants RO access to most namespaced resources\n  - apiGroups: [\"\", \"apps\", \"autoscaling\", \"batch\", \"extensions\"]\n    resources: [\"*\"]\n    verbs: [\"get\", \"list\", \"watch\"]\n  # Grants RO access to metric server\n  - apiGroups: [\"metrics.k8s.io\"]\n    resources: [\"pods\", \"nodes\"]\n    verbs:\n      - get\n      - list\n      - watch\n\n---\n# Sample K9s user RoleBinding\napiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1\nkind: RoleBinding\nmetadata:\n  name: k9s\n  namespace: default\nsubjects:\n  - kind: User\n    name: fernand\n    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\nroleRef:\n  kind: Role\n  name: k9s\n  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io\n```\n\n---\n\n## Skins\n\nExample: Dracula Skin ;)\n\n<img src=\"assets/skins/dracula.png\" alt=\"Dracula Skin\">\n\nYou can style K9s based on your own sense of look and style. Skins are YAML files, that enable a user to change the K9s presentation layer. See this repo `skins` directory for examples.\nYou can skin k9s by default by specifying a UI.skin attribute. You can also change K9s skins based on the context you are connecting too.\nIn this case, you can specify a skin field on your cluster config aka `skin: dracula` (just the name of the skin file without the extension!) and copy this repo\n`skins/dracula.yaml` to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/skins/` directory.\n\nIn the case where your cluster spans several contexts, you can add a skin context configuration to your context configuration.\nThis is a collection of {context_name, skin} tuples (please see example below!)\n\nColors can be defined by name or using a hex representation. Of recent, we've added a color named `default` to indicate a transparent background color to preserve your terminal background color settings if so desired.\n\n> NOTE: This is very much an experimental feature at this time, more will be added/modified if this feature has legs so thread accordingly!\n> NOTE: Please see [K9s Skins](https://k9scli.io/topics/skins/) for a list of available colors.\n\nTo skin a specific context and provided the file `in_the_navy.yaml` is present in your skins directory.\n\n```yaml\n#  $XDG_DATA_HOME/k9s/clusters/clusterX/contextY/config.yaml\nk9s:\n  cluster: clusterX\n  skin: in_the_navy\n  readOnly: false\n  namespace:\n    active: default\n    lockFavorites: false\n    favorites:\n    - kube-system\n    - default\n  view:\n    active: po\n  featureGates:\n    nodeShell: false\n  portForwardAddress: localhost\n```\n\nYou can also specify a default skin for all contexts in the root k9s config file as so:\n\n```yaml\n#  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml\nk9s:\n  liveViewAutoRefresh: false\n  screenDumpDir: /tmp/dumps\n  refreshRate: 2\n  maxConnRetry: 5\n  readOnly: false\n  noExitOnCtrlC: false\n  ui:\n    enableMouse: false\n    headless: false\n    logoless: false\n    crumbsless: false\n    noIcons: false\n    # Toggles reactive UI.
