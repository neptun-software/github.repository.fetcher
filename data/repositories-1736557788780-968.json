Examples of\nrepresenting a project or community include using an official project e-mail\naddress, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed\nor de facto representative at an online or offline event.\n\n## Conflict Resolution\n\nConflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a\nbad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious\ninstances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and\neverything in between.\n\nIf the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires\nimmediate escalation, please see below.\n\nHowever, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first\nresolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that\nfails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the\noutcome of their dispute.\n\nIf you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following\nescalation strategy to address the conflict:\n\n1.  Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a\n    real-time medium.\n2.  If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with\n    background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.\n3.  If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to\n    harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.\n\n## Reporting Violations\n\nViolations of the Code of Conduct can be reported to the project team at\napollo-beijing@baidu.com. The team will determine whether the Code of Conduct\nwas violated, and will issue an appropriate sanction, possibly including a\nwritten warning or expulsion from the project, project sponsored spaces, or\nproject forums. We ask that you make a good-faith effort to resolve your\nconflict via the conflict resolution policy before submitting a report.\n\nViolations of the Code of Conduct can occur in any setting, even those unrelated\nto the project. We will only consider complaints about conduct that has occurred\nwithin one year of the report.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nIf the project team receives a report alleging a violation of the Code of\nConduct, it will notify the accused of the report, and provide them an\nopportunity to discuss the report before a sanction is issued. The team will do\nits utmost to keep the reporter anonymous. If the act is ongoing (such as\nsomeone engaging in harassment), or involves a threat to anyone's safety (e.g.\nthreats of violence), the team may issue sanctions without notice.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,\navailable at https://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4, and includes some\naspects of the\n[Geek Feminism Code of Conduct](https://geekfeminismdotorg.wordpress.com).\n"

To contribute, please agree\nwith the [Apollo individual contributor license agreement]\n(https://gist.githubusercontent.com/startcode/f5ccf8887bfc7727a0ae05bf0d601e30/raw/029a11300e987e34a29a9d247ac30caa7f6741a7/Apollo_Individual_Contributor_License_Agreement)\nfirst.\n\n### How do I start contributing\n\n- You can follow the standard\n  [Github approach](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to\n  contribute code. There is also a detailed how-to guide on _How to Create Pull\n  Request_ in both [English](docs/14_Others/%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5/how_to_create_pull_request.md) and\n  [Chinese](docs/14_Others/%E4%BB%A3%E7%A0%81%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5/how_to_create_pull_request_cn.md).\n\n- There are\n  [issues with label \"help wanted\"](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3A%22Type%3A+Help+wanted%22+)\n  that are best to help you get started.\n- If you are currently working on an issue, leave a message to let people know\n  that you are working on it.\n- Before sending in your pull request for\n  [review](https://github.com/ApolloAuto/apollo/pulls), make sure your changes\n  follow the guidelines mentioned below, namely: license, testing and coding\n  style guidelines.\n\n#### License\n\nFor each new file, please include a license at the top of the file.\n\n- C++ code License example [util.h](modules/common/util/util.h);\n\n- Python code License example\n  [process.py](modules/tools/vehicle_calibration/process.py);\n\n- Bash code License example [apollo_base.sh](scripts/apollo_base.sh);\n\n#### Testing\n\nPlease include unit tests for the contributed code to prove that your code works\ncorrectly, and make sure that your code does not break existing tests. Test\nfiles are always named to end with `_test.cc`, and the test target names in the\nBUILD file always end with `test`. Here is an example test file\n[file_test.cc](cyber/common/file_test.cc).\n\nYou can use command `bash apollo.sh test` to run all unit tests.\n\n#### Coding style\n\n- **C/C++ coding style**: Apollo adopted the\n  [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).\n  Make sure your code conforms to this style guide. You can use command\n  `bash apollo.sh lint` to check if your code has any style issue.\n\n- **Python coding style**: Apollo adopted the\n  [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).\n  You can use the [yapf](https://github.com/google/yapf) command\n  `yapf -i --style='{based_on_style: google}' foo.py` to format a file foo.py.\n\n- **Apollo best coding practice**: Please also refer to\n  [Apollo Best Coding Practice](docs/technical_tutorial/apollo_best_coding_practice.md)\n  for more coding practice disciplines.\n\n- **BUILD file coding style** : you can use command\n  `bash apollo.sh format path/to/BUILD/files` to format your BUILD files before\n  you submit.\n\n#### Documentation\n\nIf your code is not straightforward for other contributors to understand, it is\nrecommended to implement the code in a clear and efficient way, and provide\nsufficient comments and documentation. Apollo uses doxygen to help generate\nformatted API Document with command `bash apollo.sh doc generate`. To document\nyour code, please follow the guide:\n[How to document code](docs/01_Installation%20Instructions/how_to_document_code.md).\n\n#### Commit Message\n\nThe first line of commit message should be a one-line summary of the change. A\nparagraph can be added following the summary to clearly explain the details of\nthe change. If your code fixed an issue, add the issue number to your commit\nmessage. An example of a good commit message is:\n\n> Control: Replaced algorithm A with algorithm B in modules/control.\n>\n> Algorithm B is faster than A because it uses binary search. The runtime is\n> reduced from O(N) to O(log(N)).\n>\n> Fixes #1234\n\n### Before Creating Pull Request\n\nAfter you finish your code and are ready to create a Pull Request, please make\nsure your change don't break build/test/lint by running `bash apollo.sh check`,\nwhich is equivalent to a combination of `bash apollo.sh build`,\n`bash apollo.sh test` and `bash apollo.sh lint`.\n"

          "content": "##  Apollo Governance\n\nApollo is an open platform whose primary purpose is to become a vibrant autonomous driving ecosystem by providing a comprehensive, safe, secure, and reliable solution that supports all major features and functions of an autonomous vehicle.\n\nApollo's ambition is no less than to revolutionize the auto and transportation industries, and there will be challenges of unprecedented scale and complexity along the way. Given Apollo's enormous potential to change the world, this historic opportunity requires a unique governance model that must support a highly effective leadership which is as inclusive and open as possible in order to swiftly achieve Apollo's vision.\n\nIn order to safeguard the architectural integrity, system reliability, and rapid evolution of Apollo, Baidu is willing to step up and exercise its leadership in driving important decisions whenever needed while preserving active participation of the wider community.\n\n##  Apollo Manifesto\n\nIn essence, Apollo is the freedom from wasting time and resources re-implementing fundamental components and allows each member of the ecosystem to focus on their specific areas of expertise, which will dramatically increase the speed of innovation.\n\nApollo’s comprehensive, modular solution allows anyone to use as much or as little of the existing source code and data. Open source code portions can be modified and open capability components accessible through an API can be replaced with proprietary implementations. All this can then be contributed back to Apollo, redistributed, and commercialized.\n\nCritical considerations such as ensuring reliability, handling failover, and guaranteeing security that would pose a challenge to most development efforts will be readily available components. Everyone can benefit from Apollo's capabilities to improve individual competitive advantage.\n\nApollo provides high quality code and data that allows anyone to bootstrap their autonomous driving development, but only with contributions from Apollo’s partners and the wider community can Apollo become increasingly more capable. The goal is to create a virtuous cycle where software and services are deployed onto the vehicle to obtain quality data, which is then used to create an even more capable autonomous system. Accelerating this iterative cycle is the engine of innovation that will give birth to a viable autonomous vehicle and compelling services leading to a breakthrough autonomous ecosystem.\n\nApollo welcomes anyone to make technical and non-technical contributions, but the most valuable contribution is high quality data, it is the very fuel that drives innovation. Baidu will seed Apollo with its vast dataset that the community can experiment with. However, Baidu’s contribution alone is not enough to sustain Apollo’s evolution let alone realize Apollo’s grand ambition. Therefore, Apollo will create an innovative data collective that will pool high quality data from Apollo’s partners, each of whom can leverage a larger data set than it can gather individually.\n\nThis innovative platform and data service creates a lasting, mutually beneficial business model that accelerates individual innovation as well as sustains the growth of a breakthrough ecosystem. On a broader level, Apollo will engage academia, government, and the general public in order to convince and educate society on the acceptance and adoption of autonomous technology. Only by growing the ecosystem together rather than through individual efforts can the full potential of autonomous vehicles and services be realized for the benefit of all.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Manifesto is available on our website [apollo.auto](http://apollo.auto/docs/manifesto.html).\n"

Besides, the software development costs are lowered by upgrading the operating system, establishing communication with other frameworks, and reusing ecological software capabilities. Regarding safety, functional safety strategies and functional safety framework capabilities are reinforced.\n\n## Major New Features and Improvements:\n\nBetter performance and enhanced stability to comprehensively reinforce Apollo's autonomous driving capabilities\n\n- CyberRT Framework Upgrade: With industry-leading framework capabilities, low latency and low consumption, the performance is improved by 10 times, and the communication is more reliable. Apollo 10.0 features zero-copy communication, which ensures high performance and low consumption and achieves microsecond-level transmission latency. During inter-process communication, message are read and written directly on shared memory, avoiding memory copying, serialization, deserialization, and other resource-intensive operations. See [CyberRT Performance Report](docs/%E9%99%84%E5%BD%95/CyberRT%20Performance%20Report.md) for more details.\n- Comprehensive and Detailed Performance Analysis Tool: It empowers developers to create high-quality autonomous driving system applications. Five key resources including CPU, GPU, memory, graphics memory, and IO are comprehensively monitored and tracked in real time with a visual interface to identify issues immediately. Function-level analysis capabilities ensure precise localization. Intuitively analysis of resource consumption distribution at the function-level granularity helps developers conduct in-depth optimizations to improve performance. See [Cyber RT Performance Analysis Tool](docs/%E6%A1%86%E6%9E%B6%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83/CyberRT/Cyber%20RT%20Performance%20Analysis%20Tool.md) for more details.\n\nStronger capabilities, More various ecological support to significantly reduce R&D costs for both software and hardware\n\n- Pure Vision Perception Solution with Low Cost and High Ceiling: The mainstream perception paradigms of visual BEV (Bird's Eye View) object detection and occupancy network are introduced into the Apollo open-source framework, and optimizations are performed based on industry-standard models, with each paradigm surpassing the industry-standard models in performance. Deployment is also extensively optimized, and now the inference frame rate can reach 5Hz on a single Orin platform. See [The Introduction and tutorials of vision object detection and occpancy prediction model](docs/%E5%BA%94%E7%94%A8%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5/%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E8%B0%83%E8%AF%95%E6%95%99%E7%A8%8B/Apollo%E6%84%9F%E7%9F%A5%E5%AE%9E%E8%B7%B5/%E6%84%9F%E7%9F%A5%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2%E8%AE%AD%E7%BB%83/The_introduction_and_tutorials_of_vision_obejct_detection_and_occpancy_prediction_model.md) for more details.\n- Various Software Ecosystem and Accelerated Iteration Efficiency to Reduce Software Development and Deployment Costs: By integrating with the ROS ecosystem at the framework level, software reuse costs are lowered, R&D efficiency is enhanced, and more use scenarios are catered. The plugin engineering design simplifies expansion. Meanwhile, typical universal modules are ready to use at zero cost, while modules with customized capabilities can be integrated at low cost through conversion. Besides, it is more convenient and efficient to directly install and deploy multiple system versions on physical machines. Also, the deployment tool offers one-click packaging, enabling batch deployment of secondary development components. See [Cyber RT Communication with ROS](docs/%E6%A1%86%E6%9E%B6%E8%AE%BE%E8%AE%A1/%E8%BD%AF%E4%BB%B6%E6%A0%B8%E5%BF%83/CyberRT/Cyber%20RT%20Communication%20with%20ROS.md) and [Installation Guide](docs/%E5%AE%89%E8%A3%85%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97/Installation%20Guide.md) for more details.\n- Broader Hardware Ecosystem Support Offering More Options and More Suitable Scenarios to Reduce Hardware Selection Costs: An industry-leading hardware ecosystem is built through collaborations with over 32 manufacturers, supporting more than 73 devices and adding over 20 new models in our list. Particularly, the number of core devices (such as domain controllers, LiDARs, and inertial navigation systems) has doubled or tripled. We also provide a new hardware adaptation guide. All these provide a more convenient access mechanism for hardware ecosystem partners to connect with a broader market, fostering a collaborative ecosystem model.\n\nComprehensive Safety Coverage for More Stable and Reliable Autonomous Driving\n\n- Compliance with Industry Safety Standards for Autonomous Driving: Functional safety software modules are designed and implemented based on relevant standards and specifications in ISO 26262 Road vehicles – Functional safety and ISO 21448 Road vehicles – Safety of the intended functionality.\n- Comprehensive Functional Safety Strategies: These include hardware safety monitoring of sensors, computing units, chassis, vehicles, and other related components; full-link anomaly monitoring of sensor input to perception, prediction, planning, control, and chassis communication modules; runtime dependency environment anomaly monitoring, including system anomalies, resource occupancy, network, and IO; and independent capabilities for detecting collisions, traffic rule violations, and accidents.\n- Robust Functional Safety Framework: With various detection items and easy expandability, the framework offers access standards for users to customize detection items at low cost. Besides, it is highly real-time, taking less than 1ms from anomaly detection to MRC (Minimum Risk Condition) strategy implementation. Meanwhile, it boasts diverse MRC strategy capabilities, with built-in configurations such as warnings, gentle braking, and emergency braking, and suopports custom development.\n\n# Release 9.0\n\nApollo Open Source Platform 9.0 further focuses on enhancing the development and debugging experience, dedicated to provide autonomous driving developers with a unified development tool platform and easy-to-extend PnC and perception software framework interfaces. The new version reshapes the PnC and perception extension development method based on package management.
