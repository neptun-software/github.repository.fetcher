Think of it like Kubernetes for developer experience. We realize this is an ambitious goal. We can’t do it alone.\n\nTherefore, we want to create a strong community of contributors -- all working together to create the kind of delightful experience that our developers deserve.\n\nContributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given. ❤️\n\nBackstage is released under the Apache 2.0 License, and original creations contributed to this repo are accepted under the same license.\n\nIf you need help, just jump into our [Discord chatroom](https://discord.gg/backstage-687207715902193673).\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Code of Conduct](#code-of-conduct)\n- [Security Issues?](#security-issues)\n- [Accessibility](#accessibility)\n- [Get Started!](#get-started)\n- [Coding Guidelines](#coding-guidelines)\n- [Package Scripts](#package-scripts)\n- [Local configuration](#local-configuration)\n- [Creating Changesets](#creating-changesets)\n- [Developer Certificate of Origin](#developer-certificate-of-origin)\n- [API Reports](#api-reports)\n- [Submitting a Pull Request](#submitting-a-pull-request)\n- [Review Process](#review-process)\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project adheres to the [CNCF Code of Conduct][code-of-conduct]. By participating, you are expected to honor this code.\n\n[code-of-conduct]: https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n\n## Security Issues?\n\nSee [SECURITY](SECURITY.md).\n\n## Accessibility\n\nWe encourage you to catch any accessibility issues already in the development phase of new features to Backstage, see our [Accessibility documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/accessibility/) for more details.\n\n## Get Started!\n\nSo... feel ready to jump in? Let's do this. 👏🏻💯\n\n### Cloning the Repository\n\nOk. So you're gonna want some code right? Go ahead and fork the repository into your own GitHub account and clone that code to your local machine. GitHub's [Fork a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) documentation has a great step by step guide if you are not sure how to do this.\n\nIf you cloned a fork, you can add the upstream dependency like so:\n\n```bash\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:backstage/backstage\ngit pull upstream master\n```\n\nAfter you have cloned the Backstage repository, you should run the following commands once to set things up for development:\n\n```bash\ncd backstage  # change to root directory of project\n\nyarn install  # fetch dependency packages - may take a while\nyarn tsc      # does a first run of type generation and checks\n```\n\n### Serving the Example App\n\nOpen a terminal window and start the web app by using the following command from the project root. Make sure you have run the above mentioned commands first.\n\n```bash\nyarn dev\n```\n\nThis is going to start two things, the frontend (:3000) and the backend (:7007).\n\nThis should open a local instance of Backstage in your browser, otherwise open one of the URLs printed in the terminal.\n\nBy default, Backstage will start on port 3000, however you can override this by setting an environment variable `PORT` on your local machine. e.g. `export PORT=8080` then running `yarn start`. Or `PORT=8080 yarn start`.\n\nOnce successfully started, you should see the following message in your terminal window:\n\n```sh\n$ concurrently \"yarn start\" \"yarn start-backend\"\n$ yarn workspace example-app start\n$ yarn workspace example-backend start\n$ backstage-cli app:serve\n$ backstage-cli backend:dev\n[0] Loaded config from app-config.yaml\n[1] Build succeeded\n[0] ℹ ｢wds｣: Project is running at http://localhost:3000/\n[0] ℹ ｢wds｣: webpack output is served from /\n[0] ℹ ｢wds｣: Content not from webpack is served from $BACKSTAGE_DIR/packages/app/public\n[0] ℹ ｢wds｣: 404s will fallback to /index.html\n[0] ℹ ｢wdm｣: wait until bundle finished: /\n[1] 2021-02-12T20:58:17.614Z backstage info Loaded config from app-config.yaml\n```\n\nYou'll see how you get both logs for the frontend `webpack-dev-server` which serves the react app ([0]) and the backend ([1]);\n\nVisit <http://localhost:3000> and you should see the bleeding edge of Backstage ready for contributions!\n\nIf you want to get a better understanding of the layout of the repo now that you have a local copy running feel free to review the [Backstage Project Structure](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/#general-folder-structure) documentation.\n\n## Coding Guidelines\n\nAll code is formatted with `prettier` using the configuration in the repo. If possible, we recommend configuring your editor to format automatically, but you can also use the `yarn prettier --write <file>` command to format files.\n\nA consistent coding style is included via [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) with the file [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig) at the root of the repo. Depending on your editor of choice, it will either support it out of the box or you can [download a plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download) for the config to be applied.\n\nIf you're contributing to the backend or CLI tooling, be mindful of cross-platform support. [This](https://shapeshed.com/writing-cross-platform-node/) blog post is a good guide of what to keep in mind when writing cross-platform NodeJS.\n\nAlso be sure to skim through our [ADRs](docs/architecture-decisions) to see if they cover what you're working on. In particular [ADR006: Avoid React.FC and React.SFC](docs/architecture-decisions/adr006-avoid-react-fc.md) is one to look out for.\n\nIf there are any updates in `markdown` file please make sure to run `yarn run lint:docs`. Though it is checked on `lint-staged`. It is required to install [vale](https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/) separately and make sure it is accessed by global command.\n\n### Editor\n\nThe Backstage development environment does not require any specific editor, but it is intended to be used with one that has built-in linting and type-checking. The development server does not include any checks by default, but they can be enabled using the `--check` flag. Note that using the flag may consume more system resources and slow things down.\n\n## Package Scripts\n\nThere are many commands to be found in the root [package.json](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/package.json), here are some useful ones:\n\n```shell\nyarn start # Start serving the example app, use --check to include type checks and linting\n\nyarn storybook # Start local storybook, useful for working on components in @backstage/core-components\n\nyarn workspace @backstage/plugin-api-docs start # Serve api-docs plugin only, also supports --check\n\nyarn tsc # Run typecheck, use --watch for watch mode\nyarn tsc:full # Run full type checking, for example without skipLibCheck, use in CI\n\nyarn build:backend # Build the backend package, depends on tsc\nyarn build:all # Build published versions of packages, depends on tsc\nyarn build:api-reports # Build API Reports used for documentation\n\nyarn lint # Lint packages that have changed since later commit on origin/master\nyarn lint:all # Lint all packages\nyarn lint:docs # Lint all the Markdown files\nyarn lint:type-deps # Verify that @types/* dependencies are placed correctly in packages\n\nyarn test # Test packages that have changed since later commit on origin/master\nyarn test --no-watch # Test packages and include unchanged ones\nyarn test:all # Test all packages\n\nyarn clean # Remove all output folders and @backstage/cli cache\n\nyarn diff # Make sure all plugins are up to date with the latest plugin template\n\nyarn new # Create a new module\n```\n\n> See [package.json](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/package.json) for other yarn commands/options.\n\n## Local configuration\n\nBackstage allows you to specify the configuration used while running the application on your computer. Local configuration is read from `app-config.local.yaml`. This file is ignored by Git, which means that you can safely use it to reference secrets like GitHub tokens without worrying about these secrets, inadvertently ending up in the Git repository. You do not need to copy everything from the default config to the local config. The `app-config.local.yaml` file will be merged with `app-config.yaml` and overwrite the default app configs.\n\n> NOTE: If you want to add your own configuration values to access in the frontend you also need to mark those values as visible using configuration schema, either in the app or in your own plugin. For more information, see [Defining Configuration](https://backstage.io/docs/conf/defining/).\n\nYou can learn more about the local configuration in the [Static Configuration in Backstage](https://backstage.io/docs/conf/) section.\n\n## Creating Changesets\n\nWe use [changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) to help us prepare releases. They help us make sure that every package affected by a change gets a proper version number and an entry in its `CHANGELOG.md`. To make the process of generating releases easy, it helps when contributors include changesets with their pull requests.\n\n### When to use a changeset?\n\nAny time a patch, minor, or major change aligning to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) is made to any published package in `packages/` or `plugins/`, a changeset should be used. It helps to align your change to the [Backstage package versioning policy](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy#package-versioning-policy) for the package you are changing, for example, when to provide additional clarity on deprecation or impacting changes which will then be included into CHANGELOGs.\n\nIn general, changesets are only needed for changes to packages within `packages/` or `plugins/` directories, and only for the packages that are not marked as `private`. Changesets are also not needed for changes that do not affect the published version of each package, for example changes to tests or in-line source code comments.\n\nChangesets **are** needed for new packages, as that is what triggers the package to be part of the next release. They are also needed for changes to `README.md` files so that the updates are reflected on the NPM page for the changed package.\n\n### How to create a changeset\n\n1. Run `yarn changeset` from the root of the repo\n2. Select which packages you want to include a changeset for\n3. Select impact of the change you're introducing. If the package you are changing is at version `0.x`, use `minor` for breaking changes and `patch` otherwise. If the package is at `1.0.0` or higher, use `major` for breaking changes, `minor` for backwards compatible API changes, and `patch` otherwise. See the [Semantic Versioning specification](https://semver.org/#semantic-versioning-specification-semver) for more details.\n4. Explain your changes in the generated changeset. See [examples of well written changesets](#writing-changesets).\n5. Add generated changeset to Git\n6. Push the commit with your changeset to the branch associated with your PR\n7. Accept our gratitude for making the release process easier on the maintainers\n\n### Writing changesets\n\nChangesets are an important part of the development process. They are used to generate Changelog entries for all changes to the project. Ultimately, they are read by the end users to learn about important changes and fixes to the project. Some of these fixes might require manual intervention from users so it's important to write changesets that users understand and can take action on.\n\nHere are some important do's and don'ts when writing changesets:\n\n### Changeset should give a clear description to what has changed\n\n#### Bad\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/catalog': patch\n---\n\nFixed table layout\n```\n\n#### Good\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/catalog': patch\n---\n\nFixed bug in EntityTable component where table layout did not readjust properly below 1080x768 pixels.\n```\n\n### Breaking changes not caught by the type checker should be clearly marked with bold **BREAKING** text\n\n#### Bad\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/catalog': minor\n---\n\ngetEntity is now a function that returns a Promise.\n```\n\n#### Good\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/catalog': minor\n---\n\n**BREAKING** The getEntity function now returns a Promise and **must** be awaited from now on.\n```\n\n### Changes to code should include a diff of the files that need updating\n\n#### Bad\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/catalog': patch\n---\n\n**BREAKING** The catalogEngine now requires a flux capacitor to be passed.\n```\n\n#### Good\n\n````md\n---\n'@backstage/catalog': patch\n---\n\n**BREAKING** The catalog createRouter now requires that a `FluxCapacitor` is\npassed to the router.\n\nThese changes are **required** to `packages/backend/src/plugins/catalog.ts`\n\n```diff\n+ import { FluxCapacitor } from '@backstage/time';\n+ const fluxCapacitor = new FluxCapacitor();\n  return await createRouter({\n    entitiesCatalog,\n    locationAnalyzer,\n    locationService,\n+   fluxCapacitor,\n    logger: env.logger,\n    config: env.config,\n  });\n```\n````\n\n## Developer Certificate of Origin\n\nAs with other CNCF projects, Backstage has adopted a [Developers Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/). A DCO is a lightweight way for a developer to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit code or documentation to a project.\n\nTo certify the code you submit to the repository, you'll need to add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commits.\n\n`$ git commit -s -m 'Awesome commit message'`\n\nWhich will look something like the following in the repo;\n\n```\nAwesome commit message\n\nSigned-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>\n```\n\n> Note: this assumes you have setup your git name and email, if you have not you can use these commands to set that up:\n>\n> ```shell\n> git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n> git config --global user.email \"youremail@example.com\"\n> ```\n\n- In case you forgot to add it to the most recent commit, use `git commit --amend --signoff`\n- In case you forgot to add it to the last N commits in your branch, use `git rebase --signoff HEAD~N` and replace N with the number of new commits you created in your branch.\n- If you have a very deep branch with a lot of commits, run `git rebase -i --signoff $(git merge-base -a master HEAD)`, double check to make sense of the commits (keep all lines as `pick`) and save and close the editor. This should bulk sign all the commits in your PR. Do be careful though. If you have a complex flow with a lot of branching and re-merging of work branches and stuff, merge-base may not be the right solution for you.\n\nNote: If you have already pushed your branch to a remote, you might have to force push: `git push -f` after the rebase.\n\n### Using GitHub Desktop?\n\nIf you are using the GitHub Desktop client, you need to manually add the `Signed-off-by` line to the Description field on the Changes tab before committing:\n\n```text\nAwesome description (commit message)\n\nSigned-off-by: Jane Smith <jane.smith@example.com>\n```\n\nIn case you forgot to add the line to your most recent commit, you can amend the commit message from the History tab before pushing your branch (GitHub Desktop 2.9 or later).\n\n### Using VS Code?\n\nIf you are using VS Code you can enable always signing your commits by setting the following in your `settings.json` file:\n\n```json\n\"git.alwaysSignOff\": true,\n```\n\nOr from the Settings UI look for the \"Git: Always Sign Off\" setting and check the \"Controls the signoff flag for all commits\" box.\n\n## API Reports\n\nBackstage uses [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) and TSDoc comments to generate API Reports in Markdown format. These reports are what drive the [API Reference documentation](https://backstage.io/docs/reference/). What this means is that if you are making changes to the API or adding a new plugin then you will need either generate a new API Report or update an existing API Report. If you don't do this the CI build will fail when you create your Pull Request.\n\nThere are two ways you can do this:\n\n1. You can run `yarn build:api-reports` from the root of the project and it will go through all of the existing API Reports and update them or create new ones as needed. This may take a while but is generally the best method if you are new to this.\n2. You can run `yarn build:api-reports plugins/<your-plugin-with-changes>` from the root and it will update the existing API Report or create a new one.\n\n> Note: the above commands assume you've run `yarn install` beforehand or recently.\n\nEach plugin/package has its own API Report which means you might see more than one file updated or created depending on your changes. These changes will then need to be committed as well.\n\n## Submitting a Pull Request\n\nWhen you've got your contribution working, tested, and committed to your branch it's time to create a Pull Request (PR). If you are unsure how to do this GitHub's [Creating a pull request from a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) documentation will help you with that. Once you create your PR you will be presented with a template in the PR's description that looks like this:\n\n```md\n## Hey, I just made a Pull Request!\n\n<!-- Please describe what you added, and add a screenshot if possible.\n     That makes it easier to understand the change so we can :shipit: faster. -->\n\n#### :heavy_check_mark: Checklist\n\n<!--- Please include the following in your Pull Request when applicable: -->\n\n- [ ] A changeset describing the change and affected packages. ([more info](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-changesets))\n- [ ] Added or updated documentation\n- [ ] Tests for new functionality and regression tests for bug fixes\n- [ ] Screenshots attached (for UI changes)\n- [ ] All your commits have a `Signed-off-by` line in the message. ([more info](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-certificate-of-origin))\n```\n\nFrom here all you need to do is fill in the information as requested by the template. Please do not remove this as it helps both you and the reviewers confirm that the various tasks have been completed.\n\nHere are some examples of good PR descriptions:\n\n- <https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/19473>\n- <https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/19623>\n- <https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/15881>\n- <https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/16401>\n\n## Review Process\n\nOnce you've submitted a Pull Request (PR) the various bots will come out and do their work:\n\n- assigning reviewers from the various areas impacted by changes in your PR\n- adding labels to help make reviewing PRs easier\n- checking for missing changesets or confirming them\n- checking for commits for their DCO (Developer Certificate of Origin)\n- kick of the various CI builds\n\nOnce these steps are completed, it's just a matter of being patient. As the reviewers have time, they will begin reviewing your PR. When the review process begins, there may be a few layers to this, but the general rule is that you need approval from one of the core maintainers and one from the specific area impacted by your PR. You may also have someone from the community review your changes. This can really help speed things up as they may catch some early items making the review for the maintainers simpler. Once you have the two (2) approvals, it's ready to be merged, a task that is also performed by the maintainers.\n\n### Review Tips\n\nHere are a few things that can help as you go through the review process:\n\n- You'll want to make sure all the automated checks are passing as generally the PR won't get a review if something like the CI build is failing\n- PRs get automatically assigned so you don't need to ping people, they will be notified and have a process of their own for this\n- If you are waiting for a review or mid-review and your PR goes stale one of the easiest ways to clear the stale bot is by simply rebasing your PR\n- There are times where you might run into conflict with the `yarn.lock` during a rebase, to help with that make sure your `master` branch is up to date and then in your branch run `git checkout master yarn.lock` and then run `yarn install`, this will get you a conflict free `yarn.lock` file you can commit\n- If Vale finds issues with your documentation but it's a code reference you can fix it by putting backticks (`) around it. Now if it is a special word or maybe a name there are two ways you can fix that by adding it to the list of accepted words in the [accept.txt file](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/blob/master/.github/vale/config/vocabularies/Backstage/accept.txt) and them committing that change\n\n### Merging to Master\n\nFor those contributors who have earned write access to the repository, when a pull request is approved, in general we prefer the author of the PR to perform the merge themselves. This allows them to own accountability for the change and they likely know best how or when to address pending fixes or additional follow-ups. In this way, we all help contribute to the project's successful outcomes.\n"

          "content": "# Introduction\n\nThis file provides pointers for reviewing pull requests. While the main audience are reviewers, this can also be useful if you are contributing to this repository.\n\n## Code Style\n\nSee our code style documented at [STYLE.md](./STYLE.md).\n\nIn particular when it comes to naming, make sure that naming follows established conventions within the project and/or package.\n\nWhen adding new dependencies to packages it is always preferred to use version ranges that are already in use by other packages in the repository. This helps minimize lockfile changes and reduce package duplication, both in our repository as well as other Backstage installations.\n\n## Secure Coding Practices\n\nBe sure to familiarize yourself with our [secure coding practices](./SECURITY.md#coding-practices).\n\n## Release & Versioning Policy\n\nWhen reviewing pull requests it's important to consider our [versioning policy and release cycle](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy). Generally the most important bit is our [package versioning policy](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy#package-versioning-policy), which describes when and how we can ship breaking changes. We'll dive into how to identify breaking changes in a different section.\n\nOne other thing to keep in mind, especially when merging pull requests, is where in the release cycle we're currently at. In particular you want to avoid merging any large or risky changes towards the end of each release cycle. If there is a change that is ready to be merged, but you want to hold off until the next main line release, then you can label it with the `merge-after-release` label.\n\n## Configuration\n\nPull requests that have [configuration related](https://backstage.io/docs/conf/defining) changes or additions need some extra consideration.\n\n- Every configuration field consumed by code should have a corresponding `config.d.ts` declaration.\n- Carefully consider the `@visibility` of configuration fields in the schema. The default is `backend`. Take extra care that sensitive/secret fields are marked as `@visibility secret` so that they don't accidentally leak. Also ensure that fields that the frontend wants to consume are marked as `@visibility frontend`, otherwise they can't be sent to the browser at all.\n- Check that the `config.d.ts` is mentioned in the consuming package's `package.json` as illustrated [in the docs](https://backstage.io/docs/conf/defining). Otherwise it won't get packaged and picked up by the runtime.\n\n## Changesets\n\nWe use changesets to track changes in all published packages. Changesets both define what should go into the changelog of each package, but also what kind of version bump should be done for the next release.\nAn introduction to changesets can be found in our [contribution guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md#creating-changesets).\n\nWhen reviewing a changeset, the most important things to look for are the bump levels, i.e. `major` / `minor` / `patch`, as well as whether the content is accurate and if it's written in a way that makes sense when reading it in the changelog for each package.\n\n### Reviewing Changeset Bump Levels\n\nThe following table provides a reference for what type of version bump is needed for each package. This is applied separately to each individual package, it does not matter what the scope of a change is in any other broader context.\n\n| Scope           | Current Package Version | Bump Level |\n| --------------- | ----------------------- | ---------- |\n| Breaking Change | `1.0` and above         | `major`    |\n| New Feature     | `1.0` and above         | `minor`    |\n| Fix             | `1.0` and above         | `patch`    |\n| Breaking Change | `0.x`                   | `minor`    |\n| New Feature     | `0.x`                   | `patch`    |\n| Fix             | `0.x`                   | `patch`    |\n\nThe only situation where a package that is currently at `0.x` can have a `major` bump is if all owners and stakeholders of the package agree that the package is ready to be released as `1.0`.\n\n### Reviewing Changeset Content\n\nEach changeset should be written in a way that describes the impact of the change for the users of each package. The contents of the changesets will end up in the changelog of each package, for example [@backstage/core-plugin-api](./packages/core-plugin-api/CHANGELOG.md). The changelogs are intended to provide both a summary of the new features as well as guidance in the case of breaking changes or deprecations.\n\nSome things that changeset should NOT contain are:\n\n- Internal architecture details - these are generally not interesting to users, focus on the impact towards users of the package instead.\n- Information related to a different package.\n- A large amount of content, consider for example a separate migration guide instead, either in the package README or [./docs/](./docs/), and then link to that instead.\n- Documentation - changesets can describe new features, but it should not be relied on for documenting them. Documentation should either be placed in [TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org) comments, package README, or [./docs/](./docs/).\n- Diffs of internal code, for example mirroring what the pull request changes _inside_ a plugin rather than public surfaces. This is not of interest to the reader of a package changelog. Sometimes, however, a small and concise diff can be used in a changeset to illustrate changes that the user will have to make in _their own_ Backstage installation as part of an upgrade, specifically when breaking changes are made to a package.\n\n### When is a changeset needed?\n\nIn general our changeset feedback bot will take care of informing whether a changeset is needed or not, but there are some edge cases. Whether a changeset is needed depends mostly on what files have been changed, but sometimes also on the kind of change that has been made.\n\nChanges that do NOT need a new changeset:\n\n- Changes to any test, storybook, or other local development files, for example, `MyComponent.test.tsx`, `MyComponent.stories.tsx`, `**mocks**/MyMock.ts`, `.eslintrc.js`, `setupTests.ts`, or `report.api.md`. Explained differently, it is only files that affect the published package that need changesets, such as source files and additional resources like `package.json`, `README.md`, `config.d.ts`, etc.\n- When tweaking a change that has not yet been released, you can rely on and potentially modify the existing changeset instead.\n- Changes that do not belong to a published packages, either because it's not a package at all, such as `docs/`, or because the package is private, such as `packages/app`.\n- Changes that do not end up having an effect on the published package, such as whitespace fixes or code formatting changes. Although it's also fine to have a short changeset for these kind of changes too.\n\n### Changeset Example\n\nConsider the following scenario for a changeset:\n\nA new `EntityList` component has been added to `plugins/catalog-react`.\n\nBelow are examples of a good and three bad changesets for that change.\n\n**GOOD**\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/plugin-catalog-react': minor\n---\n\nAdded a new `EntityList` component that can be used to display detailed information about a list of entities.\n```\n\nThe `@backstage/plugin-catalog-react` package has reached version `1.x`, which means that feature additions that aren't breaking should be a `minor` change. We don't bother with too much documentation, keeping it short and sweet. The main purpose is to inform users that this new component exists and to give them an idea of how they can use it.\n\n**BAD**\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/plugin-catalog-react': minor\n'@backstage/plugin-catalog': minor\n---\n\nAdded `EntityList` component.\n\nFixed a bug in the catalog index page.\n```\n\nThis changeset is too short, it's best to give users an idea of how they can benefit from the new addition.\n\nIt also includes changes affecting both the Catalog and Catalog React library. It should be split into two separate changesets for each of the two packages, otherwise we'll end up with redundant and unrelated information in both changelogs.\n\n**BAD**\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/plugin-catalog-react': major\n---\n\nAdded a new `EntityList` component that can be used to display detailed information about a list of entities. The component looks like this:\n\n![EntityList screenshot](./docs/assets/headline.png)\n\nIt accepts the following properties:\n\n- entities - The entities that should be listed.\n- title - An optional formatting function for the list titles.\n- dialog - An optional component that overrides the default details dialog.\n```\n\nThis changeset is getting too detailed. It's not always bad to get this much into the weeds, but keep in mind that changesets are not easy to browse when searching for information about specific APIs. It's better to document things like this separately and keep the changeset more lean. Also avoid linking to assets in changesets, keep them text-only.\n\nThe change is also marked as a breaking `major` change. This should be changed to `minor` since adding new APIs is never a breaking change.\n\n**BAD**\n\n```md\n---\n'@backstage/plugin-catalog-react': patch\n---\n\nAdded a new `EntityList` component that can be used to display detailed information about a list of entities. The `ListView` component was also refactored in order to make it possible to reuse it between the new `EntityList` and `KindList` components.\n```\n\nAssuming that the `ListView` component is not public API, this changeset goes into details that are not interesting to the user of the package. Internal changes do not need to be highlighted in changesets. If an internal refactor is the only change then it's alright to say something short like \"Internal refactor to improve code reuse\", but otherwise those details should be left out.\n\nThe `@backstage/plugin-catalog-react` package has also reached `1.x`, which means that new features should be introduced through a `minor` bump. We'd only use `patch` bumps for minor changes or fixes that do not affect the public API.\n\n## Breaking Changes\n\nIdentifying breaking changes can be quite tricky. You need to look at the changes from both the point of view of consumers and producers of APIs, as well as behavioral changes. In this section we explore a couple of methods for identifying whether a change is breaking or not.\n\n### Behavioral Changes\n\nThese are changes where the behavior of the code changes, but the public API is unchanged or doesn't have any breaking changes. They can be anything from tiny tweaks, like adding a bit of padding to a visual element, to a complete redesign and refactor of an entire plugin.\n\nIt's hard to set up exact rules for when a behavioral change is breaking or not. In some cases it's obvious, for example if you remove important functionality of a system, while in other cases it can be very hard to tell. In the end what's important is whether a significant number of users of the package will be negatively impacted by the change. One question that you can ask yourself here is \"is it likely that there are users that don't want the new behavior, or will need to change their code to adapt to the new behavior?\" If the answer is yes, then it's likely a breaking change. You do also want to keep [xkcd.com/1172](https://xkcd.com/1172/) in mind though.\n\nNote that even a bug fix can be considered a breaking change in some situations. One thing to lean on in that case is what the _documented_ behavior is. If the current behavior does not match the documented behavior, then a change to match the documentation is generally not a breaking change. That is unless it is likely that there are a significant number of users that will be impacted by the change.\n\nFor tricky behavioral changes you may simply need to let end users provide feedback. This can be done either by hiding the new behavior behind an experimental feature switch, or by releasing the change early on in the release cycle, preferably in the first or second `next`-line release. Be ready to respond to feedback and potentially revert the change if needed.\n\n### Public API Changes\n\nTypescript is a huge help when it comes to identifying breaking changes, as well as the API Reports that we generate for all packages. Most of the time it is enough to only look at the API Reports to determine whether a change is breaking or not. If you determine that a change is breaking at the TypeScript level, then it is a breaking change.\n\nIn this section we will be talking about changed \"types\", but by that we mean any kind of exported symbol from packages, such as TypeScript types aliases or interfaces, functions, classes, constants, etc.\n\n#### API Reports\n\nWe generate API Reports using the [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/) tool. These reports are generated for most packages in the Backstage repository, and are stored in the `report.api.md` file of each package. For CLI package we use custom tooling, and instead store the result in `cli-report.md`. Whenever the public API of a package changes, the API Report needs to be updated to reflect the new state of the API. Our CI checks will fail if the API reports are not up to date in a pull request.\n\nEach API report contains a list of all the exported types of each package. As long as the API report does not have any warnings it will contain the full publicly facing API of the package, meaning you do not need to consider any other changes to the package from the point of view of TypeScript API stability.\n\nExported types can be marked with either `@public`, `@alpha` or `@beta` release tags. It is only the `@public` exports that we consider to be part of the stable API. The `@alpha` and `@beta` exports are considered unstable and can be changed at any time without needing a breaking package versions bump.\n\n#### Changes that are Not Considered Breaking\n\nThere are a few exceptions that are not considered breaking in the [versioning policy](https://backstage.io/docs/overview/versioning-policy#changes-that-are-not-considered-breaking),\nprimarily regarding Utility APIs and Backend Service interfaces (referred to \"contracts\" below) that are supplied by the\nBackstage core packages.\n\nExample of a non-breaking change to a contract which has a default\nimplementation, since consumers typically only interact with that contract as\ncallers of existing methods:\n\n```diff\n export interface MyService {\n   oldMethod(): void;\n+  newMethod(): void;\n }\n```\n\nChanges such as these must still be marked with `**BREAKING PRODUCERS**:` in the\nchangelog, to highlight them for those who might be implementing custom\nimplementations of those contracts or putting mocks of the contract in tests.\n\nExample of a breaking change to a contract, which affects existing consumers and\ntherefore makes it NOT fall under these exceptions:\n\n```diff\n export interface MyService {\n-   oldMethod(): void;\n+   oldMethod(): Promise<void>;\n }\n```\n\n#### Type Contract Direction\n\nAn important distinction to make when looking at changes to an API Report is the direction of the contract of a changed type, that is, whether it's used as input or output from the user's point of view. In the next two sections we'll dive into the different directions of a type contract, and how it affects whether a change is breaking or not.\n\n#### Input Types\n\nAn input type is one where a value needs to be provided by users of the package. The most common form of input type are function, constructor, and method parameters.\n\nThe following is an example where `MyComponentProps` is an input type:\n\n```ts\ntype MyComponentProps = {\n  title: string;\n  size?: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';\n};\n\nfunction MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps): JSX.Element;\n```\n\nAnd from the package user's point of view it would look something like this:\n\n```tsx\n<MyComponent title=\"Hello World\" size=\"medium\" />\n```\n\nWhen modifying an input type, any change that increases constraints are breaking. For example, if we made the `size` prop required, that would be a breaking change. Likewise, if we changed the type of `size` to `'small' | 'large'`, that would also be breaking.\n\nOn the other hand, it's fine to relax constraints without it being a breaking change. For example, if we made the `title` prop optional, that would not be breaking. Likewise, if we changed the type of `size` to `'small' | 'medium' | 'large' | 'huge'`, that would not be breaking either. It is also possible to add new properties without it being a breaking change, as long as they are optional.\n\nThere's an edge-case where completely removing a property is also considered a breaking change. That's because of TypeScript being strict and refusing unknown properties, rather than a runtime breaking change. It is typically an easy thing for consumers to fix though.\n\nAnother way to think about the rules for evolving input types is that the old type must be assignable to the new type. In this case for example `_props: NewComponentProps = {} as OldComponentProps`. It's not a silver bullet though, because of edge-cases like the one mentioned above.\n\n#### Output Types\n\nAn output type is one that the user receives from the packages. One of the most obvious examples here are the top-level exports from the package itself, but it also includes for example function return types.\n\nThe following is an example where both `useBox` and `Box` are output types:\n\n```ts\ntype Box = {\n  title: string;\n  shape?: 'square' | 'rounded';\n};\n\nfunction useBox(): Box;\n```\n\nAnd from the consumer's point of view it would look something like this:\n\n```ts\nconst { title, shape } = useBox();\n```\n\nWhen modifying an output type, any change that reduces constraints are breaking. For example, if we made the `title` property optional, that would be a breaking change, or if we changed the type of `shape` to `'square' | 'rounded' | 'octagon'`.\n\nAdding new properties is not a breaking change, regardless of whether they are optional or not. Removing properties is on the other hand always breaking.\n\nIt is generally fine to increase constraints without it being a breaking change. For example, if we made the `shape` property required, that would not be breaking.\n\nThere are some edge-cases though, for example if `shape` was changed to just `'square'`, that would be a breaking change because consumers might be checking for `box.shape === 'rounded'`, which would then be breaking. It's typically a quite easy thing for consumers to fix though. More generally, type unions and discriminated unions are quite troublesome in output types, as both adding and removing types from them are considered breaking changes.\n\nAnother way to think about the rules for evolving output types is that the new type must be assignable to the old type. In this case for example `_box: OldBox = {} as NewBox`. It's not a silver bullet though, because of edge-cases like the one mentioned above.\n\n#### I/O Types\n\nSome types are considered both input and output types. For example, consider the following example:\n\n```ts\ntype Point = {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n};\n\nfunction trimCoords(point: Point): Point;\n```\n\nIn this case `Point` is both an input and output type. This means that the only changes we can make to the type that aren't breaking are the intersection of allowed changes between input and output types. In practice this only allows for the addition of new optional properties. Because of this constraint it is generally best to avoid using I/O types, and keep the input separated from the output.\n\nThere are some cases where I/O types favor either input or output when it comes to API stability. For example, all types used by Utility APIs are I/O types, but the stability of the output is a lot more important than the stability of the input. That is because it's a lot easier for the single producer of the input interface to adapt to changes compared to all consumers of the API that use it as an output type.\n\n#### Identifying the Contract Direction\n\nThe only way to identify the contract direction of a type is to look at the context in which it's being used. In particular this can be tricky when looking at individual type aliases and interfaces, as you need to look at the rest of the package exports to see how the type is being used.\n\nOne important rule is that the context considered for any type is limited to only the package in which the type is declared. Just because a type is imported in a different package and used as an input type does not make it an input type.\n\nThe following rules can be used to identify the direction of a type alias or interface:\n\n- If the type is used in an input context, for example function parameter, then it's an input type.\n- If the type is used in an output context, for example function return type, then it's an output type.\n- If the type is referenced by another type, then it inherits the direction of that type, except if referenced through a function callback, in which case the direction is reversed.\n- If the type is used or inherits both input and output contexts, then it's an I/O type.\n- If the type is not referenced anywhere else, then it's an I/O type.\n\nBelow is an example of the public API of a package, with type directions assigned to each export:\n\n```ts\n// I/O, used by getPoint as return type and referenced by BoxProps, an input type\ninterface Point {\n  x: number;\n  y: number;\n}\n\n// Output, since it's an exported function\nfunction getPoint(): Point;\n\n// Input, used by Box as parameter type\ninterface BoxProps {\n  point?: Point\n}\n\n// Output, since it's an exported function\nfunction Box(props: BoxProps): JSX.Element;\n\n// Output, used by createWidget as return type\ninterface Widget {\n  ...\n}\n\n// Output, as it's referenced by WidgetOptions, which is an input\n// type, but the render callback causes a direction reversal\ninterface WidgetProps {\n  ...\n}\n\n// Input, just like WidgetProps this is due to the direction reversal\n// caused by the render callback\ntype RenderedWidget = JSX.Element | null;\n\n// Input, used by createWidget parameter type\ninterface WidgetOptions {\n  render(props: WidgetProps): RenderedWidget;\n}\n\n// Output, since it's an exported function\nfunction createWidget(options: WidgetOptions): Widget;\n\n// I/O, since it's not referenced anywhere else\ntype LabelStyle = 'normal' | 'thin';\n\n// Output, since it's an exported constant\nconst LABEL_SIZE: number;\n```\n\n## Plugin Directory Submissions\n\nWhen reviewing Plugin Directory submissions please consider the following:\n\n- Check to make sure they have the rights for any icon being used. This is mostly for clearly copyrighted logos, for example the Microsoft Azure DevOps logo\n- Make sure the package has been published on the NPM registry.\n- Make sure the package on NPM has a link back to the code repo, this helps provide confidence that it's the right package.\n- If they use an [NPM scope](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-scopes) make sure it that matches either the Organization name or user name, this provides trust in the plugin\n- If the plugin has both a frontend and backend make sure that the documentation notes that.\n"

Create a [new draft security advisory](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/security/advisories/new). The values and descriptions don't need to be perfect to begin with as they can be edited later. For severity, use the \"Assess severity using CVSS\" and refer to [the guide](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide) for help.\n2. Request a CVE identification number. It can take up to 72h for one to be assigned so be sure to do this early on.\n3. If there is not already a patch for the vulnerability, collaborate on one in a private fork:\n   1. Head to the security advisory on GitHub and [create a private fork](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/collaborating-in-a-temporary-private-fork-to-resolve-a-security-vulnerability)\n   1. [Invite any collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/adding-a-collaborator-to-a-security-advisory) from outside the maintainer team that should be part of creating a fix.\n   1. Create one or multiple Pull Requests with fixes towards the fork. Note that these PRs will not have CI checks run on them, so more care should be taken to run local validation. The PRs are also not merged like normal PRs, but are instead merged straight into the main repo all at once when the merge button is hit on the security advisory.\n4. Once the fix is ready in a PR or private fork and it is time to release it, there are a couple of options. Either merge into the main branch with a changeset and wait for a regular release, or do a quick release by manually bumping the version in `package.json` of the affected package, along with a manual `CHANGELOG.md` entry. Note that a quick release will only work if the package does not have any other pending changes that depend on pending changes in other packages, so be sure to manually check that first, and fall back to an early regular release if needed. In general it's best to stick with the regular release flow, with the quick release being used only for time sensitive fixes.\n5. Finalize and publish the security advisory. Note that once you hit the publish button it's no longer possible to edit the advisory. Just like the CVE number this can take up to 72h, and expect it to be slower than the CVE number request.\n\n## Vulnerability Policies\n\nBackstage uses Snyk vulnerability scans in order to make sure we minimize vulnerabilities in our dependencies and get notified of new vulnerabilities.\n\nThere are many situations where a vulnerability does not affect a particular dependency because of how the vulnerable package is used. In that situation the package authors may choose to stay at the current version rather than bumping the dependency, leading to a warning in the vulnerability scans but no actual vulnerability.\n\nTo work around this and other similar issues, Snyk provides a method to ignore vulnerabilities. In order to provide the best visibility and most utility to adopters of Backstage, we store these ignore rules in `.snyk` policy files. This allows adopters to rely on our ignore policies if they wish to do so.\n\nAdding a new ignore policy is done by creating or modifying an existing `.snyk` file within a package root. See the [Snyk Documentation](https://support.snyk.io/hc/en-us/articles/360007487097-The-snyk-file) for details on the syntax. Always include a description, full path, and time limit of the ignore policy.\n\n## Coding Practices\n\nIn this section we highlight patterns where particular care needs to be taken in order to avoid security vulnerabilities, as well as the best practices to follow.\n\n### Local file path resolution\n\nA common pitfall in backend packages is to resolve local file paths based on user input, without sufficiently protecting against input that traverses outside the intended directory.\n\nFor example, consider the following code:\n\n```ts\n// WARNING: DO NOT DO THIS\n\nimport { join } from 'path';\nimport fs from 'fs-extra';\n\nfunction writeTemporaryFile(tmpDir: string, name: string, content: string) {\n  const filePath = join(tmpDir, name);\n  await fs.writeFile(filePath, content);\n}\n```\n\nIf the `name` of the file is controlled by the user, they can for example enter `../../../../etc/hosts` as the name of the file. This can lead to a file being written outside the intended directory, which in turn can be used to inject malicious code or other form of attacks.\n\nThe recommended solution to this is to use `resolveSafeChildPath` from `@backstage/backend-plugin-api` to resolve the file path instead. It makes sure that the resolved path does not fall outside the provided directory. If you simply want to validate whether a file path is safe, you can use `isChildPath` instead.\n\nThe insecure example above should instead be written like this:\n\n```ts\n// THIS IS GOOD, DO THIS\n\nimport { resolveSafeChildPath } from '@backstage/backend-plugin-api';\nimport fs from 'fs-extra';\n\nfunction writeTemporaryFile(tmpDir: string, name: string, content: string) {\n  const filePath = resolveSafeChildPath(tmpDir, name);\n  await fs.writeFile(filePath, content);\n}\n```\n\n### Express responses\n\nWhen returning a response from an Express route, always use `.json(...)` or `.end()` without any arguments. This ensures that the response can not be interpreted as an HTML document with embedded JavaScript by the browser. Never use `.send(...)` unless you want to send other forms of content, and be sure to always set an explicit content type. If you need to return HTML or other content that may be executed by the browser, be very careful how you handle user input.\n\nIf you want to return an error response, simply throw the error or pass it on to the `next(...)` callback. There is a middleware installed that will transform the error into a JSON response. Many of the common HTTP errors are available from `@backstage/errors`, for example `NotFoundError`, which will also set the correct status code.\n\nThe following example show how to return an error that contains user input:\n\n```ts\nres.send(`Invalid id: '${req.params.id}'`); // BAD\n\n// import { InputError } from '@backstage/errors';\nthrow new InputError(`Invalid id: '${req.params.id}'`); // GOOD\n\n// OR, in case a custom response is needed\nres.json({ message: `Invalid id: '${req.params.id}'` }); // NOT BAD\n```\n\nNo matter how trivial it may seem, always use `.json(...)`. It reduces the risk that a future refactoring introduces vulnerabilities:\n\n```ts\nres.send({ ok: true }); // BAD\n\nres.json({ ok: true }); // GOOD\n```\n\nIf you absolutely must return a string with `.send(...)`, use an explicit and secure `Content-Type`:\n\n```ts\nres.send(`message=${message}`); // BAD\n\nres.contentType('text/plain').send(`message=${message}`); // GOOD\n```\n\nAn example of how to return dynamic HTML is not provided here. If you need to do so, proceed with extreme caution and be very sure that you know what you are doing.\n"

          "content": "# Introduction\n\nThis file describes the various style and design conventions that are used in the Backstage main repository. While you may choose to use these conventions in your own Backstage projects, it is not required.\n\n# TypeScript Coding Conventions\n\nOur TypeScript style is inspired by the [style guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines) of the TypeScript implementation itself.\n\n## Naming\n\n1. Use PascalCase for type names.\n1. Do not use `I` as a prefix for interface names.\n1. Use PascalCase for `enum` values.\n1. Use `camelCase` for function names.\n1. Use `camelCase` for property names and local variables.\n1. Do not use `_` as a prefix for private properties.\n1. Use whole words in names when possible.\n1. Give type parameters names prefixed with `T`, for example `Request<TBody>`.\n\n## Syntax and Types\n\n1. Use `undefined`. Do not use `null`.\n1. Prefer `for..of` over `.forEach`.\n1. Do not introduce new types/values to the global namespace.\n\n## File and Export Structure\n\n1. Shared types should be defined in `types.ts`.\n1. Keep `index.ts` free from implementation, it should only contain re-exports.\n1. If a file has a single or a main export, name the file after the export.\n\n## Error Handling\n\n1. Rely on `@backstage/errors` for custom error types.\n   ```ts\n   throw new NotFoundError(`Could not find resource with id '${id}'`);\n   ```\n1. Check error types by comparing the name\n   ```ts\n   if (error.name === 'NotFoundError') {\n     // ...\n   }\n   ```\n1. Use `ResponseError` to convert `fetch` error responses.\n   ```ts\n   if (!res.ok) {\n     throw await ResponseError.fromResponse(res);\n   }\n   ```\n\n## API Design\n\nThis section describes guidelines for designing public APIs. It can also be applied to internal implementations, but it is less necessary.\n\n1. Keep [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) principles in mind.\n1. Be mindful of the number of top-level exports of each package, strive to keep it low.\n1. Prioritize consistency over correctness, stick to existing patterns within the same class/file/folder/package.\n1. Consume interfaces rather than concrete implementations.\n1. Prefer classes for encapsulating functionality and implementing interfaces.\n1. Suffix the name of concrete implementations with the name of the implemented interface. Use a prefix that describes the behavior of the implementation, or use a `Default` prefix.\n\n   ```ts\n   interface ImageLoader { ... } // interface for loading images\n\n   class DefaultImageLoader implements ImageLoader { /* loads an image */ }\n   class CachingImageLoader implements ImageLoader { /* caches loaded images */ }\n   class ResizingImageLoader implements ImageLoader { /* resizes loaded images */ }\n   ```\n\n1. Keep constructors private, prefer static factory methods for creating instances.\n\n   ```ts\n   class DefaultImageLoader implements ImageLoader {\n     // Use `create` for the main way to create an instance.\n     static create(options?: ImageLoaderOptions) {\n       /* ... */\n     }\n\n     // If there are multiple different types of instances that can be\n     // created, suffix the create method.\n     static createWithCaching(options?: ImageLoaderOptions) {\n       /* ... */\n     }\n\n     // If the instantiation process is based on a specific value, use `from*`.\n     // The most common example of this is reading from configuration.\n     // Use a second parameter in case additional options are needed.\n     static fromConfig(config: Config, deps: { logger: Logger }) {\n       /* ... */\n     }\n\n     // Other types of values can work too\n     static fromUrl(url: URL) {\n       /* ... */\n     }\n\n     // In order to make a private constructor available for testing you can use a\n     // static factory marked as `@internal`, which will not show up in the public API.\n     /** @internal */\n     static forTesting(internalOptions?: { ... }) {\n       return new DefaultImageLoader(internalOptions);\n     }\n\n     private constructor(/* ... */) {\n       /* ... */\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n1. Prefer common prefixes over suffixes when naming constants.\n\n   ```ts\n   // May be tempting to use `GITHUB_WIDGET_LABEL` instead.\n   const WIDGET_LABEL_GITHUB = 'github';\n   const WIDGET_LABEL_GITLAB = 'gitlab';\n   const WIDGET_LABEL_BITBUCKET = 'bitbucket';\n   ```\n\n1. When a type relates directly to other symbols, use the name of those as prefix for the type.\n\n   ```ts\n   // Always prefix a prop type with the name of the component.\n   function MyComponent(props: MyComponentProps) {}\n\n   // Option types should be prefixed with the name of the operation.\n   function upgradeWidget(options: UpgradeWidgetOptions) {}\n   function activateWidget(options: ActivateWidgetOptions) {}\n\n   // An exception to this are create methods, where the name of the thing\n   // being created may be used as the prefix instead.\n   function createWidget(options: WidgetOptions) {}\n\n   // In this case the related names for request types are `ReportsApi` and\n   // the method name. If there is a low risk of conflict we can keep them\n   // short by only prefixing with the method name, but if there is a higher\n   // risk of conflict then we would want to use the full prefix instead, while\n   // omitting redundant parts, i.e. `ReportsApiUploadRequest.\n   interface ReportsApi {\n     uploadReports(request: UploadReportsRequest): Promise<void>;\n     deleteReport(request: DeleteReportRequest): Promise<void>;\n   }\n   ```\n\n1. When there is a significant number of arguments to a function or method, prefer to use a single options object as the argument, rather than many positional arguments.\n\n   ```ts\n   // Bad\n   function createWidget(id: string, name: string, width: number) {}\n\n   // Good\n   function createWidget(options: CreateWidgetOptions) {}\n   ```\n\n1. Avoid arrays as return types; prefer response objects.\n\n   ```ts\n   interface UserApi {\n     // Bad\n     // Can only return Users without signaling additional information such as pagination.\n     listUsers(): Promise<User[]>;\n\n     // Good\n     // Easy to evolve with additional fields.\n     listUsers(): Promise<ListUsersResponse>;\n   }\n   ```\n\n# Documentation Guidelines\n\nWe use [API Extractor](https://api-extractor.com/pages/overview/demo_docs/) to generate our documentation, which in turn uses [TSDoc](https://github.com/microsoft/tsdoc) to parse our doc comments.\n\nThe doc comments are of the good old `/** ... */` format, with tags of the format `@<tag>` used to mark various things. The [TSDoc website](https://tsdoc.org/) has a good index of all available tags.\n\nThere are a few things to pay attention to, in order to make the documentation show up in a nice way on the website...\n\n## Declare exported functions using the `function` keyword\n\nAPI documenter will not recognize arrow functions as functions, but rather as a constant that shows up in the list of exported variables. By declaring functions using the `function` keyword, they will show up in the list of functions. They will also get a much nicer documentation page for the individual function that shows information about parameters and return types.\n\nThis also extends to React components, since API documenter doesn't have any special handling of those. By always defining exported React components using the `function` keyword, we make them show up among the list of functions in the API reference, where they are then easily discoverable through the `(props)` argument (which you should be sure to include!).\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4984472/133120461-59d74c3e-ebd9-44f9-900d-cc30f54a3cd2.png)\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Properties for {@link ErrorPanel}.\n */\nexport interface ErrorPanelProps {\n  ...\n}\n\n/**\n * Renders a warning panel as the effect of an error.\n */\nexport function ErrorPanel(props: ErrorPanelProps) {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Do not destruct parameters in public function declarations\n\nIf the parameters of a function are destructed in the parameter list, they will show up in the documentation like this:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4984472/133117011-3e6cb6da-40dd-450e-8d33-51bdcf412e08.png)\n\nInstead prefer to use a single parameter variable and then move the destructuring into the function body, which will look much nicer:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4984472/133120542-d648de43-5495-43a8-b532-f5e6f6ab736e.png)\n\nAlso be sure to check that the type used by the parameter is exported, as it otherwise won't be discoverable through documentation.\n\n## Use `@remarks` to split long descriptions\n\nThe API reference has an index of exported symbols for each package, which uses a short description, while clicking through to the page for a symbol shows the full description. By default all descriptions are considered \"short\", and you have to manually add a divider where the description should be cut off using the `@remarks` tag.\n\n```ts\n/**\n * This function helps you create a thing.\n *\n * @remarks\n *\n * Here is a much longer and more elaborate description of how the\n * creation of a thing works, which is way too long to fit on the index page.\n */\nfunction createTheThing() {}\n```\n\n## Use `@param` to document parameters\n\nWhen using the `@param` tag to document a parameter it will show up in the **Parameters** section:\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4984472/133120977-64004074-0afb-4e8a-9a2a-c846f04eb3d9.png)\n\nBe sure to include a `-` after the parameter name as well as [required by TSDoc](https://tsdoc.org/pages/tags/param/), or you'll get a warning in the API report.\n\n```ts\n/**\n * Generates a PluginCacheManager for consumption by plugins.\n *\n * @param pluginId - The plugin that the cache manager should be created for. Plugin names should be unique.\n */\nforPlugin(pluginId: string): PluginCacheManager {\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n## Fill in missing references using `{@link ...}`\n\nNot all types are detected and referenced on the documentation page. Most notably variables, and therefore `ApiRef`s, will not have clickable links to other symbols that they reference. We instead fill in this missing information using inline `{@link ...}` tags in the description:\n\n```ts\n/**\n * {@link ApiRef} for the {@link DiscoveryApi}.\n */\nexport const discoveryApiRef: ApiRef<DiscoveryApi> = createApiRef(...);\n```\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4984472/133123632-d00cefd9-a70f-43f6-8f14-40c253554ee1.png)\n"
