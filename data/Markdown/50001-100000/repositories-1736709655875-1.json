It is _not_ a specification of the format of the pages themselves - only a specification of how a user should be able to interface with an official client. For a list of previous versions of the specification, see the [changelog section](#changelog) below.\n\nThe keywords \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\",  \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).\n\n## Terminology\n\nThis section defines key terms that are relevant for understanding this specification document.\n\n### Page\n\ntldr-pages consists of multiple _pages_ - each of which describes a specific command.\n\n### Platform\n\nPages are grouped by platform, i.e. operating systems — for example, `windows`, `linux`, `osx`.\nThe special platform `common` contains pages for commands that work identically across more than one platform.\n\nIf a page is common across multiple platforms, but slightly different on a given platform, then the page is still stored in the `common` directory, but a copy tailored for the differing platform is placed in that platform's specific folder.\n\nFor example, if the command `foo` is common to `mac`, `windows`, and `linux` but functions differently on `windows`, then the main page will be stored in `common`, and a copy will be placed in `windows` that's altered to match the different functionality.\n\n## Command-line interface\n\nThis section describes the standardised command-line interface (CLI) for clients implementing one. Clients that do not provide a CLI can ignore this section.\n\n### Arguments\n\nThe following command-line options MUST be supported (unless otherwise specified) if a CLI is implemented:\n\nOption             | Required?   | Meaning\n-------------------|-------------|----------\n`-v`, `--version`  | Yes         | Shows the current version of the client, and the version of this specification that it implements.\n`-p`, `--platform` | Yes         | Specifies the platform to be used to perform the action (either listing or searching) as an argument. If this option is specified, the selected platform MUST be checked first instead of the current platform as described below.\n`-u`, `--update`   | Conditional | Updates the offline cache of pages. MUST be implemented if caching is supported.\n`-l`, `--list`     | No          | Lists all the pages in the current platform to the standard output.\n`-L`, `--language` | No          | Specifies the preferred language for the page returned. Overrides other language detection mechanisms. See the [language section](#language) for more information.\n\nClients MUST implement both the short and long versions of an option.\n\nAdditional decoration MAY be printed if the standard output is a [TTY](https://linusakesson.net/programming/tty/index.php). If not, then the output MUST not contain any additional decorations. For example, a page list MUST be formatted with one page name per line (to enable easy manipulation using standard CLI tools such as `grep` etc.).\n\nClients MAY support additional custom arguments and syntax not documented here.\n\nHere are some examples of invocations using the above flags:\n\n```bash\ntldr --update\ntldr --version\ntldr -l\n```\n\n### Page names\n\nThe first argument that does not start with a dash (`-`), MUST be considered the page name.\n\nPage names MAY contain spaces (e.g. `git status`), and such page names MUST be transparently concatenated with dashes (`-`). For example, the page name `git checkout` becomes `git-checkout`.\n\nPage names MAY contain mixed capitalization, and such page names MUST be transparently lowercased. For example, the page name `eyeD3` becomes `eyed3`.\n\nHere are some example invocations:\n\n```bash\ntldr 7za\ntldr eyeD3  # equivalent to tldr eyed3\ntldr git checkout  # equivalent to tldr git-checkout\ntldr --platform osx bash\n```\n\n## Directory structure\n\nThis section documents the directory structure that contains the pages themselves.\n\nThe main version of every page is stored inside (but not directly) the `pages` directory. Inside this directory, there is a folder for each platform - for example `windows`, `linux`, and the special `common` platform:\n\n- `pages/`\n  - `common/`\n  - `linux/`\n  - `windows/`\n  - `osx/`\n  - ...etc.\n\nIt is RECOMMENDED that clients support `macos` as an alias for `osx`.\n\nWhile clients do not need to support new platforms automatically (though such support is RECOMMENDED), they MUST NOT break if additional platforms are added to tldr-pages.\n\nThe pages themselves reside inside the appropriate platform folder, with the extension `.md`. Here are some example mappings:\n\nCommand name    | Mapped name     | Filename\n----------------|-----------------|-------------------\n`7za`           | `7za`           | `7za.md`\n`git checkout`  | `git-checkout`  | `git-checkout.md`\n`tar`           | `tar`           | `tar.md`\n\n### Translations\n\nOther directories sit alongside the main `pages` directory, and contain translations of the main versions of every page - though pages MAY NOT have a translation available for a given language yet. Furthermore, a given language MAY NOT have a folder yet either. The format of these directories is `pages.<locale>`, where `<locale>` is a [POSIX Locale Name](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Names.html#Locale-Names) in the form of `<language>_<country>`, where:\n\n- `<language>` is the shortest [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639) language code for the chosen language (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) for a complete list).\n- `<country>` is the two-letter [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) country code for the chosen region (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) for a complete list).\n\nSome examples:\n\n- Chinese (Taiwan): `pages.zh_TW`.\n- Portuguese (Brazil): `pages.pt_BR`.\n- Italian: `pages.it`.\n\nThe structure inside these translation folders is identical to that of the main `pages` folder.\n\n## Page structure\n\nAlthough this specification is about the interface that clients must provide, it is also worth noting that pages are written in standard [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/), with the exception of the non-standard `{{` and `}}` placeholder syntax, which surrounds values in an example that users may edit. Clients MAY highlight the placeholders and MUST remove the surrounding curly braces. Clients MUST NOT treat them as the placeholder syntax if they are escaped using `\\` (i.e. `\\{\\{` and `\\}\\}`) and MUST instead display literal braces, without backslashes. Placeholder escaping applies only when both braces are escaped (e.g. in `\\{` or `\\{{`, backslashes MUST be displayed). In cases when a command uses `{}` in its arguments (e.g. `stash@{0}`) **_the outer braces_** mark the placeholder - the braces inside MUST be displayed. Clients MUST NOT break if the page format is changed within the _CommonMark_ specification.\n\n### Examples\n\n- `ping {{example.com}}` MUST be rendered as \"ping example.com\"\n- `docker inspect --format '\\{\\{range.NetworkSettings.Networks\\}\\}\\{\\{.IPAddress\\}\\}\\{\\{end\\}\\}' {{container}}` MUST be rendered as \"docker inspect --format '{{range.NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{.IPAddress}}{{end}}' container\"\n- `mount \\\\{{computer_name}}\\{{share_name}} Z:` MUST be rendered as \"mount \\\\\\\\computer_name\\share_name Z:\"\n- `git stash show --patch {{stash@{0}}}` MUST be rendered as \"git stash show --patch stash@{0}\"\n\n## Page resolution\n\nThis section defines the algorithm by which a client can decide which page a user has requested.\n\nAfter transparently replacing spaces (` `) with dashes (`-`) and lowercasing the name, clients have several decisions to make:\n\n- The language of a page to display to a client\n- The platform to display a page from\n\n### Platform\n\nClients MUST default to displaying the page associated with the platform on which the client is running.\n\nFor example, a client running on _Windows 11_ will default to displaying pages from the `windows` platform.\nClients MAY provide a user-configurable option to override this behaviour, however.\n\nIf a page is not available for the host platform, clients MUST fall back to the special `common` platform.\n\nIf a page is not available for either the host platform or the `common` platform, then clients SHOULD search other platforms and display a page from there - along with a warning message.\n\nFor example, a user has a client on Windows and requests the `apt` page. The client consults the platforms in the following order:\n\n1. `windows` - Not available\n2. `common` - Not available\n3. `osx` - Not available\n4. `linux` - Page found\n\nSteps #3 and #4 may be done in either order.\n\nIt is possible that due to this page resolution logic, the client may show a page which does not belong to the host platform because a page can reside in `common`, and not be present on the host platform. Clients must not assume that a given command is always executable on the host platform.\n\nIt is RECOMMENDED that clients detect new platforms added to the relevant `pages` directory automatically.\n\n#### If a page is not found\n\nIf a page cannot be found in _any_ platform, then it is RECOMMENDED that clients display an error message with a link to create a new issue against the `tldr-pages/tldr` GitHub repository. Said link might take the following form:\n\n```url\nhttps://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/issues/new?title=page%20request:%20{command_name}\n```\n\nwhere `{command_name}` is the name of the command that was not found. Clients that have control over their exit code on the command-line (i.e. clients that provide a CLI) MUST exit with a non-zero exit code in addition to showing the above message.\n\n#### If multiple versions of a page were found\n\nIf multiple versions of a page were found for different platforms, then a client MAY choose to display a notice to the user notifying them of this.\n\n## Language\n\nPages can be written in multiple languages. If a client has access to environment variables, it MUST use them to derive the preferred user language as described in the next paragraphs. If not, then clients MUST make reasonable assumptions based on the information provided by the environment in which they operate (e.g. consulting `navigator.languages` in a browser, etc.).\n\nThe [`LANG` environment variable](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Environment-Variables.html) specifies the user's preferred locale (in the form `ll[_CC][.encoding]`). The [`LANGUAGE` environment variable](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/The-LANGUAGE-variable.html) specifies a priority list of locales (in the form `l1:l2:...`) that can be used if the locale defined by `LANG` is not available. Both `LANG` and `LANGUAGE` may contain the values `C` or `POSIX`, which should be ignored.\n\nTo determine the display language, a client MUST:\n\n1. Check the value of `LANG`. If not set, then skip to step 5.\n2. Extract the priority list from `LANGUAGE`. If not set, start with an empty priority list.\n3. Append the value of `LANG` to the priority list.\n4. Follow the priority list in order and use the first available language.\n5. Fall back to English if none of the languages are available.\n\nExamples:\n\n LANG  | LANGUAGE  | Result\n-------|-----------|-----------------------------\n `cz`  |`it:cz:de` | `it`, `cz`, `de`, `en`\n `cz`  |`it:de:fr` | `it`, `de`, `fr`, `cz`, `en`\n `it`  |unset      | `it`, `en`\n unset |`it:cz`    | `en`\n unset |unset      | `en`\n\nRegardless of the language determined through the environment, clients MUST always attempt to fall back to English if the page does not exist in the user's preferred language. Clients MAY notify the user when a page in their preferred language cannot be found (optionally including a link to the [translations section of the contributing guide](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translations)).\n\nIt is also RECOMMENDED to make the language configurable, to not only rely on the environment. Clients SHOULD offer options to configure or override the language using configuration files or even command-line options (like `-L, --language` as suggested in the [arguments section](#arguments) above). If such a command-line option is specified, a client must strictly adhere to its value, and MUST NOT show pages in a different language, failing with an appropriate error message instead.\n\nThe [`LC_MESSAGES` environment variable](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Environment-Variables.html) MAY be present. If the client itself is localized and this environment variable is present, it MUST use its value to determine the language in which interface text is shown (separately from the language used for pages). In the absence of `LC_MESSAGES`, then `LANG` and `LANGUAGE` MUST be used for this purpose instead.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> For page lookup it is highly RECOMMENDED to give precedence to the platform over the language. In other words, look for a platform under each language, before checking the next preferred language. This ensures a meaningful and correct page resolution.\n\nHere's an example of how the lookup should be done on `linux` having set `LANG=it` and `LANGUAGE=\"it:fr:en\"`:\n\nStep  | Path checked         | Outcome\n------|--------------------------------|-----------------------\n1   | pages.it/linux/some-page.md | does not exist\n2   | pages.fr/linux/some-page.md | does not exist\n3   | pages/linux/some-page.md    | does not exist\n4   | pages.it/common/some-page.md | does not exist\n5   | pages.fr/common/some-page.md | does not exist\n6   | pages/common/some-page.md   | FOUND!\n\n## Caching\n\nIf appropriate, it is RECOMMENDED that clients implement a cache of pages. If implemented, clients MUST download the entire archive either as a whole from **<https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest/download/tldr.zip>** or download language-specific archives in the format `https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest/download/tldr-pages.{{language-code}}.zip` (e.g. **<https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest/download/tldr-pages.en.zip>**). The English archive is also available from **<https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest/download/tldr-pages.zip>**.\n\n> [!CAUTION]\n> Prior to version 2.2, the client specification stated that clients MUST download archives from <https://tldr.sh/assets>. This method is now deprecated, and **_will be removed_** in the future.\n\nCaching SHOULD be done according to the user's language configuration (if any), to not waste unneeded space for unused languages. Additionally, clients MAY automatically update the cache regularly.\n\n## Changelog\n\n<!--\nMaintainer note:\n\nKeep the changelog links pointing to this document under the appropriate\n`/blob/<version-tag>/...` and also reference the PR which introduced the new\nversion. After merging an update to the client spec, tag appropriately and\ncreate a new release under https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases\nincluding the changes. NOTE: tagging of the commit with a new version tag (in\nthe form `vX.Y`) should be done immediately AFTER merging the version bump, as\nthe commit hash changes when merging with squash or rebase.\n-->\n\n- [v2.2, March 20th 2024](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/v2.2/CLIENT-SPECIFICATION.md) ([#12452](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/12452))\n  - Removed redirect text from the [caching section](#caching) ([#12133](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/12133))\n  - Updated asset URLs to use GitHub releases ([#12158](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/12158))\n  - Add requirement to disambiguate triple-brace placeholders ([#12158](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/12158))\n  - Add notice to deprecate the old asset URL ([#12452](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/12452))\n\n- [v2.1, November 30th 2023](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/v2.1/CLIENT-SPECIFICATION.md) ([#11523](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/11523))\n  - Add requirement to support escaping the placeholder syntax in certain pages ([#10730](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/10730))\n  - Add suggestion to detect new platforms added to the relevant `pages` directory automatically ([#11523](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/11523))\n\n- [v2.0, September 10th 2023](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/v2.0/CLIENT-SPECIFICATION.md) ([#10148](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/10148))\n  - Add recommendation to support `macos` alias for `osx` ([#7514](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/7514))\n  - Drop the special \"all\" platform from the `--list` flag ([#7561](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pull/7561))\n  - Drop the `master` branch from the assets link.

(That's not to say they're hard-set rules:\nexceptions can always be considered through open community discussion.)\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> It is required to have [two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security) (2FA) enabled for your GitHub account to be added as an outside collaborator or a member of the tldr-pages organization.\n\n## When to change roles\n\n- **Regular contributors should be added as collaborators in the repository.**\n  Specifically: once a contributor has had at least _5 non-trivial pull requests merged_\n  (see `https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/commits?author=<username>`)\n  on a repository under the tldr-pages organization,\n  they should be invited to become\n  a **collaborator** in that repository.\n  This means they will be able to push commits to that repository,\n  as well as merge PRs, label and close issues, among other things.\n\n- **Repository collaborators who regularly perform maintenance tasks should be added as organization members.**\n  (Maintenance work means facilitating contributions by other people,\n  which in this project typically consists of reviewing and/or merging PRs.)\n  Specifically: once a repository collaborator has _merged at least 10 PRs_\n  and submitted at least _5 non-trivial reviews to PRs_\n  (see `https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/pulls?q=reviewed-by:<username>`),\n  which can overlap with the 10 they merged themselves,\n  they should be invited to become a\n  [**member**](https://github.com/orgs/tldr-pages/people)\n  of the tldr-pages organization.\n  This means they will be able to\n  push commits to all of the organization's repositories,\n  merge PRs, label and close issues, among other things.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> All members of the tldr-pages organization **must** make their membership public.\n\n- **Organization members who remain active for a while should become organization owners.**\n  Specifically: members of the tldr-pages organization\n  who remain _active for at least 6 months_\n  (see [`MAINTAINERS.md`](MAINTAINERS.md#organization-members))\n  should be invited to become an\n  [**owner**](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization/)\n  of the tldr-pages organization.\n  This means they will be able to add people to the organization,\n  manage all the organization's repositories, configure integrations, etc.\n\n- **These roles are temporary, and that's OK.**\n  People's interests and availability naturally change over time,\n  so the project should regularly update the list of people in each role,\n  to accurately reflect the active team managing the project\n  (and to avoid conveying an undue sense of obligation\n  on people whose priorities have shifted.)\n  Specifically: If an organization member becomes _inactive for over 6 months_,\n  their membership status should be equally deactivated.\n  (They should nevertheless remain as collaborators\n  in the repositories on which they have been active in the past.)\n  Again, this is merely a reflection\n  of their actual involvement with the project,\n  not a demotion or punishment.\n  Indeed, if they return to active participation in the project,\n  they should be added back to the organization, to reflect that fact.\n\n## How to change roles\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This section is aimed at owners in the tldr-pages organization\n> (i.e. the group of people who can perform these changes).\n\nIf you notice a contributor being particularly active,\nreview their recent contributions to check whether a role transition is due,\naccording to the criteria defined in the previous section.\nIf a role change is warranted, **open a new issue proposing that role change**,\nusing one of the template messages below as a base.\n\n### Adding new collaborators\n\n1. Open an issue with the following message template (edit it as appropriate):\n\n   ```md\n   Hi, @username! You seem to be enjoying contributing to the tldr-pages project.\n   You now have had five distinct pull requests [merged](<!-- REPLACE THIS WITH THE LINKS TO THE RELEVANT PRs -->)!\n   That qualifies you to become a collaborator in this repository, as explained in our [community roles documentation](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/COMMUNITY-ROLES.md).\n\n   As a collaborator, you will have commit access to the repository.\n   That means you can merge pull requests, label and close issues, and perform various other maintenance tasks that are needed here and there.\n   Of course, all of this is voluntary — you're welcome to contribute to the project in whatever ways suit your liking.\n\n   If you do decide to start performing maintenance tasks, though, we only ask you to get familiar with the [maintainer's guide](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/contributing-guides/maintainers-guide.md).\n\n   So, what do you say? Can we add you as a collaborator?\n\n   Either way, thanks for all your work so far!\n\n   > [!NOTE]\n   > It is required to have [two-factor authentication](https://github.com/settings/security) (2FA) enabled for your GitHub account to be added as a collaborator to the tldr-pages/tldr repository.\n   ```\n\n2. Once they acknowledge the message and if they accept the invitation,\n   go to <https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/settings/collaboration>\n   and add them to the repository as a collaborator with write permissions.\n\n3. Suggest them to open a PR adding their name to the \"Repository collaborators\" section\n   in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md#repository-collaborators) file.\n   Make sure to include `Closes #<issue number>` in the PR description.\n   The issue will then be automatically closed once the PR gets merged.\n\n### Adding new organization members\n\n1. Open an issue with the following message template (edit it as appropriate):\n\n   ```md\n   Hi, @username! After joining as a collaborator in the repository, you have been regularly performing [maintenance tasks](<!-- REPLACE THIS WITH THE LINKS TO THE RELEVANT ISSUES AND/OR PRs -->).\n\n   Thank you for that!\n\n   According to our [community roles documentation](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/COMMUNITY-ROLES.md), you've now met the thresholds to be effectively considered an active maintainer of the project.\n\n   To publicly acknowledge that fact, we'd like to add you to the tldr-pages organization.\n\n   If you accept the invitation, we ask you to make your membership public and (in case you don't already) start hanging out in our [Matrix chat room](https://matrix.to/#/#tldr-pages:matrix.org).\n\n   Additionally, consider subscribing to the notifications from the various repositories under the [tldr-pages organization](https://github.com/tldr-pages).\n\n   As one of the public faces of the tldr-pages project, it's also especially important that you follow and encourage the [project\n   governance principles](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/GOVERNANCE.md).\n\n   How does that sound? Are you up for it?\n   ```\n\n2. Once they acknowledge the message and if they accept the invitation,\n   go to <https://github.com/orgs/tldr-pages/people>\n   and add them to the organization as a member.\n\n3. Suggest them to open a PR moving their name to the \"Organization members\" section\n   in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md#organization-members) file.\n   Make sure to include `Closes #<issue number>` in the PR description.\n   The issue will then be automatically closed once the PR gets merged.\n\n### Adding new organization owners\n\n1. Open an issue with the following message template (edit it as appropriate):\n\n   ```md\n   Hi, @username! You've been an active tldr-pages organization member for over 6 months.\n\n   Thanks for sticking around this far and helping out!\n\n   According to our [community roles documentation](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/COMMUNITY-ROLES.md), you're now eligible to become an owner in the organization.\n\n   That means you will, from now on, be part of the team responsible for performing role changes (like this one!) in the community.\n   When performing such role transitions, make sure to follow the process described in the [COMMUNITY-ROLES.md](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/COMMUNITY-ROLES.md) document.\n\n   Is that OK with you? Let us know!\n\n   Either way, thanks so much for all the work you've done so far. You rock!\n   ```\n\n2. Once they acknowledge the message and if they accept the invitation,\n   go to https://github.com/orgs/tldr-pages/people\n   and change their role from \"member\" to \"owner\".\n\n3. Suggest them to open a PR moving their name to the \"Organization owners\" section\n   in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md#organization-owners) file.\n   Make sure to include `Closes #<issue number>` in the PR description.\n   The issue will then be automatically closed once the PR gets merged.\n\n### Removing inactive organization members\n\n1. Open an issue with the following message template (edit it as appropriate):\n\n   ```md\n   Hi, @username! As you know, our [community roles documentation](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/COMMUNITY-ROLES.md) defines processes for keeping the list of organization members in sync with the actual maintenance team.\n   Since you haven't been active in the project for a while now, we'll be relieving you from the maintainer responsibilities.\n\n   In practice, not much will change on your side, since you'll remain a collaborator in the repos you have been active in.\n   That means **you will keep the ability to commit, merge PRs, label and close issues, etc.**, whenever you feel so inclined.\n\n   If you don't, that's all right too!\n\n   Every bit of work you already did for the tldr-pages project was a voluntary gift of your time to this community, which is deeply appreciated.\n   Your efforts have contributed to a project which helps hundreds of people every day — be proud of it!\n\n   And of course, you're welcome back anytime as an active maintainer, if you so choose — in which case, just let us know and we'll re-add you to the organization, in accordance with the principles of our governance guidelines.\n\n   In any case, we wish you the best of luck in your new endeavors!\n   ```\n\n2. Once they acknowledge the message (or after two weeks without any reaction),\n   go to <https://github.com/orgs/tldr-pages/people>, click the gear icon in their row,\n   and select the \"Convert to outside collaborator\" menu entry.\n\n3. Open a PR moving their name to the \"Past organization members\" section\n   in [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md).\n   Make sure to include `Closes #<issue number>` in the PR description.\n   The issue will then be automatically closed once the PR is merged.\n\n## Who can change roles\n\nAny member of the community can (and is encouraged to) propose role changes\nby following the process outlined [above](#how-to-change-roles).\n[Owners of the tldr-pages organization](MAINTAINERS.md#organization-owners)\ncan then perform the actual role changes.\n\n## CODEOWNERS\n\nThe [`.github/CODEOWNERS` file](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) allows contributors with write access to the [tldr-pages/tldr repository](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr)\nto get automatic review request notifications for given files and directories.\n\nIf they wish to, contributors can open a pull request to add themselves to this file as desired.\n\nExample uses include (but are not limited to):\n\n- Contributors who speak a specific language and want to assist with reviewing translations in those specific languages.\n- Contributors with specific expertise who wish to review pull requests for specific platforms.\n- Contributors interested in reviewing [client specification](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/CLIENT-SPECIFICATION.md) updates.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This mechanism is purely for automatic review requests for PRs and doesn't grant collaborators additional copyright over the code-owned files.

Just open an issue or send a pull request, and we'll incorporate it as soon as possible.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> While this file contains general instructions to get started, it is suggested to read the [style guide](contributing-guides/style-guide.md) and [translation templates](contributing-guides/translation-templates)\n> for more detailed information about the syntax and commonly used translation terms.\n\nTo get started, please [sign](https://cla-assistant.io/tldr-pages/tldr) the\n[Contributor License Agreement](https://gist.github.com/waldyrious/e50feec13683e565769fbd58ce503d4e).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> When submitting a new command, please base your PR against the `main` branch and check if there's already a pull request in progress for it.\n\n## Guidelines\n\nThe basic format of a `tldr` page is a set of concrete usage examples.\n\nHere are a few guidelines to get started:\n\n1. Try to keep pages at around 5 examples. Pages can be longer or shorter when appropriate but don't exceed the maximum of eight examples.\n   Remember, it's OK if the page doesn't cover everything; that's what `man` is for.\n2. When in doubt, keep new command-line users in mind. Err on the side of clarity rather than terseness.\n   For example, commands that require `sudo` should include it directly in the examples.\n3. Try to incorporate the spelled-out version of single-letter options in the example's description.\n   The goal is to allow people to *understand* the syntax of the commands, not just *memorize* it.\n4. Introduce options gradually, starting with the simplest command invocations and using more complex examples progressively.\n5. Focus on details specific to the command and avoid explaining general UNIX concepts that could apply to any command\n   (i.e. relative/absolute paths, glob patterns/wildcards, special character escaping, ...).\n\nThese are all guidelines, not strict rules.\nUse proper judgement, keeping simplicity and user-friendliness as the top priorities.\n\nWhen in doubt, have a look at a few existing pages :).\n\n## Directory structure\n\nThe English pages directory is called `pages`, under which the platform directories are present. Language-specific directories must follow the pattern `pages.<locale>`, where `<locale>` is a\n[POSIX Locale Name](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/Locale-Names.html#Locale-Names) in the form of `<language>[_<country>]`, where:\n\n- `<language>` is the shortest [ISO 639](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639) language code for the chosen language (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-2_codes) for a complete list).\n- `<country>` is the two-letter [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1) country code for the chosen region (see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2#Officially_assigned_code_elements) for a complete list).\n\nThe `<country>` code is optional and should only be added when there is a substantial difference between a language (`ll`) and its regional dialects (`ll_CC1`, `ll_CC2`, etc.).\nFor example, both `fr_FR` and `fr_BE` should fall under the same `pages.fr` directory since there virtually is no difference in writing between standard French and Belgian French.\n\n### Platform directories\n\nThe `pages` directory and `pages.*` language-specific directories contain the platform directories, if they have at least one page of that platform.\n\n1. If the command is available for **two or more** platforms, put it **under the `common` directory**.\n2. If the command is **only** available for **one** platform, these are the available directories followed by their right platform:\n\n- `android`: Android\n- `freebsd`: FreeBSD\n- `openbsd`: OpenBSD\n- `osx`: OSX/Mac OS/macOS (will be replaced by `macos`)\n- `linux`: any Linux distro\n- `netbsd`: NetBSD\n- `sunos`: SunOS\n- `windows`: Windows\n\n## Markdown format\n\nAs a quick reference, the format of each page should match the following template:\n\n```md\n# command-name\n\n> Short, snappy description.\n> Preferably one line; two are acceptable if necessary.\n> More information: <https://url-to-upstream.tld>.\n\n- Example description:\n\n`command --option`\n\n- Example description:\n\n`command --option1 --option2 {{arg_value}}`\n```\n\nFor page descriptions, you can additionally use ``See also: `command`.`` and [subcommand reference](#subcommands).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> While we suggest only two lines for the page description, it is acceptable to have more than two lines if it is necessary to add additional information (i.e. [`pacman`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/pages/linux/pacman.md)).\n\nTo see some examples of preexisting pages, you can look at:\n\n- [pwd](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/pages/common/pwd.md) - one of the simplest command examples\n- [tar](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/pages/common/tar.md) - page with placeholders\n\nIn our pages, we use placeholders defined as being tokens within curly brackets. For example, in `sleep {{5}}`, the user can change 5 to any number.\n\nOther examples but not limited to of our placeholder syntax are:\n\n- `{{path/to/directory}}`\n- `{{path/to/directory1 path/to/directory2 ...}}`\n\nHowever, if the description suggests a specific value, leave it as part of the command, and **not** as a placeholder, for example:\n\n```md\n- Display records more recent than 3 days:\n\n`lastlog --time 3`\n```\n\nFor more detailed formatting guidelines,\nrefer to the [style guide](contributing-guides/style-guide.md).\n\n## Subcommands\n\nMany programs use subcommands for separating functionality, which may require their own separate pages.\n\nFor instance, `git commit` has its own page, as well as `git push` and many others.\n\nTo create a page for a subcommand, the program and subcommand need to be separated with a dash (`-`), so `git-commit.md` is shown when calling `tldr git commit`.\n\nYou should always add a base page (e.g. `git`) that describes the program and basic switches like `--version` or `--help`.\n\n### Referencing subcommands\n\nThe following methods can be used to reference subcommands:\n\n- You can add a note saying ``Some subcommands such as `example command` have their own usage documentation`` to the main page. (See the [subcommand reference](/contributing-guides/translation-templates/subcommand-mention.md) page for translation templates). `example command` should only include the subcommand (e.g. `commit` instead of `git commit`).\n- You can use ``See also: `command1`, `command2`.`` template to reference similar commands, aliases and subcommands.\n- Alternatively, the whole page can be converted to reference the main subcommands.\n\nFor example:\n\n```md\n# command\n\n> Short, snappy description.\n> Some subcommands such as `subcommand1` have their own usage documentation.\n> More information: <https://url-to-upstream.tld>.\n\n- View documentation for creating something:\n\n`tldr command-subcommand1`\n\n- View documentation for managing something:\n\n`tldr command-subcommand2`\n```\n\nSee these examples for reference:\n\n- [git](pages/common/git.md)\n- [distrobox-create](pages/linux/distrobox-create.md)\n- [nmcli](pages/linux/nmcli.md)\n\n## Translations\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Translations of pages should be done based on the English (US) page in the `pages` directory. If the English pages don't exist for the command, it should be added first in a PR before creating a translation.\n\nTranslation of pages can be done by simply creating the corresponding page within the appropriate [language-specific directory](#directory-structure), creating that as well if it does not already exist.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]  \n> When adding a new language to `tldr`, it is suggested to add it to the [translation templates](contributing-guides/translation-templates) along with any page additions.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> When fixing errors in an existing translation, it is suggested to update the page to match the latest version of the English page.\n\nTo see the current progress of all translations, you can visit <https://lukwebsforge.github.io/tldri18n/>, which provides a dynamically updated table of all pages and their translations or you can visit <https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-maintenance/issues/127>, which provides a dynamically updated list about the translation status (e.g. list all outdated pages) per language.\n\nSome examples of valid locale tags:\n\n- French: `fr`.\n- Chinese: `zh`.\n- Chinese (Singapore): `zh_SG`.\n- Portuguese (Brazil): `pt_BR`.\n\nA list of translated templates for alias pages can be found [here](contributing-guides/translation-templates/alias-pages.md).\n\nIt is acceptable for several pages to get translated in one pull request.\n\nFor more information about language-specific rules, refer to the [style guide](contributing-guides/style-guide.md#language-specific-rules).\n\n## Inclusive language\n\nWhere possible, use inclusive language in the content of pages. For example, prefer terms like \"denylist\"/\"allowlist\" instead of \"blacklist\"/\"whitelist\", \"primary\"/\"secondary\" instead of \"master\"/\"slave\", \"they\" instead of \"him\"/\"her\", etc.\nOf course, this shouldn't sacrifice content clarity, such as when documenting tools where this terminology has specific technical meanings and its usage is central to explaining the involved concepts.\n\n## Submitting a pull request\n\n### Testing pages locally\n\nOnce you have written a `tldr` page, you can test its syntax locally using [`tldr-lint`](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-lint).\n\nThe latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) is required to install `tldr-lint` with the following command:\n\n```sh\nnpm install --global tldr-lint\n```\n\nOnce it is installed, you can test your page by running the following command:\n\n```sh\ntldr-lint {{path/to/page.md}}\n```\n\nNow, you are ready to submit a pull request!\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Additionally, inside the `tldr` directory you can install the dependencies using the `npm install` command and now when you commit your changes, the tests will run automatically via the pre-commit hook.\n> (To skip the pre-commit hook and immediately commit your changes use the `git commit --no-verify` command).\n\n### Submitting changes\n\nThe easiest way to submit a change is to edit the page directly on the GitHub interface.\n\nCheck out the step-by-step instructions (with screenshots) on\n[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-another-user-s-repository/).\n\nAlternatively, you can do most of the process\n[using Git on the command-line](contributing-guides/git-terminal.md).\n\n> [!TIP]\n> After creating a pull request, it is suggested to enable the \"Allow edits by maintainers\" option (This only needs to be done once the first time you create a PR).\n> It allows maintainers to make changes to your pull request and assist you in getting it merged, in addition to facilitate the contribution to go on if you can no longer work on it soon for any reason.\n\n### Accepting suggestions within a pull request\n\nThe easiest way to apply suggested changes is to accept the suggestion made on your pull request.\nRefer to the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) for more details.\n\nTo commit a suggestion to your pull request, click on `Commit suggestion`:\n\n![Commit suggestion button in Github](./images/commit-suggestion-button.png)\n\nIf you want to commit multiple suggestions, go to the \"Files changed\" tab and batch all suggestions. Now, click the `Commit suggestions` button and enter a commit message to create a single commit.\n\n### Commit message and PR title\n\nFor the commit message and PR title of page changes, use the following format:\n\n`{{command}}: type of change`\n\nWhere `{{command}}` is the name of the command being modified, and `type of change` can be (but not limited to) one of the following examples:\n\n- For a new page addition: `ls: add page`, `docker-container-rm: add alias page`\n- For a page edit: `cat: fix typo`, `git-push: add --force example`\n- For a new translation of an existing page: `cp: add Tamil translation`\n- For a modification to the translation of an existing page: `cp: fix typo in Tamil translation`\n- For related changes to some pages: `grep, find, locate: synchronize format of wildcards`\n- For related changes to several unrelated pages: `pages*: fix Linux casing`\n- For multiple subcommand page additions: `git-{add, push, ...}: add page`\n- For modifying multiple pages in a language: `pages.<locale>/*: update pages`\n\nFor script changes, the commit message and the PR title can be (but not limited to) one of the following examples:\n\n- For a new script addition: `scripts/{{script_name}}: add script`\n- For a script edit: `scripts/set-alias-page: fix performance issue`\n- For changes that affect multiple scripts: `scripts: replace insecure library`\n\nFor other cases, it is suggested to follow <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/> as much as possible.\n\n## Name collisions\n\nWhen there are multiple commands sharing the same name, the existing page of the command and the new command can be renamed to `command.1` and so on following a numbering scheme or based on the programming language i.e. `command.js`.\nThe base page can be updated to reference the newly renamed/created pages by following [this subcommand reference format](#subcommands).\n\nSee the following page for reference:\n\n- [just](pages/common/just.md)\n\n## Licensing\n\nThis repository is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License](LICENSE.md).\n\nThe contents of the `scripts/` directory are licensed under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).\n\nAny contributions to this project are governed by the\n[Contributor License Agreement](https://cla-assistant.io/tldr-pages/tldr).\n"

Perhaps you're just a little rusty or can't always recall the arguments for commands like `lsof`, or `tar`?\n\nIt certainly doesn't help that, in the past, the first option explained in `man tar` was:\n\n```console\n$ man tar\n...\n-b blocksize\n   Specify the block size, in 512-byte records, for tape drive I/O.\n   As a rule, this argument is only needed when reading from or writing to tape drives,\n   and usually not even then as the default block size of 20 records (10240 bytes) is very common.\n...\n```\n\nThere is room for simpler help pages focused on practical examples.\nHow about:\n\n<picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/images/tldr-dark.png\">\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: light)\" srcset=\"https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/images/tldr-light.png\">\n    <img alt=\"Screenshot of the tldr client displaying the tar command.\" src=\"https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/blob/main/images/tldr-dark.png\">\n</picture>\n\nThis repository is just that: an ever-growing collection of examples\nfor the most common UNIX, Linux, macOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD,\nSunOS, Android, and Windows command-line tools.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\n> [!TIP]\n> For browsing without installing a client on your computer,\n> see the web client at <https://tldr.inbrowser.app> (with offline support using PWA).\n\nA popular and convenient way to access these pages on your computer\nis to install the official [Node.js client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-node-client):\n\n```shell\nnpm install -g tldr\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the official [Python client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-python-client), which can be installed via [pip3](https://pypi.org/project/tldr/) (or [other package managers](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-python-client#installation)):\n\n```shell\npip3 install tldr\n```\n\nLinux and Mac users can also install the official [Rust Client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tlrc) using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/tlrc)\n(or [other package managers](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tlrc#installation) on other operating systems):\n\n```shell\nbrew install tlrc\n```\n\nThen you have direct access to simplified, easy-to-read help for commands, such as `tar`,\naccessible through typing `tldr tar` instead of the standard `man tar`.\n\nIf you don't want to install any software, check out the [PDF version](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest/download/tldr-book.pdf) instead.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> PDFs for translations are available for most languages. You can find them in the release assets of the [latest release](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/releases/latest).\n\nThere are also **various other clients** provided by the community,\nboth for the command-line and for other platforms.\nFor a comprehensive list of clients, head over to our [Wiki](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/wiki/Clients).\n\n## How do I contribute to tldr-pages?\n\nAll contributions are welcome!\n\nSome ways to contribute include:\n\n- Adding your favorite command that isn't covered.\n- Adding examples or improving the content of an existing page.\n- Adding requested pages from our issues with the [help wanted](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) label.\n- Translating pages into different languages.\n\nAll `tldr` pages are written in Markdown so that they can be edited quite easily and changes can be submitted in\npull requests here using Git on the command-line or\nusing the GitHub web interface.\n\nWe strive to maintain a [welcoming and collaborative](GOVERNANCE.md) community.\nIf it's your first time contributing, have a look at the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), and go ahead!\n\nIf you'd like to contribute to translations, you can visit <https://lukwebsforge.github.io/tldri18n/>\nto see the overall progress of all translations, and which translations are missing or outdated.\n\nYou are also welcome to join us on the [matrix chatroom](https://matrix.to/#/#tldr-pages:matrix.org)!\n\n## Similar projects\n\n- [Command Line Interface Pages](https://github.com/command-line-interface-pages)\n  allows you to write standardized help pages for CLI, directories, and configs.\n\n- [Cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat)\n  allows you to create and view interactive cheatsheets on the command-line.\n  It was designed to help remind Unix system administrators of options\n  for commands that they use frequently, but not frequently enough to remember.\n\n- [cheat.sh](https://cheat.sh/)\n  Aggregates cheat sheets from multiple sources (including tldr-pages)\n  into 1 unified interface.\n\n- [devhints](https://devhints.io/)\n  Rico's cheatsheets are not just focused on the command-line and\n  include a plethora of other cheatsheets related to programming.\n\n- [eg](https://github.com/srsudar/eg)\n  provides detailed examples with explanations on the command-line.\n  Examples come from the repository, but `eg` supports displaying\n  custom examples and commands alongside the defaults.\n  \n- [kb](https://github.com/gnebbia/kb)\n  is a minimalist command-line knowledge base manager.\n  kb can be used to organize your notes and cheatsheets in a minimalist\n  and clean way. It also supports non-text files.\n\n- [navi](https://github.com/denisidoro/navi)\n  is an interactive cheatsheet tool, which allows you to browse through\n  specific examples or complete commands on the fly.\n\n- [bropages (deprecated)](http://bropages.org)\n  are a highly readable supplement to man pages.\n  It shows concise, common-case examples for Unix commands.\n  The examples are submitted by the user base, and can be voted up or down;\n  the best entries are what people see first when they look up a command.\n\n## What does \"tldr\" mean?\n\nTL;DR stands for \"Too Long; Didn't Read\".\nIt originated as Internet slang, where it is used to indicate that a long text\n(or parts of it) has been skipped as too lengthy.\nRead more in How-To Geek's [article](https://www.howtogeek.com/435266/what-does-tldr-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/).\n"
