          "content": "# Contributing to Docker Documentation\n\nWe value documentation contributions from the Docker community. We'd like to\nmake it as easy as possible for you to work in this repository.\n\nOur style guide and instructions on using our page templates and components is\navailable in the [contribution section](https://docs.docker.com/contribute/) on\nthe website.\n\nThe following guidelines describe the ways in which you can contribute to the\nDocker documentation at <https://docs.docker.com/>, and how to get started.\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nIf you encounter a problem with the content, or the site in general, feel free\nto [submit an issue](https://github.com/docker/docs/issues/new/choose) in our\n[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/docker/docs/issues). You can also use\nthe issue tracker to raise requests on improvements, or suggest new content\nthat you think is missing or that you would like to see.\n\n## Editing content\n\nThe website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The content is primarily\nMarkdown files in the `/content` directory of this repository (with a few\nexceptions, see [Content not edited here](#content-not-edited-here)).\n\nThe structure of the sidebar navigation on the site is defined by the site's\nsection hierarchy in the `contents` directory. The titles of the pages are\ndefined in the front matter of the Markdown files. You can use `title` and\n`linkTitle` to define the title of the page. `title` is used for the page\ntitle, and `linkTitle` is used for the sidebar title. If `linkTitle` is not\ndefined, the `title` is used for both.\n\nYou must fork this repository to create a pull request to propose changes. For more details, see [Local setup](#local-setup).\n\n### General guidelines\n\nHelp make reviewing easier by following these guidelines:\n\n- Try not to touch a large number of files in a single PR if possible.\n- Don't change whitespace or line wrapping in parts of a file you aren't\n  editing for other reasons. Make sure your text editor isn't configured to\n  automatically reformat the whole file when saving.\n- We use GitHub Actions for testing and creating preview deployments for each\n  pull request. The URL of the preview deployment is added as a comment on the\n  pull request. Check the staging site to verify how your changes look and fix\n  issues, if necessary.\n\n### Local setup\n\nYou can use Docker (surprise) to build and serve the files locally.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> This requires Docker Desktop version **4.24** or later, or Docker Engine with Docker\n> Compose version [**2.22**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/file-watch/) or later.\n\n1. [Fork the docker/docs repository.](https://github.com/docker/docs/fork)\n\n2. Clone your forked docs repository:\n\n   ```console\n   $ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/docs\n   $ cd docs\n   ```\n\n3. Configure Git to sync your docs fork with the upstream docker/docs\n   repository and prevent accidental pushes to the upstream repository:\n\n   ```console\n   $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/docker/docs.git\n   $ git remote set-url --push upstream no_pushing\n   ```\n\n4. Check out a branch:\n\n   ```console\n   $ git checkout -b <branch>\n   ```\n\n5. Start the local development server:\n\n   ```console\n   $ docker compose watch\n   ```\n\nThe site will be served for local preview at <http://localhost:1313>. The\ndevelopment server watches for changes and automatically rebuilds your site.\n\nTo stop the development server:\n\n1. In your terminal, press `<Ctrl+C>` to exit the file watch mode of Compose.\n2. Stop the Compose service with the `docker compose down` command.\n\n### Testing\n\nBefore you push your changes and open a pull request, we recommend that you\ntest your site locally first. Local tests check for broken links, incorrectly\nformatted markup, and other things. To run the tests:\n\n```console\n$ docker buildx bake validate\n```\n\nIf this command doesn't result in any errors, you're good to go!\n\n## Content not edited here\n\nCLI reference documentation is maintained in upstream repositories. It's\npartially generated from code, and is only vendored here for publishing. To\nupdate the CLI reference docs, refer to the corresponding repository:\n\n- [docker/cli](https://github.com/docker/cli)\n- [docker/buildx](https://github.com/docker/buildx)\n- [docker/compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)\n\nFeel free to raise an issue on this repository if you're not sure how to\nproceed, and we'll help out.\n\nOther content that appears on the site, but that's not edited here, includes:\n\n- Dockerfile reference\n- Docker Engine API reference\n- Compose specification\n- Buildx Bake reference\n\nIf you spot an issue in any of these pages, feel free to raise an issue here\nand we'll make sure it gets fixed in the upstream source.\n"
