~~is~~ was an official list available in the GitHub Docs at  \n<https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#displaying-badges-on-your-profile> ([link to the

 \nThere is still a section which includes specifics on how badges were/are awarded, e.g. which [repositories and versions qualified for the Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/customizing-your-profile/personalizing-your-profile#list-of-qualifying-repositories-for-mars-2020-helicopter-contributor-achievement).\n\n~~Consider this repository a mirror, maybe in the future with historic purpose.~~ Unless there will be an official list again, this is it.\n\n## Details\n\n### Specifics on how to achieve\n\nFor now, please

In other words, they were overhauled on 2022-06-09.\n\n```diff\n- GitHub Sponsor\n+ Public Sponsor\n- Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor\n+ Mars 2020 Contributor\n```\n\nHere are the old designs and names:\n\n| Title | Badge |\n| --- | --- |\nArctic Code Vault Contributor | ![Arctic Code Vault Contributor Achievement Badge](/images/2021-04-19-2022-06-09/badge-arctic-code-vault-small.png)\nGitHub Sponsor | ![GitHub Sponsor Achievement Badge](/images/2021-04-19-2022-06-09/badge-sponsors-small.png)\nMars 2020 Helicopter Contributor | ![Mars 2020 Helicopter Contributor Achievement Badge](images/2021-04-19-2022-06-09/badge-mars-2020-small.png)\n\n## See also\n\n* [Flet/rejected-github-profile-achievements](https://github.com/Flet/rejected-github-profile-achievements) for a laugh about the Achievements\n* [drknzz/GitHub-Achievements](https://github.com/drknzz/GitHub-Achievements) same as this collection, but different ;)\n"
