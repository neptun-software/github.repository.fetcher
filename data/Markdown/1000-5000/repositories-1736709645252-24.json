No need to ask someone else to tell you what's happening in the Bitcoin network.\n* **Improve your privacy.** Connect your wallets to your node so that you no longer need to reveal their whole financial history to external servers.\n* **Be part of Lightning.** Run your own Lightning node for everyday payments and help building a robust, decentralized Bitcoin Lightning network.\n\nDid we mention that it's fun, as well?\n\n---\n\n## RaspiBolt overview\n\nThis guide explains how to set up your own Bitcoin node on a cheap Raspberry Pi.\nBut it works on most hardware platforms because it only uses standard Debian Linux commands.\n\n### Features\n\nYour Bitcoin node will offer the following functionality:\n\n* **Bitcoin**: direct and trustless participation in the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, full validation of blocks and transactions\n* **Electrum server**: connect your compatible wallets (including hardware wallets) to your own node\n* **Blockchain Explorer**: web-based Explorer to privately look up transactions, blocks, and more\n* **Lightning**: full client with stable long-term channels and web-based and mobile-based management interfaces\n* **Always on**: services are constantly synced and available 24/7\n* **Reachable from anywhere**: connect to all your services through the Tor network\n\n### Target audience\n\nWe strive to give foolproof instructions.\nBut the goal is also to do everything ourselves.\nShortcuts that involve trusting someone else are not allowed.\nThis makes this guide quite technical, but we try to make it as straightforward as possible.\nYou'll gain a basic understanding of the how and why.\n\nIf you like to learn about Linux, Bitcoin, and Lightning, then this guide is for you.\n\n### Structure\n\nWe aim to keep the core of this guide well maintained and up-to-date:\n\n1. [Raspberry Pi](guide/raspberry-pi/index.md): prepare the hardware and set up the operating system\n1. [Bitcoin](guide/bitcoin/index.md): sync your own Bitcoin full node, Electrum server, and Blockchain Explorer\n1. [Lightning](guide/lightning/index.md): run your own Lightning client with web-based node management\n\nThe bonus section contains more specific guides that build on top of the main section.\nMore fun, lots of knowledge, but with lesser maintenance guarantees.\nEverything is optional.\n\n* [Bonus guides](guide/bonus/index.md)\n\nRunning into issues?\n\n* [Troubleshooting](guide/troubleshooting.md): first aid to debug your system\n* [FAQ](guide/faq.md): frequently asked questions and further reading\n\n---\n\n## Community\n\nThis is a community project.\nFind help and other RaspiBolt users on the following platforms:\n\n* [Github Issues / Knowledge Base](https://github.com/raspibolt/raspibolt/issues){:target=\"_blank\"}\n* Reddit sub: [r/raspibolt](https://www.reddit.com/r/raspibolt/){:target=\"_blank\"}\n* Telegram group: [t.me/raspibolt](https://t.me/raspibolt){:target=\"_blank\"}\n\nAnd feel free to join the many other contributors if you see something that can be improved!\n\n---\n\n## Already running an earlier version of the RaspiBolt?\n\nUnfortunately, a seamless update is not possible because RaspiBolt 3 uses an entirely different 64-bit operating system.\nThe general structure of the setup stays the same, however.\nWe recommend setting up the RaspiBolt from scratch, but you can then copy over essential data.\n\n[Read how to do that in the FAQ section](guide/faq.md#can-i-update-my-raspibolt-2-to-the-new-version).\n\n## Looking for an older version of this guide?\n\nIf you're looking for an older version of this guide, you can still check out the archived source files for [version 1](https://github.com/raspibolt/raspibolt/tree/1.0){:target=\"_blank\"} and [version 2](https://v2.raspibolt.org){:target=\"_blank\"}.\n\n<br /><br />\n\n---\n\nGet started: [Backstory >>](guide/backstory.md)\n"
