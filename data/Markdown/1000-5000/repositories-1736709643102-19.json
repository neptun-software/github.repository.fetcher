[#87](https://github.com/adr/madr/pull/87)\n- Renamed \"Deciders\" to \"Decision Maker(s)\" (`decision-makers:`). [#101](https://github.com/adr/madr/issues/101)\n- Rename template name \"Markdown Any Decision Record\" back to \"Markdown Architectural Decision Record\"\n- Rename `0000-use-markdown-any-decision-records.md` to `0000-use-madr.md`.\n- All placehodlers are are now one liners.\n\n### Removed\n\n- Removed link to ADR in `status` field.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\nlimited to, the following:\n\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\n     in a Work;\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\n     directive); and\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\n     implementations thereof.\n\n2.

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\nAffirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\npurposes (the \"Waiver\").

Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\naccount Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\n\"License\").

Should any part of the License for any\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\n\n4.

MADR offers pre-configured VS Code web environment at [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/adr/madr).\n* MADR uses [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) as Linter for Markdown files. Use [markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint) for checking for linting issues in VS Code.\n* `template/adr-template.md` is mirrored to `docs/decisions/adr-template`.\n  However, following YAML front matter is added to make it handled properly by the [Just the Docs Jekyll Template](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/). <!-- markdownlint-disable-next-line MD031 -->\n  ```markdown\n  ---\n  parent: Decisions\n  nav_order: 100\n  title: ADR Template\n  ---\n  ```\n\n### Branches\n\n| Branch       | Meaning                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `gh-pages`   | Homepage showing the latest released version, rendered at <https://adr.github.io/madr>                                                       |\n| `develop`    | Latest developments, including homepage updates which should be published on a release. `gh-pages` should always be merged into this branch. |\n| `release/vY` | Branch for latest release Y.x version of MADR. Introduced to fix [#92](https://github.com/adr/madr/issues/92)                                |\n\nThe branch name conventions follow the [git flow model](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow).\n\nSee also [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## How to start Jekyll locally\n\nFor rendering the `docs` directory, Jekyll is needed.\n\nFor local development, follow the [Jekyll installation instructions](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).\nInstalling the latest version of ruby followed by `gem install bundler` should be enough.\n\nAfterwards, run\n\n```terminal\nbundle install\njekyll serve --livereload\n```\n\nand go to <http://localhost:4000/madr/> in your browser.\n\nOn Windows, using a dockerized environment is recommended:\n\n```terminal\ndocker run -p 4000:4000 --rm -v \"C:\\git-repositories\\adr.github.io\\madr\\docs\":/site bretfisher/jekyll-serve\n```\n\nIn case you get errors regarding `Gemfile.lock`, just delete `Gemfile.lock` and rerun.\n\n## Updating just-the-docs\n\n* Adapt `docs/Gemfile` to use newer just-the-docs version. Thereby check <https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/Gemfile> for versions.\n* Delete `docs/Gemfile.lock`. Start `bundle install`.\n* Check <https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>.\n* Check <https://just-the-docs.com/migration/>.\n\n## Releasing a new version\n\n1. Update the examples at `docs/index.md` and `docs/examples.md`.\n2. Update the concrete decisions in `docs/decisions/*` with the new template.\n3. Commit (\"Update examples and decisions\") and push. Possibly as pull request.\n4. Adapt the version reference in `template/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md`.\n5. Update \"template\" files in `docs/decisions`:\n   * Copy `template/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md` to `docs/decisions/0000-use-markdown-architectural-decision-records.md`.\n   * Adapt content of `docs/decisions/adr-template.md` based on `template/adr-template.md`.\n     Thereby, ensure that the YAML front matter in `docs/decisions/adr-template.md` is kept.\n6. Add link to `docs/index.md` at \"Older versions\" (for the homepage).\n7. Copy `.markdownlint.yml` to `template/.markdownlint.yml` (and possibly to `docs/.markdownlint.yml`).\n8. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.\n9. Commit.\n10. Update `package.json` and publish to [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/madr) using [release-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/release-it) (do not create a release on GitHub). This also does a commit.\n11. Create GitHub release using [github-release-from-changelog](https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-release-from-changelog).\n12. Merge `develop` into `gh-pages`\n\n## License\n\nThis work is dual-licensed under [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) and\n[CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/).\nYou can choose between one of them if you use this work.\n\n```yaml\nSPDX-License-Identifier: MIT OR CC0-1.0\n```\n"
