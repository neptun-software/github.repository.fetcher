Maven Toolchains is used to employ additional JDKs required for tests.\nYou either need to have a user-level configuration in `~/.m2/toolchains.xml` or explicitly provide one to the Maven: `./mvnw --global-toolchains /path/to/toolchains.xml`.\n+\n.An example `toolchains.xml` containing a JDK 8 toolchain\n[source,xml]\n----\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF8\"?>\n<toolchains>\n  <toolchain>\n    <type>jdk</type>\n    <provides>\n      <version>1.8.0_372</version>\n    </provides>\n    <configuration>\n      <jdkHome>/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64</jdkHome>\n    </configuration>\n  </toolchain>\n</toolchains>\n----\n\n. Run Maven tests with the `java8-tests` profile:\n+\n[source,bash]\n----\n./mvnw verify -Pjava8-tests,!java8-incompat-fixes\n----\n\n[#docker]\n=== Docker tests\n\nCertain tests use Docker to spawn necessary external services.\nDocker tests are configured using the `docker` Maven profile, which is activated by default for the CI environment.\nYou can locally enable this profile by passing a `-P docker` argument to your `./mvnw` commands.\n\n[#website]\n== Building the website\n\nYou can build the website as follows:\n\n[source,bash]\n----\n./mvnw compile    # <1>\n./mvnw site       # <2>\n----\n<1> Generate plugin descriptors that will be used to generate the plugin reference page.\nDescriptors are placed under `target/plugin-descriptors`.\n<2> Generate the website to `target/site`\n\nYou can view the generated website with a browser by pointing it to `target/site` directory.\n\n[#development]\n== Development\n\nYou can follow below steps for casual development needs:\n\n. Make sure you installed everything:\n+\n[source,bash]\n----\n./mvnw install -DskipTests\n----\n\n. After making a change to, say, `log4j-core`, install your changes:\n+\n[source,bash]\n----\n./mvnw install -pl :log4j-core -DskipTests\n----\n\n. Run all tests associated with `log4j-core`:\n+\n[source,bash]\n----\n./mvnw test -pl :log4j-core-test\n----\n\n. Run a particular test:\n+\n[source,bash]\n----\n./mvnw test -pl :log4j-core-test -Dtest=FooBarTest\n----\n\n. Make sure all build checks (Spotless, Spotbugs, BND, RAT, etc.) succeed:\n+\n[source,bash]\n----\n./mvnw verify -DskipTests -pl :log4j-core,:log4j-core-test\n----\n\n[#development-ide-debug]\n=== Debugging `./mvnw test` with IDE\n\nYou can connect your IDE to a `./mvnw test` run by\n\n. Run `./mvnw test -pl :log4j-core-test -Dtest=FooBarTest -Dmaven.surefire.debug`\n. Use _\"Run > Attach to process\"_ in IntelliJ IDEA\n\n[#development-ci]\n=== Activating CI profiles\n\nThere are certain Maven profiles activated only for CI.\nAs a consequence of this, you can observe certain CI failures that you can't reproduce locally.\nTo work around this, you can activate CI profiles by running Maven commands as follows:\n\n[source,bash]\n----\nCI=true ./mvnw ...\n----\n\n[#development-faq-idea-plugin-not-found]\n=== Compilation in IntelliJ IDEA fails with `java: plug-in not found: ErrorProne`\n\nTry removing all _\"Override compiler parameters per-module\"_ entries in _\"Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler\"_.\n\n[#development-api-compatibility]\n=== Fixing API compatibility check failures\n\nLog4j uses the\nhttps://github.com/bndtools/bnd/tree/master/maven-plugins/bnd-baseline-maven-plugin[BND Baseline Maven Plugin]\nto enforce its\nhttps://semver.org/[semantic versioning policy].\nFollowing the\nhttps://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/170-versioning.html#best-practices[OSGi versioning best practices], both Log4j artifacts and packages are versioned.\nIf you modify Log4j's public API, a BND Baseline error like the following will occur:\n\n[source]\n----\n  Name                        Type     Delta      New    Old    Suggest  If Prov.\n  org.apache.logging.foo      PACKAGE  UNCHANGED  2.1.0  2.1.0  ok       -\n* org.apache.logging.foo.bar  PACKAGE  MINOR      2.3.4  2.3.4  2.4.0    -\n  MINOR        PACKAGE    org.apache.logging.foo.bar\n  ...\n----\n\nThe solution of the error depends on the change kind (`Delta`):\n\n[#development-api-compatibility-micro]\n`MICRO`::\n+\nFor patch level changes modify the `package-info.java` file of the `org.apache.logging.foo.bar` package and update the `@Version` annotation to the number suggested by BND: increment just the patch number.\n+\n[source,java]\n----\n@Version(\"2.3.5\")\npackage org.apache.logging.foo.bar;\n----\n\n[#development-api-compatibility-minor]\n`MINOR`::\n+\nChanges of type `MINOR` require more work:\n+\n--\n* Make sure that the current Log4j version is a minor upgrade over the last released version.\nIf that is not the case (e.g., it is `2.34.5-SNAPSHOT`) modify the `<revision>` property in the main POM file (e.g., change it to `2.35.0-SNAPSHOT`).\n* Make sure to add a\nhttps://logging.apache.org/log4j/tools/log4j-changelog.html#changelog-entry-file[changelog entry]\nof type `added`, `changed` or `deprecated` to your PR.\n* As in the\n<<development-api-compatibility-micro,`MICRO` case>>\nmodify the `package-info.java` file of the package and update the `@Version` annotation to the **next Log4j version** (`2.35.0` in the example) and **not** the minimal version number suggested by BND.\nThe purpose of this policy is to have an alignment between package versions and the last Log4j version, where an API change occurred.\n--\n\n[#development-api-compatibility-major]\n`MAJOR`::\n+\nChanges of type `MAJOR` (i.e. breaking changes) are not accepted in the `2.x` branch.\nIf you believe it is not a breaking change (e.g., you removed a class **documented** as private), the development team will guide you on how to solve it.\n"

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.
