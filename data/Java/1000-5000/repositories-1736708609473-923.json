The MQTT5 specification is almost fully supported. \nThe features implemented by the broker are:\n* session and message expiry\n* shared subscriptions\n* request/response\n* topic alias\n* flow control\n* subscription options\n* will delay\n* server disconnects\n* payload format indicator\n\nIts designed to be evented, uses Netty for the protocol encoding and decoding part.\n\n## Community feedback\nWe would love :heart: to hear from Moquette users, please [let us know how you use it 👣 ](https://github.com/moquette-io/moquette/discussions/874)\n\n## Embedding in other projects\n\nUse JitPack to resolve Moquette dependency in your project. \n\nIn repositories section, add:\n```\n<repositories>\n  <repository>\n    <id>jitpack.io</id>\n    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>\n  </repository>\n</repositories>\n```\n\nIn dependencies section add:\n```\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.github.moquette-io</groupId>\n  <artifactId>moquette-broker</artifactId>\n  <version>0.18.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n## Build from sources\n\nAfter a git clone of the repository, cd into the cloned sources and: `./gradlew package`, at the end the distribution \npackage is present at `distribution/target/distribution-0.19-SNAPSHOT-bundle.tar.gz`\n\nIn distribution/target directory will be produced the selfcontained file for the broker with all dependencies and a running script. \n"

COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</span></b> </p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Commercial distributors of software may\naccept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners\nand the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the\nProgram in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial\nContributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\nContributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and\ncosts (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other\nlegal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to\nthe extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\nconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\noffering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\nto qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor\nto control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and\nany related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate\nin any such claim at its own expense.</span> </p>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">For example, a Contributor might include the\nProgram in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a\nCommercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and\nwarranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this\nsection, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the\nother Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\nCommercial Contributor must pay those damages.</span> </p>\n\n<p><b><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">5.
