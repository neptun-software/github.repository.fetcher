          "content": "*❗ Please note: Reflections library is currently NOT under active development or maintenance ❗*\n\n*Thank you for your continuous support!\n<br>There are open issues and also workarounds. Release version will be considered incase contributing PR fixing the main issues.*\n\n*Last released `org.reflections:reflections:0.10.2` (Oct 2021)*\n\n----\n\n# Java runtime metadata analysis\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ronmamo/reflections.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ronmamo/reflections)\n\nReflections scans and indexes your project's classpath metadata, allowing reverse transitive query of the type system on runtime.\n\nUsing Reflections you can query for example:\n  * Subtypes of a type\n  * Types annotated with an annotation\n  * Methods with annotation, parameters, return type\n  * Resources found in classpath  \nAnd more...\n\n*Reflections was written in the spirit of [Scannotations](http://bill.burkecentral.com/2008/01/14/scanning-java-annotations-at-runtime/) library*\n\n## Usage\nAdd Reflections dependency to your project:\n```xml\n# Maven\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.reflections</groupId>\n    <artifactId>reflections</artifactId>\n    <version>0.10.2</version>\n</dependency>\n\n# Gradle\nimplementation 'org.reflections:reflections:0.10.2'\n```\n\nCreate Reflections instance and use the query functions: \n```java\nReflections reflections = new Reflections(\"com.my.project\");\n\nSet<Class<?>> subTypes =\n  reflections.get(SubTypes.of(SomeType.class).asClass());\n\nSet<Class<?>> annotated = \n  reflections.get(SubTypes.of(TypesAnnotated.with(SomeAnnotation.class)).asClass());\n```\n\nOr using previous 0.9.x APIs, for example:\n\n```java\nSet<Class<? extends SomeType>> subTypes =\n  reflections.getSubTypesOf(SomeType.class);\n\nSet<Class<?>> annotated = \n  reflections.getTypesAnnotatedWith(SomeAnnotation.class);\n```\n\n*Note that there are some breaking changes with Reflections 0.10+, along with performance improvements and more functional API, see below.*\n\n### Scan\nCreating Reflections instance requires [ConfigurationBuilder](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/util/ConfigurationBuilder.html), typically configured with packages and [Scanners](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/scanners/Scanners.html) to use: \n\n```java\n// typical usage: scan package with the default scanners SubTypes, TypesAnnotated\nReflections reflections = new Reflections(\n  new ConfigurationBuilder()\n    .forPackage(\"com.my.project\")\n    .filterInputsBy(new FilterBuilder().includePackage(\"com.my.project\")));\n```\n\nOther examples:\n```java\nimport static org.reflections.scanners.Scanners.*;\n\n// scan package with specific scanners\nReflections reflections = new Reflections(\n  new ConfigurationBuilder()\n    .forPackage(\"com.my.project\")\n    .filterInputsBy(new FilterBuilder().includePackage(\"com.my.project\").excludePackage(\"com.my.project.exclude\"))\n    .setScanners(TypesAnnotated, MethodsAnnotated, MethodsReturn));\n```\n\nNote that:\n* **Scanner must be configured in order to be queried, otherwise an empty result is returned**  \nIf not specified, default scanners will be used SubTypes, TypesAnnotated.  \nFor all standard scanners use `Scanners.values()`. See more scanners in the source [package](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/scanners).\n* **All relevant URLs should be configured**   \nConsider `.filterInputsBy()` in case too many classes are scanned.  \nIf required, Reflections will [expand super types](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/Reflections.html#expandSuperTypes(java.util.Map)) in order to get the transitive closure metadata without scanning large 3rd party urls.  \n* Classloader can optionally be used for resolving runtime classes from names.\n\n### Query\nOnce Reflections was instantiated and scanning was successful, it can be used for querying the indexed metadata.  \n\n```java\nimport static org.reflections.scanners.Scanners.*;\n\n// SubTypes\nSet<Class<?>> modules = \n  reflections.get(SubTypes.of(Module.class).asClass());\n\n// TypesAnnotated (*1)\nSet<Class<?>> singletons = \n  reflections.get(TypesAnnotated.with(Singleton.class).asClass());\n\n// MethodsAnnotated\nSet<Method> resources =\n  reflections.get(MethodsAnnotated.with(GetMapping.class).as(Method.class));\n\n// FieldsAnnotated\nSet<Field> ids = \n  reflections.get(FieldsAnnotated.with(Id.class).as(Field.class));\n\n// Resources\nSet<String> properties = \n  reflections.get(Resources.with(\".*\\\\.properties\"));\n```\n\nMore scanners:\n\n```java\n// MethodsReturn\nSet<Method> voidMethods = \n  reflections.get(MethodsReturn.with(void.class).as(Method.class));\n\n// MethodsSignature\nSet<Method> someMethods = \n  reflections.get(MethodsSignature.of(long.class, int.class).as(Method.class));\n\n// MethodsParameter\nSet<Method> pathParam = \n  reflections.get(MethodsParameter.of(PathParam.class).as(Method.class));\n\n// ConstructorsAnnotated\nSet<Constructor> injectables =\n  reflections.get(ConstructorsAnnotated.with(Inject.class).as(Constructor.class));\n\n// ConstructorsSignature\nSet<Constructor> someConstructors = \n  reflections.get(ConstructorsSignature.of(String.class).as(Constructor.class));\n\n// MethodParameterNamesScanner\nList<String> parameterNames =\n  reflections.getMemberParameterNames(member);\n\n// MemberUsageScanner\nSet<Member> usages =\n  reflections.getMemberUsages(member)\n```\n\n*See more examples in [ReflectionsQueryTest](src/test/java/org/reflections/ReflectionsQueryTest.java).*\n\n*Note that previous 0.9.x APIs are still supported*\n\n<details>\n  <summary><i>Compare Scanners and previous 0.9.x API (*)</i></summary>\n\n| Scanners | previous 0.9.x API | previous Scanner |\n| -------- | ------------------ | ------ |\n| `get(SubType.of(T))` | getSubTypesOf(T) | ~~SubTypesScanner~~ |\n| `get(SubTypes.of(`<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`TypesAnnotated.with(A)))` | getTypesAnnotatedWith(A) *(1)*| ~~TypeAnnotationsScanner~~ | \n| `get(MethodsAnnotated.with(A))` | getMethodsAnnotatedWith(A) | ~~MethodAnnotationsScanner~~ | \n| `get(ConstructorsAnnotated.with(A))` | getConstructorsAnnotatedWith(A) *(2)*| ~~MethodAnnotationsScanner~~ | \n| `get(FieldsAnnotated.with(A))` | getFieldsAnnotatedWith(A) | ~~FieldAnnotationsScanner~~ | \n| `get(Resources.with(regex))` | getResources(regex) | ~~ResourcesScanner~~ | \n| `get(MethodsParameter.with(P))` | getMethodsWithParameter(P) *(3)*<br>~~getMethodsWithAnyParamAnnotated(P)~~| ~~MethodParameterScanner~~<br>*obsolete* | \n| `get(MethodsSignature.of(P, ...))` | getMethodsWithSignature(P, ...) *(3)<br>~~getMethodsMatchParams(P, ...)~~*| \" | \n| `get(MethodsReturn.of(T))` | getMethodsReturn(T) *(3)*| \" | \n| `get(ConstructorsParameter.with(P))` | getConstructorsWithParameter(P) *(3)<br>~~getConstructorsWithAnyParamAnnotated(P)~~*| \" | \n| `get(ConstructorsSignature.of(P, ...))` | getConstructorsWithSignature(P, ...) *(3)<br>~~getConstructorsMatchParams(P, ...)~~*| \" | \n\n*Note: `asClass()` and `as()` mappings were omitted*\n\n*(1): The equivalent of `getTypesAnnotatedWith(A)` is `get(SubTypes.of(TypesAnnotated.with(A)))`, including SubTypes*  \n\n*(2): MethodsAnnotatedScanner does not include constructor annotation scanning, use instead Scanners.ConstructorsAnnotated*  \n\n*(3): MethodParameterScanner is obsolete, use instead as required:  \nScanners.MethodsParameter, Scanners.MethodsSignature, Scanners.MethodsReturn, Scanners.ConstructorsParameter, Scanners.ConstructorsSignature*\n</details>\n\n## ReflectionUtils\nApart from scanning classpath metadata using [Javassist](https://github.com/jboss-javassist/javassist), \nJava Reflection convenient methods are available using \n[ReflectionsUtils](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/ReflectionUtils.html):\n\n```java\nimport static org.reflections.ReflectionUtils.*;\n\nSet<Class<?>>    superTypes   = get(SuperTypes.of(T));\nSet<Field>       fields       = get(Fields.of(T));\nSet<Constructor> constructors = get(Constructors.of(T));\nSet<Methods>     methods      = get(Methods.of(T));\nSet<URL>         resources    = get(Resources.with(T));\n\nSet<Annotation>  annotations  = get(Annotations.of(T));\nSet<Class<? extends Annotation>> annotationTypes = get(AnnotationTypes.of(T));\n```\n\n*Previous ReflectionUtils 0.9.x API is still supported though marked for removal, more info in the javadocs.*\n\n## Query API\nEach Scanner and ReflectionUtils function implements [QueryBuilder](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/util/QueryBuilder.html), and supports:\n* `get()` - function returns direct values \n* `with()` or `of()` - function returns all transitive values\n\n*For example, `Scanners.SubTypes.get(T)` return direct subtypes, \nwhile `Scanners.SubTypes.of(T)` return transitive subtypes hierarchy. \nSame goes for `Scanners.TypesAnnotated` and `ReflectionUtils.SuperTypes` etc.*\n\nNext, each function implements [QueryFunction](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/util/QueryFunction.html), \nand provides fluent functional interface for composing `filter()`, `map()`, `flatMap()`, `as()` and more, such that:\n\n```java\n// filter, as/map\nQueryFunction<Store, Method> getters =\n  Methods.of(C1.class)\n    .filter(withModifier(Modifier.PUBLIC))\n    .filter(withPrefix(\"get\").and(withParametersCount(0)))\n    .as(Method.class);\n\n// compose Scanners and ReflectionUtils functions \nQueryFunction<Store, Method> methods = \n  SubTypes.of(type).asClass()  // <-- classpath scanned metadata\n    .flatMap(Methods::of);     // <-- java reflection api\n\n// function of function\nQueryFunction<Store, Class<? extends Annotation>> queryAnnotations = \n  Annotations.of(Methods.of(C4.class))\n    .map(Annotation::annotationType);\n```\n\nSee more in [ReflectionUtilsQueryTest](https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections/tree/master/src/test/java/org/reflections/ReflectionUtilsQueryTest.java)  \n\nA more complex example demonstrates getting merged annotations of rest controllers endpoints:\n```java\n// get all annotations of RequestMapping hierarchy (GetMapping, PostMapping, ...)\nSet<Class<?>> metaAnnotations =\n  reflections.get(TypesAnnotated.getAllIncluding(RequestMapping.class.getName()).asClass());\n\nQueryFunction<Store, Map<String, Object>> queryAnnotations =\n  // get all controller endpoint methods      \n  MethodsAnnotated.with(metaAnnotations).as(Method.class)\n    .map(method ->\n      // get both method's + declaring class's RequestMapping annotations   \n      get(Annotations.of(method.getDeclaringClass())\n        .add(Annotations.of(method))\n        .filter(a -> metaAnnotations.contains(a.annotationType())))\n        .stream()\n        // merge annotations' member values into a single hash map\n        .collect(new AnnotationMergeCollector(method)));\n\n// apply query and map merged hashmap into java annotation proxy\nSet<RequestMapping> mergedAnnotations = \n  reflections.get(mergedAnnotation\n    .map(map -> ReflectionUtils.toAnnotation(map, metaAnnotation)));\n```\n\nCheck the [tests](src/test/java/org/reflections) folder for more examples and API usage\n\n### What else?\n- **Integrating with build lifecycle**  \nIt is sometime useful to `Reflections.save()` the scanned metadata into xml/json as part of the build lifecycle for generating resources, \nand then collect it on bootstrap with `Reflections.collect()` and avoid scanning. *See [reflections-maven](https://github.com/ronmamo/reflections-maven/) for example*.\n- [JavaCodeSerializer](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/serializers/JavaCodeSerializer.html) - scanned metadata can be persisted into a generated Java source code. \nAlthough less common, it can be useful for accessing types and members in a strongly typed manner. *(see [example](src/test/java/org/reflections/MyTestModelStore.java))*\n- [AnnotationMergeCollector](https://ronmamo.github.io/reflections/org/reflections/util/AnnotationMergeCollector.html) - can be used to merge similar annotations. *(see [test](src/test/java/org/reflections/ReflectionUtilsQueryTest.java#L216))*\n- `MemberUsageScanner` - experimental scanner allow querying for member usages `getMemberUsages()` of packages/types/elements in the classpath.\nCan be used for finding usages between packages, layers, modules, types etc.  \n\n----\n\n*Spread the spirit of open-source and collaboration, clean code and simplicity*\n"
