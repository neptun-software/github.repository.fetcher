There are multiple ways to contribute.\n\n## Opening issues\n\nFor bugs or enhancement requests, please file a GitHub issue unless it's\nsecurity related. When filing a bug remember that the better written the bug is,\nthe more likely it is to be fixed. If you think you've found a security\nvulnerability, do not raise a GitHub issue and follow the instructions in our\n[security policy](./SECURITY.md).\n\nWhen submitting a new Issue for what seems is a bug, please note the versions\n(OpenGrok, Tomcat, Universal ctags etc.) you're running and ideally steps to reproduce.\n\nMake sure to add a comment line to the changeset saying which Issue it is fixing,\ne.g. `fixes #XYZ` so that the issue can be automatically closed when the associated\npull request is merged.\n\n## Contributing code\n\nWe welcome your code contributions. Before submitting code via a pull request,\nyou will need to have signed the [Oracle Contributor Agreement][OCA] (OCA) and\nyour commits need to include the following line using the name and e-mail\naddress you used to sign the OCA:\n\n```text\nSigned-off-by: Your Name <you@example.org>\n```\n\nThis can be automatically added to pull requests by committing with `--sign-off`\nor `-s`, e.g.\n\n```text\ngit commit --signoff\n```\n\nOnly pull requests from committers that can be verified as having signed the OCA\ncan be accepted.\n\n## Pull request process\n\nEach pull request should be accompanied by a comment explaining how the change\nwas tested, unless unit tests are provided/updated.\nPlease make every effort to make most of your changes covered by tests. Also,\nfor more complicated changes, please make any effort to explain the rationale\nbehind the changes (providing answers to the 'why ?' questions is very important).\n\nPlease follow pre-existing coding style.\n\nAsking questions via creating new [discussion](https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/discussions) is fine.\n\nFeel free to add a Copyright line to the source files where you made non-trivial changes.\n\n1. Ensure there is an issue created to track and discuss the fix or enhancement\n   you intend to submit.\n1. Fork this repository.\n1. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using\n   the issue number as part of your branch name, e.g. `1234-fixes`.\n1. Ensure that any documentation is updated with the changes that are required\n   by your change.\n1. Ensure that any samples are updated if the base image has been changed.\n1. Submit the pull request. *Do not leave the pull request blank*. Explain exactly\n   what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate.\n   your changes. Ensure that you reference the issue you created as well.\n1. We will assign the pull request to 2-3 people for review before it is merged.\n\n## Code of conduct\n\nFollow the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). If you'd\nlike more specific guidelines, see the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct][COC].\n\n[OCA]: https://oca.opensource.oracle.com\n[COC]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct/\n"

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\na) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\ndocumentation distributed under this Agreement, and b) in the case of each\nsubsequent Contributor: i) changes to the Program, and ii) additions to the\nProgram; where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\nand are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\nContributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\nContributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are\nseparate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program\nunder their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the\nProgram. \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the\nProgram.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\nreproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\ndistribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\nsuch derivative works, in source code and object code form. b) Subject to\nthe terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a\nnon-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents\nto make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\nContribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code\nform. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution\nand the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\nContributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be\ncovered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\nother combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\nlicensed hereunder. c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor\ngrants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\nprovided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or\nother intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\ndisclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity\nbased on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a\ncondition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each\nRecipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other\nintellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\npatent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it\nis Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing\nthe Program. d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\nsufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the\ncopyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\n\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and b) its\nlicense agreement: i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors\nall warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\nconditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\nconditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; ii)\neffectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\ndamages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\ndamages, such as lost profits; iii) states that any provisions which differ\nfrom this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any\nother party; and iv) states that source code for the Program is available\nfrom such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\nreasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software\nexchange. When the Program is made available in source code form:\n\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and b) a copy of this\nAgreement must be included with each copy of the Program. Contributors may\nnot remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program. Each\nContributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\nany, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify\nthe originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor\nwho includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a\nmanner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors.\nTherefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to\ndefend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from\nclaims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against\nthe Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of\nsuch Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\nProgram in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do\nnot apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing\nof such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and\ncooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related\nsettlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any\nsuch claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\nthat Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\nwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\nsuch Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\nCommercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON\nAN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR\nCONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks\nassociated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but\nnot limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with\napplicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\nLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\nOF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\nremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\nparties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\nnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\nunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and\ndoes not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming\naware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement\nterminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as\nsoon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this\nAgreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program\nshall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but\nin order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right\nto publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\ntime. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\nAgreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\nEclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\nSteward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement\nwill be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\nAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of\nthe Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\nstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\nlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this\nAgreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All\nrights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are\nreserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury\ntrial in any resulting litigation.\n"

Distribution Obligations.\n\n    3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make\n    available in Executable form must also be made available in Source\n    Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under\n    the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this\n    License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered\n    Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must\n    inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form\n    as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code\n    form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n    used for software exchange.\n\n    3.2. Modifications.\n\n    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You\n    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or\n    You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this\n    License.\n\n    3.3. Required Notices.\n\n    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that\n    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may\n    not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices\n    contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing\n    or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or\n    the Initial Developer.\n\n    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\n    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in\n    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version\n    of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may\n    choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of\n    Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,\n    and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.\n    You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You\n    hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every\n    Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or\n    such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability terms You offer.\n\n    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software\n    under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of\n    Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\n    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\n    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to\n    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from\n    the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the\n    Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You\n    must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from\n    this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n    Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the\n    Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred\n    by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any\n    such terms You offer.\n\n    3.6. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with\n    other code not governed by the terms of this License and\n    distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,\n    You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled\n    for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n    4.1. New Versions.\n\n    Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may\n    publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to\n    time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.\n    Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license\n    steward has the right to modify this License.\n\n    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n    License under which You originally received the Covered Software.\n    If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original\n    Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made\n    available under any subsequent version of the License, You must\n    distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms\n    of the version of the License under which You originally received\n    the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,\n    distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under\n    the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by\n    the license steward.\n\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new\n    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a\n    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license\n    and remove any references to the name of the license steward\n    (except to note that the license differs from this License); and\n    (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which\n    differ from this License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\"\n    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED\n    SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\n    PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.

THIS DISCLAIMER OF\n    WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF\n    ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS\n    DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\n    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond\n    the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\n    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\n    assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that\n    the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where\n    the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where\n    the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if\n    the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors\n    under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days\n    notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically\n    at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within\n    such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the\n    Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally\n    or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n    6.3.

Contact us](#5-contact-us)\n  - [6. Run as container](#6-run-as-container)\n\n## 1. Introduction\n\nOpenGrok is a fast and usable source code search and cross reference\nengine, written in Java. It helps you search, cross-reference and navigate\nyour source tree. It can understand various program file formats and\nversion control histories of many source code management systems.\n\nOfficial page of the project is on:\n<https://oracle.github.io/opengrok/>\n\n## 2. Installation\n\nSee https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/wiki/How-to-setup-OpenGrok\n\n### 2. 1. Updating\n\nOpenGrok uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) and the version components further indicate more details about updating to newer version. The version scheme is *major.minor.micro* and change in any component is interpreted as:\n\n- major - major backwards incompatible update, will require full reindex as well as configuration changes\n- minor - full clean reindex of your repositories is needed (e. g. index format has changed)\n- micro - redeploy web application\n\nGenerally it is possible to go backward only within the micro version.\n\n## 3. Information for developers\n\nSee https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/wiki/Developer-intro and https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/wiki/Developers\n\n## 4. Authors\n\nThe project has been originally conceived in [Sun Microsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems) by Chandan B.N.\n\nFor full list of contributors see https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/graphs/contributors\n\n## 5. Contact us\n\nUse the [Github Discussions](https://github.com/oracle/opengrok/discussions).\n\n## 6. Run as container\n\nYou can run OpenGrok as a Docker container as described [here](docker/README.md).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis project welcomes contributions from the community. Before submitting a pull request, please [review our contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Security\n\nPlease consult the [security guide](./SECURITY.md) for our responsible security vulnerability disclosure process\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2006, 2024 Oracle and/or its affiliates.\n"

The following endpoints are accessible under `/api/v1` with the exception of `/metrics`.\n\nBesides `/suggester`, `/search`, `/system/ping` and `/metrics` endpoints, everything is accessible from `localhost` only\nunless authentication bearer tokens are configured in the web application and used via the 'Authorization' HTTP header\n(within HTTPS connection).\n\nSome of the APIs are asynchronous. They return status code 202 (Accepted) and a Location header that contains the URL\nfor the status endpoint to check for the result of the API call. Once the status API returns result other than 202,\nthe client should issue DELETE request to this URL to clean up server resources.\n\nFor all entry points that modify web application configuration it is worth noting that\nthe configuration has to be retrieved and stored on disk (using the configuration specific\nentry points) in order to be persistent (e.g. in case of application server restart or\nweb application redeploy).\n\n## Annotation [/annotation{?path}]\n\n### Get annotation for a file [GET]\n\n+ Parameters\n  + path (string) - path of file, relative to source root\n\n+ Response 200 (application/json)\n  + Body\n\n            [\n              {\n                \"revision\": \"c55d5891\",\n                \"author\": \"Adam Hornáček\",\n                \"description\": \"changeset: c55d5891\\nsummary: Rewrite README.txt to use markdown syntax\\nuser: Adam Hornáček <adam.hornacek@oracle.com>\\ndate: Wed Aug 30 17:42:12 CEST 2017\",\n                \"version\": \"1/15\"\n              },\n              {\n                \"revision\": \"5e0c6b22\",\n                \"author\": \"Vladimir Kotal\",\n                \"description\": \"changeset: 5e0c6b22\\nsummary: bump year\\nuser: Vladimir Kotal <vlada@devnull.cz>\\ndate: Thu Jul 18 14:43:01 CEST 2019\",\n                \"version\": \"14/15\"\n              }\n            ]\n\n## Authorization framework reload [/configuration/authorization/reload]\n\n### reloads authorization framework [POST]\n\nThis is asynchronous API endpoint.\n\n+ Request (application/text)\n\n+ Response 204\n\n## Configuration [/configuration]\n\n### return XML representation of configuration [GET]\n\n+ Response 200 (application/xml)\n  + Body\n\n        ```\n        <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n        <java version=\"1.8.0_172\" class=\"java.beans.XMLDecoder\">\n         <object class=\"org.opengrok.indexer.configuration.Configuration\" id=\"Configuration0\">\n          <void property=\"allowLeadingWildcard\">\n           <boolean>true</boolean>\n          </void>\n         </object>\n        </java>\n        ```\n\n### sets configuration from XML representation [PUT]\n\nThis is asynchronous API endpoint.\n\n+ Request (application/xml)\n  + Body\n\n        ```\n        <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n        <java version=\"1.8.0_172\" class=\"java.beans.XMLDecoder\">\n         <object class=\"org.opengrok.indexer.configuration.Configuration\" id=\"Configuration0\">\n          <void property=\"allowLeadingWildcard\">\n           <boolean>true</boolean>\n          </void>\n         </object>\n        </java>\n        ```\n\n+ Response 201 (application/json)\n\n## Configuration field [/configuration/{field}{?reindex}]\n\n### returns specific configuration field [GET]\n\n+ Response 200 (application/json)\n\n### sets specific configuration field [PUT]\n\nThis is asynchronous API endpoint.\n\n+ Parameters\n  + reindex (boolean) - specifies if the underlying data were also reindexed (refreshes some searchers and additional data structures)\n\n+ Request (application/text)\n\n        string value of the field to set\n\n+ Response 204\n\n## File content [/file/content{?path}]\n\n### get file content [GET]\n\nHonors the `Accept` header.
