There are few formal roles--an \nindividual's word carries weight in accordance with their contribution to the project. \nDecisions are made by consensus, rather than voting--most decisions are of interest only \nto members of the community who will be affected by it. The combination of public mailing lists \nand consensus ensures that any person who could be affected by a decision both finds out about it,\nand has a voice in the discussion.\n\n## Roles and Responsibilities\n\n\nThere are quite a few ways to participate on projects within the GlassFish community, \nand not all of them involve contributing source code to a project! Simply using the software, \nparticipating on mailing lists, or filing bug reports or enhancement requests is an incredibly valuable \nform of participation.\n\nIf one were to break down the forms of participation in GlassFish projects into a set of roles, \nthe result would look something like this: Users, Contributors, Committers, Maintainers, and Project Lead.\n\n### Users\n\nUsers are the people who use the software. Users are using the software, reporting bugs, \nmaking feature requests and suggestions. This is by far the most important category of people. \nWithout users, there is no reason for the project.\n\nHow to become one: Download the software and use it to build an application.\n\n### Contributors\n\nContributors are individuals who contribute to a GlassFish project, but do not have write access \nto the source tree. Contributions can be in the form of source code patches, new code, or bug reports, \nbut could also include web site content like articles, FAQs, or screenshots.\n\nA contributor who has sent in solid, useful source code patches on a project can be elevated \nto committer status by the maintainer.\n\nIntegration of a Contributors' submissions is at the discretion of the project maintainer, but this is \nan iterative, communicative process. Note that for code to be integrated, a completed \nOracle Contribution Agreement (OCA) is required from each contributor. See the [OCA policy](#oca-policy) \nfor info.\n\nHow to become one: Contribute in any of the ways described above: either code, examples, \nweb site updates, tests, bugs, and patches. If you're interested in becoming a Committer to the source base, \nget the sources to the project, make an improvement or fix a bug, and send that code \nto the developers mailing list or attach it to the bug report in the project issue tracking system.\n\n### Committers\n\nCommitters have write access to the source tree, either for the individual modules they are working on, \nor in some cases global write permissions everywhere in the source code management system.\n\nA committer must complete and send in a OCA to commit code. See the [OCA policy](#oca-policy) for info.\n\nRules for how to commit, once you have commit access, will vary by project and module. Be sure to ask \nbefore you start making changes!\n\nHow to become one: Submit some patches via email, and ask the maintainer of the code you've patched \nfor commit access. The maintainer will seek consensus before granting Committer access, but their \ndecisions are final.\n\n### Maintainers\n\nEach module has one maintainer, who has check-in permissions (either for that module or globally), \nand \"manages\" a group of Committers. They are responsible for merging contributors' patches, bug fixes, \nand new code from the development branch of the source tree into the stable branch. \nMaintainers are responsible for making sure that these contributions do not break the build.\n\nThe Maintainer is also responsible for checking that everyone who contributes code has submitted a OCA. \nSee the [OCA policy](#oca-policy) for info.\n\nA Maintainer is responsible for their module, and for granting check-in privileges to contributors. \nThey also act as the \"police force\" of the module, helping to ensure quality across the build.\n\nHow to become one: Start a module (you need to have written some working code on your project to do this, \nyou'll also need to talk to the Project Lead). Have responsibility for that module handed over to you \nfrom the current Maintainer. Take over an abandoned project--sometimes someone starts something, \nbut for one reason or another can't continue to work on it. If it's interesting to you, volunteer!\n\n### Project Lead\n\nEach project in the GlassFish community has an overall Project Lead. The Project Leads are currently appointed \nby Oracle. They are responsible for managing the entire project, helping to create policies by consensus \nthat ensure global quality.\n\n## OCA Policy\n\nThe first step to contributing code or submitting a patch is to sign and return a signed copy of the \n[Contributor Agreement][oca-agreement]. Please print this form out, fill in all the necessary detail, \nscan it in, and return it via e-mail : `oracle-ca_us [at] oracle [dot] com`. \n\nThe [main OCA page][oca-main] has more information and the list of current signatories. You may also want to read \nthe [Contributor agreement FAQ][oca-faq].\n\n[oca-agreement]: http://oss.oracle.com/oca.pdf\n[oca-main]: http://oracle.com/technetwork/goto/oca\n[oca-faq]: http://oss.oracle.com/oca-faq.pdf\n"

Application of Additional Terms.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>You  may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source  Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this  License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer,  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability  obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However,  you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the  Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely  clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability  obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify  the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability  incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of  warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>3.5.

Except as provided in Section 4.3, no  one other than the license steward has the right to modify this  License.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>4.2.  Effect of New Versions.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>You  may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered  Software available under the terms of the version of the License  under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the  Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software  prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available  under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and  make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of  the License under which You originally received the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make  the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent  version of the License published by the license steward.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>4.3.  Modified Versions.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>When  You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for  Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of  this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references  to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license  differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the  license contains terms which differ from this License.</blockquote>\r\n<p>5.  DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>COVERED  SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; BASIS,  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF  DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR  NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF  THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER  CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR  CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART  OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED  HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>6.  TERMINATION.</p>\r\n<blockquote>6.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.  Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the  termination of this License shall survive.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>6.2.  If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory  judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the  Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim  is referred to as &ldquo;Participant&rdquo;) alleging that the Participant  Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a  Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the  Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then  any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such  Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not  the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2  of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate  prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day  notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your  claim with respect to the Participant Software against such  Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement  with Participant.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>6.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant  alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly  infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license  or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement  litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such  Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in  determining the amount or value of any payment or license.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>6.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end  user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any  distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses  granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.</blockquote>\r\n<p>7.  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>UNDER  NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING  NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL  DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED  SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY  PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR  LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR  ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY  SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS  LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR  PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT  APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT  ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>8.  U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>The  Covered Software is a &ldquo;commercial item,&rdquo; as that term is defined  in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of &ldquo;commercial computer  software&rdquo; (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. &sect;  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and &ldquo;commercial computer software  documentation&rdquo; as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept.  1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1  through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire  Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S.  Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other  FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government  rights in computer software under this License.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>9.  MISCELLANEOUS.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>This  License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter  hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,  such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make  it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the  jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original  Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides  otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the  jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue  specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with  the losing party responsible for costs, including, without  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the  International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be  construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You  agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United  States export administration regulations (and the export control laws  and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or  otherwise make available any Covered Software.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>10.  RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n    <p>As  between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is  responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,  out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to  work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such  responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>NOTICE  PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION  LICENSE (CDDL)</p>\r\n<p>The  code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the  State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any  litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the  jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of  California and the state courts of the State of California, with  venue lying in Santa Clara County, California. </p>\r\n<p><br />\r\n    <br />\r\n</p>\r\n<h1><strong>The  GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991</strong></h1>\r\n<p>Copyright  (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br />\r\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA </p>\r\n<p>Everyone  is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br />\r\n    of this  license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Preamble</strong></p>\r\n<p>The  licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to  share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is  intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free  software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This  General Public License applies to most of the Free Software  Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit  to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered  by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it  to your programs, too.</p>\r\n<p>When  we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have  the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for  this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it  if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it  in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>\r\n<p>To  protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone  to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These  restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you  distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>\r\n<p>For  example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis  or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you  have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the  source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their  rights.</p>\r\n<p>We  protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and  (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,  distribute and/or modify the software.</p>\r\n<p>Also,  for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that  everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free  software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,  we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the  original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect  on the original authors' reputations.</p>\r\n<p>Finally,  any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We  wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will  individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program  proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent  must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.</p>\r\n<p>The  precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and  modification follow.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TERMS  AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>0</strong>.  This License applies to any program or other work which contains a  notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed  under the terms of this General Public License. The &quot;Program&quot;,  below, refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on  the Program&quot; means either the Program or any derivative work  under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or  a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or  translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is  included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>\r\n<p>Activities  other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by  this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the  Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered  only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program  (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether  that is true depends on what the Program does.</p>\r\n<p><strong>1</strong>.  You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you  conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate  copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the  notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any  warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this  License along with the Program.</p>\r\n<p>You  may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you  may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2</strong>.  You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of  it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute  such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above,  provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>\r\n<blockquote>a)  You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating  that you changed the files and the date of any change.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>b)  You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole  or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part  thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties  under the terms of this License.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>c)  If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when  run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use  in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement  including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is  no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that  users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and  telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if  the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an  announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print  an announcement.)</blockquote>\r\n<p>These  requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable  sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be  reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,  then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when  you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the  same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the  Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this  License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire  whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>\r\n<p>Thus,  it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your  rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to  exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or  collective works based on the Program.</p>\r\n<p>In  addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program  with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of  a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under  the scope of this License.</p>\r\n<p><strong>3</strong>.  You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under  Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the  following:</p>\r\n<blockquote>a)  Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source  code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2  above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>b)  Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to  give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of  physically performing source distribution, a complete  machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be  distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium  customarily used for software interchange; or,</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>c)  Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to  distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed  only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the  program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in  accord with Subsection b above.)</blockquote>\r\n<p>The  source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for  making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source  code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any  associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to  control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a  special exception, the source code distributed need not include  anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary  form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the  operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component  itself accompanies the executable.</p>\r\n<p>If  distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access  to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to  copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of  the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy  the source along with the object code.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4</strong>.  You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program  except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this  License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from  you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so  long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>5</strong>.  You are not required to accept this License, since you have not  signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or  distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by  modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the  Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and  all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying  the Program or works based on it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>6</strong>.  Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the  Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the  original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject  to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted  herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third  parties to this License.</p>\r\n<p><strong>7</strong>.  If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent  infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),  conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or  otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do  not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot  distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under  this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a  consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example,  if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of  the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly  through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this  License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the  Program.</p>\r\n<p>If  any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under  any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended  to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other  circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>It  is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any  patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any  such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the  integrity of the free software distribution system, which is  implemented by public license practices. Many people have made  generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed  through that system in reliance on consistent application of that  system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is  willing to distribute software through any other system and a  licensee cannot impose that choice.</p>\r\n<p>This  section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a  consequence of the rest of this License.</p>\r\n<p><strong>8</strong>.  If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in  certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the  original copyright holder who places the Program under this License  may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding  those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among  countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates  the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</p>\r\n<p><strong>9</strong>.  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions  of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions  will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in  detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>\r\n<p>Each  version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program  specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and  &quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the  terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version  published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not  specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version  ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>10</strong>.  If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free  programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the  author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by  the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;  we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by  the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our  free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software  generally.</p>\r\n<p>NO  WARRANTY</p>\r\n<p><strong>11</strong>.  BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY  FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT  WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER  PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY  KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE  IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR  PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE  PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME  THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>\r\n<p><strong>12</strong>.  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING  WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR  REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR  DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL  DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM  (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED  INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE  OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH  HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH  DAMAGES.</p>\r\n<p>END  OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>\r\n<p><strong>How  to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</strong></p>\r\n<p>If  you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest  possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make  it free software which everyone can redistribute and change under  these terms.</p>\r\n<p>To  do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to  attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least  the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice  is found.</p>\r\n<blockquote>One  line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it  does.<br />\r\n    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt; &lt;name of author&gt;</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>This  program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it  under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the  Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at  your option) any later version.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>This  program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU  General Public License for more details.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>You  should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along  with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,  Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA</blockquote>\r\n<p>Also  add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>\r\n<p>If  the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this  when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Gnomovision  version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes with  ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free  software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain  conditions; type `show c' for details.</blockquote>\r\n<p>The  hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the  appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the  commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and  `show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever  suits your program.</p>\r\n<p>You  should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your  school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the  program, if necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Yoyodyne,  Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James  Hacker.</blockquote>\r\n<blockquote>signature  of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989<br />\r\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice</blockquote>\r\n<p>This  General Public License does not permit incorporating your program  into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library,  you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary  applications with the library. If this is what you want to do, use  the GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.</p>\r\n<hr />\r\n<li style=\"background-color:yellow;\">\r\n    <p>Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its\r\n        affiliates are subject to the following clarification and special\r\n        exception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its\r\n        Classpath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only\r\n        where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's\r\n        header the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to\r\n        the \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file\r\n        that accompanied this code.\"</p>\r\n    <p>You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent\r\n        programs in this software package. Some of those programs are provided\r\n        under licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software\r\n        Foundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs\r\n        licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are\r\n        licensed to you under their original licenses.</p>\r\n    <p>Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding\r\n        the Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which\r\n        permits you to use that code in combination with other independent\r\n        modules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would\r\n        not permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with\r\n        Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such\r\n        code into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then\r\n        distributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the\r\n        Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and\r\n        distribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or\r\n        all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and\r\n        since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\r\n        included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\r\n        Exception could therefore effectively compromise your ability to\r\n        further distribute the package.</p>\r\n    <p>Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a\r\n        lawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath\r\n        Exception or making modifications to this package which may\r\n        subsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party\r\n        software.</p>\r\n\r\n    <p><strong>CLASSPATH EXCEPTION</strong><br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is  making a combined work based on this library.&nbsp; Thus, the terms  and conditions of the GNU General Public License Version 2 cover the  whole combination. <br />\r\n        <br />\r\n        As a special exception, the  copyright holders of this library give you permission to link  this library with independent modules to produce an executable,  regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and  to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent  module, the terms and conditions of the license of that module.&nbsp;  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or  based on this library.&nbsp; If you modify this library, you may  extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are  not obligated to do so.&nbsp; If you do not wish to do so, delete  this exception statement from your version.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</body>\r\n</html>\r\n"

License Grants.\n\n    2.1. The Initial Developer Grant.\n\n    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject\n    to third party intellectual property claims, the Initial Developer\n    hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n\n    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n    trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,\n    modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original\n    Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,\n    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of\n    Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and\n    offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software\n    (or portions thereof).\n\n    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on\n    the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the\n    Original Software available to a third party under the terms of this\n    License.\n\n    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\n    granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or\n    (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the\n    Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software\n    with other software or devices.\n\n    2.2. Contributor Grant.\n\n    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject\n    to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby\n    grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n\n    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n    trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,\n    display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\n    created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an\n    unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software\n    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling\n    of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in\n    combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n    otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or\n    portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by\n    that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n    combination).\n\n    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective\n    on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the\n    Modifications available to a third party.\n\n    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n    granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n    Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third\n    party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination\n    of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software\n    (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)\n    under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n    3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n    in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form\n    and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every\n    copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute\n    or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such\n    Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such\n    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or\n    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\n    3.2. Modifications.\n\n    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You\n    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You\n    have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n    3.3. Required Notices.\n\n    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that\n    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not\n    remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained\n    within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any\n    descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the\n    Initial Developer.\n\n    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\n    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in\n    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of\n    this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to\n    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n    However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\n    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under\n    the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your\n    choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\n    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\n    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to\n    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from\n    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered\n    Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make\n    it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\n    are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or\n    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n    Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    3.6. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with\n    other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute\n    the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make\n    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered\n    Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n    4.1. New Versions.\n\n    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or\n    new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be\n    given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section\n    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify\n    this License.\n\n    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If\n    the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software\n    prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available\n    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n    make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version\n    of the License under which You originally received the Covered\n    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or\n    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any\n    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new\n    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a\n    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and\n    remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to\n    note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise\n    make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this\n    License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE\n    IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\n    THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\n    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS\n    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\n    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n    termination of this License shall survive.\n\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\n    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\n    assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that the\n    Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the\n    Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the\n    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice\n    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the\n    expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60\n    day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n    Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to\n    a written agreement with Participant.\n\n    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by\n    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n    license.\n\n    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,\n    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\n    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\n    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE\n    TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\n    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\n    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\n    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION\n    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\n    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n    software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. ß\n    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software documentation\"\n    as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\n    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\n    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software\n    with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\n    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other\n    clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer\n    software under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n    the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within\n    the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\n    provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law\n    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject\n    to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and\n    venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,\n    with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n    limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\n    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\n    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\n    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You\n    agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n    States export administration regulations (and the export control\n    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute\n    or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\nLICENSE (CDDL)\n\nThe code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the\nState of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any\nlitigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction\nof the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the\nstate courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara\nCounty, California.\n\n\n\n  The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\nBoston, MA 02110-1335\nUSA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\nshare and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\nLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\nto any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\nSoftware Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\nservice if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\nYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\nbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\nto any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\neither the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\nto say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\nverbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\nthe Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\nthat you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n    under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n    is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\ncan be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\nthe Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\nstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\nscope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n    accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\nmeans all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\nexception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\nto copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\nthe source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\ncode, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\nalong with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\nnot have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\nfull compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\nits terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\nso as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\nany other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\ndistribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\nnot permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\nreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\nby public license practices. Many people have made generous\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\nsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\nthe author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\na consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\nadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\nFree Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\nYOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\nOTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n    General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\n    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\nyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\ncould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\n    James Hacker.\n\n    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\nwith the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\nGeneral Public License instead of this License.\n\n#\n\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its\naffiliates are subject to the following clarification and special\nexception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its\nClasspath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only\nwhere Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's\nheader the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to\nthe \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file\nthat accompanied this code.\"\n\nYou should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent\nprograms in this software package. Some of those programs are provided\nunder licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software\nFoundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs\nlicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are\nlicensed to you under their original licenses.\n\nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding\nthe Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which\npermits you to use that code in combination with other independent\nmodules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would\nnot permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with\nOracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such\ncode into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then\ndistributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the\nClasspath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and\ndistribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or\nall of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and\nsince the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\nincluded in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\nException could therefore effectively compromise your ability to\nfurther distribute the package.\n\nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a\nlawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath\nException or making modifications to this package which may\nsubsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party\nsoftware.\n\nCLASSPATH EXCEPTION\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\nmaking a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\nconditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\ncombination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\nmodules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\nterms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\nindependent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\nmodule.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\nbased on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\nexception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\ndo so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\nfrom your version.\n"

These\r\n* restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\n* distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n*\r\n* For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\r\n* or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\r\n* You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\r\n* And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\r\n*\r\n* We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n* (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\n* distribute and/or modify the software.\r\n*\r\n* Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\n* that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\n* software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\n* want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\n* that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\n* authors' reputations.\r\n*\r\n* Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\r\n* We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\r\n* individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\r\n* proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\r\n* be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n*\r\n* The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\n* modification follow.\r\n*\r\n* TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n*\r\n* 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\r\n* notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\r\n* the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\r\n* to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\r\n* either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\r\n* to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\r\n* verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\r\n* (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\r\n* \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n*\r\n* Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\n* covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\r\n* the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\r\n* covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\r\n* (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\r\n* is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n*\r\n* 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\r\n* code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\r\n* and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\r\n* and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\r\n* this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\r\n* recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\r\n*\r\n* You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\n* you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n*\r\n* 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\r\n* it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\r\n* such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\r\n* that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n*\r\n*     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\r\n*     that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n*\r\n*     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole\r\n*     or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof,\r\n*     to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the\r\n*     terms of this License.\r\n*\r\n*     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when\r\n*     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in\r\n*     the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\r\n*     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\r\n*     else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may\r\n*     redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user\r\n*     how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is\r\n*     interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work\r\n*     based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n*\r\n* These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\r\n* identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\r\n* can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\n* themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\n* sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\r\n* distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\r\n* the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\r\n* License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\r\n* whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n*\r\n* Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\n* your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\n* exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\n* collective works based on the Program.\r\n*\r\n* In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\n* with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\r\n* storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\r\n* scope of this License.\r\n*\r\n* 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\r\n* Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections\r\n* 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n*\r\n*     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\r\n*     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2\r\n*     above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n*\r\n*     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\r\n*     give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\r\n*     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\r\n*     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n*     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n*\r\n*     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\r\n*     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only\r\n*     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\r\n*     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\r\n*     Subsection b above.)\r\n*\r\n* The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\n* making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\r\n* means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\n* associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\r\n* compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\r\n* exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\r\n* normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\r\n* components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\r\n* which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\r\n* executable.\r\n*\r\n* If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\r\n* to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\r\n* the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\r\n* code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\r\n* along with the object code.\r\n*\r\n* 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\n* except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\r\n* to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\r\n* automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\r\n* who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\r\n* not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\r\n* full compliance.\r\n*\r\n* 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\n* signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\n* distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\r\n* prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\r\n* modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\n* Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\r\n* its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\r\n* Program or works based on it.\r\n*\r\n* 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\n* Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\n* original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\n* these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\r\n* on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\r\n* responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\r\n*\r\n* 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\n* infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\n* conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\n* otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\n* excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\r\n* so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\r\n* any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\r\n* distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\r\n* not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\r\n* receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\r\n* could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\r\n* distribution of the Program.\r\n*\r\n* If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\n* any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\n* apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\n* circumstances.\r\n*\r\n* It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\n* patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\n* such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\n* integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\r\n* by public license practices. Many people have made generous\r\n* contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\r\n* system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\r\n* the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\r\n* software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\r\n* choice.\r\n*\r\n* This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\r\n* a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n*\r\n* 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\n* certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\n* original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\r\n* add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\r\n* countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\r\n* not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\r\n* limitation as if written in the body of this License.\r\n*\r\n* 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\r\n* of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\r\n* be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\r\n* address new problems or concerns.\r\n*\r\n* Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\r\n* specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\r\n* later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\r\n* conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\r\n* the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\r\n* number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\r\n* Free Software Foundation.\r\n*\r\n* 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\r\n* programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\r\n* author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\r\n* Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\r\n* sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\r\n* two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\r\n* software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\r\n*\r\n* NO WARRANTY\r\n*\r\n* 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\r\n* FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN\r\n* OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\r\n* PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER\r\n* EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\r\n* WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\r\n* ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\r\n* YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\r\n* NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\r\n*\r\n* 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\r\n* WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\r\n* AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\r\n* DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\r\n* DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\r\n* (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\r\n* INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\r\n* THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\r\n* OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n*\r\n* END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n*\r\n* How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\r\n*\r\n* If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\r\n* possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\r\n* free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these\r\n* terms.\r\n*\r\n* To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\r\n* attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\r\n* the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\r\n* \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\r\n*\r\n*     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\r\n*     Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\r\n*\r\n*     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\r\n*     under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the\r\n*     Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your\r\n*     option) any later version.\r\n*\r\n*     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\r\n*     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\n*     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General\r\n*     Public License for more details.\r\n*\r\n*     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\r\n*     with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\r\n*     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\r\n*\r\n* Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\r\n*\r\n* If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\r\n* when it starts in an interactive mode:\r\n*\r\n*     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision\r\n*     comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is\r\n*     free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain\r\n*     conditions; type `show c' for details.\r\n*\r\n* The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\r\n* appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\r\n* you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\r\n* could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\r\n*\r\n* You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\r\n* school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\r\n* necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\r\n*\r\n*     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\r\n*     `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\r\n*\r\n*     signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\r\n*     Ty Coon, President of Vice\r\n*\r\n* This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\r\n* into proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\r\n* may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\r\n* with the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\r\n* General Public License instead of this License.\r\n*\r\n*\r\n*\r\n* \"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL VERSION 2\r\n*\r\n* Certain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its affiliates\r\n* are subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPLv2,\r\n* based on the GNU Project exception for its Classpath libraries, known as the\r\n* GNU Classpath Exception, but only where Oracle has expressly included in the\r\n* particular source file's header the words \"Oracle designates this particular\r\n* file as subject to the \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the\r\n* LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\r\n*   You should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent programs in\r\n* this software package. Some of those programs are provided under licenses\r\n* deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software Foundation and others.\r\n* For example, the package includes programs licensed under the Apache License,\r\n* Version 2.0.  Such programs are licensed to you under their original licenses.\r\n*   Oracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding the\r\n* Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which permits you\r\n* to use that code in combination with other independent modules not licensed\r\n* under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would not permit you to commingle\r\n* code under an incompatible license with Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for\r\n* example, cutting and pasting such code into a file also containing Oracle's\r\n* GPLv2 licensed code and then distributing the result.  Additionally, if you\r\n* were to remove the Classpath Exception from any of the files to which it\r\n* applies and distribute the result, you would likely be required to license\r\n* some or all of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well,\r\n* and since the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\r\n* included in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath Exception could\r\n* therefore effectively compromise your ability to further distribute the package.\r\n*\r\n* Proceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a lawyer\r\n* skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath Exception or\r\n* making modifications to this package which may subsequently be redistributed\r\n* and/or involve the use of third party software.\r\n*\r\n* CLASSPATH EXCEPTION\r\n* Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making a\r\n* combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU\r\n* General Public License version 2 cover the whole combination.\r\n*\r\n* As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\r\n* permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\r\n* executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules, and\r\n* to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your choice,\r\n* provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and\r\n* conditions of the license of that module.  An independent module is a module\r\n* which is not derived from or based on this library.  If you modify this library,\r\n* you may extend this exception to your version of the library, but you are not\r\n* obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception\r\n* statement from your version.\r\n\r\n== Source Code\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/jersey/jersey.git\r\n\r\n== Copyright Holders\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2013-2018 Oracle and/or its affiliates.

Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\r\n* protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\r\n* Related Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\r\n* limited to, the following:\r\n*\r\n*   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\r\n*      communicate, and translate a Work;\r\n*  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\r\n* iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or\r\n*      likeness depicted in a Work;\r\n*  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\r\n*      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\r\n*   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\r\n*      in a Work;\r\n*  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\r\n*      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\r\n*      protection of databases, and under any national implementation\r\n*      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\r\n*      directive); and\r\n* vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\r\n*      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\r\n*      implementations thereof.\r\n*\r\n* 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\r\n* of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\r\n* irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\r\n* Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\r\n* of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\r\n* future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\r\n* worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\r\n* treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\r\n* medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\r\n* including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\r\n* purposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\r\n* member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and\r\n* successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\r\n* revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\r\n* equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\r\n* as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.\r\n*\r\n* 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\r\n* be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\r\n* Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\r\n* account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n*      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n*      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n*      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n*      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n*      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n*      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n*\r\n*   6.

Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n*      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n*      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n*      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n*      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n*      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n*      PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n*      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n*      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n*      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n*      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n*      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n*      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n*      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n*      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n*      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n*\r\n*   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n*\r\n*   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n*\r\n*      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n*      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n*      replaced with your own identifying information.

Jersey is included in this list of projects and we are pleased to announce that the initial contribution has taken place. Jersey is being contributed to Eclipse Foundation as Eclipse Jersey[2].\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our community members for their effort and dedication to Jersey for these many years. Thank you for your many contributions and assistance improving the quality of the project, the documentation, and identifying issues.\n\nWe intend to transition this Jersey project repository to Archive status -- which will render it \"Read Only.\" All issues will be migrated to the Eclipse Jersey project. All pending PRs will be closed. Any remaining PRs that are still relevant will be migrated to the new Eclipse Jersey project repository at GitHub [3].\n\nWe hope that you will join us as we continue evolving the new Eclipse Jersey project. Jersey will use the Eclipse developer mailing list for product announcements and updates [4]. If you want to track issues, don't forget to follow Eclipse Jersey at it's new GitHub location. The new process for contributions under Eclipse is described  under \"Contributing file\" at this link [5].\n\nWe look forward to your continued contributions as part of the Eclipse Foundation. We hope that this transition is easy and smooth.\n\nThank you again for making Jersey the best that it can be.\n\n* [1] https://blogs.oracle.com/theaquarium/ee4j%3a-an-update\n* [2] https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.jersey\n* [3] https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jersey\n* [4] mailto:jersey-dev[at]eclipse.org, subscribe at https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/jersey-dev\n* [5] https://www.eclipse.org/projects/tools/about.php?id=ee4j.jersey\n"
