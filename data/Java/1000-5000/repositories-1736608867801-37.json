          "content": "A Note about Invoking Maven\n===========================\n\nApache Ignite build system uses Maven Wrapper to simplify and standardize build process. On different operating\nsystems, it should be run slightly differently:\n\n* On Unix-like systems (including Cygwin, WSL, git-bash), it's `./mvnw <arguments>`\n* On Windows (in PowerShell), it's `./mvnw <arguments>` as well\n* On Windows (in cmd shell), it's `.\\mvnw <arguments>` or `mvnw <arguments>` (in older versions)\n\nFurther in our documentation, we always use the ./mvnw form. Please adapt it to your system if needed.\n\nApache Ignite Maven Build Instructions\n======================================\n1) Compile and install:\n\n        ./mvnw clean install -Pall-java,licenses -DskipTests\n\n   or if you have to build .NET part as well, use the following command:\n   (Note that 'doxygen', `docfx`, '.NET Core SDK 3.1', 'PowerShell' should be installed before running this command.)\n\n        ./mvnw clean install -Pall-java,licenses,platforms -DskipTests -DclientDocs\n\n2) Javadoc generation (optional):\n\n        ./mvnw initialize -Pjavadoc\n\n3) Build Apache Ignite assembly:\n\n        ./mvnw initialize -Prelease\n\n   Look for apache-ignite-<version>-bin.zip in ./target/bin directory.\n\n4) Build Apache Ignite slim edition assembly:\n\n        ./mvnw initialize -Prelease -Dignite.edition=apache-ignite-slim\n\n   Look for apache-ignite-slim-<version>-bin.zip in ./target/bin directory.\n\n\nApache Ignite with LGPL Maven Build Instructions\n================================================\n1) Compile and install:\n\n        ./mvnw clean install -Pall-java,licenses -DskipTests\n\n   or if you have to build .NET part as well, use the following command:\n   (Note that 'doxygen', `docfx`, '.NET Core SDK 3.1', 'PowerShell' should be installed before running this command.)\n\n        ./mvnw clean install -Pall-java,licenses,platforms -DskipTests -DclientDocs\n\n2) Javadoc generation with LGPL (optional):\n\n        ./mvnw initialize -Pjavadoc,lgpl\n\n3) Build Apache Ignite assembly with LGPL dependencies:\n\n        ./mvnw initialize -Prelease,lgpl -Dignite.edition=apache-ignite-lgpl\n\n   Look for apache-ignite-lgpl-<version>-bin.zip in ./target/bin directory.\n\n\nApache Ignite with NUMA allocator Build Instructions (Linux only)\n================================================\n1) Install dependencies as described at modules/numa-allocator/README.md.\n\n2) Compile and install:\n\n        ./mvnw clean install -Pall-java,licenses -DskipTests\n\n   or if you have built Apache Ignite.NET on the first step use following command:\n   (Note that 'doxygen' should be installed before running this command.)\n\n        ./mvnw clean install -Pall-java,licenses -DskipTests -DclientDocs\n\n3) Javadoc generation with NUMA allocator (optional):\n\n        ./mvnw initialize -Pjavadoc,numa-allocator\n\n4) Build Apache Ignite assembly with NUMA allocator:\n\n        ./mvnw initialize -Prelease,numa-allocator\n\n   Look for apache-ignite-<version>-bin.zip in ./target/bin directory.\n\n\nIgnite C++ Build Instructions\n=============================\nInstructions can be found at modules/platforms/cpp/DEVNOTES.txt.\n\n\nApache Ignite RPM Package Build Instructions\n============================================\n1) Build Apache Ignite binary archive (instructions above)\n\n2) Run packaging script and follow messages if they required interaction\n\n        packaging/package.sh --rpm\n\n   Packages will be available in packaging/ directory\n\n\nApache Ignite DEB Package Build Instructions\n============================================\n1) Build Apache Ignite binary archive (instructions above)\n\n2) Build Apache Ignite RPM package (also above)\n\n3) Run packaging script and follow messages if they required interaction\n\n        packaging/package.sh --deb\n\n   Packages will be available in packaging/ directory\n\n   NOTE: to build both packages type at once, run\n\n        packaging/package.sh --rpm --deb\n\n\nInstall and Run Apache Ignite from packages\n===========================================\n1) Install package with YUM or APT respectively\n\n        yum localinstall -y apache-ignite-<version>.noarch.rpm\n            or\n        dpkg -i apache-ignite_<version>_all.deb\n\n2) Start Apache Ignite service\n\n        systemctl start apache-ignite@<config name>\n\n   NOTE: <config name> - relative to /etc/apache-ignite configuration file name\n\n   Example:\n\n        systemctl start apache-ignite@default-config.xml\n\n3) See logs in /var/log/apache-ignite or journalctl -xe\n\n\nIgnite Release Instructions\n===========================\n1) Use your people.apache.org/keys/committer/<username>.asc key to generate KEYS file.\n   Download https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ignite/KEYS and append you key using commands:\n\n        gpg --list-sigs <keyname> >> KEYS\n        gpg --armor --export <keyname> >> KEYS\n\n   Upload modified KEYS file.\n\n2) Specify gpg profile at settings.xml. It will be used to sign sources and artifacts.\n\n<profile>\n   <id>gpg</id>\n   <properties>\n      <gpg.keyname>keyname</gpg.keyname>\n      <gpg.passphrase>passphrase</gpg.passphrase>\n   </properties>\n</profile>\n\n   Ensure you have RELEASE (not SNAPSHOT) version at Ignite poms.\n   Maven release plugin release:prepare goal can be used to make release tag.\n\n3) Deploy Ignite release candidate to maven repository and dev-svn, make tag:\n\n   3.1) Deploy Ignite to maven repository, prepares sources and binaries.\n\n                ./mvnw deploy -Papache-release,gpg,all-java,licenses,deploy-ignite-site -Dignite.edition=apache-ignite -DskipTests\n\n   3.2) Javadoc generation:\n\n                ./mvnw initialize -Pjavadoc\n\n   3.3) Assembly Apache Ignite:\n\n                ./mvnw initialize -Prelease\n\n   NOTE: Nexus staging (repository.apache.org) should be closed with appropriate comment contains release version and\n   release candidate number, for example \"Apache Ignite 1.0.0-rc7\", when `./mvnw deploy` finished.\n\n   3.5) Checkout https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/ignite svn. Create release candidate folder with name\n        equals to release version with \"-rc*\" ending, for example \"1.0.0-rc7\", at svn root.\n        Copy /target/site folder content to svn/ignite/<rc-version> folder and commit with appropriate comment.\n\n   3.6) Make appropriate git tag for release candidate, for example \"ignite-X.Y.Z-rc1\".\n\n4) Start vote based on https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/ignite/<rc-version>.\n\n5) Release nexus staging, move binaries and sources from https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/ignite/<rc-version>\n   to https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/ignite/<version> when version accepted.\n   Use svn mv ^/dev/ignite/<rc-version> ^/release/ignite/<version> command for proper moving.\n\n6) Make appropriate git tag for released version, for example \"ignite-X.Y.Z\".\n\n7) Send an email to dev@ignite.apache.org contains release svn url.\n\n\nJCache TCK compliance\n======================\nTo test compliance with JCache TCK use:\n\n        ./mvnw test -P-release,jcache-tck -pl :ignite-core -am\n\nRun tests\n=========\nTo run tests locally use:\n\n        ./mvnw clean test -U -Plgpl,examples,-clean-libs,-release -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true -DfailIfNoTests=false -Dtest=%TEST_PATTERN%\n\nFor example, %TEST_PATTERN% can be 'org.apache.ignite.testsuites.IgniteBasicTestSuite' or 'GridCacheLocalAtomicFullApiSelfTest#testGet'\n\nTest suites\n=========\nAll unit tests must be included in any test suite. Travis runs a check for that. To check it locally run for the root project:\n\n        ./mvnw test -Pcheck-test-suites\n\nIf you want to check a single module only:\n\n1) Add ignite-tools dependency to the test scope of the module.\n\n2) Install ignite-tools with command:\n\n    ./mvnw install -Pcheck-test-suites\n\n3) Run tests in the module:\n\n    ./mvnw test\n\nApache RAT Instructions\n=======================\nTo check license headers use:\n\n        ./mvnw clean validate -Pcheck-licenses\n\nFor more information (e.g. exclude list) see \"check-licenses\" profile in \"parent/pom.xml\".\n\n\nUseful Release Commands\n=======================\nZIP:\n        zip -r9 apache-ignite-X.X.X-src.zip apache-ignite-X.X.X-src\nGPG:\n        gpg --armor --output apache-ignite-X.X.X-src.zip.asc --detach-sig apache-ignite-X.X.X-src.zip\n\n"

The memory tier allows using DRAM and Intel® Optane™ operating in the Memory Mode for data storage and processing needs. The disk tier is optional with the support of two options -- you can persist data in an external database or keep it in the Ignite native persistence. SSD, Flash, HDD, or Intel Optane operating in the AppDirect Mode can be used as a storage device.\n\n[Read More](https://ignite.apache.org/arch/multi-tier-storage.html)\n\n## Ignite Native Persistence\n\nEven though Apache Ignite is broadly used as a caching layer on top of external databases, it comes with its native persistence - a distributed, ACID, and SQL-compliant disk-based store. The native persistence integrates into the Ignite multi-tier storage as a disk tier that can be turned on to let Ignite store more data on disk than it can cache in memory and to enable fast cluster restarts.\n\n[Read More](https://ignite.apache.org/arch/persistence.html)\n\n## ACID Compliance\nData stored in Ignite is ACID-compliant both in memory and on disk, making Ignite a **strongly consistent** system. Ignite transactions work across the network and can span multiple servers.\n\n[Read More](https://ignite.apache.org/features/transactions.html)\n\n## ANSI SQL Support\nApache Ignite comes with a ANSI-99 compliant, horizontally scalable, and fault-tolerant SQL engine that allows you to interact with Ignite as with a regular SQL database using JDBC, ODBC drivers, or native SQL APIs available for Java, C#, C++, Python, and other programming languages. Ignite supports all DML commands, including SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, and DELETE queries as well as a subset of DDL commands relevant for distributed systems.\n\n[Read More](https://ignite.apache.org/features/sql.html)\n\n## High-Performance Computing\nHigh-performance computing (HPC) is the ability to process data and perform complex calculations at high speeds. Using Apache Ignite as a [high-performance compute cluster](https://ignite.apache.org/use-cases/hpc.html), you can turn a group of commodity machines or a cloud environment into a distributed supercomputer of interconnected Ignite nodes. Ignite enables speed and scale by processing records in memory and reducing network utilization with APIs for data and compute-intensive calculations. Those APIs implement the MapReduce paradigm and allow you to run arbitrary tasks across the cluster of nodes.\n\n"
