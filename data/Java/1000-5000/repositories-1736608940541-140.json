That's great!\n\nNew contributions are added under AGPL version 3.\n\n## Developing process\nWe are all about quality while not sacrificing speed so we use a very pragmatic workflow.\n\n* create an issue with feature request\n    * discuss it with other developers\n    * create mockup if necessary\n    * must be approved --> label approved\n    * after that no conceptual changes!\n* develop code\n* create [pull request](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pulls)\n* to assure the quality of the app, any PR gets reviewed, approved and tested by [two developers](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/blob/master/.pullapprove.yml#L29) before it will be merged to master\n\n\n### Branching model\n![branching model](/doc/branching.png \"Branching Model\")\n* All contributions bug fix or feature PRs target the ```master``` branch\n* Feature releases will always be based on ```master```\n* Bug fix releases will always be based on their respective feature-release-bug-fix-branches\n* Bug fixes relevant for the most recent _and_ released feature (e.g. ```2.0.0```) or bugfix (e.g. ```2.0.1```) release will be backported to the respective bugfix branch (e.g. ```2.0.x``` or ```2.1.x```)\n* Hot fixes not relevant for an upcoming feature release but the latest release can target the bug fix branch directly\n\n\n### Android Studio formatter setup\nOur formatter setup is rather simple:\n* Standard Android Studio\n* Line length 120 characters (Settings->Editor->Code Style->Right margin(columns): 120)\n* Auto optimize imports (Settings->Editor->Auto Import->Optimize imports on the fly)\n\n\n### Build variants\nThere are three build variants\n* generic: no Google Stuff, used for FDroid\n* gplay: with Google Stuff (Push notification), used for Google Play Store\n* versionDev: based on master and library master, available as direct download and FDroid\n\n### Git hooks\nWe provide git hooks to make development process easier for both the developer and the reviewers.\nTo install them, just run:\n\n```bash\n./gradlew installGitHooks\n```\n\n## Contribution process\n* Contribute your code in the branch 'master'. It will give us a better chance to test your code before merging it with stable code.\n* For your first contribution start a pull request on master.\n\n\n### Fork and download android repository:\n* Please follow [SETUP.md](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/blob/master/SETUP.md) to setup Nextcloud Android app work environment.\n\n\n### Create pull request:\n* Commit your changes locally. Remember to sign off your commits (`git commit -sm 'Your commit message'`).\n* Push your changes to your GitHub repo: ```git push```\n* Browse to <https://github.com/YOURGITHUBNAME/android/pulls> and issue pull request\n* Enter description and send pull request.\n\n### Create another pull request:\nTo make sure your new pull request does not contain commits which are already contained in previous PRs, create a new branch which is a clone of upstream/master.\n\n* ```git fetch upstream```\n* ```git checkout -b my_new_master_branch upstream/master```\n* If you want to rename that branch later: ```git checkout -b my_new_master_branch_with_new_name```\n* Push branch to server: ```git push -u origin name_of_local_master_branch```\n* Use GitHub to issue PR\n\n### Backport pull request:\nUse backport-bot via \"/backport to stable-version\", e.g. \"/backport to stable-3.7\".\nThis will automatically add \"backport-request\" label to PR and bot will create a new PR to targeted branch once the base PR is merged.\nIf automatic backport fails, it will create a comment.\n\n### Pull requests that also need changes on library\nFor speeding up developing, we do use a master snapshot of nextcloud-library, provided by jitpack.io.\nThis means that if a breaking change is merged on library, master branch of the app will fail.\nTo limit this risk please follow this approach:\n- on app PR: first use a reference to your library branch in build.gradle: ext -> androidLibraryVersion, e.g. androidLibraryVersion = \"changeSearch-SNAPSHOT\"\n- on library PR: use label \"client change required\" to indicate that this is breaking change. This will prevent GitHub from merging it.\n\nOnce both PRs are reviewed and ready to merge:\n- on library PR: remove label and merge it (for a short time now master cannot be built!)\n- on app PR: change androidLibraryVersion back to \"master-SNAPSHOT\"\n- wait for CI and then merge\n\nWith this approach the \"downtime\" of not building master is limited to the timestamp between merge lib PR and merging app PR, which is only limited by CI.\n\n### Adding new files\nIf you create a new file it needs to contain a license header. We encourage you to use the same license (AGPL3+) as we do.\nCopyright of Nextcloud GmbH is optional.\n\nSource code of library:\n```java\n/*\n * Nextcloud Android Library\n *\n * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Your Name <your@email.com>\n * SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\n */\n ```\n\nSource code of app:\n```java\n/*\n * Nextcloud - Android Client\n *\n * SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Your Name <your@email.com>\n * SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later OR GPL-2.0-only\n */\n ```\n \n XML (layout) file:\n ```xml\n<!--\n  ~ Nextcloud - Android Client\n  ~ \n  ~ SPDX-FileCopyrightText: 2024 Your name <your@email.com>\n  ~ SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later OR GPL-2.0-only\n-->\n```\n\n### Testing\n- testing is very important, but is lacking a lot on this project. Starting with 2020 we aim to write tests for every\n  new pull request.\n- Code coverage can be found [here](https://codecov.io/gh/nextcloud/android).\n\n#### Unit tests\n- small, isolated tests, with no need of Android SDK\n- code coverage can be directly shown via right click on test and select \"Run Test with Coverage\"\n\n#### Instrumented tests\n- tests to see larger code working in correct way\n- tests that require parts of Android SDK\n- best to avoid server communication, see https://github.com/nextcloud/android/pull/3624\n\n- run all tests ```./gradlew createGplayDebugCoverageReport -Pcoverage=true```\n- run selective test class: ```./gradlew createGplayDebugCoverageReport -Pcoverage=true\n  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.owncloud.android.datamodel.FileDataStorageManagerTest```\n- run multiple test classes:\n  -   separate by \",\"\n  - ```./gradlew createGplayDebugCoverageReport -Pcoverage=true -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.owncloud.android.datamodel.FileDataStorageManagerTest,com.nextcloud.client.FileDisplayActivityIT```\n- run one test in class: ```./gradlew createGplayDebugCoverageReport -Pcoverage=true\n  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=com.owncloud.android.datamodel.FileDataStorageManagerTest#saveNewFile```\n- JaCoCo results are shown as html: firefox ./build/reports/coverage/gplay/debug/index.html\n\n\n#### UI tests\nWe use [shot](https://github.com/Karumi/Shot) for taking screenshots and compare them \n- check screenshots: ```./gradlew gplayDebugExecuteScreenshotTests ```\n- update/generate new screenshots: ```scripts/updateScreenshots.sh ``` \n    - in this script are samples how to only execute a given class/test\n    - this will fire up docker & emulator to ensure that screenshots look the same\n- creating own UI comparison tests: \n    - add IntentsTestRule for launching activity directly:\n\n    ```java\n    @Rule public IntentsTestRule<SettingsActivity> activityRule = new IntentsTestRule<>(SettingsActivity.class,\n                                                                                        true,\n                                                                                        false);\n    ```\n\n    -  in test method:\n\n    ```java \n    Activity activity = activityRule.launchActivity(null); \n    …do something, e.g. navigate, create folder, etc. … \n     Screenshot.snapActivity(activity).record();\n    ```\n\n    - best practice is to first create test with emulator too see behaviour and then create screenshots\n\n## File naming\n\nThe file naming patterns are inspired and based on [Ribot's Android Project And Code Guidelines](https://github.com/ribot/android-guidelines/blob/c1d8c9c904eb31bf01fe24aadb963b74281fe79a/project_and_code_guidelines.md).\n\n### Menu files\n\nSimilar to layout files, menu files should match the name of the component. For example, if we are defining a menu file that is going to be used in the `UserProfileActivity`, then the name of the file should be `activity_user_profile.xml`. Same pattern applies for menus used in adapter view items, dialogs, etc.\n\n| Component        | Class Name             | Menu Name                   |\n| ---------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------- |\n| Activity         | `UserProfileActivity`  | `activity_user_profile.xml`   |\n| Fragment         | `SignUpFragment`       | `fragment_sign_up.xml`        |\n| Dialog           | `ChangePasswordDialog` | `dialog_change_password.xml`  |\n| AdapterView item | ---                    | `item_person.xml`             |\n| Partial layout   | ---                    | `partial_stats_bar.xml`       | \n\nA good practice is to not include the word `menu` as part of the name because these files are already located in the `menu` directory. In case a component uses several menus in different places (via popup menus) then the resource name would be extended. For example, if the user profile activity has two popup menus for configuring the users settings and one for the handling group assignments then the file names for the menus would be: `activity_user_profile_user_settings.xml` and `activity_user_profile_group_assignments.xml`.\n\n## Translations\n\nWe manage translations via [Transifex](https://app.transifex.com/nextcloud/nextcloud/android/). So just request joining the translation team for Android on the site and start translating. All translations will then be automatically pushed to this repository, there is no need for any pull request for translations.\n\nIf you need to change a translation, do not change it, but give it new key. This way the translation stays backward compatible as we automatically backport translated strings to last versions.\n\nWhen submitting PRs with changed translations, please only submit changes to values/strings.xml and not changes to translated files. These will be overwritten by next merge of transifex-bot and increase PR review.  \n\n## Engineering practices\n\nThis section contains some general guidelines for new contributors, based on common issues flagged during code review.\n\n### Approach to technical debt\n\nTL;DR Non-Stop Litter Picking Party!\n\nWe recognize the importance of technical debt that can slow down development, make bug fixing difficult and\ndiscourage future contributors.\n\nWe are mindful of the [Broken Windows Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory) and we'd like\nactively promote and encourage contributors to apply The Scout's Rule: *\"Always leave the campground cleaner than \nyou found it\"*. Simple, little improvements will sum up and will be very appreciated by Nextcloud team.\n\nWe also promise to actively support and mentor contributors that help us to improve code quality, as we understand\nthat this process is challenging and requires deep understanding of the application codebase.\n\n### Dependency injection\n\nTL;DR Avoid calling constructors inside constructors.\n\nIn effort to modernize the codebase we are applying [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection)\nwhenever possible. We use 2 approaches: automatic and manual.\n\nWe are using [Dagger 2](https://dagger.dev/) to inject dependencies into major Android components only:\n\n * `Activity`\n * `Fragment`\n * `Service`\n * `BroadcastReceiver`\n * `ContentProvider`\n\nThis process is fairly automatic, with `@Inject` annotation being sufficient to supply properly initialized\nobjects. Android lifecycle callbacks allow us to do most of the work without effort.\n\nFor other application sub-components we prefer to use constructor injection and manually provide required dependencies.\n\nThis combination allows us to benefit from automation when it provides most value, does not tie rest of the code\nto any specific framework and stimulates continuous code modernization through iterative refactoring of all minor\nelements.\n\n### Custom platform APIs\n\nTL;DR Avoid Android platform APIs.\n\nNextcloud Android application provides some replacements for native Android APIs to facilitate testing\nand expose higher-level, business-specific APIs.\n\nGenerally, whenever you need:\n\n* account management\n* application preferences\n* background task scheduling\n* device hardware information\n* media playback\n* networking\n* logging\n* notifications management\n\nwe have something more suitable.\n\nOur transition to new APIs is a continuous process. Contributors might be asked by code reviewers to\nrefrain from  using specific Android APIs considered problematic and to use Nextcloud APIs instead.\nIn extreme cases we might decide to put specific features on hold until we provide platform API\nreplacement.\n\nIf in doubt, ask Nextcloud developers. App undergoes a process of intense refactoring and situation\nchanges frequently.\n\n### Testing\n \nTL;DR If we can't write a test for it, it's not good.\n \nTest automation is challenging in mobile applications in general. We try to improve in this area\nand thereof we'd ask contributors to be mindful of their code testability:\n\n1. new code submitted to Nextcloud project should be provided with automatic tests\n2. contributions to existing code that is currently not covered by automatic tests\n   should at least not make future efforts more challenging\n3. whenever possible, testability should be improved even if the code is not covered by tests\n\n### Performance\n\nIf you're interested in improving the app's performance, please check the [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance)\nfor ways you can inspect and improve performance.\n\nFor additional analysis, set the `perfAnalysis` property\nin your Gradle build:\n\n```shell\n./gradlew installGplayDebug -P perfAnalysis\n```\n\nThis will install the app with [LeakCanary](https://square.github.io/leakcanary/) and \n[StrictMode](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/StrictMode) enabled and configured.\nThese tools can help find memory leaks, foreground operations that should be in background, and other performance\nproblems.\n\n# Releases\nAt the moment we are releasing the app in two app stores:\n\n* [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nextcloud.client)\n* [f-droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=com.nextcloud)\n\n\n## Types\nWe do differentiate between three different kinds of releases:\n\n### Stable\nPlay store and f-droid releases for the masses.\nPull Requests that have been tested and reviewed can go to master. After the last release candidate is out in the wild for ~2 weeks and no errors get reported (by users or in the developer console) the master branch is ready for the stable release.\nSo when we decide to go for a new release we freeze the master feature wise.\n\n### Release Candidate\n_stable beta_ releases done via the Beta program of the Google Play store and f-droid.\nWhenever a PR is reviewed/approved we put it on master.\nBefore releasing a new stable version there is at least one release candidate. It is based on the current master and during this phase the master is feature freezed. After ~2 weeks with no error a stable version will be released, which is identical to the latest release candidate. \n\n### Dev\nDone as a standalone app that can be installed in parallel to the stable app.\nAny PR which is labelled \"ready for dev\" will be automatically included in the dev app. This label should only set by the main developers.\nSame applies for the android-library. This repository also has a branch called dev which includes all upcoming features. The dev branch on this repository must always use the android-library dev branch.\n\n## Version Name and number\n### Stable / Release candidate\nFor _stable_ and _release candidate_ the version name follows the [semantic versioning schema](http://semver.org/) and the version number has several digits reserved to parts of the versioning schema inspired by the [jayway version numbering](https://www.jayway.com/2015/03/11/automatic-versioncode-generation-in-android-gradle/), where:\n\n* 2 digits for beta code as in release candidates starting at '01'\n* 2 digits for hot fix code\n* 3 digits for minor version code\n* n digits for mayor version code\n\n![Version code schema](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1315170/15992040/e4e05442-30c2-11e6-88e2-84e77fa1653d.png)\n\nExamples for different versions:\n* 1.0.0 ```10000099```\n* 8.12.2 ```80120200```\n* 9.8.4-rc18 ```90080418```\n\nbeware, that beta releases for an upcoming version will always use the minor and hotfix version of the release they are targeting. So to make sure the version code of the upcoming stable release will always be higher stable releases set the 2 beta digits to '99' as seen above in the examples. For major versions, as we're not a library and thus 'incompatible API changes' is not something that happens, decisions are essentially marketing-based. If we deem a release to be very impactful, we might increase the major version number.\n\n### Dev\nFor dev the version name is in format YYYYMMDD. It is mainly as a reference for reporting bugs and is not related to stable/release candidates as it is an independent app.\n\n## Release cycle\n* Releases are planned every ~2 months, with 6 weeks of developing and 2 weeks of stabilising\n* after feature freeze a public release candidate on play store and f-droid is released\n* ~2 weeks testing, bug fixing\n* release final version on f-droid and play store\n* Bugfix releases (dot releases, e.g. 3.2.1) are released 4 weeks after stable version from the branch created with first stable release (stable-3.2.x). If changes to the library are required, we do the same: create a branch from the version used in stable release (e.g. 1.1.0) and then release a dot release (1.1.1).\n\n> Hotfixes as well as security fixes are released via bugfix releases (dot releases) but are released on demand in contrast to regular, scheduled bugfix releases.\n\nTo get an idea which PRs and issues will be part of the next release simply check our [milestone plan](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/milestones)\n\n## Release process\n\n\n### Stable Release\nStable releases are based on the git [master](https://github.com/nextcloud/android).\n\n1. Bump the version name and version code in the [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml), see chapter 'Version Name and number'.\n2. Create a [release/tag](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/releases) in git. Tag name following the naming schema: ```stable-Mayor.Minor.Hotfix``` (e.g. stable-1.2.0) naming the version number following the [semantic versioning schema](http://semver.org/)\n\n\n### Release Candidate Release\nRelease Candidate releases are based on the git [master](https://github.com/nextcloud/android) and are done between stable releases.\n\n1. Bump the version name and version code in the [AndroidManifest.xml](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/blob/master/AndroidManifest.xml), see below the version name and code concept.\n2. Create a [release/tag](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/releases) in git. Tag name following the naming schema: ```rc-Mayor.Minor.Hotfix-betaIncrement``` (e.g. rc-1.2.0-12) naming the version number following the [semantic versioning schema](http://semver.org/)\n\n\n### Developement Release\nDev releases are based on the [master](https://github.com/nextcloud/android/tree/master) branch and are done independently from stable releases for people willing to test new features and provide valuable feedback on new features to be incorporated before a feature gets released in the stable app.\n\nThe deployment/build is done once a day automatically. If code has changed a new apk will be published [here](https://download.nextcloud.com/android/dev) and it will, with a little delay, be available on [Fdroid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdfilter=nextcloud&fdid=com.nextcloud.android.beta).\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 2,\n    as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n  \n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

If you want to help developing the app take a look to the [contribution guidelines][0].\n\nSections 1) and 2) are common for any environment. The rest of the sections describe how to set up a project in different tool environments. Nowadays we recommend to use Android Studio (section 2), but you can also build the app from the command line (section 3).\n\nIf you have any problem, remove the 'android' folder, start again from 1) and work your way down. If something still does not work as described here, please open a new issue describing exactly what you did, what happened, and what should have happened.\n\n\n### 0. Common software dependencies.\n\nThere are some tools needed, no matter what is your specific IDE or build tool of preference.\n\n[git][1] is used to access to the different versions of the Nextcloud's source code. Download and install the version appropriate for your operating system from [here][2]. Add the full path to the 'bin/' directory from your git installation into the PATH variable of your environment so that it can be used from any location.\n\nThe [Android SDK][3] is necessary to build the app. There are different options to install it in your system, depending of the IDE you decide to use. Check Google documentation about [installation][4] for more details on these options. After installing it, add the full path to the directories 'tools/' and 'platform-tools/' from your Android SDK installation into the PATH variable of your environment.\n\nOpen a terminal and type 'android' to start the Android SDK Manager. To build the Nextcloud for Android app you will need to install at least the next SDK packages:\n\n* Android SDK Tools and Android SDK Platform-tools (already installed); upgrade to their last versions is usually a good idea.\n* Android SDK Build-Tools 24.0.2.\n* Android 7.0 (API 24), SDK Platform; needed to build the nextcloud app.\n\nInstall any other package you consider interesting, such as emulators.\n\nFor other software dependencies check the details in the section corresponding to your preferred IDE or build system.\n\n\n### 1. Fork and download the nextcloud/android repository.\n\nYou will need [git][1] to access to the different versions of the Nextcloud's source code. The source code is hosted on GitHub and may be read by anybody, without a GitHub account. You will need one if you want to contribute to the development of the app with your own code.\n\nThe next steps will assume you have a GitHub account and that you will get the code from your own fork.\n\n* In a web browser, go to https://github.com/nextcloud/android, and click the 'Fork' button near the top right corner.\n* Open a terminal and go on with the next steps in it.\n* Clone your forked repository: ```git clone https://github.com/YOURGITHUBNAME/android.git```.\n* Move to the project folder with ```cd android```.\n* Pull any changes from your remote branch 'master': ```git pull origin master```\n* Make official Nextcloud repo known as upstream: ```git remote add upstream https://github.com/nextcloud/android.git```\n* Make sure to get the latest changes from official android/master branch: ```git pull upstream master```\n\nAt this point you can continue using different tools to build the project. Section 2 and 3 describe the existing alternatives.\n\n\n### 2. Working with Android Studio.\n\n[Android Studio][5] is currently the official Android IDE. Due to this, we recommend it as the IDE to use in your development environment. Follow the installation instructions [here][6].\n\nWe recommend to use the last version available in the stable channel of Android Studio updates. See what update channel is your Android Studio checking for updates in the menu path 'Help'/'Check for Update…'/link 'Updates' in the dialog.\n\nTo set up the project in Android Studio follow the next steps:\n\n* Open Android Studio and select 'Import Project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc)'. Browse through your file system to the folder 'android' where the project is located. Android Studio will then create the '.iml' files it needs. If you ever close the project but the files are still there, you just select 'Open Project…'. The file chooser will show an Android face as the folder icon, which you can select to reopen the project.\n* Android Studio will try to build the project directly after importing it. To build it manually, follow the menu path 'Build'/'Make Project', or just click the 'Play' button in the toolbar to build and run it in a mobile device or an emulator. The resulting APK file will be saved in the 'build/outputs/apk/' subdirectory in the project folder.\n* Setup Android Studio editor configuration for the project: ```Settings``` → ```Editor``` → ```Code Style``` → ```Scheme: Project``` and ```Enable EditorConfig support```\n\n\n### 3. Working in a terminal with Gradle:\n\n[Gradle][7] is the build system used by Android Studio to manage the building operations on Android apps. You do not need to install Gradle in your system, and Google recommends not to do it, but instead trusting on the [Gradle wrapper][8] included in the project.\n\n* Open a terminal and go to the 'android' directory that contains the repository.\n* Run the 'clean' and 'build' tasks using the Gradle wrapper provided\n    - Windows: ```gradlew.bat clean build```\n    - Mac OS/Linux: ```./gradlew clean build```\n\nThe first time the Gradle wrapper is called, the correct Gradle version will be downloaded automatically. This requires a working Internet connection.\n\nThe generated APK file is saved in android/build/outputs/apk as android-debug.apk\n\n### 4. App flavours\n\nThe app is currently equipped to be built with three flavours:\n* generic - the regular build, released as Nextcloud Android app on FDroid\n* gplay - with Google Stuff (Push notification), used for Google Play Store\n* versionDev - based on master and library master, available as direct download and FDroid\n\n[0]: https://github.com/nextcloud/android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md\n[1]: https://git-scm.com/\n[2]: https://git-scm.com/downloads\n[3]: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html\n[4]: https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html\n[5]: https://developer.android.com/tools/studio/index.html\n[6]: https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html?pkg=studio\n[7]: https://gradle.org/\n[8]: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html\n\n### 5. How-To\n\n#### 1. Direct usage of library project\n\nThis is handy if one wants to make changes both to files app and library:\n\n- Add the following to `settings.gradle`:\n  ```groovy\n  includeBuild('[path to library clone]') {\n    dependencySubstitution {\n      substitute module('com.github.nextcloud:android-library') using project(':library')\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n- Sync project with gradle files\n\nNow every change in library can be directly used in files app.\n\n### 6. Troubleshooting\n\n#### 1. Compilation fails with \"java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space\" error\nThe default settings for Gradle is to limit the compilation to 1GB of heap.\nYou can increase that value by :\n- adding `org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4G` to `gradle.properties`\n- running gradlew(.bat) with this command line : `GRADLE_OPTS=\"-Xmx4G\" ./gradlew clean build\"\n\n"
