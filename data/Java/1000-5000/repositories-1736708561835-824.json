Virtual threads are now used by default for both client and server on Java 21+, otherwise the default worker pools are now automatically sized based on available processor count.\n\nAs before, you may still want to [customize](https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/wiki/3-Server#custom-request-queues) your request queue and/or worker threading - but the changes here make it much easier to get started with reasonable defaults.\n\nAs always, feedback welcome!

Let's talk about how you can get\nthe most mileage out of it.\n\n## Be Respectful\n\nhttp-kit is an active project maintained by a small group of contributors who\nwork on this in their spare time. Please keep this in mind when filing issues -\nalthough a bug you've encountered may be frustrating, the people who will read\nand respond to your issue are human beings contributing unpaid time and effort\nto the project. Please try to use a polite and respectful tone when filing\nissues and reporting bugs.\n\n## Filing Issues\n\nWhen reporting a bug, it's helpful for us if you include the following\ninformation:\n - Your JDK version\n - Your Leiningen version\n - Which version of http-kit you're using\n - A full stacktrace, if you have one available\n\n## Building and Testing Locally\n\nThe project uses Rake to wrap build and testing tools. To build and execute tests\n(if you have Rake installed) at the root of the project simply type:\n\n```rake```\n\nThis will build the java source and test files, it will then execute 'lein test'\n\nTo run the java junit tests, at the root of the project type:\n\n```rake test_java```\n\nTo run a set of benchmarks, at the root of the project type:\n\n```rake bench```\n\n## Filing Pull Requests\n\nWhen filing a pull request, please make sure you've run the test suite on your\nlocal machine and that the tests pass (unfortunately, we've had some issues with\nthe test suite in CI due to AWS EC2's lack of proper support for IPv6).\n\nOver time, some of http-kit's codebase has become a little messy. We welcome PRs\nthat look to clean up the existing codebase for readability and maintenance.\n\nIf your pull request introduces a new feature or otherwise changes existing\nlogic, please make sure to add a corresponding test so that we don't experience\na logical regression in the future.\n"

You can use it with all your current libraries and middleware.\n\n- **High performance**: http-kit uses an event-driven architecture like nginx, and is **fast**. See [here](#performance) for benchmarks.\n\n- **High concurrency**: http-kit is **efficient**. Its RAM usage is O(n), with only few kB used per connection. Tests have [shown](https://http-kit.github.io/600k-concurrent-connection-http-kit.html) http-kit happily serving >600k concurrent connections.\n\n- **Clean, simple, small**: written from the ground-up to be **lean**, the entire http-kit client+server JAR is ~90kB with **zero dependencies** and ~3k total lines of code.\n\n- **Sync or async**: synchronous is simple, asynchronous fast & flexible. With http-kit you get the best of both with a simple API that lets you mix & match to best fit your use case.\n\n- **WebSockets**: realtime web apps are a breeze with http-kit, with great out-the-box support for both WebSockets and efficient HTTP long-polling.\n\n## Performance\n\nhttp-kit now includes an extensive single-system **benchmark suite** that can be easily customized and run in your own environment.\n\nSee [here](../../wiki/4-Benchmarking) for http-kit's **benchmark philosophy**, usage info, detailed results, etc.\n\nSelected example results:\n\n> **Important**: as with all benchmarks - please be skeptical and check the details for important context!\n\n![chart-server-work-0](../../raw/master/benchmarks/charts/server-work-0.png)\n\n![chart-client-https](../../raw/master/benchmarks/charts/client-https.png)\n\n## Project status\n\nhttp-kit was created by [@shenfeng][], but is currently being maintained by its community.\n\nA big thank-you to the [current contributors](../../graphs/contributors) for keeping the project going! **Additional contributors very welcome**: please ping me if you'd be interested in lending a hand.\n\n\\- [Peter Taoussanis][]\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Wiki][GitHub wiki] (getting started, usage, etc.)\n- API reference: [cljdoc][cljdoc docs], [Codox][Codox docs]\n\n## License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2012-2024 [Feng Shen][@shenfeng] and contributors.  \nLicensed under [Apache 2.0](LICENSE.txt).\n\n<!-- Common -->\n\n[GitHub releases]: ../../releases\n[GitHub issues]:   ../../issues\n[GitHub wiki]:     ../../wiki\n[Slack channel]: https://www.taoensso.com/http-kit/slack\n\n[Peter Taoussanis]: https://www.taoensso.com\n\n<!-- Project -->\n\n[Codox docs]:   https://http-kit.github.io/http-kit/\n[cljdoc docs]: https://cljdoc.org/d/http-kit/http-kit/\n\n[Clojars SVG]: https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/http-kit.svg\n[Clojars URL]: https://clojars.org/http-kit\n\n[Main tests SVG]:  https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/actions/workflows/main-tests.yml/badge.svg\n[Main tests URL]:  https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/actions/workflows/main-tests.yml\n[Graal tests SVG]: https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/actions/workflows/graal-tests.yml/badge.svg\n[Graal tests URL]: https://github.com/http-kit/http-kit/actions/workflows/graal-tests.yml\n\n<!-- Unique -->\n\n[@shenfeng]: https://github.com/shenfeng\n"
