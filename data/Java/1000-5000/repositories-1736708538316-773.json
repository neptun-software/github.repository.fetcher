Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at wendal1985@gmail.com. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-\n   | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.\n   |\n   | For example, if you have an integration testing plugin - like cactus - that needs to know where\n   | your Tomcat instance is installed, you can provide a variable here such that the variable is \n   | dereferenced during the build process to configure the cactus plugin.\n   |\n   | As noted above, profiles can be activated in a variety of ways. One way - the activeProfiles\n   | section of this document (settings.xml) - will be discussed later. Another way essentially\n   | relies on the detection of a system property, either matching a particular value for the property,\n   | or merely testing its existence. Profiles can also be activated by JDK version prefix, where a \n   | value of '1.4' might activate a profile when the build is executed on a JDK version of '1.4.2_07'.\n   | Finally, the list of active profiles can be specified directly from the command line.\n   |\n   | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact\n   |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration\n   |       variables for plugins in the POM.\n   |\n   |-->\n  <profiles>\n    <!-- profile\n     | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the\n     | mechanisms described above. For inheritance purposes, and to activate profiles via <activatedProfiles/>\n     | or the command line, profiles have to have an ID that is unique.\n     |\n     | An encouraged best practice for profile identification is to use a consistent naming convention\n     | for profiles, such as 'env-dev', 'env-test', 'env-production', 'user-jdcasey', 'user-brett', etc.\n     | This will make it more intuitive to understand what the set of introduced profiles is attempting\n     | to accomplish, particularly when you only have a list of profile id's for debug.\n     |\n     | This profile example uses the JDK version to trigger activation, and provides a JDK-specific repo.\n    <profile>\n      <id>jdk-1.4</id>\n\n      <activation>\n        <jdk>1.4</jdk>\n      </activation>\n\n      <repositories>\n        <repository>\n          <id>jdk14</id>\n          <name>Repository for JDK 1.4 builds</name>\n          <url>http://www.myhost.com/maven/jdk14</url>\n          <layout>default</layout>\n          <snapshotPolicy>always</snapshotPolicy>\n        </repository>\n      </repositories>\n    </profile>\n    -->\n\n    <!--\n     | Here is another profile, activated by the system property 'target-env' with a value of 'dev',\n     | which provides a specific path to the Tomcat instance.
