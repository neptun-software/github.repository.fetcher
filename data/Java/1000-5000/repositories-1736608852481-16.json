Click on the [instruction document](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/XUI/wiki) and experience it!\n\n> Covers most of the UI components：TextView、Button、EditText、ImageView、Spinner、Picker、Dialog、PopupWindow、ProgressBar、LoadingView、StateLayout、FlowLayout、Switch、Actionbar、TabBar、Banner、GuideView、BadgeView、MarqueeView、WebView、SearchView...etc. A series of components and colorful style themes。\n\nPlease read [【wisdom of asking questions】](https://xuexiangjys.blog.csdn.net/article/details/83344235) before raising the issue and strictly follow the [issue template](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/XUI/issues/new/choose) fill in and save everyone's time.\n\nPlease read the [instruction document](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/XUI/wiki) carefully before use, important things are to be repeated for three time!!！\n\nplease read the [instruction document](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/XUI/wiki) carefully before use, important things are to be repeated for three time!!！\n\nPlease read the [instruction document](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/XUI/wiki) carefully before use, important things are to be repeated for three time!!！\n\n## About me\n\n| WeChat public number   | juejin     |  zhihu    |  CSDN   |   jianshu   |   segmentfault  |   bilibili  |   toutiao\n|---------|---------|--------- |---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\n| [我的Android开源之旅](https://t.1yb.co/Irse)  |  [Click me](https://juejin.im/user/598feef55188257d592e56ed/posts)    |   [Click me](https://www.zhihu.com/people/xuexiangjys/posts)       |   [Click me](https://xuexiangjys.blog.csdn.net/)  |   [Click me](https://www.jianshu.com/u/6bf605575337)  |   [Click me](https://segmentfault.com/u/xuexiangjys)  |   [Click me](https://space.bilibili.com/483850585)  |   [Click me](https://img.rruu.net/image/5ff34ff7b02dd)\n\n## Rapid integration of X-Library\n\nIn order to facilitate the rapid integration of X-Library, I provide a template project for your reference: [https://github.com/xuexiangjys/TemplateAppProject](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/TemplateAppProject)\n\nIn addition, I have also produced several [video tutorials](https://space.bilibili.com/483850585/channel/detail?cid=104998) for your reference.\n\n----\n\n## Features\n\n* Simple and elegant，the total size of the project library is less than 1M (about 644k after packaging).\n\n* Rich components，provides the vast majority of our developers in common functional components.\n\n* Easy to use，in order to facilitate rapid development and improve development efficiency, the API is optimized to provide one click access.\n\n* Uniform style，the framework provides a series of unified styles to make the UI look beautiful and harmonious.\n\n* High compatibility，the framework also provides three different sizes of device styles (4.5 inch, 7 inch and 10 inch) and is compatible with Android 17 at least, which makes UI compatibility stronger.\n\n* Strong expansibility，each component provides rich properties and style APIs, and different styles of UI can be built by setting different style properties.\n\n## Stargazers over time\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/xuexiangjys/XUI.svg)](https://starchart.cc/xuexiangjys/XUI)\n\n----\n\n## Usage\n\n> Before you consider using XUI, you must be clear that this framework provides a whole set of UI solutions. If you just want to use a few of them, you don't need to introduce such a huge UI library. You can find better component libraries on GitHub. If you want to have a customized, unified UI overall solution, then you can continue to look!\n\n### Add gradle dependency\n\n1.In the project root directory `build.gradle`:\n\n```\nallprojects {\n     repositories {\n        ...\n        maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2.Then add in the dependencies of `build.gradle` of the application project (usually app):\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  ...\n  //androidx project\n  implementation 'com.github.xuexiangjys:XUI:1.2.1'\n\n  implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'\n  implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.2.1'\n  implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0'\n  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.12.0'\n}\n```\n\n【Note】 If your project does not currently use `androidx`, please use the following configuration:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  ...\n  //support project\n  implementation 'com.github.xuexiangjys:XUI:1.0.9-support'\n\n  implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'\n  implementation 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:28.0.0'\n  implementation 'com.android.support:design:28.0.0'\n  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.8.0'\n}\n```\n\n### Initialization\n\n1.Modify the basic theme of the application (required)\n\n> The basic theme of the application must be set, otherwise the component will not work normally! It is very important to ensure that the theme of all windows using XUI components is a subclass of `XUITheme`!!!\n\nBasic topic type：\n\n* Large flat plate(10 inches, 240dpi, 1920*1200）：XUITheme.Tablet.Big\n\n* Small plate(7 inches, 320dpi, 1920*1200）：XUITheme.Tablet.Small\n\n* Mobile phone（4.5 inches, 320dpi, 720*1280）：XUITheme.Phone\n\n```\n<style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"XUITheme.Phone\">\n     <!-- Customize your own theme style --> \n    <item name=\"colorPrimary\">@color/colorPrimary</item>\n    <item name=\"colorPrimaryDark\">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>\n    <item name=\"colorAccent\">@color/colorAccent</item>\n </style>\n\n```\n\nOf course, you can also call the following code at the beginning of the `Activity` to set the theme dynamically.\n\n```\n@Override\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    XUI.initTheme(this);\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n2.Adjust font library (omit if there is no requirement for font)\n\n（1）Set the font library path you need to modify (under assets)\n\n```\n// Set the default font to Chinese line Kai, write your font library here\nXUI.getInstance().initFontStyle(\"fonts/hwxk.ttf\");\n```\n\n（2）Add the following code to the basic activity of the project to inject fonts\n\nNote: after version 1.1.4, use the following settings for injection\n\n```\n@Override\nprotected void attachBaseContext(Context newBase) {\n    // Injection font\n    super.attachBaseContext(ViewPumpContextWrapper.wrap(newBase));\n}\n```\n\nNote: versions 1.1.3 and earlier use the following settings for injection\n\n```\n@Override\nprotected void attachBaseContext(Context newBase) {\n    // Injection font\n    super.attachBaseContext(CalligraphyContextWrapper.wrap(newBase));\n}\n```\n\n----\n\n## Demonstration\n\n### Screenshot\n\n![1_splash.png](./art/1_splash.png) &emsp; ![2_main.png](./art/2_main.png) &emsp; ![3_about.png](./art/3_about.png) &emsp;\n\n![4_menu.png](./art/4_menu.png) &emsp; ![5_dialog.png](./art/5_dialog.png) &emsp; ![6_bottom_dialog.png](./art/6_bottom_dialog.png) &emsp;\n\n![7_picker.png](./art/7_picker.png) &emsp; ![8_webview.png](./art/8_webview.png) &emsp;![9_flowlayout.png](./art/9_flowlayout.png) &emsp;\n\n![10_ninegrid.png](./art/10_ninegrid.png) &emsp; ![11_radius_imageview.png](./art/11_radius_imageview.png) &emsp; ![12_badge_view.png](./art/12_badge_view.png) &emsp;\n\n![13_tabview.png](./art/13_tabview.png) &emsp; ![14_citypicker.png](./art/14_citypicker.png) &emsp; ![15_refresh_layout.png](./art/15_refresh_layout.png) &emsp;\n\n![16_spinner.png](./art/16_spinner.png) &emsp;\n\n### Demo download\n\n> The demo program is about 18M (mainly because the demo integrates a small video shooting library, which is about 13M, while XUI library is only 644k in size). The project is relatively large, and dandelion is recommended to download.\n\n![xui_size.png](./art/xui_size.png)\n\n#### Pgyer Download\n\n> Pgyer Download password: xuexiangjys\n\n[![Pgyer](https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-pgyer-blue.svg)](https://www.pgyer.com/XUIDemo)\n\n[![download_pugongying.png](./art/download_pugongying.png)](https://www.pgyer.com/XUIDemo)\n\n#### Github Download\n\n[![Github](https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-Github-blue.svg)](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/XUI/blob/master/apk/xuidemo.apk?raw=true)\n\n[![download_github.png](./art/download_github.png)](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/XUI/blob/master/apk/xuidemo.apk?raw=true)\n\n## Contribution\n\n> Due to my limited energy, you are welcome to actively contribute your idea.

[点我](https://img.rruu.net/image/5ff34ff7b02dd)\n\n## X系列库快速集成\n\n为了方便大家快速集成X系列框架库，我提供了一个空壳模版供大家参考使用: [https://github.com/xuexiangjys/TemplateAppProject](https://github.com/xuexiangjys/TemplateAppProject)\n\n除此之外，我还特别制作了几期[视频教程](https://space.bilibili.com/483850585/channel/detail?cid=104998)供大家学习参考.\n\n----\n\n## 特征\n\n* 简洁优雅，尽可能少得引用资源文件的数量，项目库整体大小不足1M(打包后大约644k）。\n\n* 组件丰富，提供了绝大多数我们在开发者常用的功能组件。\n\n* 使用简单，为方便快速开发，提高开发效率，对api进行了优化，提供一键式接入。\n\n* 样式统一，框架提供了一系列统一的样式，使UI整体看上去美观和谐。\n\n* 兼容性高，框架还提供了3种不同尺寸设备的样式（4.5英寸、7英寸和10英寸），并且最低兼容到Android 17, 让UI兼容性更强。\n\n* 扩展性强，各组件提供了丰富的属性和样式API，可以通过设置不同的样式属性，构建不同风格的UI。\n\n## Star趋势\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/xuexiangjys/XUI.svg)](https://starchart.cc/xuexiangjys/XUI)\n\n----\n\n## 如何使用\n\n> 在决定使用XUI前，你必须明确的一点是，此框架给出的是一整套UI的整体解决方案，如果你只是想使用其中的几个控件，那大可不必引入如此庞大的一个UI库，Github上会有更好的组件库。如果你是想拥有一套可以定制的、统一的UI整体解决方案的话，那么你就继续往下看吧！\n\n### 添加Gradle依赖\n\n1.先在项目根目录的 build.gradle 的 repositories 添加:\n```\nallprojects {\n     repositories {\n        ...\n        maven { url \"https://jitpack.io\" }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n2.然后在应用项目(一般是app)的 `build.gradle` 的 dependencies 添加:\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  ...\n  //androidx项目\n  implementation 'com.github.xuexiangjys:XUI:1.2.1'\n\n  implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'\n  implementation 'androidx.recyclerview:recyclerview:1.2.1'\n  implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.4.0'\n  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.12.0'\n}\n```\n\n【注意】如果你的项目目前还未使用androidx，请使用如下配置：\n\n```\ndependencies {\n  ...\n  //support项目\n  implementation 'com.github.xuexiangjys:XUI:1.0.9-support'\n\n  implementation 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:28.0.0'\n  implementation 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:28.0.0'\n  implementation 'com.android.support:design:28.0.0'\n  implementation 'com.github.bumptech.glide:glide:4.8.0'\n}\n```\n\n### 初始化XUI设置\n\n1.调整应用的基础主题（必须）\n\n> 必须设置应用的基础主题，否则组件将无法正常使用！必须保证所有用到XUI组件的窗口的主题都为XUITheme的子类，这非常重要！！！\n\n基础主题类型：\n\n* 大平板(10英寸, 240dpi, 1920*1200）：XUITheme.Tablet.Big\n\n* 小平板(7英寸, 320dpi, 1920*1200）：XUITheme.Tablet.Small\n\n* 手机（4.5英寸, 320dpi, 720*1280）：XUITheme.Phone\n\n```\n<style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"XUITheme.Phone\">\n     <!-- 自定义自己的主题样式 --> \n    <item name=\"colorPrimary\">@color/colorPrimary</item>\n    <item name=\"colorPrimaryDark\">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>\n    <item name=\"colorAccent\">@color/colorAccent</item>\n </style>\n\n```\n当然也可以在Activity刚开始时调用如下代码动态设置主题\n\n```\n@Override\nprotected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n    XUI.initTheme(this);\n    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n    ...\n}\n```\n\n2.调整字体库（对字体无要求的可省略）\n\n（1）设置你需要修改的字体库路径（assets下）\n```\n//设置默认字体为华文行楷，这里写你的字体库\nXUI.getInstance().initFontStyle(\"fonts/hwxk.ttf\");\n```\n\n（2）在项目的基础Activity中加入如下代码注入字体.\n\n注意：1.1.4版本之后使用如下设置注入\n```\n@Override\nprotected void attachBaseContext(Context newBase) {\n    //注入字体\n    super.attachBaseContext(ViewPumpContextWrapper.wrap(newBase));\n}\n```\n\n注意：1.1.3版本及之前的版本使用如下设置注入\n```\n@Override\nprotected void attachBaseContext(Context newBase) {\n    //注入字体\n    super.attachBaseContext(CalligraphyContextWrapper.wrap(newBase));\n}\n```\n\n----\n\n## 演示（请star支持）\n\n###
