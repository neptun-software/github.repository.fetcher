          "content": "## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!\n\n1. Make your own fork of this repo\n2. Make your changes in a branch, in your own repo.\n3. If you add any new files, please make sure the Apache license header is included up top.\n4. When you are done coding, be sure to run `test.sh` and make sure that it passes!\n5. When your code is ready and the tests are passing, open up a pull request against our master branch.\n\nIf you have bug reports or feature requests, please open a GitHub Issue, and we'll get to it ASAP.\n\n## Building\n\n```sh\n./gradlew build\n```\n\nNote that this runs the integration tests, which can be rather slow.  To run only the regular unit tests:\n\n```sh\n./gradlew test\n```\n\n## Releasing\n\nWe use the [`gradle-maven-publish-plugin`](https://github.com/vanniktech/gradle-maven-publish-plugin) to publish to Sonatype OSS (and from thence to Maven Central), and the [`com.gradle.plugin-publish](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.gradle.plugin-publish) plugin to publish to the Gradle Plugin Portal.  Each of these plugins requires a fair bit of configuration.\n\n### Publishing to Sonatype\n\nPushing artifacts to Sonatype requires membership in the KeepSafe Sonatype org, which is by employment only.  Once\nyou have a login, put it in your private global Gradle file (e.g. `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`, along with a valid\nGPG signing configuration.  Your properties file should look like so:\n\n```properties\nSONATYPE_NEXUS_USERNAME=<your username here>\nSONATYPE_NEXUS_PASSWORD=<your password here>\nsigning.secretKeyRingFile=/path/to/your/.gnupg/secring.gpg\nsigning.keyId=<short hex key ID>\nsigning.password=<password associated with the key>\n```\n\n### Publishing to the Gradle Plugin Portal\n\nPublishing to the Gradle Plugin Portal also requires credentials tied to your employment.  You'll need an API key and secret from `https://plugins.gradle.org`.  Put them in your global Gradle properties file like so:\n\n```properties\ngradle.publish.key=<your API key>\ngradle.publish.secret=<your secret here>\n```\n\nNote that the Plugin Portal is incredibly lame and does not have a notion of more than one person being able to publish artifacts.  Consequently, we need to share credentials; in practice, only @benjamin-bader has the keys.\n\n### Release Script\n\n1. `git checkout master`\n1. Edit version number in gradle.properties, remove \"-SNAPSHOT\" suffix\n1. Edit version number in README.md\n1. Edit version number in docs/index.html\n1. Update CHANGELOG.md\n1. `git add . && git commit -S -m \"Release version <version number here>`\n1. `git tag -s -a <version number> -m \"Release version <version number>\"`\n1. `./gradlew clean check`\n1. `./gradlew uploadArchives`\n1. `./gradlew publishPlugins`\n1. Edit version number in gradle.properties to the next SNAPSHOT version.\n1. `git add . && git commit -S -m \"Prepare next development version\"`\n1. `git push --tags`\n1. Go to https://oss.sonatype.org, log in\n1. Click \"Staging Repositories\"\n1. Select the appropriate repo, then click \"Close\", then wait\n1. Once closed, select the repo and click \"Release\", then wait\n\n### Working with the website\n\nWe use [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with the [Material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/).  Follow the instructions at each link to install all the things. \n\nThe site is generated from the Markdown files in `docs/`, according to the template and settings in `mkdocs.yml`.  The general workflow is:\n\n1. `mkdocs serve`\n1. Open the browser to `http://localhost:8000`\n1. Edit docs and/or mkdocs.yml\n1. Look at the changes in the browser\n1. Repeat as necessary\n1. Open a doc PR\n1. Once merged, `mkdocs gh-deploy`\n"

(_Building_ the plugin requires Java 17 or higher.)\n\n## Credits\n\nThe Java code from the `com.android.dexdeps` package is sourced from the [Android source tree](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik.git/+/master/tools/dexdeps/).\nInspired by Mihail Parparita's [`dex-method-counts`](https://github.com/mihaip/dex-method-counts) project, to whom much credit is due.\n\nCopyright 2015-2023 Keepsafe Software, Inc\n"

          "content": "How To Release\n==============\n\nDue to Maven Central's very particular requirements, the release process is a bit\nelaborate and requires a good deal of local configuration.  This guide should walk\nyou through it.  It won't do anyone outside of KeepSafe any good, but the workflow\nis representative of just about any project deploying via Sonatype.\n\nWe currently deploy to both Maven Central (via Sonatype's OSS Nexus instance) and to\nplugins.gradle.org.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A *published* GPG code-signing key\n1. A Sonatype Nexus OSS account with permission to publish in com.getkeepsafe\n1. A plugins.gradle.org account with permission to publish in com.getkeepsafe\n1. Permission to push directly to https://github.com/KeepSafe/dexcount-gradle-plugin\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Add your GPG key to your github profile - this is required\n   for github to know that your commits and tags are \"verified\".\n1. Configure your code-signing key in ~/.gradle.properties:\n   ```gradle\n   signing.keyId=<key ID of your GPG signing key>\n   signing.password=<your key's passphrase>\n   signing.secretKeyRingFile=/path/to/your/secring.gpg\n   ```\n1. Configure your Sonatype credentials in ~/.gradle.properties:\n   ```gradle\n   SONATYPE_NEXUS_USERNAME=<nexus username>\n   SONATYPE_NEXUS_PASSWORD=<nexus password>\n   ```\n1. Configure git with your codesigning key; make sure it's the same as the one\n   you use to sign binaries (i.e. it's the same one you added to gradle.properties):\n   ```bash\n   # Do this for the dexcount repo only\n   git config user.email \"your@email.com\"\n   git config user.signingKey \"your-key-id\"\n   ```\n1. Add your plugins.gradle.org credentials to ~/.gradle/gradle.properties:\n   ```gradle\n   gradle.publish.key=<the key>\n   gradle.publish.secret=<the secret>\n   ```\n\n### Pushing a build\n\n1. Edit gradle.properties, remove '-SNAPSHOT' from the VERSION property\n1. Edit readme so that Gradle examples point to the new version\n1. Edit changelog, add relevant changes, note the date and new version (follow the existing pattern)\n1. Verify that the everything works:\n   ```bash\n   ./gradlew clean check\n   ```\n1. Make a *signed* commit:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -S -m \"Release version X.Y.Z\"\n   ``` \n1. Make a *signed* tag ()check existing tags for message format):\n   ```bash\n   git tag -s -a X.Y.Z\n   ```\n1. Upload binaries to Sonatype:\n   ```bash\n   ./gradlew publish\n   ```\n1. Go to oss.sonatype.org, log in with your credentials\n1. Click \"Staging Repositories\"\n1. Find the \"comgetkeepsafe\" repo, usually at the bottom of the list\n1. \"Close\" the repository (select it then click the \"close\" button up top), the text field doesn't matter so put whatever you want in it\n1. Wait until that's done\n1. \"Release\" the repository, leave the checkbox checked.  Hooray, we're in Maven Central now!\n1. Upload binaries to Gradle's plugin portal:\n   ```bash\n   ./gradlew publishPlugins\n   ```\n1. Edit gradle.properties, bump the version number and add '-SNAPSHOT'\n1. Make a *signed* commit:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -S -m \"Prepare next development version\"\n   ```\n1. Push all of our work to Github to make it official:\n   ```bash\n   git push --tags origin master\n   ```\n"
