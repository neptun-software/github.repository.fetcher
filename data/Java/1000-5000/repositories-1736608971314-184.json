Press one button and forget about your USB cable.\n\n**Android WiFI ADB plugin adds a button ![Android WiFi ADB Button][5] to your IntelliJ/Android Studio Toolbar** to connect your device to your computer over WiFi.  \n\n*To use this plugin the project opened in your IntelliJ/Android Studio has to be an Android project configured with the Android SDK.*\n\n**Archived repository:** Maintaining this project up to date for all the different Android devices without having access to the physical devices is not possible at all right now. Most of the bugs reported ar related to the adb installation and not to the plugin code so this repository will keep archived for now.\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\nConnect all devices button:\n\n![Android WiFi ADB Usage][2]\n\nDevices dashboard:\n\n![Android Devices Window][7]\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nConnect your device to your computer using a USB cable. Then press the button, and a notification will pop up saying that the phone has been connected. Disconnect your USB once the plugin shows your device is connected. Open the Android WiFi ADB tab at the right side to see all the devices and manage your connections. Your device will be connected over WiFi now. You can now deploy, run and debug your device using your WiFi connection. Remember that your device and your computer have to be in the same WiFi connection. Also, you have to first connect your device with a USB every time you open Android Studio, for setting up the connection over WiFi.\n  \nIf you want to handle your devices connection individually, open the Android WiFi ADB dashboard you will find at the right of your IDE.  \n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nDownload and install **Android WiFi ADB** directly from Intellij / Android Studio:\n`Preferences/Settings->Plugins->Browse Repositories` \n\nAlternatively, you can [download the plugin][6] from the JetBrains plugin site and install it manually in:\n`Preferences/Settings->Plugins->Install plugin from disk`.\n\nBuild the project\n-----------------\n\nIf you need some information about how to build this project review [IntelliJ Idea's Gradle Plugin documentation](https://github.com/JetBrains/gradle-intellij-plugin).\n\nDo you want to contribute?\n--------------------------\n\nPlease, do it!
