Notices\n\nHappy new Year &#x1F386;\n\nGoogle requires FairEmail to undergo an annual [CASA](https://appdefensealliance.dev/casa) security audit,\nwhich must be conducted by an authorized assessor (this year [TAC Security](https://casa.tacsecurity.com/site/home)).\nBesides being time-consuming, this is no longer free as of this year.\nThis is one of the reasons why the app cannot be completely free, meaning some features must be paid for in order to pay for an annual security audit.\nTo be clear, nothing will be changed for now.\n\nThe security audit revealed no problems, so Google accounts [can continue to be used](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/13464325) as usual next year.\n\n<br>\n\nPeople keep asking me to add new, often exotic, features to the app, to whom I often say \"no\", and other people complain about too many features.\nBoth groups of people leave bad reviews for this, which is frustrating, also because there are already enough bad reviews for the wrong reasons\n(email server problems, which unfortunately happen too often, etc.).\nThe main problem is that more features now make more people unhappy than happy.\nTherefore, [the rules for new features](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#get-support) will be strictly followed from today.\n\nNo worries, the app will [continue to be maintained](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/commits/) and supported as usual.\n\n<br>\n\nFor support you can use [the contact form](https://contact.faircode.eu/?product=fairemailsupport).\n\n<br>\n\n###

permission.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq2\"></a>\n**(2) Why is there a permanent notification shown?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq2)\n\n*If you came here by clicking on the \"monitoring\" notification, you should know that the next click will open the unified inbox.*\n\nTo reliably receive messages in the background, the app needs to start a service,\nwhich will let Android display a status bar notification notifying you about potential battery usage.\n\nThe service can't be started without a notification and the app can't disable the notification either.\nHowever, you can disable the notification yourself, without side effects, via the notification settings of FairEmail:\n\n* Android 8 Oreo and later: tap the *Monitoring channel* button and disable the channel via the Android settings (this won't disable new message notifications)\n* Android 7 Nougat and before: enabled *Use background service to synchronize messages*, but be sure to read the remark below the setting first\n\nYou can also switch to periodical synchronization of messages in the receive settings, in order to remove the notification, but be aware that this might use more battery power.\nSee [here](#faq39) for more details about battery usage.\n\nAndroid 8 Oreo might also show a status bar notification with the text *Apps are running in the background*.\nPlease see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7vw7l4/psa_turn_off_background_apps_notification/) about how you can disable this notification.\n\n*Background*\n\nThe service is a [foreground service](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html#startForeground(int,%20android.app.Notification))\nand is needed to prevent Android from stopping the service when the device is sleeping\n([doze mode](https://developer.android.com/training/monitoring-device-state/doze-standby)).\n\nMost, if not all, other email apps don’t show a notification,\nwhich leads to new messages often not being shown or reported later and messages not being sent at all or sent later.\n\nSome other email apps download all your messages to their servers first and push messages via\n[Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/) to your device.\nFor your privacy this is not a nice solution ...\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq3\"></a>\n**(3) What are operations and

shows the number of pending operations, which can be:\n\n* *add*: add message to remote folder\n* *move*: move message to another remote folder\n* *copy*: copy message to another remote folder\n* *fetch*: fetch changed (pushed) message\n* *delete*: delete message from remote folder\n* *seen*: mark message as read/unread in remote folder\n* *answered*: mark message as answered in remote

are processed only when there is a connection to the email server or when manually synchronizing.\nSee also [this FAQ](#faq16).\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq4\"></a>\n**(4) How can I use an invalid security certificate / empty password / plain text connection?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq4)\n\n**Since version 1.2137:\nDue to [Google's Play Store policies](https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/6346016),\nit is no longer possible to support insecure connections to email servers with certificate issues\nfor the version of FairEmail distributed in the Play Store.\nTherefore, this issue can only be resolved by your email provider,\nor by installing the GitHub version of the app (as an update) and enabling insecure connections in the account/identity settings.**\n\n*... Untrusted ... not in certificate ...*<br />\n*... Invalid security certificate (Can't verify identity of server) ...*<br />\n*... Chain validation failed ... timestamp check failed ... Certificate expired at ...*<br />\n\nThis can be caused by using an incorrect host name, so first double-check the host name in the advanced identity/account settings (tap *Manual setup and account options*).\nPlease see the documentation of the email provider about the right host name.\nSometimes the right host name is in the error message.\n\nYou should try to fix this by contacting your provider or by getting a valid security certificate\nbecause invalid security certificates are insecure and allow [man-in-the-middle attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).\nIf money is an obstacle, you can get free security certificates from [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org).\n\nThe quick, but unsafe solution (not advised), is to enable *Insecure connections* in the advanced identity settings\n(navigation menu, tap *Settings*, tap *Manual setup*, tap *Identities*, tap the identity, tap *Advanced*).\n\nAlternatively, you can accept the fingerprint of invalid server certificates like this:\n\n1. Make sure you are using a trusted internet connection (no public Wi-Fi networks, etc.)\n1. Go to the setup screen via the navigation menu (swipe from the left side inwards)\n1.

Later versions will most likely be compatible, but earlier versions might not be.\n\n**Important**: the OpenKeychain app is known to (silently) crash when the calling app (FairEmail) is not authorized yet and is getting an existing public key.\nYou can workaround this by trying to send a signed/encrypted message to a sender with an unknown public key.\n\n**Important**: if the OpenKeychain app cannot find a key (anymore), you might need to reset a previously selected key.\nThis can be done by long pressing an identity in the list of identities (Settings, tap Manual setup, tap Identities).\n\n**Important**: to let apps like FairEmail reliably connect to the OpenKeychain service to encrypt/decrypt messages,\nit might be necessary to disable battery optimizations for the OpenKeychain app.\n\n**Important**: the OpenKeychain app reportedly needs contacts permission to work correctly.\n\n**Important**: on some Android versions / devices it is necessary to enable *Show popups while running in background*\nin the additional permissions of the Android app settings of the OpenKeychain app.\nWithout this permission the draft will be saved, but the OpenKeychain popup to confirm/select might not appear.\n\nFairEmail will send the [Autocrypt](https://autocrypt.org/) header for use by other email clients,\nbut only for signed and encrypted messages because too many email servers have problems with the often long Autocrypt header.\nNote that the most secure way to start an encrypted email exchange is by sending signed messages first.\nThere is an encryption option to send signed messages by default.\nAlternatively, this can enabled for a specific identity in the advanced identity settings.\nReceived Autocrypt headers will be sent to the OpenKeychain app for storage on verifying a signature or decrypting a message.\n\nAlthough this shouldn't be necessary for most email clients, you can attach your public key to a message\nand if you use *.key* as extension, the mime type will correctly be *application/pgp-keys*.\n\nAll key handling is delegated to the OpenKey chain app for security reasons. This also means that FairEmail does not store PGP keys.\n\nInline encrypted PGP in received messages is supported, but inline PGP signatures and inline PGP in outgoing messages is not supported,\nsee [here](https://josefsson.org/inline-openpgp-considered-harmful.html) about why not.\n\nIf you wish to verify a signature manually, check *Show inline attachments* and save the files *content.asc* (the signed content) and *signature.asc* (the digital signature).\nInstall [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/) on your preferred operating system and execute this command:\n\n```gpg --verify signature.asc.pgp content.asc```\n\nSigned-only or encrypted-only messages are not a good idea, please see here about why not:\n\n* [OpenPGP Considerations Part I](https://www.openkeychain.org/openpgp-considerations-part-i)\n* [OpenPGP Considerations Part II](https://www.openkeychain.org/openpgp-considerations-part-ii)\n* [OpenPGP Considerations Part III Autocrypt](https://www.openkeychain.org/openpgp-considerations-part-iii-autocrypt)\n\nSigned-only messages are supported, and encrypted-only messages are supported since version 1.2053.\n\nCommon errors:\n\n* *No key*: there is no PGP key available for one of the listed email addresses.\n* *No key found!*: the PGP key stored in the identity probably doesn't exist anymore. Resetting the key (see above) will probably fix this problem.\n* *Missing key for encryption*: there is probably a key selected in FairEmail that does not exist in the OpenKeychain app anymore. Resetting the key (see above) will probably fix this problem.\n* *Key for signature verification is missing*: the public key for the sender is not available in the OpenKeychain app. This can also be caused by Autocrypt being disabled in the encryption settings or by the Autocrypt header not being sent.\n* *Message signature valid but not confirmed*: the signature is okay, but the public key still needs to be confirmed in the OpenKeychain app.\n* *OpenPgp error 0: null* / *OpenPgp error 0: General error*: please check the key in the OpenKeychain app and make sure there are no conflicting identities for the key and make sure the email address exactly matches the key, including lower/upper case. Also, make sure the key can be used to sign/encrypt and isn't for encrypting/signing only.\n* *OpenPgp error 0: Encountered an error reading input data!*: your public key has the [AEAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption) flag set, but the message was encrypted in the older MDC (Modification Detection Code) mode by the sender. For example the Posteo email server does this erroneously. Workaround: [remove the AEAD flag](https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/4025#issuecomment-853933127) from the key.\n\n**Important**: if *Don't keep activities* is enabled in the Android developer options,\nFairEmail and the OpenKeychain app cannot run at the same time, causing PGP operations to fail.\nIf needed, please [see here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable) about how to enable the developer options.\n\n**Important**: Android 8.1.0 on Tecno CF8 Camon 11 Pro devices blocks communication between apps\nwith the message \"*AutoStart limited*\" in the system logcat.\nSo, FairEmail (or any other app) can't communicate with the OpenKeychain app.\n\n<br />\n\n*S/MIME*\n\nEncrypting a message requires the public key(s) of the recipient(s). Signing a message requires your private key.\n\nPrivate keys are stored by Android and can be imported via the Android advanced security settings\n(Encryption & credentials, Install a certificate, VPN & app user certificate).\nThere is a shortcut (button) for this in the encryption settings for Android version 10 and before.\nAndroid will ask you to set a PIN, pattern, or password if you didn't before.\nIf you have a Nokia device with Android 9, please [read this first](https://nokiamob.net/2019/08/10/a-bug-prevents-nokia-1-owners-from-unlocking-their-screen-even-with-right-pin-pattern/).\n\n**Important**: If Android doesn't accept the password of a certificate, it probably means it doesn't support the certificate's encryption method.\nThe solution is to convert the certificate like this:\n\n```\nopenssl pkcs12 -nodes <your.p12 >certbag.pem\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -legacy -in certbag.pem >legacy.p12\n```\n\nNote that .p12 and .pfx are interchangeable.\nYou can find more information about this issue [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71872900/installing-pcks12-certificate-in-android-wrong-password-bug)\n\n<br>\n\nNote that certificates can contains multiple keys for multiple purposes,  for example for authentication, encryption and signing.\nAndroid only imports the first key, so to import all the keys, the certificate must first be split.\nThis is not very trivial and you are advised to ask the certificate supplier for support.\n\nIf you renewed a certificate, you should import the renewed certificate and reset the key.\nThis can be done by long pressing an identity in the list of identities (Settings, tap Manual setup, tap Identities).\n\nNote that S/MIME signing with other algorithms than RSA is supported, but be aware that other email clients might not support this.\nS/MIME encryption is possible with asymmetric algorithms only, which means in practice using RSA.\n\nThe default encryption method is PGP, but the last used encryption method will be remembered for the selected identity for the next time.\nYou can long press on the send button to change the encryption method for an identity.\nIf you use both PGP and S/MIME encryption for the same email address, it might be useful to copy the identity,\nso you can change the encryption method by selecting one of the two identities.\nYou can long press an identity in the list of identities (via manual setup in the main setup screen) to copy an identity.\n\nTo allow different private keys for the same email address, FairEmail will always let you select a key when there are multiple identities with the same email address for the same account.\n\nPublic keys are stored by FairEmail and can be imported when verifying a signature for the first time or via the encryption settings (PEM or DER format).\n\nFairEmail verifies both the signature and the complete certificate chain.\n\nCommon errors:\n\n* *No certificate found matching targetContraints*: this likely means you are using an old version of FairEmail\n* *unable to find valid certification path to requested target*: basically this means one or more intermediate or root certificates were not found\n* *Private key does not match any encryption keys*: the selected key cannot be used to decrypt the message, probably because it is the incorrect key\n* *No private key*: no certificate was selected or no certificate was available

description of other key usage bits, like *cRLSign*, via this same link.\nCertificates found in the Android key store are marked with \"Android\".\n\nA valid chain looks like this:\n\n```\nYour certificate > zero or more intermediate certificates > CA (root) certificate marked with \"Android\"\n```\n\nNote that a certificate chain will always be invalid when no anchor certificate can be found in the Android key store,\nwhich is fundamental to S/MIME certificate validation.\n\nPlease see [here](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/2844832?hl=en) how you can import certificates

Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq13)\n\nYou can start searching for messages on sender (from), recipient (to, cc, bcc), subject, keywords or message text by using the magnify glass in the action bar of a folder.\nYou can also search from any app by selecting *Search email* in the copy/paste popup menu.\n\nSearching in the unified inbox will search in all folders of all accounts,\nsearching in the folder list will search in the associated account only\nand searching in a folder will search in that folder only.\n\nMessages will be searched for on the device first, unless you use a complex expression, see below.\n\n<br>\n\nYou can download more messages on the device via the three-dots overflow menu in the start screen.\nThere will be an action button with a search again icon at the bottom to continue searching on the server.\nYou can select in which folder to continue the search.\n\n<br>\n\nThe IMAP protocol doesn't support searching in more than one folder at the same time.\nSearching on the server is an expensive operation, therefore it is not possible to select multiple folders.\n\nThe POP3 protocol doesn't support searching on the server at all.\n\n<br>\n\nSearching local (on-device) messages is case insensitive and on partial text.\nThe message text of local messages will not be searched if the message text was not downloaded yet.\nSearching on the server might be case sensitive or case insensitive and might be on partial text or whole words, depending on the provider.\n\n<br>\n\nSome servers cannot handle searching in the message text when there are a large number of messages.\nFor this case there is an option to disable searching in the message text.\nSince version 1.1888 a popup message will be shown and the search will automatically be retried without searching in the message text.\n\n<br>\n\nIt is possible to use Gmail search operators by prefixing a search command with *raw:*.\nIf you configured just one Gmail account, you can start a raw search directly on the server by searching from the unified inbox.\nIf you configured multiple Gmail accounts,\nyou'll first need to navigate to the folder list or the archive (all messages) folder of the Gmail account you want to search in.\nPlease [see here](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190) for the possible search operators. For example:\n\n``\nraw:larger:10M\n``\n\n<br>\n\nSearching through a large number of messages on the device is not very fast because of two limitations:\n\n* [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/), the database engine of Android has a record size limit, preventing message texts from being stored in the database\n* Android apps get only limited memory to work with, even if the device has plenty memory available\n\nThis means that searching for a message text requires that files containing the message texts need to be opened one by one\nto check if the searched text is contained in the file, which is a relatively expensive process.\n\nIn the *miscellaneous settings* you can enable *Build search index* to significantly increase the speed of searching on the device,\nbut be aware that this will increase battery and storage space usage.\nThe search index is based on <ins>whole</ins> words in all message parts,\nso searching for partial text and searching in specific messages parts (from, subject, text, etc) is not possible.\n\nNote that only messages for which the message text was downloaded will be indexed.\nIn the connection settings can be configured up to which size messages texts will be downloaded automatically\nwhen using a metered connection (generally mobile data or paid WiFi).\nIn the folder properties (long press on a folder in the folder list of an account) downloading of messages texts can be enabled/disabled.\n\nUsing the search index is a pro feature.\n\n<br />\n\nSince version 1.1315 it is possible to use search expressions like this:\n\n```\napple +banana -cherry ?nuts\n```\n\nThis will result in searching in the subject or text (only) like this:\n\n```\n(\"apple\" AND \"banana\" AND NOT \"cherry\") OR \"nuts\"\n```\n\nSince version 1.1980 it is possible to use these prefixes as a search expression:\n\n```\nfrom:<email address>\nto:<email address>\ncc:<email address>\nbcc:<email address>\nkeyword:<keyword>\n```\n\nThere should be <ins>no space</ins> between the prefix and the search term, which will be applied as an AND-condition.\n\nOnly AND conditions (+) and NOT conditions (-) can be used for on-device searching (since version 1.1981).\nIf you try to use other search expressions, you get the error *Select a folder for a complex search*,\nwhich means that a folder in an account's folder list must be selected in order to perform the search on the server.\n\n<br>\n\nSince version 1.1733 it is possible to save searches, which means that a named entry in the navigation menu will be created to repeat the same search later.\nYou can save a search after searching by tapping on the save button in the top action bar.\nAfter repeating a search there will be a delete button at the same place to delete a saved search again.\nA saved search might be useful to quickly search for starred messages, or for messages from a specific email address, etc.\n\nUsing the search index is a pro feature.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq14\"></a>\n**(14) How can I set up an Outlook / Live / Hotmail account?**\n\n&#x1F30E;

For Gmail this would be just 7 connections.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq24\"></a>\n**(24) What is browse messages on the server?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google

message *Storage access framework not available*,\nthe [storage access framework](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/document-provider), a standard Android component, is probably not present.\nThis might be because your custom ROM does not include it or because it was actively removed (debloated).\nNote that this will result in similar problems in other apps too.\n\nFairEmail does not request storage permissions, so this framework is required to select files and folders.\nNo app, except maybe file managers, targeting Android 4.4 KitKat or later should ask for storage permissions because it would allow access to *all* files.\nMoreover, recent Android versions disallow access to all files for apps, except, under specific conditions, for file managers.\n\nTo resolve this problem, the system component Google Play Services may need to be updated.\nPlease [see here](https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9037938?hl=en) on how.\nPlease note that you will need to restart your device after the update!\n\nThe storage access framework is provided by the package *com.android.documentsui*,\nwhich is visible as *Files* app on some Android versions (notably OxygenOS).\n\nYou can enable the storage access framework (again) with this adb command:\n\n```\npm install -k --user 0 com.android.documentsui\n```\n\nAlternatively, you might be able to enable the *Files* app again using the Android app settings.\n\nOneDrive doesn't support *view*, only *share*, which means that if you want to open an attachment in OneDrive you need to long press on an attachment.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq26\"></a>\n**(26) Can I help to translate FairEmail in my own language?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google

Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq33)\n\nMost providers accept validated addresses only when sending messages to prevent spam.\n\nFor example Google modifies the message headers like this for *unverified* addresses:\n\n```\nFrom: Somebody <somebody@example.org>\nX-Google-Original-From: Somebody <somebody+extra@example.org>\n```\n\nThis means that the edited sender address was automatically replaced by a verified address before sending the message.\n\nNote that this is independent of receiving messages.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq34\"></a>\n**(34) How are identities matched?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq34)\n\nMatched identities are used to select the correct (matched) identity when replying to a message.\n\nIdentities are as expected matched by account.\nFor incoming messages the *to*, *cc*, *bcc*, *from* and *(X-)delivered/envelope/original-to* addresses will be checked (in this order)\nand for outgoing messages (drafts, outbox and sent) only the *from* addresses will be checked.\nEqual addresses have precedence over partially matching addresses, except for *delivered-to* addresses.\n\nThe matched address will be shown as *via* in the addresses section of received messages (between the message header and message text).\n\nNote that identities need to be enabled to be able to be matched\nand that identities of other accounts will not be considered.\n\nMatching will be done only once on receiving a message, so changing the configuration will not change existing messages.\nYou could clear local messages by long pressing a folder in the folder list and synchronize the messages again, though.\n\nIt is possible to configure a [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) in the advanced identity settings\n(Navigation menu > Settings > Manual setup and account options > Identities > tap the identity > Advanced)\nto match **the username** of an email address (the part before the @ sign).\n\nNote that the domain name (the parts after the @ sign) always needs to be equal to the domain name of the identity.\nThis also implies that the username will be copied from a received message only if it matches the domain name of the matched identity.\nSince version 1.1640, it is possible to match the full email address with a regex by including the @ character in the regex, which can be useful for matching alias domain names.\nThe username will not be copied in this case because the domain name of the *from* address and the the domain name of the identity must be the same.\nIf you want the username to be copied, you should define an identity for each domain, which will allow you to send new messages from a specific domain name too.\n\nIf you want to match a catch-all email address, this regex is usually fine, provided all usernames for the domain are yours:\n\n```\n.*\n```\n\nThe username of a message being replied to will be used as the default username when editing of usernames is enabled in the advanced identity settings.\n\nPlease see [this FAQ](#faq9) about editing the email address when composing a message.\n\nIf you want to *not* match specific addresses, you can use something like this:\n\n```\n^(?!marcel$|johanna$).*\n```\n\nIf you like to match the special purpose email addresses abc@example.com and xyx@example.com\nand like to have a fallback email address main@example.com as well, you could do something like this:\n\n* Identity: abc@example.com; regex: **(?i)abc**\n* Identity: xyz@example.com; regex: **(?i)xyz**\n* Identity: main@example.com; regex: **^(?i)((?!abc|xyz).)\\*$**\n\nYou can test a regex [here](https://regexr.com/).\n\nMatched identities can be used to color code messages.\n\nThe identity color takes precedence over the folder and account color.\nThis means that the color of the color stripe will be determined by first checking if there is a color set for the 'via' (matched) identity,\nand after that if there is a color set for the folder containing the message, and finally if there is a color set for the account the message belongs to.\n\nSetting identity colors is a pro feature.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq35\"></a>\n**(35) Why should I be careful with viewing images, attachments, the original message, and opening links?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq35)\n\nViewing remotely stored images (see also [this FAQ](#faq27)) and opening links might not only tell the sender that you have seen the message,\nbut will also leak your IP address.\nSee also this question: [Why email's link is more dangerous than web search's link?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/241139/why-emails-link-is-more-dangerous-than-web-searchs-link).\n\nThis BBC article is worth reading as well: [Spy pixels in emails have become endemic](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56071437).\n\nOpening attachments or viewing an original message might load remote content and execute scripts,\nthat might not only cause privacy sensitive information to leak, but can also be a security risk.\n\nNote that your contacts could unknowingly send malicious messages if they got infected with malware.\n\nFairEmail formats messages again, causing messages to look different from the original, but also uncovering phishing links, etc.\n\nNote that reformatted messages are often easier to read than original messages because the margins are removed, and font colors and sizes are standardized.\n\nThe Gmail app shows images by default by downloading the images through a Google proxy server.\nSince the images are downloaded from the source server [in real-time](https://blog.filippo.io/how-the-new-gmail-image-proxy-works-and-what-this-means-for-you/),\nthis is even less secure, because Google is involved, too, without providing much benefit.\n\nYou can show images and original messages by default for trusted senders on a case-by-case basis by checking *Do not ask this again for ...*.\nYou might need to reset the questions via a button in the miscellaneous-settings tab page.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq36\"></a>\n**(36) How are settings files encrypted?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google

FairEmail?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq39)\n\nRecent Android versions by default report *app usage* as a percentage in the Android battery settings screen.\n**Confusingly, *app usage* is not the same as *battery usage* and is not even directly related to battery usage!**\nThe app usage (while in use) will be very high because FairEmail is using a foreground service which is considered as constant app usage by Android.\nHowever, this doesn't mean that FairEmail is constantly using battery power.\nThe real battery usage can be seen by navigating to this screen:\n\n*Android settings*, *Battery*, three-dots menu *Battery usage*, three-dots menu *Show full device usage*\n\nAlternatively: tap on the *App settings* button in the main settings screen of the app and tap on *Battery*.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, the battery usage should be below or in any case not be much higher than *Mobile network standby* for one account with a stable network connection.\nIf this isn't the case, please turn on *Auto optimize* in the receive settings tab page.\nIf this doesn't help, please [ask for support](https://contact.faircode.eu/?product=fairemailsupport).\n\nIt is inevitable that synchronizing messages will use battery power because it requires network access and accessing the messages' database.\nSince the app needs to wait for responses of the email server, which requires the processor (CPU) to be active, slower email servers will result in more battery usage.\n\nIf you are comparing the battery usage of FairEmail with another email client, please make sure the other email client is set up similarly.\nFor example, comparing always sync (push messages) and (infrequent) periodic checking for new messages is not a fair comparison.\n\nIf you are comparing the battery usage of FairEmail with an app like Whatsapp,\nplease understand that most apps use [Firebase Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging) (FCM) for push messages,\nwhich means that no battery usage will be contributed to an app for push messages, but instead to the Google Play Services system component.\nApart from the privacy concerns, it is not possible to use FCM for email because email servers do not support FCM.\nThe only way would be to download all your messages to a third-party server first and use FCM to push notifications to the app.\nThe privacy and security implications would be significant, though.\n\nReconnecting to an email server will use extra battery power, so an unstable internet connection will result in extra battery usage.\nAlso, some email servers prematurely terminate idle connections, while [the standard](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2177) says that an idle connection should be kept open for 29 minutes.\nIn these cases you might want to synchronize periodically, for example each hour, instead of continuously.\nNote that polling frequently (more than every 30-60 minutes) will likely use more battery power than synchronizing always\nbecause connecting to the server and comparing the local and remote messages are expensive operations.\n\nIf you know that the connection (reception) is bad, it might be worthwhile to decrease the timeout value in the connection-settings tab page to 10–20 seconds,\nso that the app discovers earlier that no connection is possible,\nso that the mechanism as described in [this FAQ](#faq123) is used faster.\n\n[On some devices](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) it is necessary to *disable* battery optimizations (setup step 3) to keep connections to email servers open.\nIn fact, leaving battery optimizations enabled can result in extra battery usage for all devices, even though this sounds contradictory!\n\nMost of the battery usage, not considering viewing messages, is due to synchronization (receiving and sending) of messages.\nSo, to reduce the battery usage, set the number of days to synchronize message for to a lower value,\nespecially if there are a lot of recent messages in a folder.\nLong press a folder name in the folders list and select *Edit properties* to access this setting.\n\nIf you have at least once a day internet connectivity, it is sufficient to synchronize messages just for one day.\n\nNote that you can set the number of days to *keep* messages for to a higher number than to *synchronize* messages for.\nYou could for example initially synchronize messages for a large number of days and after this has been completed\nreduce the number of days to synchronize messages, but leave the number of days to keep messages.\nAfter decreasing the number of days to keep messages, you might want to run the cleanup in the miscellaneous settings to remove old files.\n\nIn the receive settings tab page you can enable to always synchronize starred messages,\nwhich will allow you to keep older messages around while synchronizing messages for a limited number of days.\n\nDisabling the folder option *Automatically download message texts and attachments*\nwill result in less network traffic and thus less battery usage.\nYou could disable this option, for example for the sent folder and the archive.\n\nSynchronizing messages at night is mostly not useful, so you can save on battery usage by not synchronizing at night.\nIn the settings, you can select a schedule for message synchronization (this is a pro feature).\n\nFairEmail will by default synchronize the folder list on each connection.\nSince folders are mostly not created, renamed and deleted very often, you can save some network and battery usage by disabling this in the receive settings tab page.\n\nFairEmail will by default check if old messages were deleted from the server on each connection.\nIf you don't mind that old messages that were deleted from the server are still visible in FairEmail,\nyou can save some network and battery usage by disabling this in the receive settings tab page.\n\nSome providers don't follow the IMAP standard and [don't keep connections open](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501#section-5.4) long enough, forcing FairEmail to reconnect often, causing extra battery usage.\nYou can inspect the *Log* via the main navigation menu to check if there are frequent reconnects (connection closed/reset, read/write error/timeout, etc.).\nYou can work around this by lowering the keep-alive interval in the advanced account settings to for example 9 or 15 minutes.\nNote that battery optimizations need to be disabled in setup step 3 to reliably keep connections alive.\n\nSome providers send every two minutes something like '*Still here*' resulting in network traffic and your device to wake up and causing unnecessary extra battery usage.\nYou can inspect the *Log* via the main navigation menu to check if your provider is doing this.\nIf your provider is using [Dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/) as IMAP server,\nyou could ask your provider to change the [imap_idle_notify_interval](https://wiki.dovecot.org/Timeouts) setting to a higher value or better yet, to disable this.\nIf your provider is not able or willing to change/disable this, you should consider switching to periodically instead of continuous synchronization.\nYou can change this in the receive settings tab page.\n\nIf you got the message, *This provider does not support push messages* while configuring an account,\nconsider switching to a modern provider which supports push messages (IMAP IDLE) to reduce battery usage.\n\nIf your device has an [AMOLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED) screen,\nyou can save battery usage while viewing messages by switching to the black theme.\n\nIf auto optimize in the receive settings tab page is enabled,\nan account will automatically be switched to periodically checking for new messages when the email server:\n\n* Says '*Still here*' within 3 minutes\n* The email server does not support push messages\n* The keep-alive interval is lower than 12 minutes\n\n<br />\n\n<a

Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq40)\n\nYou can reduce the data usage basically in the same way as reducing battery usage, see the previous question for suggestions.\n\nIt is inevitable that data will be used to synchronize messages.\n\nIf the connection to the email server is lost, FairEmail will always synchronize the messages again to make sure no messages were missed.\nIf the connection is unstable, this can result in extra data usage.\nIn this case, it is a good idea to decrease the number of days to synchronize messages to a minimum (see the previous question)\nor to switch to periodically synchronizing of messages (receive settings).\n\nTo reduce data usage, you could change these advanced receive settings:\n\n* Check if old messages were removed from the server: disable\n* Synchronize (shared) folder list: disable\n\nBy default FairEmail does not download message texts and attachments larger than 256 KiB when there is a metered (mobile or paid Wi-Fi) internet connection.\nYou can change this in the connection settings.\n\nYou could enable to download only plain text only parts, but all messages will be without formatting (styling),\nand besides that, a plain text only part is not always sent, and worse, it is sometimes only a part of the message text, containing HTML and CCS.\n\nIn case of POP3, you can reduce the maximum number of messages to download.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq41\"></a>\n**(41) How can I fix the error 'Handshake failed'?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq41)\n\nThere are several possible causes, so please read to the end of this answer.\n\nThe error '*Handshake failed ... WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER ...*' might mean that you are trying to connect to an IMAP or SMTP server\nwithout an encrypted connection, typically using port 143 (IMAP) and port 25 (SMTP), or that a wrong protocol (SSL/TLS or STARTTLS) is being used.\n\nMost providers provide encrypted connections using different ports, typically port 993 (IMAP) and port 465/587 (SMTP).\n\nIf your provider doesn't support encrypted connections, you should ask to make this possible.\nIf this isn't an option, you could enable *Allow insecure connections* both in the advanced settings AND the account/identity settings.\n\nSee also [this FAQ](#faq4).\n\nThe error '*Handshake failed ... SSLV3_ALERT_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER ...*' is either caused by a bug in the SSL protocol implementation\nor by a too short DH key on the email server and can unfortunately not be fixed by FairEmail.\n\nThe error '*Handshake failed ... HANDSHAKE_FAILURE_ON_CLIENT_HELLO ...*' might be caused by the provider still using RC4,\nwhich isn't supported since [Android 7](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/nougat/android-7.0-changes.html#tls-ssl) anymore.\n\nThe error '*Handshake failed SSL handshake terminated ... SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE ... HANDSHAKE_FAILURE_ON_CLIENT_HELLO*'\ncan be caused by [this Android 7.0 bug](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37122132). This can unfortunately not be fixed by FairEmail.\n\nThe error '*Handshake failed ... UNSUPPORTED_PROTOCOL or TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION or SSLV3_ALERT_HANDSHAKE_FAILURE ...*'\nmight be caused by enabling **hardening connections** or **Bouncy Castle** in the connection settings tab page,\nor by Android not supporting older protocols anymore, like SSLv3 and TLSv1.\n\nThe error '*javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Read error: ... CERT_LENGTH_MISMATCH*' means that there is something wrong with the email server setup.\nTry to switch to port 993 (IMAP) or 465 (SMTP) with SSL/TLS.\n\nAndroid 8 Oreo and later [do not support](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/oreo/android-8.0-changes#security-all) SSLv3 anymore.\nThere is no way to workaround lacking RC4 and SSLv3 support because it has completely been removed from Android (which should say something).\nSince version 1.2121 the Bouncy Castle secure socket provider ([JSSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Secure_Socket_Extension)) is bundled.\nEnabling this socket provider in the connection-settings tab and enabling '*Allow insecure connections*' in the account/identity settings *might* solve this problem.\n\nThe error '*javax.net.ssl.SSLHandshakeException: Read error: ... TLSV1_ALERT_INTERNAL_ERROR*' means that Android and the email server share no common protocol versions and/or common ciphers.\n\nPlease [see here](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/net/ssl/SSLSocket) for an overview of supported protocols and cipher suites by Android version.\n\nYou can use [this website](https://ssl-tools.net/mailservers) or [this website](https://www.immuniweb.com/ssl/) to check for SSL/TLS problems of email servers.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq42\"></a>\n**(42) Can you add a new provider to the list of providers?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq42)\n\nIf the provider is used by more than a few people, yes, with pleasure.\n\nThe following information is needed:\n\n```\n<provider\n\tname=\"Gmail\"\n\tlink=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229\" // link to the instructions of the provider\n\ttype=\"com.google\"> // this is not needed\n\t<imap\n\t\thost=\"imap.gmail.com\"\n\t\tport=\"993\"\n\t\tstarttls=\"false\" />\n\t<smtp\n\t\thost=\"smtp.gmail.com\"\n\t\tport=\"465\"\n\t\tstarttls=\"false\" />\n</provider>\n```\n\nThe EFF [writes](https://www.eff.org/nl/deeplinks/2018/06/announcing-starttls-everywhere-securing-hop-hop-email-delivery):\n\"*Additionally, even if you configure STARTTLS perfectly and use a valid certificate, there’s still no guarantee your communication will be encrypted.*\"\n\nSo, pure SSL connections are safer than using [STARTTLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunistic_TLS) and therefore preferred.\n\nPlease make sure receiving and sending messages works properly before contacting me to add a provider.\n\nSee below about how to contact me.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq43\"></a>\n**(43) Can you show the original ...?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq43)\n\nShow original, shows the original message as the sender has sent it, including original fonts, colors, margins, etc.\nFairEmail does and will not alter this in any way,\nexcept for requesting [TEXT_AUTOSIZING](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebSettings.LayoutAlgorithm),\nwhich will *attempt* to make small text more readable.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq44\"></a>\n**~~(44) Can you show contact photos / identicons in the sent folder?~~**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq44)\n\n~~Contact photos and identicons are always shown for the sender because this is necessary for conversation threads.~~\n~~Getting contact photos for both the sender and receiver is not really an option because getting contact photo is an expensive operation.~~\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq45\"></a>\n**(45) How can I fix 'This key is not available.

deprecated, use *onBlocklist()* instead)\n* *onBlocklist()* (returns a boolean indicating if the sender/server is on a DNS blocklist; since version 1.2179)\n* *hasMx()* (returns a boolean indicating if the from/reply-to address has an associated MX record; since version 1.2179)\n* *attachments(regex)* (returns an integer indicating number of attachments; since version 1.2179; optional regex since version 1.2194)\n* *Jsoup()* (returns an array of selected strings;

(sender and subject)\n* Automation (Tasker, etc)\n* Webhook (since version 1.2107)\n\n**Important**: permanent deletion is **irreversible**.\nInstead, consider to move messages to the trash folder\nand to set up auto deletion for the trash folder in the folder properties (long press the folder in the folder list of an account).\n\nIf you want to forward a message, consider to use a *move* action instead.\nThis will be more reliable than forwarding because forwarded messages might be considered as spam.\n\n<br>\n\nIt is possible to use a [Jsoup selector](https://jsoup.org/cookbook/extracting-data/selector-syntax) to select the text for notes, for example:\n\n```\njsoup:td > span:containsOwn(€)\n```\n\nThe text of the first matched HTML element up to 512 characters will be used as text for the local note.\n\n<br>\n\nA *move* action can optionally create subfolders (since version 1.1966) to move messages to, for which you can use the following placeholders:\n\n```\n$day$ (since version 1.2030)\n$week$\n$month$\n$year$\n$domain$\n$group$ (since version 1.2030)\n```\n\n$group$ will be replaced with the contact group name of the sender, provided that the related contact is assigned to one contact group only.\nNote that the Android contact provider isn't very fast, so using this placeholder can slow down fetching messages.\n\n<br />\n\nSince version 1.2132 it is possible to use the following placeholders in keywords:\n\n```\n$day$\n$week$\n$month$\n$year$\n```\n\n<br />\n\nSince message headers are not downloaded and stored by default to save on battery and data usage and to save storage space\nit is by default not possible to preview which messages would match a header rule condition.\nYou can enable downloading message headers in the connection settings and check headers conditions anyway (since version 1.1599).\n\nSome common header conditions (regex):\n\n* *.&ast;To:.&ast;undisclosed-recipients.&ast;*\n* *.&ast;Cc:.&ast;test@example.com.&ast;*\n* *.&ast;Envelope-to:.&ast;test@example.com.&ast;*\n* *.&ast;Auto-Submitted:.&ast;*

[RFC3462](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3462)\n\nTo match *set* IMAP flags (keywords) via a header condition (since version 1.1777):\n\n```\n$<keyword>$\n```\n\nTo match *set* message flags via a header condition (since version 1.1777):\n\n```\n$$seen$ (read)\n$$answered$ (replied to)\n$$flagged$ (starred, favorite)\n$$deleted$ (marked as deleted)\n```\n\nTo match *passed* message checks via a

1.1981)\n$$encrypted$ (since version 1.1981)\n$$aligned$ (since version 1.2049)\n```\n\nNote that *regex* should be disabled and that there should be no white space.\n\nPlease be aware that a difference in the *from* and *reply-to* domain, and no or multi *from* addresses isn't a good indication of spam.\n\nSince the app sets the keyword *$Filtered$* after the rules have been executed for a message,\nyou can create a rule to prevent the rules from being executed again (which is sometimes desirable):\n\n* Name: anything you like\n* Order: lower than all other rules, for example 0\n* Stop processing rules after executing this rule: enabled\n* Header contains: *$$Filtered$* (no spaces)\n* Action: No action\n\nNote that not all email servers support IMAP keywords.\n\n<br />\n\nThe automation action will broadcast the intent *eu.faircode.email.AUTOMATION* with the following string extras:\n\n* *rule*\n* *received* (ISO 8601 date/time)\n* *sender*\n* *subject*\n* *preview* (since version 1.2222)\n\nAn app like Tasker can listen for this intent and perform some action.\nPlease [see here](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/intents.html) about receiving intents in Tasker.\n\n<br />\n\nYou can long-press a rule in the list of rules to copy it, which can be useful if you need a rule with the same condition but a different action.\n\n<br />\n\nIn the three-dots *more* message menu there is an item to create a rule for a received message with the most common conditions filled in.\n\n<br />\n\nIf you want to set up archiving by week, month, year, etc,\nyou can do this with rules with an absolute time condition on a 'jump' archive folder where archived messages are being moved to as a first step.\nSuch a rule will move the messages to a (sub) archive folder as a second step.\n\nThe POP3 protocol does not support setting keywords and moving or copying messages.\n\n<br />\n\nSince version 1.2061 it is possible to execute rules with an automation app, like for example Tasker.\n\n\n```\n(adb shell) am start-foreground-service -a eu.faircode.email.RULE --es account <account name> -es rule <unique rule name>\n```\n\n<br />\n\nSince version 1.2107 it is possible to executed webhooks.\nThe supported HTTP methods are GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, POST and POST.\nThe query parameters will be sent as body in the case of POST and PUT.\nNote that execution of webhooks won't be retried.

[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq78)\n\nIn the receive settings you can enable scheduling and set a time period and the days of the week *when* messages should be *received*.\n\nThe schedule section shows two parts, *Workdays* and *Weekend*.\nEach of them has a start time and a finish time.\nPressing on any one of these means the time can be edited.\n\nBelow these sections, there is a list of day names, *Sunday* through to *Saturday*.\nSome of these may be in bold text.\nThe ones that are in bold are set using the cog next to the *Weekend* section.\nIf you press the cog, you can choose which days you define to be the weekend.\nTypically, it will be *Sunday* and *Saturday*, but you can choose any day.\nTicking one of these means that that will now be shown as bold in the list of days.\n\nThe times under the *Weekend* section apply to those days which are in bold.\nThe days which are not in bold are regarded as the workdays.\n\nYou can untick any of the days in the list of days and that means that the schedule will not apply to those days.\n\nNote that an end time equal to or earlier than the start time is considered to be 24 hours later.\n\nSince version 1.1880 is is possible to exclude accounts from scheduling in the advanced account settings.\nThis means you can synchronize a business account during business hours only and make an exception for personal accounts.\n\nAutomation, see below, can be used for more advanced schedules,\nlike for example multiple synchronization periods per day or different synchronization periods for different days.\n\nIt is possible to install FairEmail in multiple user profiles, for example a personal and a work profile, and to configure FairEmail differently in each profile,\nwhich is another possibility to have different synchronization schedules and to synchronize a different set of accounts.\n\nIt is also possible to create [rules](#faq71) with a time condition and to snooze messages until the end time of the time condition.\nThis way it is possible to *snooze* business related messages until the start of the business hours.\nThis also means that the messages will be on your device for when there is (temporarily) no internet connection. How to:\n\n* Go to the folder list of an account by tapping on the account name in the navigation menu (left side menu)\n* Long press the inbox in the folder list and select *Edit rules*\n* Tap om the big *plus* button at the bottom to create a new rule\n* Enter as name for example *Snooze business messages*\n* Under relative time select a start and end date/time, for example Friday 17:00 and Monday 09:00\n* Select *Snooze* as action\n* Save the rule with the save button in the bottom action bar\n\nNote that recent Android versions allow overriding DND (Do Not Disturb) per notification channel and per app,\nwhich could be used to (not) silence specific (business) notifications.\nPlease [see here](https://support.google.com/android/answer/9069335) for more information.\n\nSince version 1.2150 it is possible to create [rules](#faq71) to silence specific new message notifications.\n\nFor more complex schemes you could set one or more accounts to manual synchronization\nand send this command to FairEmail to check for new messages:\n\n```\n(adb shell) am start-foreground-service -a eu.faircode.email.POLL\n```\n\nFor a specific account:\n\n```\n(adb shell) am start-foreground-service -a eu.faircode.email.POLL --es account Gmail\n```\n\nYou can also automate turning receiving messages on and off by sending these commands to FairEmail:\n\n```\n(adb shell) am start-foreground-service -a eu.faircode.email.ENABLE\n(adb shell) am start-foreground-service -a eu.faircode.email.DISABLE\n```\n\nTo enable/disable a specific account:\n\n```\n(adb shell) am start-foreground-service -a eu.faircode.email.ENABLE --es account Gmail\n(adb shell) am start-foreground-service -a eu.faircode.email.DISABLE --es account Gmail\n```\n\nNote that disabling an account will hide the account and all associated folders and messages.\nSince version 1.1600 an account will be disabled/enabled by setting the account to manual/automatic sync, so the folders and messages keep being accessible.\n\nTo set the poll interval:\n\n```\n(adb shell) adb shell am start-foreground-service -a eu.faircode.email.INTERVAL --ei minutes nnn\n```\n\nWhere *nnn* is one of 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240, 480, 1440. A value of 0 means push messages.\n\nYou can automatically send commands with for example [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/intents.html):\n\n```\nNew task: Something recognizable\nAction Category: Misc/Send Intent\nAction: eu.faircode.email.ENABLE\nTarget: Service\n```\n\nTo enable/disable an account with the name *Gmail*:\n\n```\nExtras: account:Gmail\n```\n\nAccount names are case sensitive.\n\nScheduling is a pro feature.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq79\"></a>\n**(79) How do I use synchronize on demand (manual)?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq79)\n\nNormally, FairEmail maintains a connection to the configured email servers whenever possible to receive messages in real-time.\nIf you don't want this, for example to be not disturbed or to save on battery usage, just disable receiving in the receive settings.\nThis will stop the background service which takes care of automatic synchronization and will remove the associated status bar notification.\n\nYou can also enable *Synchronize manually* in the advanced account settings if you want to manually synchronize specific accounts only.\n\nYou can use pull-down-to-refresh in a message list or use the folder menu *Synchronize now* to manually synchronize messages.\n\nIf you want to synchronize some or all folders of an account manually, just disable synchronization for the folders (but not of the account).\n\nYou'll likely want to disabled [browse on server](#faq24) too.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq80\"></a>\n**~~(80) How do I fix the error 'Unable to load BODYSTRUCTURE'?~~**\n\n&#x1F30E;

[Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq92)\n\nSpam filtering, verification of the [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) signature\nand [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) authorization is a task of email servers,\nnot of an email client, which is basically a viewer for messages on an email server.\nServers generally have more memory and computing power, so they are much better suited to this task than battery-powered devices.\nAlso, you'll want spam filtered for all your email clients, possibly including web email, not just for one email client on one device.\nMoreover, email servers have access to information, like the IP address, etc. of the connecting server, which an email client has no access to.\nFurthermore, an email server can inspect all messages of all email accounts, while an email client can inspect messages in your email account only.\n\nIf you are receiving a significant amount of spam, the first thing you should do is consider switching to another email provider.\nSome email servers excell at filtering spam, and others are really bad at it.\nSwitching to another e-mail provider is no fun, but neither is wading through piles of spam on a daily basis.\n\nSpam filtering based on message headers might have been feasible,\nbut unfortunately this technique is [patented by Microsoft](https://patents.google.com/patent/US7543076).\n\nRecent versions of FairEmail can filter spam to a certain extent using a message classifier.\nPlease see [this FAQ](#faq163) for more information about this.\n\nOf course you can report messages as spam with FairEmail,\nwhich will move the reported messages to the spam folder and train the spam filter of the provider, which is how it is supposed to work.\nThis can be done automatically with [rules](#faq71) too.\nBlocking the sender will create a filter rule to automatically move future messages of the same sender into the spam folder.\n\nNote that the POP3 protocol gives access to the inbox only. So, it is won't be possible to report spam for POP3 accounts.\n\nNote that you should not delete spam messages, also not from the spam folder,\nbecause the email server uses the messages in the spam folder to \"learn\" what spam messages are.\n\nIf you are wondering why a message was moved into the spam folder, these are all possible reasons:\n\n* The email server of your email provider moved the message into the spam folder. The app can't undo this automatically because this can result in an endless loop.\n* The message classifier (miscellaneous settings tab page) moved the message into the spam folder.\n* A filter rule (navigation menu = left side menu of the start screen), for example a block domain name rule, moved the message into the spam folder.\n* An email address or a network address is on a block list (receive settings tab page).\n\nNote that a sender will automatically be blocked when a message is moved into the spam folder.\nYou can disable this behavior by disabling the option *Automatically block the sender when reporting spam* in the behavior settings tab page.\n\nSince version 1.2143, there is an \"*Unblock all*\" button in the receive-settings tab page, which will reset all above options.\n\nIf you receive a lot of spam messages in your inbox, the best you can do is to contact the email provider to ask if spam filtering can be improved.\n\nAlso, FairEmail can show a small red warning flag\nwhen DKIM, SPF or [DMARC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC) authentication failed on the receiving server.\nYou can enable/disable [authentication verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_authentication) in the display settings.\nThe feature depends on the header [Authentication-Results](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7601), which the receiving email server should add.\nThe shield will be green only if DMARC passes (=alignment)\nand either [SPF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework) or [DKIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail) passes.\n\nIf the email server doesn't add an *Authentication-Results* header, which is optional,\nyou can enable native DKIM in the debug panel, which appears when you enable debug mode in the miscellaneous settings tab page (last option).\nIn this case, the shield will be green only when DKIM passes and the signer domain matches that of the sender (=alignment).\nPlease be aware that this option will increase both data and battery usage.\n\nFairEmail can show a warning flag too if the domain name of the (reply) email address of the sender does not define an MX record pointing to an email server.\nThis can be enabled in the receive settings. Be aware that this will slow down synchronization of messages significantly.\n\nIf the domain name of the sender and the domain name of the reply address differ,\nthe warning flag will be shown too because this is most often the case with phishing messages.\nIf desired, this can be disabled in the receive settings (since version 1.1506).\n\nIf legitimate messages are failing authentication, you should notify the sender because this will result in a high risk of messages ending up in the spam folder.\nMoreover, without proper authentication there is a risk the sender will be impersonated.\nThe sender might use [this tool](https://www.mail-tester.com/) to check authentication and other things.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq93\"></a>\n**(93) Can you allow installation/data storage on external storage media (sdcard)?**\n\n&#x1F30E;

This will enable 'learning' mode only.\nThe classifier will 'learn' from new messages in the inbox and spam folder by default.\nThe folder property *Classify new messages in this folder* will enable or disable 'learning' mode for a folder.\nYou can clear local messages (long press a folder in the folder list of an account) and synchronize the messages again to classify existing messages.\n\nEach folder has an option *Automatically move classified messages to this folder* ('auto classification' for short).\nWhen this is turned on, new messages in other folders which the classifier thinks belong to that folder will be automatically moved.\n\nThe option *Use local spam filter* in the report spam dialog will turn on message classification in the miscellaneous settings\nand auto classification for the spam folder.\nPlease understand that this is not a replacement for the spam filter of the email server and\ncan result in [false positives and false negatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives).\nSee also [this FAQ](#faq92).\n\nA practical example: suppose there is a folder 'marketing' and auto message classification is enabled for this folder.\nEach time you move a message into this folder you'll train FairEmail that similar messages belong in this folder.\nEach time you move a message out of this folder you'll train FairEmail that similar messages do not belong in this folder.\nAfter moving some messages into the 'marketing' folder, FairEmail will start moving similar messages automatically into this folder.\nOr, the other way around, after moving some messages out of the 'marketing' folder, FairEmail will stop moving similar messages automatically into this folder.\nThis will work best with messages with similar content (email addresses, subject and message text).\n\nClassification should be considered as a best guess - it might be a wrong guess, or the classifier might not be confident enough to make any guess.\nIf the classifier is unsure, it will simply leave an email where it is.\n\nTo prevent the email server from moving a message into the spam folder again and again,\nauto classification out of the spam folder will not be done.\n\nThe message classifier calculates the probability a message belongs in a folder (class).\nThere are two options in the miscellaneous settings which control if a message will be automatically moved into a folder,\nprovided that auto classification is enabled for the folder:\n\n* *Minimum class probability*: a message will only be moved when the confidence it belongs in a folder is greater than this value (default 15 %)\n* *Minimum class difference*: a message will only be moved when the difference in confidence between one class and the next most likely class is greater than this value (default 50 %)\n\nIf all previously classified messages were the same and the message being evaluated is also the same, the confidence would be 100%.\n\nBoth conditions must be satisfied before a message will be moved.\n\nConsidering the default option values:\n\n* Apples 40 % and bananas 30 % would be disregarded because the difference of 25 % is below the minimum of 50 %\n* Apples 10 % and bananas 5 % would be disregarded because the probability for apples is below the minimum of 15 %\n* Apples 50 % and bananas 20 % would result in selecting apples\n\nClassification is optimized to use as little resources as possible, but will inevitably use some extra battery power.\nThis is also why only folders of the same account will be considered.\n\nYou can delete all classification data by turning classification in the miscellaneous settings three times off.\nThis will be necessary when classification for a folder is enabled or disabled (or when a folder is deleted)\nbecause classification is based on comparision.\n\n[Rules](#faq71) will be executed before classification.\nIf one or more rules were executed for a message, message classification will be skipped\nbecause it is assumed that the message will be processed by the rules in this case.\n\nMessage classification is a pro feature, except for the spam folder.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq164\"></a>\n**(164) Can you add customizable themes?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq164)\n\nUnfortunately, Android [does not support](https://stackoverflow.com/a/26511725/1794097) dynamic themes,\nwhich means all themes need [to be predefined](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml).\n\nSince for each theme there needs to be a light, dark and black variant,\nit is not feasible to add for each color combination (literally millions) a predefined theme.\n\nMoreover, a theme is more than just a few colors.\nFor example themes with a yellow accent color use a darker link color for enough contrast.\n\nMost people like the beige background for the light themes, but if you don't like it, it can be disabled in the display settings.\n\nThe [Material You](https://material.io/blog/announcing-material-you) theme,\na more dynamic theme based on the selected background image (\"Monet\"),\nwhich was introduced in Android 12 on Google Pixel devices,\nis supported and can be selected in the theme selection dialog (via the three-dots menu of the start screen).\n\nThe theme colors are based on the color circle of [Johannes Itten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Itten).\n\nThe *Solarized* theme is described in [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solarized_(color_scheme)).\n\nThe beige background is in fact [Cosmic Latte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_latte),\nthe average color of the galaxies of the universe as perceived from the Earth\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq165\"></a>\n**(165) Is Android Auto supported?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq165)\n\nYes, Android Auto is supported, but only with the GitHub version of the app\nbecause Google rejected the application of FairEmail for this reason:\n\n*App category not permitted -\nAt this time, we are only accepting apps within the Media, short form Messaging,\nor categories supported by the Android for Cars App Library.*\n\nAlso, not all Android Auto versions support this (as installed in the car).\n\n**Use of this feature with the Github version is expressly at your own risk!**\n\nFor notification (messaging) support you'll need to enable the following notification options:\n\n* *Use Android 'messaging style' notification format*\n* Notification actions: *Direct reply* and (mark as) *Read* (this might be optional now, but this is untested)\n\nYou can enable other notification actions too, if you like, but they are not supported by Android Auto.\n\nThe developers guide is [here](https://developer.android.com/training/cars/messaging).\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq166\"></a>\n**(166) Can I snooze a message across multiple devices?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq166)\n\nFirst of all, there is no standard for snoozing messages, so all snooze implementations are custom solutions.\n\nSome email providers, like Gmail, move snoozed messages to a special folder.\nUnfortunately, third party apps have no access to this special folder.\n\nMoving a message to another folder and back might fail and might not be possible if there is no internet connection.\nThis is problematic because a message can be snoozed only after moving the message.\n\nTo prevent these issues, snoozing is done locally on the device by hiding the message while it is snoozing.\nUnfortunately, it is not possible to hide messages on the email server too.\nDeleting messages from the server and restoring them later could result in losing messages when the device breaks.\n\n<br />\n\n<a name=\"faq167\"></a>\n**(167) How can I use DeepL?**\n\n&#x1F30E;

When you tap on a link, the app will check the filter list\n1. If a list entry is found for the link, the app will suggest to *Remove tracking parameters* in the confirmation dialog box\n\nNote that the Adguard filter list contains over 2,000 entries, which takes a few moments to scan,\nvisible as a short delay between tapping on a link and the link confirmation dialog box appearing.\n\n<br>\n\n<a name=\"faq201\"></a>\n**(201) What is certificate transparency?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq201)\n\n\nPlease see [this article](https://certificate.transparency.dev/howctworks/) about what certificate transparency is.\nAlternatively, see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency).\n\nWhen certificate transparency is enabled in the connection-settings tab page of the app,\nthe [Chrome Certificate Transparency Policy](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/CertificateTransparency/blob/master/ct_policy.md) will be applied.\nThe CT log will be downloaded from [https://www.gstatic.com/](https://www.gstatic.com/ct/log_list/v3/all_logs_list.json).\n\nFairEmail uses [this library](https://github.com/appmattus/certificatetransparency) to implement certificate transparency via a custom trust manager.\n\n<br>\n\n<a name=\"faq202\"></a>\n**(202) What is DNSSEC and what is DANE?**\n\n&#x1F30E; [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq202)\n\nPlease see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions) about what DNSSEC is.\n\nPlease see [this article](https://github.com/internetstandards/toolbox-wiki/blob/main/DANE-for-SMTP-how-to.md) about what DANE is.\nAlternatively, see [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities).\n\nYou can use [this tool](https://ssl-tools.net/tlsa-generator) to generate TLSA DNS records for DANE (select either PKIX-EE or DANE-EE).\n\nYou can enable enforcing DNSSEC and/or DANA in the (advanced) account and identity settings (since version 1.2149).\n\nNote that only some email providers support DANE and that only a limited number of DNS servers support DNSSEC (January 2024: ~30%), which is required for DANE.\nMost private DNS providers support DNSSEC, though. You can configure private DNS in the Android network settings (since Android 9).\nTo be sure that private DNS is being used, better configure a host name like *dns.google*, *1dot1dot1dot1.cloudflare-dns.com* or *dns.quad9.net*.\nAn alternative is using Certificate Transparency, see the previous FAQ.\n\nSome email providers known to support DANE for client-to-server traffic:\n\n* [Disroot.org](https://disroot.org/)\n* [Freenet.de](https://email.freenet.de/)\n* [Mailbox.org](https://mailbox.org/)\n* [Posteo.de](https://posteo.de/)\n* [web.de](https://web.de/email/)\n* [GMX](https://www.gmx.net/mail)\n\nThis is not a complete and exhaustive list.\n\nPlease see [this article](https://www.zivver.com/blog/why-cisos-and-security-professionals-can-no-longer-rely-on-regular-email-for-the-sharing-of-personal-information) about why DANE is important.\n\nNote that DNSSEC and DANE are available in the GitHub version only.\n\n<br>\n\n<a name=\"faq203\"></a>\n**(203) Where is my sent message?**\n\nWhen you write a message, it will be stored in the draft messages folder.\n\nWhen you send a message, it will be in the outbox first and later in the sent messages folder.\n\nThe outbox is a queue of messages to be transferred to the email server of your email provider.\nAfter a message has been transferred to the email server, it will be stored in the sent messages folder.\n\nThe sent messages folder can be selected in the account settings: navigation menu (left side menu) > Settings > Manual setup and account options > Accounts > tap the account.\n\nThe email server will take care of sending the message to the recipient.\n\nIf a message could not be sent to the recipient, you'll in most cases receive a non-delivery notification message,\na special email, indicating the reason, like user (email address) unknown.\nFairEmail will decode non-delivery notification messages, so you can see all the details.\n\nBasically, an outgoing message is either in the draft messages folder, the outbox, or the sent messages folder.\n\n<br>\n\n<a name=\"faq204\"></a>\n**(204) How do I use Gemini?**\n\nGemini can only be used if configured and enabled.\n\n**Note that using Gemini is not free (anymore) !**\n\n<br>\n\nTo use [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), please follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check if your country [is supported](https://ai.google.dev/available_regions)**\n1.

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

B.V.](https://www.faircode.eu/)</sup>\n\n## Privacy policy\n\n[&#x1F30E; Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FM66B%2FFairEmail%2Fmaster%2FPRIVACY.md)\n\n<br />\n\nThis privacy policy will be updated as needed, such as when there are changes in the app or when regulations or laws change.\n\nLast update: **June 2, 2024**\n\n<br />\n\nFirst of all, FairEmail's main goal is to help you protect your privacy.\nWhat follows is a complete overview of all the data that will be stored on the device and that **can be** sent to the internet.\nThe latter is in the end always your choice and therefore optional.\n\nExcept for error reports (disabled by default), the app does not send any data to the developer.\nError reports will automatically be deleted after one month, or earlier upon request.\n\nData collected on the device will **never** be sold or shared in any way.\n\nData collected on the device will **never** be used for profiling, (AI) training or advertisements.\n\nThere are **no ads** in the app.\n\nYou have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory data protection authority,\nplease [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_data_protection_authority) for a list.\n\n<br>\n\nThe <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/datasafety?id=eu.faircode.email\">data safety</a> in the Play Store says:\n\n\"*The developer says this app doesn't share user data with other companies or organizations.*\".\n\nUnfortunately, there is no way to say that the app doesn't share data with the developer.\nExcept for error reporting (explicitly opt-in) **no data will be shared with the developer**.\nIt is important to note that collecting data on the device isn't synonymous with sending data off the device!\n\n<br />\n\n### Overview\n\nFairEmail **does not** send account information and message data elsewhere than to your email provider.\n\nFairEmail **does not** allow other apps access to message data without your approval.\n\nFairEmail **does not** require unnecessary permissions.\nFor more information on permissions, see [this FAQ](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq1).\n\nFairEmail **does** use modern and secure transport protocols by default.\n\nAndroid [encrypts all user data by default](https://source.android.com/docs/security/features/encryption), so all data, including account credentials, is stored encrypted by default.\n\nFairEmail **does** follow the recommendations of [this EFF article](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/01/stop-tracking-my-emails).\n\nFairEmail is 100 % **open source**, see [the license](https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\nError reporting via Bugsnag **is opt-in**, see [here](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq104) for more information.\n\nFairEmail **adheres** to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy),\nincluding the [Limited Use requirements](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#additional_requirements_for_specific_api_scopes).\nGoogle API Services are used only to authenticate Gmail accounts through OAuth.\n\nThe use of information received from Gmail APIs will adhere to the Google User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements.\"\n\nAll stored information (account details, messages, etc.) is **protected by encryption**.\nAll information is sent and received through **secure connections**.\nOf course, you should also protect your device by using a PIN code, pattern and/or biometric authentication.\n\nFairEmail **can use** these services if they are explicitly enabled (off by default) or are explicitly used by you:\n\n* [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) &#8211;

Netherlands\nmarcel+privacy@faircode.eu\n```\n\nFairCode BV is the data controller.\nIts data protection officer is Marcel Bokhorst, reachable via the aforementioned address.\nFor any legal issues, the place of jurisdiction is Dordrecht, the Netherlands.\n\n<br>\n\n### A. General information on data processing\n\n#### I. Scope of personal data processing\n\nThis privacy policy / data protection declaration applies to the Android app FairEmail.\n\nThe data processor only processes personal data insofar as absolutely required for providing a functioning email client as well as the explicitly requested services.\nUsers' personal data is usually only processed if required for fulfilling contractual or legal obligations or with the user's consent.\n\n#### II Purpose of data processing\n\nThe purpose of any data processed is to provide you with the service requested.\nThe app by default exclusively processes data that is necessary for the proper functioning of the app and its intended purpose of being an email client.\n\n#### III. Data storage and data deletion\n\nBy default, all data (both personal and non-personal) remains on the data subject's Android device for as long as not explicitly sent or shared by the data subject.\nThe data stored on the data subject's device can be deleted by the data subject at any time.\n\n#### IV. Sub-processors\n\nThe services of all sub-processors are disabled by default.\nThe data subject's data is sent to and processed by sub-processors if and only if explicitly enabled or requested by the data subject.\n\nThe sub-processors are:\n\n* [Bugsnag](https://www.bugsnag.com/) &#8211; [Privacy policy](https://docs.bugsnag.com/legal/privacy-policy/)\n\n#### V. Permissions\n\nThe app only requests permissions that are necessary for the expected behavior of an email app.\nFor more information on permissions, see [this FAQ](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq1).\n\n#### VI. Logging\n\nThe app does not send any log entries to the data processor by default.\nThe error reporting system utilizes Bugsnag and is disabled by default.\nSee [this FAQ](https://m66b.github.io/FairEmail/#faq104) for more information.\n\n#### VII. Legal basis\n\nFairEmail is fully [GDPR compliant](https://gdpr.eu/). The legal basis for any data processing is Art. 6 (1) a - c GDPR.\n\n<br>\n\n### B. Support requests\n\n#### I. Description and scope of data processing\n\nThe data subject may contact the data processor to request support through channels offered by the data processor.\nWhen the data subject contacts the data processor, any provided personal data is stored by the data controller.\n\n#### II. Purpose of data processing\n\nThe personal data is exclusively processed for finding a specific solution to support queries whilst recording and/or processing them.\nIt is essential in this respect for the data controller to be able to contact the person requesting support.\n\n#### III. Sub-processors\n\nThe data processor utilizes the services of the following sub-processors in order to process support requests:\n\n* Google LLC, if support request sent via email &#8211; [Privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)\n* Amazon Web Services EMEA SARL, if support request sent via the contact form &#8211; [Privacy policy](https://aws.amazon.com/privacy/)\n\n#### IV. Legal basis\n\nAny support requests are sent voluntarily by the data subject, including any personal data that might be attached.\nAs such, the explicit consent as outlined in Art. 6 (1) a GDPR forms the legal basis for processing.\n\nCopyright &copy; 2018-2025 Marcel Bokhorst.\n"

Therefore, this issue can only be resolved by your email provider, or by installing the GitHub version of the app (as an update) and enabling insecure connections in the account/identity settings.</strong></p>\n<p><em>… Untrusted … not in certificate …</em><br /> <em>… Invalid security certificate (Can’t verify identity of server) …</em><br /> <em>… Chain validation failed … timestamp check failed … Certificate expired at …</em><br /></p>\n<p>This can be caused by using an incorrect host name, so first double-check the host name in the advanced identity/account settings (tap <em>Manual setup and account options</em>). Please see the documentation of the email provider about the right host name. Sometimes the right host name is in the error message.</p>\n<p>You should try to fix this by contacting your provider or by getting a valid security certificate because invalid security certificates are insecure and allow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">man-in-the-middle attacks</a>. If money is an obstacle, you can get free security certificates from <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org\">Let’s Encrypt</a>.</p>\n<p>The quick, but unsafe solution (not advised), is to enable <em>Insecure connections</em> in the advanced identity settings (navigation menu, tap <em>Settings</em>, tap <em>Manual setup</em>, tap <em>Identities</em>, tap the identity, tap <em>Advanced</em>).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can accept the fingerprint of invalid server certificates like this:</p>\n<ol type=\"1\">\n<li>Make sure you are using a trusted internet connection (no public Wi-Fi networks, etc.)</li>\n<li>Go to the setup screen via the navigation menu (swipe from the left side inwards)</li>\n<li>Tap Manual setup, tap Accounts/Identities and tap the faulty account and identity</li>\n<li>Check/save the account and identity</li>\n<li>Tick the checkbox below the error message and save again</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This will “pin” the server certificate to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>\n<p>Note that older Android versions might not recognize newer certification authorities like Let’s Encrypt causing connections to be considered insecure, see also <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/training/articles/security-ssl\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><em>Trust anchor for certification path not found</em></p>\n<p><em>… java.security.cert.CertPathValidatorException: Trust anchor for certification path not found …</em> means that the default Android trust manager was not able to verify the server certificate chain.</p>\n<p>This could be due to the root certificate not being installed on your device or because intermediate certificates are missing, for example because the email server didn’t send them.</p>\n<p>You can fix the first problem by downloading and installing the root certificate from the website of the provider of the certificate.</p>\n<p>The second problem should be fixed by changing the server configuration or by importing the intermediate certificates on your device.</p>\n<p>You can pin the certificate, too, see above.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><em>Empty password</em></p>\n<p>Your username is likely easily guessed, so this is pretty insecure, unless the SMTP server is available via a restricted local network or a VPN only.</p>\n<p><em>Plain text connection</em></p>\n<p>Your username and password and all messages will be sent and received unencrypted, which is <strong>very insecure</strong> because a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack\">man-in-the-middle attack</a> is very simple on an unencrypted connection.</p>\n<p>If you still want to use an invalid security certificate, an empty password or a plain text connection, you’ll need to enable insecure connections in the account and/or identity settings. STARTTLS should be selected for plain text connections. If you enable insecure connections, you should connect via private, trusted networks only and never via public networks, such as are offered in hotels, airports, etc.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><a name=\"faq5\"></a> <strong>(5) How can I customize the message view?</strong></p>\n<p>🌎 <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq5\">Google Translate</a></p>\n<p>In the three dot overflow menu you can enable or disable or select:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>text size</em>: for three different font sizes</li>\n<li><em>compact view</em>: for more condensed message items and a smaller message text font</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the display section of the settings you can enable or disable for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Unified inbox</em>: to disable the unified inbox and to list the folders selected for the unified inbox instead</li>\n<li><em>Tabular style</em>: to show a linear list instead of cards</li>\n<li><em>Group by date</em>: show date header above messages with the same date</li>\n<li><em>Conversation threading</em>: to disable conversation threading and to show individual messages instead</li>\n<li><em>Conversation action bar</em>: to disable the bottom navigation bar</li>\n<li><em>Highlight color</em>: to select a color for the sender of unread messages</li>\n<li><em>Show contact photos</em>: to hide contact photos</li>\n<li><em>Show names and email addresses</em>: to show names or to show names and email addresses</li>\n<li><em>Show subject italic</em>: to show the message subject as normal text</li>\n<li><em>Show stars</em>: to hide stars (favorites)</li>\n<li><em>Show message preview</em>: to show 1-4 lines of the message text</li>\n<li><em>Show address details by default</em>: to expand the addresses section by default</li>\n<li><em>Automatically show original message for known contacts</em>: to automatically show original messages for contacts on your device, please read <a href=\"#faq35\">this FAQ</a></li>\n<li><em>Automatically show images for known contacts</em>: to automatically show images for contacts on your device, please read <a href=\"#faq35\">this FAQ</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that messages can be previewed only when the message text was downloaded.

This question is about optional end-to-end encryption with PGP or S/MIME.</p>\n<p>The sender and recipient should first agree on this and exchange signed messages to transfer their public key to be able to send encrypted messages. There is a gesture icon button just above the text of a received message on the right to verify a signature and store the public key.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><em>General</em></p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography\">see here</a> about how public/private key encryption works.</p>\n<p>Encryption in short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Outgoing</strong> messages are encrypted with the <strong>public key</strong> of the recipient</li>\n<li><strong>Incoming</strong> messages are decrypted with the <strong>private key</strong> of the recipient</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Signing in short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Outgoing</strong> messages are signed with the <strong>private key</strong> of the sender</li>\n<li><strong>Incoming</strong> messages are verified with the <strong>public key</strong> of the sender</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To sign/encrypt a message, just select the appropriate method in the send dialog. The simplest way to show the send dialog (again) is to long press the <em>Send</em> button in the bottom action bar. It might be necessary to disable signing/encryption with the padlock icon in the top action bar first, to prevent the select key dialog, etc. from being in the way. The encryption method will be remembered for the selected identity (at the top of the message editor).</p>\n<p>To verify a signature or to decrypt a received message, open the message and just tap the gesture or padlock icon just below the message action bar.</p>\n<p>The first time you send a signed/encrypted message, you might be asked for a sign key. FairEmail will automatically store the selected sign key in the used identity for the next time. If you need to reset the sign key, just save the identity or long press the identity in the list of identities and select <em>Reset sign key</em>. The selected sign key is visible in the list of identities. If you need to select a key on a case by case basis, you can create multiple identities for the same account with the same email address.</p>\n<p>In the encryption settings, you can select the default encryption method (PGP or S/MIME), enable <em>Sign by default</em>, <em>Encrypt by default</em> and <em>Automatically decrypt messages</em>, but be aware that automatic decryption is not possible if user interaction is required, like selecting a key or reading a security token.</p>\n<p>The to be encrypted message text/attachments and the decrypted message text/attachments are stored locally only and will never be added to the remote server. If you want to undo decryption, you can tap on the “close” padlock icon.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><em>PGP</em></p>\n<p>You’ll need to install and configure <a href=\"https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.sufficientlysecure.keychain/\">OpenKeychain</a> first. FairEmail was tested with OpenKeychain version 5.4. Later versions will most likely be compatible, but earlier versions might not be.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: the OpenKeychain app is known to (silently) crash when the calling app (FairEmail) is not authorized yet and is getting an existing public key. You can workaround this by trying to send a signed/encrypted message to a sender with an unknown public key.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: if the OpenKeychain app cannot find a key (anymore), you might need to reset a previously selected key. This can be done by long pressing an identity in the list of identities (Settings, tap Manual setup, tap Identities).</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: to let apps like FairEmail reliably connect to the OpenKeychain service to encrypt/decrypt messages, it might be necessary to disable battery optimizations for the OpenKeychain app.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: the OpenKeychain app reportedly needs contacts permission to work correctly.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: on some Android versions / devices it is necessary to enable <em>Show popups while running in background</em> in the additional permissions of the Android app settings of the OpenKeychain app. Without this permission the draft will be saved, but the OpenKeychain popup to confirm/select might not appear.</p>\n<p>FairEmail will send the <a href=\"https://autocrypt.org/\">Autocrypt</a> header for use by other email clients, but only for signed and encrypted messages because too many email servers have problems with the often long Autocrypt header. Note that the most secure way to start an encrypted email exchange is by sending signed messages first. There is an encryption option to send signed messages by default. Alternatively, this can enabled for a specific identity in the advanced identity settings. Received Autocrypt headers will be sent to the OpenKeychain app for storage on verifying a signature or decrypting a message.</p>\n<p>Although this shouldn’t be necessary for most email clients, you can attach your public key to a message and if you use <em>.key</em> as extension, the mime type will correctly be <em>application/pgp-keys</em>.</p>\n<p>All key handling is delegated to the OpenKey chain app for security reasons. This also means that FairEmail does not store PGP keys.</p>\n<p>Inline encrypted PGP in received messages is supported, but inline PGP signatures and inline PGP in outgoing messages is not supported, see <a href=\"https://josefsson.org/inline-openpgp-considered-harmful.html\">here</a> about why not.</p>\n<p>If you wish to verify a signature manually, check <em>Show inline attachments</em> and save the files <em>content.asc</em> (the signed content) and <em>signature.asc</em> (the digital signature).

Resetting the key (see above) will probably fix this problem.</li>\n<li><em>Key for signature verification is missing</em>: the public key for the sender is not available in the OpenKeychain app. This can also be caused by Autocrypt being disabled in the encryption settings or by the Autocrypt header not being sent.</li>\n<li><em>Message signature valid but not confirmed</em>: the signature is okay, but the public key still needs to be confirmed in the OpenKeychain app.</li>\n<li><em>OpenPgp error 0: null</em> / <em>OpenPgp error 0: General error</em>: please check the key in the OpenKeychain app and make sure there are no conflicting identities for the key and make sure the email address exactly matches the key, including lower/upper case. Also, make sure the key can be used to sign/encrypt and isn’t for encrypting/signing only.</li>\n<li><em>OpenPgp error 0: Encountered an error reading input data!</em>: your public key has the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption\">AEAD</a> flag set, but the message was encrypted in the older MDC (Modification Detection Code) mode by the sender. For example the Posteo email server does this erroneously. Workaround: <a href=\"https://github.com/keybase/keybase-issues/issues/4025#issuecomment-853933127\">remove the AEAD flag</a> from the key.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: if <em>Don’t keep activities</em> is enabled in the Android developer options, FairEmail and the OpenKeychain app cannot run at the same time, causing PGP operations to fail. If needed, please <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options#enable\">see here</a> about how to enable the developer options.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: Android 8.1.0 on Tecno CF8 Camon 11 Pro devices blocks communication between apps with the message “<em>AutoStart limited</em>” in the system logcat. So, FairEmail (or any other app) can’t communicate with the OpenKeychain app.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><em>S/MIME</em></p>\n<p>Encrypting a message requires the public key(s) of the recipient(s). Signing a message requires your private key.</p>\n<p>Private keys are stored by Android and can be imported via the Android advanced security settings (Encryption &amp; credentials, Install a certificate, VPN &amp; app user certificate). There is a shortcut (button) for this in the encryption settings for Android version 10 and before. Android will ask you to set a PIN, pattern, or password if you didn’t before. If you have a Nokia device with Android 9, please <a href=\"https://nokiamob.net/2019/08/10/a-bug-prevents-nokia-1-owners-from-unlocking-their-screen-even-with-right-pin-pattern/\">read this first</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: If Android doesn’t accept the password of a certificate, it probably means it doesn’t support the certificate’s encryption method. The solution is to convert the certificate like this:</p>\n<pre><code>openssl pkcs12 -nodes &lt;your.p12 &gt;certbag.pem\nopenssl pkcs12 -export -legacy -in certbag.pem &gt;legacy.p12</code></pre>\n<p>Note that .p12 and .pfx are interchangeable. You can find more information about this issue <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71872900/installing-pcks12-certificate-in-android-wrong-password-bug\">here</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Note that certificates can contains multiple keys for multiple purposes, for example for authentication, encryption and signing. Android only imports the first key, so to import all the keys, the certificate must first be split. This is not very trivial and you are advised to ask the certificate supplier for support.</p>\n<p>If you renewed a certificate, you should import the renewed certificate and reset the key. This can be done by long pressing an identity in the list of identities (Settings, tap Manual setup, tap Identities).</p>\n<p>Note that S/MIME signing with other algorithms than RSA is supported, but be aware that other email clients might not support this. S/MIME encryption is possible with asymmetric algorithms only, which means in practice using RSA.</p>\n<p>The default encryption method is PGP, but the last used encryption method will be remembered for the selected identity for the next time. You can long press on the send button to change the encryption method for an identity. If you use both PGP and S/MIME encryption for the same email address, it might be useful to copy the identity, so you can change the encryption method by selecting one of the two identities. You can long press an identity in the list of identities (via manual setup in the main setup screen) to copy an identity.</p>\n<p>To allow different private keys for the same email address, FairEmail will always let you select a key when there are multiple identities with the same email address for the same account.</p>\n<p>Public keys are stored by FairEmail and can be imported when verifying a signature for the first time or via the encryption settings (PEM or DER format).</p>\n<p>FairEmail verifies both the signature and the complete certificate chain.</p>\n<p>Common errors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>No certificate found matching targetContraints</em>: this likely means you are using an old version of FairEmail</li>\n<li><em>unable to find valid certification path to requested target</em>: basically this means one or more intermediate or root certificates were not found</li>\n<li><em>Private key does not match any encryption keys</em>: the selected key cannot be used to decrypt the message, probably because it is the incorrect key</li>\n<li><em>No private key</em>: no certificate was selected or no certificate was available in the Android keystore</li>\n<li><em>Memory allocation failed</em>: Android supports keys up to 4096 bits only (Android <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/199605614\">issue 199605614</a>)</li>\n<li><em>message-digest attribute value does not match calculated value</em>: the signature doesn’t match the message, possibly because the message was changed, or because an incorrect or key was used</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In case the certificate chain is incorrect, you can tap on the little info button to show the all certificates. After the certificate details the issuer or “selfSign” is shown. A certificate is self signed when the subject and the issuer are the same. Certificates from a certificate authority (CA) are marked with “<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.2.1.3\">keyCertSign</a>”.

You can also search from any app by selecting <em>Search email</em> in the copy/paste popup menu.</p>\n<p>Searching in the unified inbox will search in all folders of all accounts, searching in the folder list will search in the associated account only and searching in a folder will search in that folder only.</p>\n<p>Messages will be searched for on the device first, unless you use a complex expression, see below.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>You can download more messages on the device via the three-dots overflow menu in the start screen. There will be an action button with a search again icon at the bottom to continue searching on the server. You can select in which folder to continue the search.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The IMAP protocol doesn’t support searching in more than one folder at the same time. Searching on the server is an expensive operation, therefore it is not possible to select multiple folders.</p>\n<p>The POP3 protocol doesn’t support searching on the server at all.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Searching local (on-device) messages is case insensitive and on partial text. The message text of local messages will not be searched if the message text was not downloaded yet. Searching on the server might be case sensitive or case insensitive and might be on partial text or whole words, depending on the provider.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Some servers cannot handle searching in the message text when there are a large number of messages. For this case there is an option to disable searching in the message text. Since version 1.1888 a popup message will be shown and the search will automatically be retried without searching in the message text.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>It is possible to use Gmail search operators by prefixing a search command with <em>raw:</em>. If you configured just one Gmail account, you can start a raw search directly on the server by searching from the unified inbox. If you configured multiple Gmail accounts, you’ll first need to navigate to the folder list or the archive (all messages) folder of the Gmail account you want to search in. Please <a href=\"https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7190\">see here</a> for the possible search operators. For example:</p>\n<p><code>raw:larger:10M</code></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Searching through a large number of messages on the device is not very fast because of two limitations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sqlite.org/\">sqlite</a>, the database engine of Android has a record size limit, preventing message texts from being stored in the database</li>\n<li>Android apps get only limited memory to work with, even if the device has plenty memory available</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This means that searching for a message text requires that files containing the message texts need to be opened one by one to check if the searched text is contained in the file, which is a relatively expensive process.</p>\n<p>In the <em>miscellaneous settings</em> you can enable <em>Build search index</em> to significantly increase the speed of searching on the device, but be aware that this will increase battery and storage space usage. The search index is based on <ins>whole</ins> words in all message parts, so searching for partial text and searching in specific messages parts (from, subject, text, etc) is not possible.</p>\n<p>Note that only messages for which the message text was downloaded will be indexed.

Some providers expect as username just <em>username</em> and others your full email address <em>username@example.com</em>. When copying/pasting to enter a username or password, invisible characters might be copied, which could cause this problem as well. Some password managers are known to do this incorrectly too. The username might be case sensitive, so try lowercase characters only. The password is almost always case sensitive. Some providers require using an app password instead of the account password, so please check the documentation of the provider. Sometimes it is necessary to enable external access (IMAP/SMTP) on the website of the provider first. Other possible causes are that the account is blocked or that logging in has been administratively restricted in some way, for example by allowing to login from certain networks / IP addresses only.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><strong>In the case of an existing account with an authentication error, please try to use the quick setup wizard button to authenticate the account again.</strong></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Free.fr</strong>: please see <a href=\"#faq157\">this FAQ</a></li>\n<li><strong>Gmail / G suite</strong>: please see <a href=\"#faq6\">this FAQ</a></li>\n<li><strong>iCloud</strong>: please see <a href=\"#faq148\">this FAQ</a></li>\n<li><strong>Posteo</strong>: please check if <a href=\"https://posteo.de/en/help/activating-additional-email-account-protection\">additional email account protection</a> isn’t enabled.</li>\n<li><strong>Yahoo, AOL and Sky</strong>: please see <a href=\"#faq88\">this FAQ</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If needed, you can update a password in the account settings: navigation menu (left side menu), tap <em>Settings</em>, tap <em>Manual setup</em>, tap <em>Accounts</em> and tap on the account. Changing the account password will in most cases automatically change the password of related identities too. If the account was authorized with OAuth via the quick setup wizard instead of with a password, you can run the quick setup wizard again and tick <em>Authorize existing account again</em> to authenticate the account again. Note that this requires a recent version of the app.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Too many bad auth attempts …</em> likely means that you are using a Yahoo account password instead of an app password. Please see <a href=\"#faq88\">this FAQ</a> about how to set up a Yahoo account.</p>\n<p>The message <em>… +OK …</em> likely means that a POP3 port (usually port number 995) is being used for an IMAP account (usually port number 993).</p>\n<p>The errors <em>… invalid greeting …</em>, <em>… requires valid address …</em> and <em>… Parameter to HELO does not conform to RFC syntax …</em> can likely be solved by changing the advanced identity setting <em>Use local IP address instead of host name</em>.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Couldn’t connect to host …</em> means that there was no response from the email server within a reasonable time (20 seconds by default). Mostly this indicates internet connectivity issues, possibly caused by a VPN or by a firewall app. You can try to increase the connection timeout in the connection settings of FairEmail, for when the email server is really slow. Some devices have a firewall, which you can access like this:</p>\n<p>Android <em>Settings, Data usage, Three-dots overflow menu, Data usage control</em></p>\n<p>The error <em>… Connection refused …</em> (ECONNREFUSED) means that the email server or something between the email server and the app, like a firewall, actively refused the connection.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Network unreachable …</em> means that the email server was not reachable via the current internet connection, for example because internet traffic is restricted to local traffic only.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Host is unresolved …</em>, <em>… Unable to resolve host …</em> or <em>… No address associated with hostname … android_getaddrinfo failed: EAI_NODATA</em> means that the address of the email server could not be resolved into an IP address. This might be caused by a VPN, ad blocking or an unreachable or not properly working (local) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System\">DNS</a> server. An incorrect Android private DNS network setting can cause this too.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Software caused connection abort …</em> means that the email server or something between FairEmail and the email server actively terminated an existing connection. This can for example happen when connectivity was abruptly lost. A typical example is turning on flight mode.</p>\n<p>The errors <em>… BYE Logging out …</em>, <em>… Connection reset …</em> mean that the email server or something between the email server and the app, for example a router or a firewall (app), actively terminated an existing connection.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Connection closed by peer …</em> means that the email server actively closed the connection. This might be caused by a not updated Exchange server, see <a href=\"https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/pki/2010/09/30/sha2-and-windows/\">here</a> for more information.</p>\n<p>The errors <em>… Read error …</em> (sometimes combined with <em>BAD_DECRYPT</em> / <em>DECRYPTION_FAILED_OR_BAD_RECORD_MAC</em>), <em>… Write error …</em>, <em>… Read timed out …</em>, <em>… Broken pipe …</em> mean that the email server is not responding anymore or that the internet connection is bad.</p>\n<p><a name=\"connectiondropped\"></a> The error <em>… Connection dropped by server? …</em> means that the email server unexpectedly terminated the connection. This sometimes happen when there were too many (simultaneous) connections in a too short time or when a wrong password was used too often. In this case, please make sure your password is correct and disable receiving in the receive settings for about 30 minutes and try again. If needed, see <a href=\"#faq23\">this FAQ</a> about how you can reduce the number of connections.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Unexpected end of zlib input stream …</em> means that not all data was received, possibly due to a bad or interrupted connection.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… connection failure …</em> could indicate <a href=\"#faq23\">Too many simultaneous connections</a>.</p>\n<p>The warning <em>… Unsupported encoding …</em> means that the character set of the message is unknown or not supported. FairEmail will assume ISO-8859-1 (Latin1), which will in most cases result in showing the message correctly.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Login Rate Limit Hit …</em> means that there were too many login attempts with an incorrect password. Please double check your password or authenticate the account again with the quick setup wizard (OAuth only).</p>\n<p>The error <em>… NO mailbox selected READ-ONLY …</em> indicates <a href=\"https://sebastian.marsching.com/wiki/Network/Zimbra#Mailbox_Selected_READ-ONLY_Error_in_Thunderbird\">this Zimbra problem</a>.</p>\n<p>The Outlook specific error <em>… Command Error. 10 …</em> probably means that the OAuth token expired or was invalidated. Authenticating the account again with the quick setup wizard will probably resolve this condition. Another possible cause is a bug in an older Exchange version, please <a href=\"https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=886261\">see here</a>. In this case the system administrator needs to update the server software.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… Invalid ID Token Issued at time is more than 10 minutes before or after the current time …</em> means that the clock time of the device deviates too much from the clock time of the email server. Please make sure the clock time, including the time zone, of the device is correct.</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"#faq4\">see here</a> for the errors <em>… Untrusted … not in certificate …</em>, <em>… Invalid security certificate (Can’t verify identity of server) …</em> or <em>… Trust anchor for certification path not found …</em></p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"#faq127\">see here</a> for the error <em>… Syntactically invalid HELO argument(s) …</em>.</p>\n<p>Please <a href=\"#faq41\">see here</a> for the error <em>… Handshake failed …</em>.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://linux.die.net/man/3/connect\">here</a> for what error codes like EHOSTUNREACH and ETIMEDOUT mean.</p>\n<p>The error <em>… connect failed: EACCES (Permission denied) …</em> means that <em>Restrict data usage</em> was disabled in the Android MIUI app settings for FairEmail. On Samsung, and possible other devices, also check: Android settings &gt; Battery &gt; Battery manager / Unmonitored apps.</p>\n<p>Possible causes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A firewall or router is blocking connections to the server</li>\n<li>The host name or port number is invalid</li>\n<li>There are problems with the internet connection</li>\n<li>There are problems with resolving domain names (Yandex: try to disable private DNS in the Android settings)</li>\n<li>The email server is refusing to accept (external) connections</li>\n<li>The email server is refusing to accept a message, for example because it is too large or contains unacceptable links</li>\n<li>There are too many connections to the server, see also the next question</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Many public Wi-Fi networks block outgoing email to prevent spam. Sometimes you can workaround this by using another SMTP port. See the documentation of the provider for the usable port numbers.</p>\n<p>If you are using a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network\">VPN</a>, the VPN provider might block the connection because it is too aggressively trying to prevent spam. Similarly, the email server might block connections via a VPN because it was misused for sending spam. Some VPN providers have “cleaner” IP addresses than others, so switching to another VPN provider might be useful. Note that <a href=\"https://fi.google.com/\">Google Fi</a> is using a VPN too.</p>\n<p>The error ‘<em>You must use stronger authentication such as AUTH or APOP to connect to this server</em>’ can be fixed by enabling debug mode (last option in the miscellaneous settings tab page), and in the debug panel that appears enabling the APOP option.

For incoming messages the <em>to</em>, <em>cc</em>, <em>bcc</em>, <em>from</em> and <em>(X-)delivered/envelope/original-to</em> addresses will be checked (in this order) and for outgoing messages (drafts, outbox and sent) only the <em>from</em> addresses will be checked. Equal addresses have precedence over partially matching addresses, except for <em>delivered-to</em> addresses.</p>\n<p>The matched address will be shown as <em>via</em> in the addresses section of received messages (between the message header and message text).</p>\n<p>Note that identities need to be enabled to be able to be matched and that identities of other accounts will not be considered.</p>\n<p>Matching will be done only once on receiving a message, so changing the configuration will not change existing messages. You could clear local messages by long pressing a folder in the folder list and synchronize the messages again, though.</p>\n<p>It is possible to configure a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression\">regex</a> in the advanced identity settings (Navigation menu &gt; Settings &gt; Manual setup and account options &gt; Identities &gt; tap the identity &gt; Advanced) to match <strong>the username</strong> of an email address (the part before the @ sign).</p>\n<p>Note that the domain name (the parts after the @ sign) always needs to be equal to the domain name of the identity. This also implies that the username will be copied from a received message only if it matches the domain name of the matched identity. Since version 1.1640, it is possible to match the full email address with a regex by including the @ character in the regex, which can be useful for matching alias domain names. The username will not be copied in this case because the domain name of the <em>from</em> address and the the domain name of the identity must be the same. If you want the username to be copied, you should define an identity for each domain, which will allow you to send new messages from a specific domain name too.</p>\n<p>If you want to match a catch-all email address, this regex is usually fine, provided all usernames for the domain are yours:</p>\n<pre><code>.*</code></pre>\n<p>The username of a message being replied to will be used as the default username when editing of usernames is enabled in the advanced identity settings.</p>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"#faq9\">this FAQ</a> about editing the email address when composing a message.</p>\n<p>If you want to <em>not</em> match specific addresses, you can use something like this:</p>\n<pre><code>^(?!marcel$|johanna$).*</code></pre>\n<p>If you like to match the special purpose email addresses abc@example.com and xyx@example.com and like to have a fallback email address main@example.com as well, you could do something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identity: abc@example.com; regex: <strong>(?i)abc</strong></li>\n<li>Identity: xyz@example.com; regex: <strong>(?i)xyz</strong></li>\n<li>Identity: main@example.com; regex: <strong>^(?i)((?!abc|xyz).)*$</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can test a regex <a href=\"https://regexr.com/\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Matched identities can be used to color code messages.</p>\n<p>The identity color takes precedence over the folder and account color. This means that the color of the color stripe will be determined by first checking if there is a color set for the ‘via’ (matched) identity, and after that if there is a color set for the folder containing the message, and finally if there is a color set for the account the message belongs to.</p>\n<p>Setting identity colors is a pro feature.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><a name=\"faq35\"></a> <strong>(35) Why should I be careful with viewing images, attachments, the original message, and opening links?</strong></p>\n<p>🌎 <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq35\">Google Translate</a></p>\n<p>Viewing remotely stored images (see also <a href=\"#faq27\">this FAQ</a>) and opening links might not only tell the sender that you have seen the message, but will also leak your IP address.

However, this doesn’t mean that FairEmail is constantly using battery power. The real battery usage can be seen by navigating to this screen:</p>\n<p><em>Android settings</em>, <em>Battery</em>, three-dots menu <em>Battery usage</em>, three-dots menu <em>Show full device usage</em></p>\n<p>Alternatively: tap on the <em>App settings</em> button in the main settings screen of the app and tap on <em>Battery</em>.</p>\n<p>As a rule of thumb, the battery usage should be below or in any case not be much higher than <em>Mobile network standby</em> for one account with a stable network connection. If this isn’t the case, please turn on <em>Auto optimize</em> in the receive settings tab page. If this doesn’t help, please <a href=\"https://contact.faircode.eu/?product=fairemailsupport\">ask for support</a>.</p>\n<p>It is inevitable that synchronizing messages will use battery power because it requires network access and accessing the messages’ database. Since the app needs to wait for responses of the email server, which requires the processor (CPU) to be active, slower email servers will result in more battery usage.</p>\n<p>If you are comparing the battery usage of FairEmail with another email client, please make sure the other email client is set up similarly. For example, comparing always sync (push messages) and (infrequent) periodic checking for new messages is not a fair comparison.</p>\n<p>If you are comparing the battery usage of FairEmail with an app like Whatsapp, please understand that most apps use <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging\">Firebase Cloud Messaging</a> (FCM) for push messages, which means that no battery usage will be contributed to an app for push messages, but instead to the Google Play Services system component. Apart from the privacy concerns, it is not possible to use FCM for email because email servers do not support FCM. The only way would be to download all your messages to a third-party server first and use FCM to push notifications to the app. The privacy and security implications would be significant, though.</p>\n<p>Reconnecting to an email server will use extra battery power, so an unstable internet connection will result in extra battery usage. Also, some email servers prematurely terminate idle connections, while <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2177\">the standard</a> says that an idle connection should be kept open for 29 minutes. In these cases you might want to synchronize periodically, for example each hour, instead of continuously. Note that polling frequently (more than every 30-60 minutes) will likely use more battery power than synchronizing always because connecting to the server and comparing the local and remote messages are expensive operations.</p>\n<p>If you know that the connection (reception) is bad, it might be worthwhile to decrease the timeout value in the connection-settings tab page to 10–20 seconds, so that the app discovers earlier that no connection is possible, so that the mechanism as described in <a href=\"#faq123\">this FAQ</a> is used faster.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://dontkillmyapp.com/\">On some devices</a> it is necessary to <em>disable</em> battery optimizations (setup step 3) to keep connections to email servers open. In fact, leaving battery optimizations enabled can result in extra battery usage for all devices, even though this sounds contradictory!</p>\n<p>Most of the battery usage, not considering viewing messages, is due to synchronization (receiving and sending) of messages. So, to reduce the battery usage, set the number of days to synchronize message for to a lower value, especially if there are a lot of recent messages in a folder. Long press a folder name in the folders list and select <em>Edit properties</em> to access this setting.</p>\n<p>If you have at least once a day internet connectivity, it is sufficient to synchronize messages just for one day.</p>\n<p>Note that you can set the number of days to <em>keep</em> messages for to a higher number than to <em>synchronize</em> messages for. You could for example initially synchronize messages for a large number of days and after this has been completed reduce the number of days to synchronize messages, but leave the number of days to keep messages. After decreasing the number of days to keep messages, you might want to run the cleanup in the miscellaneous settings to remove old files.</p>\n<p>In the receive settings tab page you can enable to always synchronize starred messages, which will allow you to keep older messages around while synchronizing messages for a limited number of days.</p>\n<p>Disabling the folder option <em>Automatically download message texts and attachments</em> will result in less network traffic and thus less battery usage. You could disable this option, for example for the sent folder and the archive.</p>\n<p>Synchronizing messages at night is mostly not useful, so you can save on battery usage by not synchronizing at night. In the settings, you can select a schedule for message synchronization (this is a pro feature).</p>\n<p>FairEmail will by default synchronize the folder list on each connection. Since folders are mostly not created, renamed and deleted very often, you can save some network and battery usage by disabling this in the receive settings tab page.</p>\n<p>FairEmail will by default check if old messages were deleted from the server on each connection. If you don’t mind that old messages that were deleted from the server are still visible in FairEmail, you can save some network and battery usage by disabling this in the receive settings tab page.</p>\n<p>Some providers don’t follow the IMAP standard and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3501#section-5.4\">don’t keep connections open</a> long enough, forcing FairEmail to reconnect often, causing extra battery usage. You can inspect the <em>Log</em> via the main navigation menu to check if there are frequent reconnects (connection closed/reset, read/write error/timeout, etc.). You can work around this by lowering the keep-alive interval in the advanced account settings to for example 9 or 15 minutes. Note that battery optimizations need to be disabled in setup step 3 to reliably keep connections alive.</p>\n<p>Some providers send every two minutes something like ‘<em>Still here</em>’ resulting in network traffic and your device to wake up and causing unnecessary extra battery usage. You can inspect the <em>Log</em> via the main navigation menu to check if your provider is doing this. If your provider is using <a href=\"https://www.dovecot.org/\">Dovecot</a> as IMAP server, you could ask your provider to change the <a href=\"https://wiki.dovecot.org/Timeouts\">imap_idle_notify_interval</a> setting to a higher value or better yet, to disable this. If your provider is not able or willing to change/disable this, you should consider switching to periodically instead of continuous synchronization. You can change this in the receive settings tab page.</p>\n<p>If you got the message, <em>This provider does not support push messages</em> while configuring an account, consider switching to a modern provider which supports push messages (IMAP IDLE) to reduce battery usage.</p>\n<p>If your device has an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMOLED\">AMOLED</a> screen, you can save battery usage while viewing messages by switching to the black theme.</p>\n<p>If auto optimize in the receive settings tab page is enabled, an account will automatically be switched to periodically checking for new messages when the email server:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Says ‘<em>Still here</em>’ within 3 minutes</li>\n<li>The email server does not support push messages</li>\n<li>The keep-alive interval is lower than 12 minutes</li>\n</ul>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><a name=\"faq40\"></a> <strong>(40) How can I reduce the data usage of FairEmail?</strong></p>\n<p>🌎 <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq40\">Google Translate</a></p>\n<p>You can reduce the data usage basically in the same way as reducing battery usage, see the previous question for suggestions.</p>\n<p>It is inevitable that data will be used to synchronize messages.</p>\n<p>If the connection to the email server is lost, FairEmail will always synchronize the messages again to make sure no messages were missed. If the connection is unstable, this can result in extra data usage. In this case, it is a good idea to decrease the number of days to synchronize messages to a minimum (see the previous question) or to switch to periodically synchronizing of messages (receive settings).</p>\n<p>To reduce data usage, you could change these advanced receive settings:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Check if old messages were removed from the server: disable</li>\n<li>Synchronize (shared) folder list: disable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By default FairEmail does not download message texts and attachments larger than 256 KiB when there is a metered (mobile or paid Wi-Fi) internet connection. You can change this in the connection settings.</p>\n<p>You could enable to download only plain text only parts, but all messages will be without formatting (styling), and besides that, a plain text only part is not always sent, and worse, it is sometimes only a part of the message text, containing HTML and CCS.</p>\n<p>In case of POP3, you can reduce the maximum number of messages to download.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><a name=\"faq41\"></a> <strong>(41) How can I fix the error ‘Handshake failed’?</strong></p>\n<p>🌎 <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq41\">Google Translate</a></p>\n<p>There are several possible causes, so please read to the end of this answer.</p>\n<p>The error ‘<em>Handshake failed … WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER …</em>’ might mean that you are trying to connect to an IMAP or SMTP server without an encrypted connection, typically using port 143 (IMAP) and port 25 (SMTP), or that a wrong protocol (SSL/TLS or STARTTLS) is being used.</p>\n<p>Most providers provide encrypted connections using different ports, typically port 993 (IMAP) and port 465/587 (SMTP).</p>\n<p>If your provider doesn’t support encrypted connections, you should ask to make this possible.

FairEmail is designed to dynamically handle a large number of messages without running out of memory. This means that messages needs to be read from a database and that this database needs to be watched for changes, both of which might cause small delays.</p>\n<p>Some convenience features, like grouping messages to display conversation threads and determining the previous/next message, take a little extra time. Note that there is no <em>the</em> next message because in the meantime a new message might have been arrived.</p>\n<p>When comparing the speed of FairEmail with similar apps this should be part of the comparison. It is easy to write a similar, faster app which just displays a lineair list of messages while possible using too much memory, but it is not so easy to properly manage resource usage and to offer more advanced features like conversation threading.</p>\n<p>FairEmail is based on the state-of-the-art <a href=\"https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/\">Android architecture components</a>, so there is little room for performance improvements.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><a name=\"faq78\"></a> <strong>(78) How do I use schedules?</strong></p>\n<p>🌎 <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq78\">Google Translate</a></p>\n<p>In the receive settings you can enable scheduling and set a time period and the days of the week <em>when</em> messages should be <em>received</em>.</p>\n<p>The schedule section shows two parts, <em>Workdays</em> and <em>Weekend</em>. Each of them has a start time and a finish time. Pressing on any one of these means the time can be edited.</p>\n<p>Below these sections, there is a list of day names, <em>Sunday</em> through to <em>Saturday</em>. Some of these may be in bold text. The ones that are in bold are set using the cog next to the <em>Weekend</em> section. If you press the cog, you can choose which days you define to be the weekend. Typically, it will be <em>Sunday</em> and <em>Saturday</em>, but you can choose any day. Ticking one of these means that that will now be shown as bold in the list of days.</p>\n<p>The times under the <em>Weekend</em> section apply to those days which are in bold. The days which are not in bold are regarded as the workdays.</p>\n<p>You can untick any of the days in the list of days and that means that the schedule will not apply to those days.</p>\n<p>Note that an end time equal to or earlier than the start time is considered to be 24 hours later.</p>\n<p>Since version 1.1880 is is possible to exclude accounts from scheduling in the advanced account settings. This means you can synchronize a business account during business hours only and make an exception for personal accounts.</p>\n<p>Automation, see below, can be used for more advanced schedules, like for example multiple synchronization periods per day or different synchronization periods for different days.</p>\n<p>It is possible to install FairEmail in multiple user profiles, for example a personal and a work profile, and to configure FairEmail differently in each profile, which is another possibility to have different synchronization schedules and to synchronize a different set of accounts.</p>\n<p>It is also possible to create <a href=\"#faq71\">rules</a> with a time condition and to snooze messages until the end time of the time condition. This way it is possible to <em>snooze</em> business related messages until the start of the business hours. This also means that the messages will be on your device for when there is (temporarily) no internet connection.

Servers generally have more memory and computing power, so they are much better suited to this task than battery-powered devices. Also, you’ll want spam filtered for all your email clients, possibly including web email, not just for one email client on one device. Moreover, email servers have access to information, like the IP address, etc. of the connecting server, which an email client has no access to. Furthermore, an email server can inspect all messages of all email accounts, while an email client can inspect messages in your email account only.</p>\n<p>If you are receiving a significant amount of spam, the first thing you should do is consider switching to another email provider. Some email servers excell at filtering spam, and others are really bad at it. Switching to another e-mail provider is no fun, but neither is wading through piles of spam on a daily basis.</p>\n<p>Spam filtering based on message headers might have been feasible, but unfortunately this technique is <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US7543076\">patented by Microsoft</a>.</p>\n<p>Recent versions of FairEmail can filter spam to a certain extent using a message classifier. Please see <a href=\"#faq163\">this FAQ</a> for more information about this.</p>\n<p>Of course you can report messages as spam with FairEmail, which will move the reported messages to the spam folder and train the spam filter of the provider, which is how it is supposed to work. This can be done automatically with <a href=\"#faq71\">rules</a> too. Blocking the sender will create a filter rule to automatically move future messages of the same sender into the spam folder.</p>\n<p>Note that the POP3 protocol gives access to the inbox only. So, it is won’t be possible to report spam for POP3 accounts.</p>\n<p>Note that you should not delete spam messages, also not from the spam folder, because the email server uses the messages in the spam folder to “learn” what spam messages are.</p>\n<p>If you are wondering why a message was moved into the spam folder, these are all possible reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The email server of your email provider moved the message into the spam folder. The app can’t undo this automatically because this can result in an endless loop.</li>\n<li>The message classifier (miscellaneous settings tab page) moved the message into the spam folder.</li>\n<li>A filter rule (navigation menu = left side menu of the start screen), for example a block domain name rule, moved the message into the spam folder.</li>\n<li>An email address or a network address is on a block list (receive settings tab page).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that a sender will automatically be blocked when a message is moved into the spam folder. You can disable this behavior by disabling the option <em>Automatically block the sender when reporting spam</em> in the behavior settings tab page.</p>\n<p>Since version 1.2143, there is an “<em>Unblock all</em>” button in the receive-settings tab page, which will reset all above options.</p>\n<p>If you receive a lot of spam messages in your inbox, the best you can do is to contact the email provider to ask if spam filtering can be improved.</p>\n<p>Also, FairEmail can show a small red warning flag when DKIM, SPF or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMARC\">DMARC</a> authentication failed on the receiving server. You can enable/disable <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_authentication\">authentication verification</a> in the display settings. The feature depends on the header <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7601\">Authentication-Results</a>, which the receiving email server should add. The shield will be green only if DMARC passes (=alignment) and either <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sender_Policy_Framework\">SPF</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DomainKeys_Identified_Mail\">DKIM</a> passes.</p>\n<p>If the email server doesn’t add an <em>Authentication-Results</em> header, which is optional, you can enable native DKIM in the debug panel, which appears when you enable debug mode in the miscellaneous settings tab page (last option). In this case, the shield will be green only when DKIM passes and the signer domain matches that of the sender (=alignment).

So, basically, the only thing I can do, is suggest some things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure you have an active, working internet connection, and turn off any VPN based app because it might prevent the Play store from checking purchases</li>\n<li>Make sure you are logged in with the right Google account and that there is nothing wrong with your Google account</li>\n<li>Make sure you installed FairEmail via the right Google account if you configured multiple Google accounts on your device (you might need to reinstall the app)</li>\n<li>Make sure the Play store app is up to date, please <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1050566?hl=en\">see here</a></li>\n<li>Open the Play store app and wait at least a minute to give it time to synchronize with the Google servers</li>\n<li>Open FairEmail and navigate to the pro features screen to let FairEmail check the purchases; sometimes it helps to tap the <em>buy</em> button</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can also try to clear the cache of the Play store app via the Android apps settings. Restarting the device might be necessary to let the Play store recognize the purchase correctly.</p>\n<p>Note that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you did not yet configure an email account in the app, you can long press <em>About</em> in the navigation menu (left side menu) of the settings screen to go to the pro features screen</li>\n<li>If you get <em>ITEM_ALREADY_OWNED</em>, the Play store app probably needs to be updated, please <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/1050566?hl=en\">see here</a></li>\n<li>If you get <em>BILLING_UNAVAILABLE Google Play In-app Billing API version is less than 3</em>, the Play store app might not be logged into the account used to install the app</li>\n<li>Purchases are stored in the Google cloud and cannot get lost</li>\n<li>There is no time limit on purchases, so they cannot expire</li>\n<li>Google does not expose details (name, e-mail, etc) about buyers to developers</li>\n<li>An app like FairEmail cannot select which Google account to use</li>\n<li>It may take a while until the Play store app has synchronized a purchase to another device</li>\n<li>Play Store purchases cannot be used without the Play Store app/services</li>\n<li>Play Store purchases cannot be transferred to another account</li>\n<li>You can’t restore purchases with <a href=\"https://microg.org/\">microG</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/4646404\">see here</a> about how to add, remove, or edit your Google Play payment method.</p>\n<p>Sometimes the Play Store assigns a purchase incorrectly to another Google account configured on the device, resulting in the purchase not being recognized anymore.

In the context of FairEmail, a folder is a class. So, for example, the inbox, the spam folder, a ‘marketing’ folder, etc, etc.</p>\n<p>You can enable message classification in the miscellaneous settings. This will enable ‘learning’ mode only. The classifier will ‘learn’ from new messages in the inbox and spam folder by default. The folder property <em>Classify new messages in this folder</em> will enable or disable ‘learning’ mode for a folder. You can clear local messages (long press a folder in the folder list of an account) and synchronize the messages again to classify existing messages.</p>\n<p>Each folder has an option <em>Automatically move classified messages to this folder</em> (‘auto classification’ for short). When this is turned on, new messages in other folders which the classifier thinks belong to that folder will be automatically moved.</p>\n<p>The option <em>Use local spam filter</em> in the report spam dialog will turn on message classification in the miscellaneous settings and auto classification for the spam folder. Please understand that this is not a replacement for the spam filter of the email server and can result in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives\">false positives and false negatives</a>. See also <a href=\"#faq92\">this FAQ</a>.</p>\n<p>A practical example: suppose there is a folder ‘marketing’ and auto message classification is enabled for this folder. Each time you move a message into this folder you’ll train FairEmail that similar messages belong in this folder. Each time you move a message out of this folder you’ll train FairEmail that similar messages do not belong in this folder. After moving some messages into the ‘marketing’ folder, FairEmail will start moving similar messages automatically into this folder. Or, the other way around, after moving some messages out of the ‘marketing’ folder, FairEmail will stop moving similar messages automatically into this folder. This will work best with messages with similar content (email addresses, subject and message text).</p>\n<p>Classification should be considered as a best guess - it might be a wrong guess, or the classifier might not be confident enough to make any guess. If the classifier is unsure, it will simply leave an email where it is.</p>\n<p>To prevent the email server from moving a message into the spam folder again and again, auto classification out of the spam folder will not be done.</p>\n<p>The message classifier calculates the probability a message belongs in a folder (class). There are two options in the miscellaneous settings which control if a message will be automatically moved into a folder, provided that auto classification is enabled for the folder:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Minimum class probability</em>: a message will only be moved when the confidence it belongs in a folder is greater than this value (default 15 %)</li>\n<li><em>Minimum class difference</em>: a message will only be moved when the difference in confidence between one class and the next most likely class is greater than this value (default 50 %)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If all previously classified messages were the same and the message being evaluated is also the same, the confidence would be 100%.</p>\n<p>Both conditions must be satisfied before a message will be moved.</p>\n<p>Considering the default option values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apples 40 % and bananas 30 % would be disregarded because the difference of 25 % is below the minimum of 50 %</li>\n<li>Apples 10 % and bananas 5 % would be disregarded because the probability for apples is below the minimum of 15 %</li>\n<li>Apples 50 % and bananas 20 % would result in selecting apples</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Classification is optimized to use as little resources as possible, but will inevitably use some extra battery power. This is also why only folders of the same account will be considered.</p>\n<p>You can delete all classification data by turning classification in the miscellaneous settings three times off. This will be necessary when classification for a folder is enabled or disabled (or when a folder is deleted) because classification is based on comparision.</p>\n<p><a href=\"#faq71\">Rules</a> will be executed before classification. If one or more rules were executed for a message, message classification will be skipped because it is assumed that the message will be processed by the rules in this case.</p>\n<p>Message classification is a pro feature, except for the spam folder.</p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><a name=\"faq164\"></a> <strong>(164) Can you add customizable themes?</strong></p>\n<p>🌎 <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq164\">Google Translate</a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Android <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/26511725/1794097\">does not support</a> dynamic themes, which means all themes need <a href=\"https://github.com/M66B/FairEmail/blob/master/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml\">to be predefined</a>.</p>\n<p>Since for each theme there needs to be a light, dark and black variant, it is not feasible to add for each color combination (literally millions) a predefined theme.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a theme is more than just a few colors.

For other folders, you can long press the folder in the folder list of the account (tap on the account name in the navigation menu = left side menu). When you long press on a parent folder, there will be a subfolders option with a menu item to fetch more messages for all child folders. Please read the remark in the confirmation dialog box.</p>\n<p>Note that starred (favorite) messages will be kept on your device “forever”.</p>\n<p>Instead of downloading many messages to your device, consider <a href=\"#faq13\">searching for messages on the email server</a>.</p>\n<p>Longer explanation: the app has a sync and a keep window per folder. The <em>Fetch more messages</em> menu item is, in fact, a mini wizard to change the keep window of one or more folders at the same time, and to initiate a corresponding synchronization operation. If you long press on a folder in the folder list and select <em>Edit properties</em>, you can change the sync and keep window of the folder. The sync window determines which messages will be checked with a standard sync operation (default 7 days), and the keep window determines how long messages will be kept on the device (default 30 days). If you sync another time within 30 seconds, all messages in the keep window will be checked, which is useful when you have been moving around messages with another email client, for example on your desktop computer. It is mostly pointless to check all messages all the time, especially considering that this will use battery power, which is why there is a separate sync and keep window, and why the app checks messages younger than a week only.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><a name=\"faq192\"></a> <strong>(192) How can I resolve ‘Couldn’t connect to host, port: …; timeout …;’ ?</strong></p>\n<p>🌎 <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=en&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fm66b.github.io%2FFairEmail%2F%23faq192\">Google Translate</a></p>\n<p>This error message means that the app didn’t receive a response from the email server of your email provider.
