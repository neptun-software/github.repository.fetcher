          "content": "### Overview\r\n\r\njOOR stands for jOOR Object Oriented Reflection. It is a simple wrapper for the java.lang.reflect package.\r\n\r\njOOR's name is inspired by jOOQ, a fluent API for SQL building and execution.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n\r\nNone!\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\n**For use with Java 9+**\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.jooq</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>joor</artifactId>\r\n  <version>0.9.15</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**For use with Java 8+**\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.jooq</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>joor-java-8</artifactId>\r\n  <version>0.9.15</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**For use with Java 6+**\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<dependency>\r\n  <groupId>org.jooq</groupId>\r\n  <artifactId>joor-java-6</artifactId>\r\n  <version>0.9.15</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Simple example\r\n\r\n````java\r\n// All examples assume the following static import:\r\nimport static org.joor.Reflect.*;\r\n\r\nString world = onClass(\"java.lang.String\") // Like Class.forName()\r\n                .create(\"Hello World\")     // Call most specific matching constructor\r\n                .call(\"substring\", 6)      // Call most specific matching substring() method\r\n                .call(\"toString\")          // Call toString()\r\n                .get();                    // Get the wrapped object, in this case a String\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proxy abstraction\r\n\r\njOOR also gives access to the java.lang.reflect.Proxy API in a simple way:\r\n\r\n````java\r\npublic interface StringProxy {\r\n  String substring(int beginIndex);\r\n}\r\n\r\nString substring = onClass(\"java.lang.String\")\r\n                    .create(\"Hello World\")\r\n                    .as(StringProxy.class) // Create a proxy for the wrapped object\r\n                    .substring(6);         // Call a proxy method\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Runtime compilation of Java code\r\n\r\njOOR has an optional dependency on the `java.compiler` module and simplifies access to `javax.tools.JavaCompiler` through the following API:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSupplier<String> supplier = Reflect.compile(\r\n    \"com.example.HelloWorld\",\r\n    \"package com.example;\\n\" +\r\n    \"class HelloWorld implements java.util.function.Supplier<String> {\\n\" +\r\n    \"    public String get() {\\n\" +\r\n    \"        return \\\"Hello World!\\\";\\n\" +\r\n    \"    }\\n\" +\r\n    \"}\\n\").create().get();\r\n\r\n// Prints \"Hello World!\"\r\nSystem.out.println(supplier.get());\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Comparison with standard java.lang.reflect\r\n\r\njOOR code:\r\n\r\n````java\r\nEmployee[] employees = on(department).call(\"getEmployees\").get();\r\n\r\nfor (Employee employee : employees) {\r\n  Street street = on(employee).call(\"getAddress\").call(\"getStreet\").get();\r\n  System.out.println(street);\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe same example with normal reflection in Java:\r\n\r\n````java\r\ntry {\r\n  Method m1 = department.getClass().getMethod(\"getEmployees\");\r\n  Employee[] employees = (Employee[]) m1.invoke(department);\r\n\r\n  for (Employee employee : employees) {\r\n    Method m2 = employee.getClass().getMethod(\"getAddress\");\r\n    Address address = (Address) m2.invoke(employee);\r\n\r\n    Method m3 = address.getClass().getMethod(\"getStreet\");\r\n    Street street = (Street) m3.invoke(address);\r\n\r\n    System.out.println(street);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// There are many checked exceptions that you are likely to ignore anyway \r\ncatch (Exception ignore) {\r\n\r\n  // ... or maybe just wrap in your preferred runtime exception:\r\n  throw new RuntimeException(e);\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\n\r\n### Similar projects\r\n\r\nEveryday Java reflection with a fluent interface:\r\n\r\n * http://docs.codehaus.org/display/FEST/Reflection+Module\r\n * http://projetos.vidageek.net/mirror/mirror/\r\n\r\nReflection modelled as XPath (quite interesting!)\r\n\r\n * http://commons.apache.org/jxpath/users-guide.html\r\n\r\n"
