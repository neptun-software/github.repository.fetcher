We appreciate and are thankful for contributions in all shapes and sizes.\n\n## Asking Questions\n\n* Use either Slack or GitHub Discussions to ask questions.\n* Do not open issues for questions. **Questions submitted through GitHub issues will be closed**.\n* Consult the [community-maintained FAQ](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/FAQ/) to see whether your question has already been answered.\n* Avoid contacting individual contributors directly; ask questions in public instead. A well-worded question will help serve as a resource to others searching for help.\n\nThe [`#proj-dependency-track` channel](https://dependencytrack.org/slack) in the OWASP Slack space is the best place \nto ask questions and get in touch with other users and contributors. We provide an invitation to the Slack space \n[here](https://dependencytrack.org/slack/invite). Please *do* create an issue if either channel link or invitation \ndo not work anymore.\n\n## Filing Issues\n\n### Looking for existing Issues\n\nBefore you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+) \nto see if the defect or enhancement request has already been filed.\n\nIf you find your issue already exists, add relevant comments to the existing issue. \n\nOptionally indicate your interest by reacting with *thumbs up* (👍). Issues with higher community attention are more likely to be addressed sooner.\n\nIf you cannot find an existing issue for your bug or feature request, create a new issue using the guidelines below.\n\n### Requesting Enhancements\n\nFile a single issue per enhancement request. Do not list multiple enhancement requests in the same issue.\n\nDescribe your use case and the value you will get from the requested enhancement.\n\n### Reporting Defects\n\nFile a single issue per defect. Do not list multiple defects in the same issue.\n\nThe more information you can provide, the more likely we will be successful at reproducing the bug and finding a fix.\n\nAPI server logs (including errors) are logged to the following locations per default:\n\n* `~/.dependency-track/dependency-track.log` (`/data/.dependency-track/dependency-track.log` within Docker containers)\n* Standard output (use `docker logs -f <CONTAINER_NAME>` when using Docker)\n\nErrors in the frontend are logged to your browser's developer console (see [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/console/log/#browser) \nfor Google Chrome). Issues in the communication between frontend and API server will be visible in the *Network* tab of \nyour browser's developer tools (see [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/network/#load) for Google Chrome).\n\nDepending on the defect, we may ask you for a sample BOM that triggers your issue.\n\nBefore sharing BOMs, logs, screenshots or any other resources with us, please ensure that you blank, pseudonymise or\nremove all references that may leak internals of your organization.\n\n## Reporting Vulnerabilities\n\nPlease refer to our security policy in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for how to responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us.\n\n## Improving Documentation\n\nBeside extending existing documentation or correcting any errors it may contain, another great way to contribute is to\nupdate the [FAQ](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/FAQ/) with questions and answers that benefit the community.\n\nRefer to the *Documentation* section of [`DEVELOPING.md`](./DEVELOPING.md) for a guide on how to build the documentation locally.\n\n## Testing Snapshot Versions\n\nEvery time a commit is pushed to the `master` branch, container images are built and published to the `snapshot` tag.\nThis is true for both API server and frontend:\n\n* [`dependencytrack/apiserver:snapshot`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dependencytrack/apiserver/tags?name=snapshot)\n* [`dependencytrack/bundled:snapshot`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dependencytrack/bundled/tags?name=snapshot)\n* [`dependencytrack/frontend:snapshot`](https://hub.docker.com/r/dependencytrack/frontend/tags?name=snapshot)\n\nTesting `snapshot` versions and providing early feedback helps in improving the quality of new releases.\nThe private `#proj-dependency-track-beta` Slack channel is intended for discussions about and feedback for `snapshot`\nversions. If you are interested in participating, please let us know in [`#proj-dependency-track`](https://dependencytrack.org/slack).\n\n## Contributing Code\n\nBefore raising pull requests, please [file a defect](#reporting-defects) or [enhancement request](#requesting-enhancements) first. \n\n* We use [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/milestones) to plan what will be included in the next release. \n  * Depending on the size of your PR and whether it introduces breaking changes, we may schedule your change for a later release.\n* Issues for which community contributions are explicitly requested are labeled with [`help wanted`](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+).\n* Issues suitable for first-time contributors are labeled with [`good first issue`](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+).\n\n[`DEVELOPING.md`](./DEVELOPING.md) provides a detailed guide on how to get started with working on Dependency-Track.\n\n### Pull Requests\n\n* Pull requests that do not merge easily with the tip of the `master` branch will be declined.\n  * The author will be asked to merge with tip and submit a new pull request.\n* Code should follow standard code style conventions for whitespace, indentation and naming.\n  * In the case of style differences between existing code and language standards, consistency with existing code is preferred.\n* New functionality should have corresponding tests added to the existing test suite if possible.\n* Avoid new dependencies if the functionality that is being used is trivial to implement directly or is available in standard libraries.\n* Avoid checking in unrelated whitespace changes with code changes.\n* Commits must be [signed off](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt--s) to indicate agreement with [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/).\n* Optionally include visualizations like screenshots, videos or [diagrams](https://github.blog/2022-02-14-include-diagrams-markdown-files-mermaid/) in the pull request description.\n\n### Commit Messages\n\nPlease follow these rules when writing a commit message:\n\n* Separate subject from body with a blank line\n* Limit the subject line to 50 characters\n* Capitalize the subject line\n* Do not end the subject line with a period\n* Use the imperative mood in the subject line\n* Wrap the body at 72 characters\n* Use the body to explain *what* and *why* vs. *how*\n"

Awesome, here's what you need to know to get started!\n\n> Please be sure to read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and \n> [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as well.\n\n## Repositories\n\nAs of now, the Dependency-Track project consists of two separate repositories:\n\n* [DependencyTrack/dependency-track](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track) - The main application, also referred to as API server, based on Java and [Alpine](https://github.com/stevespringett/Alpine).\n* [DependencyTrack/frontend](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend) - The frontend, a single page application (SPA), based on JavaScript and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/).\n\nThis document primarily covers the API server. Please refer to the frontend repository for frontend-specific instructions.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nThere are a few things you'll need on your journey:\n\n* JDK 21+ ([Temurin](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases) distribution recommended)\n* Maven (comes bundled with IntelliJ and Eclipse)\n* A Java IDE of your preference (we recommend IntelliJ, but any other IDE is fine as well)\n* Docker (optional)\n\n> We provide common [run configurations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) for IntelliJ \n> in the [`.idea/runConfigurations`](./.idea/runConfigurations) directory for convenience. IntelliJ will automatically pick those up when you open this repository.\n\n## Core Technologies\n\nKnowing about the core technologies used by the API server may help you with understanding its codebase.\n\n| Technology                                                                                      | Purpose                   |\n|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------------------|\n| [JAX-RS](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j.rest)                                       | REST API specification    |\n| [Jersey](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey/)                                                | JAX-RS implementation     |\n| [Java Data Objects (JDO)](https://db.apache.org/jdo/)                                           | Persistence specification |\n| [DataNucleus](https://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/jdo/getting_started.html)     | JDO implementation        |\n| [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/)                                                         | Servlet Container         |\n| [Alpine](https://github.com/stevespringett/Alpine)                                              | Framework / Scaffolding   |\n\n## Building\n\nBuild an executable JAR containing just the API server:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean package -P clean-exclude-wars -P enhance -P embedded-jetty -DskipTests -Dlogback.configuration.file=src/main/docker/logback.xml\n```\n\nBuild an executable JAR that contains both API server and frontend (aka \"bundled\" distribution):\n\n```shell\nmvn clean package -P clean-exclude-wars -P enhance -P embedded-jetty -P bundle-ui -DskipTests -Dlogback.configuration.file=src/main/docker/logback.xml\n```\n\n> When using the `bundle-ui` profile, Maven will download a [`DependencyTrack/frontend`](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend) \n> release and include it in the JAR. The frontend version is specified via the `frontend.version` property in [`pom.xml`](./pom.xml).\n\nThe resulting files are placed in `./target` as `dependency-track-apiserver.jar` or `dependency-track-bundled.jar` respectively.\nBoth JARs ship with an [embedded Jetty server](https://github.com/stevespringett/Alpine/tree/master/alpine-executable-war), \nthere's no need to deploy them in an application server like Tomcat or WildFly.\n\n## Running\n\nTo run a previously built executable JAR, just invoke it with `java -jar`, e.g.:\n\n```shell\njava -jar ./target/dependency-track-apiserver.jar\n```\n\nThe API server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.\n\nAdditional configuration (e.g. database connection details) can be provided as usual via `application.properties`\nor environment variables. Refer to the [configuration documentation](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/getting-started/configuration/).\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo build and run the API server in one go, invoke the Jetty Maven plugin as follows:\n\n```shell\nmvn jetty:run -P enhance -Dlogback.configurationFile=src/main/docker/logback.xml\n```\n\n> Note that the `bundle-ui` profile has no effect using this method. \n> It works only for the API server, not the bundled distribution.\n\nThe above command is also suitable for debugging. For IntelliJ, simply *Debug* the [Jetty](./.idea/runConfigurations/Jetty.run.xml) run configuration.\n\n### Inspecting the database\n\nUnless configured otherwise, Dependency-Track will use an [H2](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) database in \n`embedded` mode. The database file is located at `~/.dependency-track/db.mv.db`.\n\nYou can open and inspect the database file, for example with tools like [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/) or \n[IntelliJ Ultimate's integrated one](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/database-tool-window.html),\nusing the following connection details:\n\n* JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:~/.dependency-track/db`\n* Username: `sa`\n* Password: none\n\nThese are the values defined via `alpine.database.*` properties in the\n[`application.properties`](src/main/resources/application.properties) file.\n\n> **Warning**  \n> Make sure that your database tool uses version **2** of the H2 database driver.\n> Connections using version 1 of the driver will fail!\n\nA limitation of the H2 database in `embedded` mode is that *only a single process at a time can access it*.\nIf you want to inspect the database while Dependency-Track is running, you have two options:\n\n#### Enable the embedded H2 console\n\nWhen building Dependency-Track locally, you can opt in to enabling an embedded \n[H2 console](http://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html#h2_console). \n\nTo enable it, simply pass the additional `h2-console` Maven profile to your build command.\nThis also works with the Jetty Maven plugin:\n\n```shell\nmvn jetty:run -P enhance -P h2-console -Dlogback.configurationFile=src/main/docker/logback.xml\n```\n\nOnce enabled, the console will be available at http://localhost:8080/h2-console.\n\n> **Note**  \n> Supporting the H2 console via a dedicated build profile instead of a runtime configuration \n> was an [active decision](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/dependency-track/pull/2592). Exposing\n> the console is a security risk, and should only ever be done for local testing purposes. Enabling\n> the console is not possible in official builds distributed via GitHub releases and Docker Hub.\n\n#### Use an external database\n\nSimply set up any of the [supported external databases](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/getting-started/database-support/).\nDocker makes this very easy. Here's an example for how you can do it with PostgreSQL:\n\n```shell\n# Launch a Postgres container\ndocker run -d --name postgres -p \"127.0.0.1:5432:5432\" \\\n  -e \"POSTGRES_DB=dtrack\" -e \"POSTGRES_USER=dtrack\" -e \"POSTGRES_PASSWORD=dtrack\" \\\n  postgres:15-alpine\n\n# Configure the database connection for Dependency-Track\nexport ALPINE_DATABASE_MODE=external\nexport ALPINE_DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/dtrack\nexport ALPINE_DATABASE_DRIVER=org.postgresql.Driver\nexport ALPINE_DATABASE_USERNAME=dtrack\nexport ALPINE_DATABASE_PASSWORD=dtrack\n\n# Launch Dependency-Track\nmvn jetty:run -P enhance -Dlogback.configurationFile=src/main/docker/logback.xml\n```\n\nYou can now use tooling native to your chosen RDBMS, for example [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/).\n\n### Skipping NVD mirroring\n\nFor local debugging and testing, it is sometimes desirable to skip the NVD mirroring process\nthat is executed a minute after Dependency-Track has started.\n\nThis can be achieved by tricking Dependency-Track into thinking that it already\nmirrored the NVD data, so there's no need to re-download it again.\n\nPrior to starting Dependency-Track, execute the `data-nist-generate-dummy.sh` script:\n\n```shell\n./dev/scripts/data-nist-generate-dummy.sh\n```\n\n> **Note** \n> The `modified` feed will still be downloaded. But that feed is so small that it\n> doesn't really have an impact.\n\nWhen testing containerized deployments, simply mount the local directory containing the prepared\nNVD data into the container:\n\n```shell\n./dev/scripts/data-nist-generate-dummy.sh\ndocker run -d --name dtrack \\\n  -v \"$HOME/.dependency-track:/data/.dependency-track\" \\\n  -p '127.0.0.1:8080:8080' dependencytrack/apiserver:snapshot\n```\n\n## Debugging with Frontend\n\nStart the API server via the Jetty Maven plugin (see [Debugging](#debugging) above). The API server will listen on \n`http://127.0.0.1:8080`.\n\nClone the frontend repository, install its required dependencies and launch the Vue development server:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend.git dependency-track-frontend\ncd ./dependency-track-frontend\nnpm ci\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nPer default, the Vue development server will listen on port `8080`. If that port is taken, it will choose a higher,\nunused port (typically `8081`). Due to this behavior, it is important to always start the API server first, unless\nyou want to fiddle with default configurations of both API server and frontend.\n\nNow visit `http://127.0.0.1:8081` in your browser and use Dependency-Track as usual.\n\n## Testing\n\n### Running unit tests\n\nTo run all tests:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean verify -P enhance\n```\n\nTo run a single test:\n\n```shell\nmvn -P enhance -Dtest=ComposerMetaAnalyzerTest verify\n```\n\nDepending on your machine, this will take roughly 10-30min. Unless you modified central parts of the application,\nstarting single tests separately via IDE is a better choice. \n\n### Testing manually\n\nWe provide multiple Docker Compose files that can be used to quickly set up a local testing environment.  \nThe files are located in the [`dev`](dev/) directory.\n\n#### With embedded H2 database\n\nThe default [`docker-compose.yml`](dev/docker-compose.yml) will deploy a frontend and API server container using an \nembedded H2 database.\n\n```shell\ncd dev\ndocker compose up -d\n```\n\n#### With PostgreSQL database\n\nTo use a PostgreSQL database instead of embedded H2, use [`docker-compose.postgres.yml`](dev/docker-compose.postgres.yml).\n\n```shell\ncd dev\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml up -d\n```\n\n#### With Microsoft SQL Server database\n\nTo use a Microsoft SQL Server database instead of embedded H2, use [`docker-compose.mssql.yml`](dev/docker-compose.mssql.yml).\n\n```shell\ncd dev\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mssql.yml up -d\n```\n\n#### With monitoring stack\n\nTo deploy both Prometheus and Grafana, [`docker-compose.monitoring.yml`](dev/docker-compose.monitoring.yml) may be supplied to any\nof the commands listed above. For example:\n\n```shell\ncd dev\ndocker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.postgres.yml -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d\n```\n\nPrometheus will automatically discover the API server's metrics. Grafana is configured to provision Prometheus\nas datasource, and import the [sample dashboard](https://docs.dependencytrack.org/getting-started/monitoring/#grafana-dashboard)\non startup.\n\nTo view the dashboard, visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser. The initial Grafana credentials are:\n\n* Username: `admin`\n* Password: `admin`\n\n## DataNucleus Bytecode Enhancement\n\nOccasionally when running tests without Maven from within your IDE, you will run into failures due to exceptions\nsimilar to this one:\n\n```\norg.datanucleus.exceptions.NucleusUserException: Found Meta-Data for class org.dependencytrack.model.Component but this class is either not enhanced or you have multiple copies of the persistence API jar in your CLASSPATH!! Make sure all persistable classes are enhanced before running DataNucleus and/or the CLASSPATH is correct.\n```\n\nThis happens because DataNucleus requires classes annotated with `@PersistenceCapable` to be [enhanced](https://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/jdo/enhancer.html).\nEnhancement is performed on compiled bytecode and thus has to be performed post-compilation \n(`process-classes` [lifecycle phase](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#Lifecycle_Reference) in Maven). \nDuring a Maven build, the [DataNucleus Maven plugin](https://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform/jdo/enhancer.html#maven)\ntakes care of this (that's also why `-P enhance` is required in all Maven commands).\n\nBecause most IDEs run their own build when executing tests, effectively bypassing Maven, bytecode enhancement is not\nperformed, and exceptions as that shown above are raised. If this happens, you can manually kick off the bytecode\nenhancement like this:\n\n```shell\nmvn clean process-classes -P enhance\n```\n\nNow just execute the test again, and it should just work. \n\n> If you're still running into issues, ensure that your IDE is not cleaning the workspace \n> (removing the `target` directory) before executing the test. \n\n## Building Container Images\n\nEnsure you've built either API server or the bundled distribution, or both.\n\nTo build the API server image:\n\n```shell\ndocker build --build-arg WAR_FILENAME=dependency-track-apiserver.jar -t dependencytrack/apiserver:local -f ./src/main/docker/Dockerfile .\n```\n\nTo build the bundled image:\n\n```shell\ndocker build --build-arg WAR_FILENAME=dependency-track-bundled.jar -t dependencytrack/bundled:local -f ./src/main/docker/Dockerfile .\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and published to \n[docs.dependencytrack.org](https://docs.dependencytrack.org). Sources are located in the [`docs`](./docs) directory.\n\nThere is a lot going on in `docs`, but most of the time you'll want to spend your time in these directories:\n\n* [`docs/_docs`](./docs/_docs): The *actual* documentation\n* [`docs/_posts`](./docs/_posts): The changelogs\n\nTo build the docs, run:\n\n```shell\n./dev/scripts/docs-build.sh\n```\n\nThis installs all required dependencies (among them Jekyll) to `docs/vendor/bundle`, generates the documentation\nwebsite and stores it in `docs/_site`.\n\nFor local development, you may want to run this instead: \n```shell\n./dev/scripts/docs-dev.sh\n```\n\nThis will start a local webserver that listens on `127.0.0.1:4000` and rebuilds the site whenever you make changes.\n\n> To be able to build the docs with Jekyll, you'll need [Ruby 2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/),\n> [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download) and [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) installed.\n> If you can't be bothered to install all of this, you can use the \n> [Jekyll container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll) instead, e.g.:\n> ```\n> docker run --rm -it --name jekyll -p \"127.0.0.1:4000:4000\" -v \"$(pwd)/docs:/srv/jekyll:Z\" jekyll/jekyll:3.8 jekyll serve\n> ```\n\n## Feature Branches\n\nWhen working on larger changes, it can happen that pull requests remain open for a prolonged period of time.\nAs the `master` branch evolves, more and more merge conflicts occur, which the PR author needs to address.\n\nSometimes it's desired to get user feedback on a new feature before it's being merged to `master`.\nExpecting users to clone the repository and build the project on their own however is not realistic.\nInstead, it would be beneficial to offer a container image including the new feature.\n\nWhen a feature is built in collaboration by multiple individuals, teams have to jump through annoying hoops\nto make it work with the GitHub workflow. Usually this requires one individual to raise a PR from their fork,\nand giving the rest of the team write permissions to their repository.\n\nTo address the use cases above, contributors to the Dependency-Track project can request a *feature branch*\nfrom a maintainer. Feature branches follow the `feature-*` naming pattern, and are subject to branch protection rules.\nJust like for the `master` branch, changes pushed to a `feature` branch trigger a container image build.\nImages built from `feature` branches are tagged with the name of the branch, for example for a branch named `feature-foobar`:\n\n```\ndocker.io/dependencytrack/apiserver:feature-foobar\n```\n\nThis imagine can be shared with colleagues and community members for testing. Images built this way will be deleted\nshortly after the respective feature has been merged into the `master` branch.\n\nInstead of raising PRs into `master`, contributors would now raise PRs into `feature-foobar`. \n\n> [!NOTE]\n> PRs into `feature` branches must still be approved by maintainers, to avoid malicious code being introduced.\n> However, this is only a surface-level review, unless explicitly requested otherwise by the contributor(s).\n\nOnce the feature is considered ready, a PR can be raised from `feature-foobar` into `master`.\n"

Dependency-Track takes a unique\nand highly beneficial approach by leveraging the capabilities of [Software Bill of Materials] (SBOM). This approach\nprovides capabilities that traditional Software Composition Analysis (SCA) solutions cannot achieve.\n\nDependency-Track monitors component usage across all versions of every application in its portfolio in order to\nproactively identify risk across an organization. The platform has an API-first design and is ideal for use in\nCI/CD environments.\n\n## Ecosystem Overview\n![alt text](./docs/images/integrations.png)\n\n## Features\n* Consumes and produces [CycloneDX] Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)\n* Consumes and produces [CycloneDX Vulnerability Exploitability Exchange (VEX)](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vex/)\n* Component support for:\n  * Applications\n  * Libraries\n  * Frameworks\n  * Operating systems\n  * Containers\n  * Firmware\n  * Files\n  * Hardware\n  * Services\n* Tracks component usage across every application in an organizations portfolio\n* Quickly identify what is affected, and where\n* Identifies multiple forms of risk including\n  * Components with known vulnerabilities\n  * Out-of-date components\n  * Modified components\n  * License risk\n  * More coming soon...\n* Integrates with multiple sources of vulnerability intelligence including:\n  * [National Vulnerability Database] (NVD)\n  * [GitHub Advisories]\n  * [Sonatype OSS Index]\n  * [Snyk]\n  * [Trivy]\n  * [OSV]\n  * [VulnDB] from [Risk Based Security]\n  * More coming soon.\n* Helps to prioritize mitigation by incorporating support for the [Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS)](https://www.first.org/epss/)\n* Maintain a private vulnerability database of vulnerability components\n* Robust policy engine with support for global and per-project policies\n  * Security risk and compliance\n  * License risk and compliance\n  * Operational risk and compliance\n* Ecosystem agnostic with built-in repository support for:\n  * Cargo (Rust)\n  * Composer (PHP)\n  * Gems (Ruby)\n  * Hex (Erlang/Elixir)\n  * Maven (Java)\n  * NPM (Javascript)\n  * CPAN (Perl)\n  * NuGet (.NET)\n  * PyPI (Python)\n  * More coming soon.\n* Identifies APIs and external service components including:\n  * Service provider\n  * Endpoint URIs\n  * Data classification\n  * Directional flow of data\n  * Trust boundary traversal\n  * Authentication requirements\n* Includes a comprehensive auditing workflow for triaging results\n* Configurable notifications supporting Slack, Microsoft Teams, Mattermost, Webhooks, Webex, Email and Jira\n* Supports standardized SPDX license ID’s and tracks license use by component\n* Easy to read metrics for components, projects, and portfolio\n* Native support for Kenna Security, Fortify SSC, ThreadFix, and DefectDojo\n* API-first design facilitates easy integration with other systems\n* API documentation available in OpenAPI format\n* OAuth 2.0 + OpenID Connect (OIDC) support for single sign-on (authN/authZ)\n* Supports internally managed users, Active Directory/LDAP, and API Keys\n* Simple to install and configure.

They are:\n\n| Package    | Package Format          | Recommended | Supported | Docker | Download |\n|:-----------|:------------------------|:-----------:|:---------:|:------:|:--------:|\n| API Server | Executable WAR          |      ✅      |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅     |\n| Frontend   | Single Page Application |      ✅      |     ✅     |   ✅    |    ✅     |\n| Bundled    | Executable WAR          |      ❌      |    ☑️     |   ✅    |    ✅     |\n\n#### API Server\n\nThe API Server contains an embedded Jetty server and all server-side functionality, but excludes the frontend user\ninterface. This variant is new as of Dependency-Track v4.0.\n\n#### Frontend\n\nThe [Frontend](https://github.com/DependencyTrack/frontend) is the user interface that is accessible in a web browser. The Frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA)\nthat can be deployed independently of the Dependency-Track API Server. This variant is new as of Dependency-Track v3.8.\n\n#### Bundled\n\nThe Bundled variant combines the API Server and the Frontend user interface. This variant was previously referred to as\nthe executable war and was the preferred distribution from Dependency-Track v3.0 - v3.8. This variant is supported but\ndeprecated and will be discontinued in a future release.\n\n#### Traditional\n\nThe Traditional variant combines the API Server and the Frontend user interface and must be deployed to a Servlet\ncontainer. This variant is not supported, deprecated, and will be discontinued in a future release.\n\n## Deploying on Kubernetes with Helm\n\nRefer to https://github.com/DependencyTrack/helm-charts.\n\n## Contributing\n\nInterested in contributing to Dependency-Track?
