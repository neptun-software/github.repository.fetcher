If your /bin/sh is\n#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or\n#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole\n#       command line, like:\n#\n#           ksh Gradle\n#\n#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script\n#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:\n#         * functions;\n#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,\n#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;\n#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;\n#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».\n#\n#   Important for patching:\n#\n#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided\n#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.\n#\n#       The \"traditional\" practice of packing multiple parameters into a\n#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security\n#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating\n#       options in \"$@\", and eventually passing that to Java.\n#\n#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,\n#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;\n#       see the in-line comments for details.\n#\n#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,\n#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.\n#\n#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template\n#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt\n#       within the Gradle project.\n#\n#       You can find Gradle at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/.\n#\n##############################################################################\n\n# Attempt to set APP_HOME\n\n# Resolve links: $0 may be a link\napp_path=$0\n\n# Need this for daisy-chained symlinks.\nwhile\n    APP_HOME=${app_path%\"${app_path##*/}\"}  # leaves a trailing /; empty if no leading path\n    [ -h \"$app_path\" ]\ndo\n    ls=$( ls -ld \"$app_path\" )\n    link=${ls#*' -> '}\n    case $link in             #(\n      /*)   app_path=$link ;; #(\n      *)    app_path=$APP_HOME$link ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n# This is normally unused\n# shellcheck disable=SC2034\nAPP_BASE_NAME=${0##*/}\n# Discard cd standard output in case $CDPATH is set (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25036)\nAPP_HOME=$( cd \"${APP_HOME:-./}\" > /dev/null && pwd -P ) || exit\n\n# Use the maximum available, or set MAX_FD != -1 to use that value.\nMAX_FD=maximum\n\nwarn () {\n    echo \"$*\"\n} >&2\n\ndie () {\n    echo\n    echo \"$*\"\n    echo\n    exit 1\n} >&2\n\n# OS specific support (must be 'true' or 'false').\ncygwin=false\nmsys=false\ndarwin=false\nnonstop=false\ncase \"$( uname )\" in                #(\n  CYGWIN* )         cygwin=true  ;; #(\n  Darwin* )         darwin=true  ;; #(\n  MSYS* | MINGW* )  msys=true    ;; #(\n  NONSTOP* )        nonstop=true ;;\nesac\n\nCLASSPATH=$APP_HOME/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar\n\n\n# Determine the Java command to use to start the JVM.\nif [ -n \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n    if [ -x \"$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\" ] ; then\n        # IBM's JDK on AIX uses strange locations for the executables\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\n    else\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\n    fi\n    if [ ! -x \"$JAVACMD\" ] ; then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory: $JAVA_HOME\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nelse\n    JAVACMD=java\n    if ! command -v java >/dev/null 2>&1\n    then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# Increase the maximum file descriptors if we can.\nif ! \"$cygwin\" && ! \"$darwin\" && ! \"$nonstop\" ; then\n    case $MAX_FD in #(\n      max*)\n        # In POSIX sh, ulimit -H is undefined.
