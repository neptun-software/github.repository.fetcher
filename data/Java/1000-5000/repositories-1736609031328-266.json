          "content": "# We've moved!\n\nYou can now find the latest code, issues, and releases at [RipMeApp/ripme](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/).\n\n\n# Etiquette\n\nPlease be polite and supportive to all users and contributors. Please be inclusive of everyone regardless of race, religion, gender identity or expression, sexual preference, or tools and platform preferences. Please be helpful and stick to the engineering facts, and avoid expressing unhelpful or off-topic opinions.\n\n\n# NSFW Content\n\n**Please tag NSFW links (links to sites with adult content) with \"(NSFW)\"!**\n\nMany of the sites we deal with contain NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content. Please assume any link you see is NSFW unless tagged otherwise -- i.e., SFW (Safe For Work). Please tag all links you post with either \"(NSFW)\" or \"(SFW)\" to be considerate to others who may not be browsing this repo in private or who are not interested in NSFW content.\n\nThere is a helpful plugin called uMatrix available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/umatrix/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/umatrix/ogfcmafjalglgifnmanfmnieipoejdcf) which allows you to block certain types of content like media and scripts.\nIf you're not sure if a site might contain NSFW images or media, and you are in mixed company but want to develop a new ripper, you can block downloading images and media in the * (all sites) scope and allow requests for specific domains you trust as you go.\nBeing able to browse the HTML is usually the most important part of developing or fixing a ripper, so it is not necessarily important to actually see the images load.\n\n\n# Priorities\n\nOur priorities, roughly in order of impact:\n\n* Bug fixes for popular websites (e.g. that have recently changed their layout and broke our behavior).\n* Bug fixes for minor websites\n* New Rippers\n* Refactorings that make development easier\n* Style fixes\n\n\n# Issues\n\n## Bugs\n\nIf you have noticed a bug in RipMe, please open an issue at [RipMeApp/ripme](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/issues/new).\n\nPlease include enough information that we can easily confirm the problem and verify when it is fixed. (For example: the exact URL that you tried to rip when something bad/incorrect happened.)\n\n\n## Rippers / Website Support\n\nRequest support for more sites by adding a comment to [this Github issue](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/issues/2068).\n\nIf you're a developer, you can add your own Ripper by following the wiki guide\n[How To Create A Ripper for HTML Websites](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/How-To-Create-A-Ripper-for-HTML-websites).\n\n\n# Pull Requests\n\nBefore you open your pull request, please consider the following:\n\n* Please ensure your change is based on the `master` branch of this repo (i.e. https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme.git)\n  * Please do `git pull` on the `master` branch before starting work on your bug fix.\n  * This helps avoid merge conflicts.\n* Please ensure your change includes only the minimum changes needed to fix a single issue. These are easiest to review and tend to get merged more quickly. If the scope of your PR is wider than a single issue, you may be asked to reopen your PR as multiple separate PRs.\n* Are you fixing an issue from one of the issue trackers ([RipMeApp](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/issues) or ([RipMeApp2](https://github.com/RipMeApp2/ripme/issues) or [4pr0n](https://github.com/4pr0n/ripme/issues))? If so, please ensure that you reference the issue you are fixing in your commit message so that it will be [automatically closed](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/).\n* Please ensure you verify that you did not break any functionality outside of your change or feature\n  * The CI might be broken, so please ensure that `mvn test` shows no new errors since before your change.\n  * Keep in mind each Ripper likely supports multiple URL formats for each website, which have different content layouts (users, galleries, etc.)\n  * We deal with live websites, so things might break while we aren't looking. Websites can change and content can be deleted at any time. Our code and/or tests may need to be rewritten to fix issues.\n* Please consider adding a test to check for regressions to the Ripper you added or the bug you fixed.\n  * See e.g. `src/test/java/com/rarchives/ripme/tst/ripper/rippers/ImgurRipperTest.java`\n\n\n## Style\n\nGenerally, we will regard style changes as low-priority. Please consider that the contributors don't have a lot of volunteer time to work on this project, so style changes which do not improve the functionality of the project may be ignored in favor of critical bug fixes, new features, or other tangible improvements. Additionally, changes which are difficult to review may be ignored.\n\nIf you make a large or complex change, please detail what changes you made, and how they are helpful or what they fix.\n\nIf you feel the need to make a style change: changes to spacing and so on are easy to review regardless of the number of lines changed if ONLY whitespace changes are present. (`git diff -w` is helpful here.) If you change spacing and layout, please avoid also moving things around or otherwise refactoring the code. **Submit refactoring changes separately from style changes.**\n\nGood style is a tool for communicating your intent with other developers of the project. We are interested in maintaining reasonably well-styled code. If a contribution is illegible, we may refuse to merge it until it has been brought up to reasonable style guidelines. If a contribution violates any of our \"rules\" but is still legible, it is likely to be merged anyway.\n\nSome recommendations:\n\n* Above all, be consistent!\n* Spaces, not tabs. Indents should be 4 spaces.\n* We prefer \"Egyptian brackets\" (in `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, etc.):\n  * `if (...) {`\n  * `} else if (...) {`\n  * `} else {`\n  * `}`\n* Note the spacing convention above for control flow constructs (a single space on the outside of each paren)\n* Constants in `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` a.k.a. `CONST_CASE`\n* Class names in `PascalCase` a.k.a. `UpperCamelCase`\n* Variable names in `camelCase` a.k.a. `lowerCamelCase`\n* Do not use Hungarian notation\n* Do not use `lower_snake_case`\n* Place spaces around binary operators: `1 + 2` not `1+2`\n* Do not place spaces inside of parens: `(a + b)` not `( a + b )`\n* Use a function like VS Code's \"Organize Imports\" to ensure imports are committed to the repo in a consistent order no matter who writes the code.\n"

It is a cross-platform tool that runs on your computer, and\nrequires Java 21 or later to run. RipMe has been tested and is confirmed working on Windows, Linux, and MacOS.\n\n![Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/UCQNjeg.png)\n\n## Downloads\n\nDownload `ripme.jar` from the [latest release](https://github.com/ripmeapp2/ripme/releases). For information about running the `.jar` file, see\n[the How To Run wiki](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/How-To-Run-RipMe).\n\nThe version number like `ripme-1.7.94-17-2167aa34-feature_auto_release.jar` contains a release number (`1.7.94`), given by\na person, the number of commits since this version (`17`). The commit SHA (`2167aa34`) uniquely references the\nsource code ripme was built from. If it is not built from the main branch, the branch name (`feature/auto-release`) is\ngiven.\n\nNote that this follows the Semantic Versioning spec (see https://semver.org/),\nand uses the feature of the format that adds extra data after the `-` to\nprovide helpful context so that every commit on every branch has a dintinct\nsemver version associated with it.\n\n## Installation\n\nOn macOS, there is a [cask](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/ripme.rb).\n\n```\nbrew install --cask ripme && xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ripme.jar\n```\n\n## Changelog\n\n[Changelog](/ripme.json) **(ripme.json)**\n\n# Features\n\n- Quickly downloads all images in an online album. [See supported sites](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/Supported-Sites)\n- Easily re-rip albums to fetch new content\n- Built in updater\n- Skips already downloaded images by default\n- Can auto skip e-hentai and nhentai albums containing certain tags. [See here for how to enable](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/wiki/Config-options#nhentaiblacklisttags)\n- Download a range of urls. [See here for how](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/wiki/How-To-Run-RipMe#downloading-a-url-range)\n\n## List of Supported Sites\n\nSee the full list of [Supported Sites](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/Supported-Sites) in the wiki.\n\nNote: Websites change over time and therefore rippers, which fundamentally depend on website layouts, can break at any time.\nFeel free to open an issue if you notice something not working, but please search the list of issues to see if it's already been reported.\n\nThe list of supported rippers includes:\n\n- imgur\n- twitter (currently broken, needs to be updated for X)\n- tumblr\n- instagram\n- flickr\n- photobucket\n- reddit\n- redgifs\n- motherless\n- imagefap\n- seenive\n- 8muses\n- deviantart (currently broken by major changes to the site)\n- xhamster\n- xvideos\n- ... and [more](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/Supported-Sites)!\n\n## Site Not Supported?\n\nRequest support for more sites by adding a comment to [this Github issue](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/issues/2068).\n\nIf you're a developer, you can add your own Ripper by following the wiki guide:\n[How To Create A Ripper for HTML Websites](https://github.com/ripmeapp/ripme/wiki/How-To-Create-A-Ripper-for-HTML-websites).\n\n# Compiling & Building\n\nThe project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org). To build the .jar file,\nnavigate to the root project directory and run at least the test you\nchange, e.g. Xhamster. test execution can also excluded completely:\n\n```bash\n./gradlew clean build testAll --tests XhamsterRipperTest.testXhamster2Album\n./gradlew clean build -x test --warning-mode all\n```\n\nThe generated JAR (java archive) in build/libs will include all\ndependencies.\n\n# Running Tests\n\nTests can be tagged as beeing slow, or flaky. The gradle build reacts to\nthe following combinations of tags:\n\n- default is to run all tests without tag.\n- testAll runs all tests.\n- testFlaky runs tests with tag \"flaky\".\n- testSlow runs tests with tag \"slow\".\n- tests can be run by test class, or single test. Use \"testAll\" so it does\n  not matter if a test is tagged or not.\n- tests can give the full stack of an assertion, exception, or error if you pass `--info` to the command\n\n```bash\n./gradlew test\n./gradlew testAll\n./gradlew testFlaky\n./gradlew testSlow\n./gradlew testAll --tests XhamsterRipperTest\n./gradlew testAll --tests XhamsterRipperTest.testXhamster2Album\n./gradlew testAll --tests ChanRipperTest --info\n```\n\nPlease note that some tests may fail as sites change and our rippers\nbecome out of date. Start by building and testing a released version\nof RipMe and then ensure that any changes you make do not cause more\ntests to break.\n\n# Maintainers: How to Publish a New Release\n\nSee wiki: [How to Make a New Ripme Release](https://github.com/RipMeApp/ripme/wiki/How-to-make-a-new-ripme-release)\n"

If your /bin/sh is\n#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or\n#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole\n#       command line, like:\n#\n#           ksh Gradle\n#\n#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script\n#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:\n#         * functions;\n#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,\n#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;\n#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;\n#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».\n#\n#   Important for patching:\n#\n#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided\n#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.\n#\n#       The \"traditional\" practice of packing multiple parameters into a\n#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security\n#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating\n#       options in \"$@\", and eventually passing that to Java.\n#\n#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,\n#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;\n#       see the in-line comments for details.\n#\n#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,\n#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.\n#\n#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template\n#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/platforms/jvm/plugins-application/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt\n#       within the Gradle project.\n#\n#       You can find Gradle at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/.\n#\n##############################################################################\n\n# Attempt to set APP_HOME\n\n# Resolve links: $0 may be a link\napp_path=$0\n\n# Need this for daisy-chained symlinks.\nwhile\n    APP_HOME=${app_path%\"${app_path##*/}\"}  # leaves a trailing /; empty if no leading path\n    [ -h \"$app_path\" ]\ndo\n    ls=$( ls -ld \"$app_path\" )\n    link=${ls#*' -> '}\n    case $link in             #(\n      /*)   app_path=$link ;; #(\n      *)    app_path=$APP_HOME$link ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n# This is normally unused\n# shellcheck disable=SC2034\nAPP_BASE_NAME=${0##*/}\n# Discard cd standard output in case $CDPATH is set (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25036)\nAPP_HOME=$( cd -P \"${APP_HOME:-./}\" > /dev/null && printf '%s\n' \"$PWD\" ) || exit\n\n# Use the maximum available, or set MAX_FD != -1 to use that value.\nMAX_FD=maximum\n\nwarn () {\n    echo \"$*\"\n} >&2\n\ndie () {\n    echo\n    echo \"$*\"\n    echo\n    exit 1\n} >&2\n\n# OS specific support (must be 'true' or 'false').\ncygwin=false\nmsys=false\ndarwin=false\nnonstop=false\ncase \"$( uname )\" in                #(\n  CYGWIN* )         cygwin=true  ;; #(\n  Darwin* )         darwin=true  ;; #(\n  MSYS* | MINGW* )  msys=true    ;; #(\n  NONSTOP* )        nonstop=true ;;\nesac\n\nCLASSPATH=$APP_HOME/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar\n\n\n# Determine the Java command to use to start the JVM.\nif [ -n \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n    if [ -x \"$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\" ] ; then\n        # IBM's JDK on AIX uses strange locations for the executables\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\n    else\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\n    fi\n    if [ ! -x \"$JAVACMD\" ] ; then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory: $JAVA_HOME\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nelse\n    JAVACMD=java\n    if ! command -v java >/dev/null 2>&1\n    then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# Increase the maximum file descriptors if we can.\nif ! \"$cygwin\" && ! \"$darwin\" && ! \"$nonstop\" ; then\n    case $MAX_FD in #(\n      max*)\n        # In POSIX sh, ulimit -H is undefined.
