          "content": "                  Last Updated: 5 August 2020\n\nThis file outlines what it takes to build Autopsy from source.\n\nNote that it currently only works out-of-the-box on Windows.  We\nare working on getting the process working under non-Windows systems.\nIt generally works, but needs some custom mangling to find the\ncorrect C libraries.\n\n\nSTEPS:\n1) Get Java Setup\n\n1a) Download and install 64-bit JDK version 17.\n\nAutopsy has been used and tested with java 17 which can be downloaded from here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17.\n\n\n1b) Ensure that JDK_HOME is set to the root JDK directory.\n\n1c) (optional) Download and install Netbeans IDE (https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html)\nNote: Netbeans IDE is not required to build and run Autopsy,\nbut it is a recommended IDE to use for development of Autopsy modules.\n\n1d) (optional) If you are going to package Autopsy, then you'll also\nneed to set JRE_HOME_32 to the root 32-bit JRE directory and/or JRE_HOME_64\nto the root 64-bit JRE directory. \n\n1e) (optional) For some Autopsy features to be functional, you need to add the \n    java executable to the system PATH.\n\n\n2) Get Sleuth Kit Setup\n2a) Download and build a Release version of Sleuth Kit (TSK) 4.0. See\n    win32\\BUILDING.txt in the TSK package for more information. You need to \n    build the tsk_jni project. Select the Release Win32 or x64 target,\n    depending upon your target build. You can use a released version or download \n    the latest from github:\n- git://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit.git\n\n2b) Build the TSK JAR file by typing 'ant dist' in\n    bindings/java in the\n    TSK source code folder from a command line. Note it is case\n    sensitive. You can also add the code to a NetBeans project and build\n    it from there, selecting the dist target.\n\n2c) Set TSK_HOME environment variable to the root directory of TSK\n\n2d) On Non-Windows systems, you will need to do a 'make install'\nfrom the TSK root directory to install the libraries and such in\nthe needed places (i.e. '/usr/local').\n\n2e) Build the TSK CaseUco jar file by running 'ant' in\n    the case-uco/java folder of the TSK source folder. You can also add the\n    code to a NetBeans project and build using the regular 'build' action.\n\n3) For Windows builds, GStreamer must be setup. GStreamer is used to view video\nfiles. You can either download it and install it, or you can copy it from the\n'thirdparty/gstreamer' folder. Both 32-bit (x86) and 64-bit (x86_64) versions\nare included, so feel free to exclude what you want. You will need to unzip the\n'lib/gstreamer-1.0/libgstlibav.zip' file into it's residing\nfolder. You will also need the 'bin' and 'lib/gstreamer-1.0' paths included in\nyour Windows PATH environment variable.\n\nNOTE: This has not been fully tested in non-Windows environments\nyet, so we don't have instructions for that yet.\n\n\n4) Get Autopsy source.\n4a) If you are not planning to contribute to Autopsy development, clone a read-only repository:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy.git\n\n4b) If you plan to contribute and submit patches, login to Github and create your own Autopsy fork.\nThen, clone your fork and work on that source-tree:\n\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/autopsy.git\n\nYou will be able to submit patches by committing and pushing changes to your fork \nand by submitting pull requests to the main Autopsy repository.\n\n5) Compile Autopsy\n5a) Using Netbeans IDE:\n- Start NetBeans IDE and open the Autopsy project.\n- Choose to build the Autopsy project / module. It is the highest level project\n    that will cause the other modules to be compiled.\n\n5b) Without Netbeans IDE (requires JDK and ant >= 1.7.1):\n- From root directory of Autopsy source execute:\nant\n(to build Autopsy)\nant run\n(to run Autopsy)\n\n\nBACKGROUND:\nHere are some notes to shed some light on what is going on during\nthe build process.\n\n- The Sleuth Kit Java datamodel JAR file has native JNI libraries\nthat are copied into it. These JNI libraries have dependencies on\nlibewf, zlib, libintl-8, libeay32, and ssleay32 DLL files. On non-Windows \nplatforms, the JNI library also has a dependency on libtsk (on Windows, \nit is compiled into libtsk_jni).\n\n- NetBeans uses ant to build Autopsy. The build target copies the\nTSK datamodel JAR file into the project.\n\n- On a Windows system, the compile-time ant target copies the \ndependency libraries into the Autopsy code structure so that they can\nbe found when Autopsy is run and packaged.  At run-time, the native\nlibrary inside of the JAR file will be extracted and used. \n\n- On a Unix system, the ant target copies only the JNI library and\nthen relies on the other libraries (libtsk, libewf, zilb, etc.) to\nbe installed on the system in their standard locations (i.e.\n/usr/local).\n\n- Every time that you do a source code update of TSK, make sure you\nrebuild both the libtsk_dll, the JAR file, and then rebuild Autopsy \nso that it copies the latest data model JAR file. \n\n\n---------------\nBrian Carrier\ncarrier <at> sleuthkit <dot> org\n"

          "content": "# Overview\r\nFor Linux systems that [support snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd), there is currently the option to install Autopsy from the [snap package](#install-autopsy-snap).  Otherwise, when installing on Debian-based Linux or macOS systems, there are three general steps: [installing prerequisites](#installing-prerequisites), [installing The Sleuth Kit](#installing-the-sleuth-kit), and [installing Autopsy](#installing-autopsy) itself.  On macOS, you will want to [setup the JNA paths](#setup-macos-jna-paths).\r\n\r\n# Install Autopsy Snap\r\nYou can download the snap package from the [releases section](https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy/releases).  In order for Autopsy to run properly, snap connections will need to be properly setup, which can be done by running this script: `snap connections autopsy | sed -nE 's/^[^ ]* *([^ ]*) *- *- *$/\\1/p' | xargs -I{} sudo snap connect {}`.  See the [snap README](./snap/README.md) for more information.\r\n\r\n# Installing Prerequisites\r\n- **Linux**: Run [`linux_macos_install_scripts/install_prereqs_ubuntu.sh`](./linux_macos_install_scripts/install_prereqs_ubuntu.sh).\r\n- **macOS**: Run [`linux_macos_install_scripts/install_prereqs_macos.sh`](./linux_macos_install_scripts/install_prereqs_macos.sh).  This script requires the package manager: [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which has installation steps on their site.\r\n\r\n*NOTE: The last output of the script is the path to the Java 17 installation.  You will want to note that path when installing Autopsy.*\r\n\r\n# Installing The Sleuth Kit\r\n- **Linux**: Download the .deb file for the release you want to install from the [release section](https://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit/releases).  Install The Sleuth Kit package from the repositories with the following command: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install /path/to/sleuthkit-version.deb`.\r\n- **macOS**: Ensure that for this session, your `JAVA_HOME` variable is set to the java 17 installation by running `export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)`.  Then, install The Sleuth Kit from source by running [`linux_macos_install_scripts/install_tsk_from_src.sh`](./linux_macos_install_scripts/install_tsk_from_src.sh), which will download, build, and install The Sleuth Kit.  It can be run as follows: `install_tsk_from_src.sh -p ~/src/sleuthkit -b sleuthkit-4.11.1`.  Make sure that your path to download source ends with \"sleuthkit\" as the last directory, and the release is the corresponding tag in the [repository](https://github.com/sleuthkit/sleuthkit).\r\n\r\n# Installing Autopsy\r\n- Download the Autopsy zip file from [repository releases](https://github.com/sleuthkit/autopsy/releases).  The file will be marked as \"autopsy-&lt;release&gt;.zip\" (i.e. \"autopsy-4.19.2.zip\").\r\n- Run [`install_application.sh`](./linux_macos_install_scripts/install_application.sh) with the following parameters: `install_application.sh [-z zip_path] [-i install_directory] [-j java_home]`.  An example would be `install_application.sh -z ~/Downloads/autopsy-4.19.2.zip -i ~/autopsy -j /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.17.0-openjdk-amd64`.  The path to the Java 17 home is the last output from the [prequisites installation scripts](#installing-prerequisites), but typically, the path will be in the result of running  `update-java-alternatives -l | grep java-1.17` on Debian-based Linux or the output of running `/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17` on macOS.\r\n\r\n# Setup macOS JNA paths\r\nIf you are on macOS, run [linux_macos_install_scripts/add_macos_jna.sh](./linux_macos_install_scripts/add_macos_jna.sh) to properly setup the jna path to get things like gstreamer working.  An example would be `add_macos_jna.sh -i ~/autopsy`.\r\n\r\n# Troubleshooting\r\n- If you see something like \"Cannot create case: javafx/scene/paint/Color\" it is an indication that Java FX\r\n  is not being found.  Confirm that the file `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext/jfxrt.jar` exists. If it does not exist, return to the Java\r\n  setup steps above.\r\n- If you see something like \"An illegal reflective access operation has occurred\" it is an indication that\r\n  the wrong version of Java is being used to run Autopsy.\r\n  Check the version of Java reported in the `messages.log` file in the log directory.  The log directory can be found by opening Autopsy, and, with no cases open, go to 'Help' > 'Open Log Folder'. `messages.log` should contain lines that looks like:\r\n  ```\r\n  Java; VM; Vendor        = 17.0.7; OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 17.0.7+7-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04.2; Private Build\r\n  Runtime                 = OpenJDK Runtime Environment 17.0.7+7-Ubuntu-0ubuntu122.04.2\r\n  Java Home               = /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-amd64\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  If your `messages.log` file indicates that Java 17 is not being used:\r\n  - Confirm that you have a version of Java 17 installed\r\n  - Confirm that your java path environment variable is set correctly.  Autopsy first uses the value of `jdkhome` in `<autopsy_install_location>/etc/autopsy.conf`, so look for an uncommented line (not starting with '#') that looks like `jdkhome=<java path>`.  If that is not set, check your `$JAVA_HOME` environment variable by running `echo $JAVA_HOME`.\r\n- If you see something like \"cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.\" it is an indication that Gatekeeper is running and is stopping a file from being executed.  To fix this open a new terminal window and enter the following command `sudo spctl --master-disable`, you will be required to enter your password.  This will allow any program to be be downloaded from anywhere and executed.\r\n- On initial run, Autopsy shows a window that can appear behind the splash screen.  This looks like Autopsy has stalled during startup.  The easiest way to get around this issue for the first run is to run autopsy with the `--nosplash` flag, which will hide the splash screen on startup.  There will be a lag where no window appears for a bit, so please be patient.\r\n- If a script fails to run due to operation not permitted or something along those lines, you may need to run `chmod u+x <path to script>` from the command line to allow the script to run.\r\n- If you encounter an error like: `getcwd: cannot access parent directories: Operation not permitted` on Mac, you can do the following:\r\n  1. Select System Preferences -> Security & Privacy -> Full Disk Access\r\n  2. Click the lock to make changes\r\n  3. Click '+'\r\n  4. Press 'cmd' + 'shift' + '.' to show hidden files\r\n  5. Select `/bin/sh`\r\n  *Source: [Symscape](https://www.symscape.com/node/1727)*\r\n\r\n# Known Issues\r\n- Not all current features in Autopsy are functional in a Linux and Mac environment including but not limited to:\r\n  - Recent Activity\r\n  - The LEAPP processors\r\n  - HEIF processing\r\n  - Video thumbnails\r\n  - VHD and VMDK files not supported on OS X\r\n"
