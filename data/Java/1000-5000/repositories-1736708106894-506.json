Therefore it generally does not make sense to use other IDEs. Download the **Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP Developers** package.\n\nOptionally, install language packs for Eclipse:\n * `Menu` --> `Help` --> `Install New Software`\n * Use the following update site:\n   ```\n   https://download.eclipse.org/technology/babel/update-site/latest/\n   ```\n * Select the language packs you want to install\n * By default, Eclipse uses the host operating system language (locale).\n   To force the use of another language, use the **-nl** parameter:\n   ```\n   eclipse.exe -nl de\n   ```\n\n\n### Install Eclipse plug-ins\n\nOptionally, install via the Eclipse Marketplace (drag and drop the *Install* button to your Eclipse workspace)\n\n* [Eclipse PDE (Plug-in Development Environment)](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/eclipse-pde-plug-development-environment) (skip if you installed the *Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP Developers*)\n* [Infinitest](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/infinitest)\n* [ResourceBundle Editor](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/resourcebundle-editor)\n* [Checkstyle Plug-In](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/checkstyle-plug)\n* [SonarLint](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/sonarlint)\n* [Launch Configuration DSL](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/launch-configuration-dsl)\n* [Darkest Dark Theme with DevStyle](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/darkest-dark-theme-devstyle) (Programming and chilling in DarkMode :sunglasses:)\n\n\n#### Install from the simulatenous release update site\n\n`Menu` --> `Help` --> `Install New Software`\n\nPick `Latest Eclipse Simultaneous Release` from the dropdown menu.\n\n* M2E PDE Integration (skip if you installed the *Eclipse IDE for RCP and RAP Developers*)\n\t- Under `General Purpose Tools` select the `M2E PDE Integration`\n* Eclipse e4 Tools Developer Resources\n\t- Under `General Purpose Tools` select the `Eclipse e4 Tools Developer Resources`\n\n\n### Configure Eclipse\n\nConfigure the following preferences (`Menu` --> `Window` --> `Preferences`)\n\n* `Java` --> `Editor` --> `Save Actions`\n\t- Activate `Format Source Code` and then `Format edited lines`\n \t- Activate `Organize imports`\n* `Java` --> `Editor` --> `Content Assist`\n\t- Activate `Add import instead of qualified name`\n\t- Activate `Use static imports`\n* `Java` --> `Editor` --> `Content Assist` --> `Favorites`\n\t- Click on `New Type...` and add the following favorites\n\t\t- `name.abuchen.portfolio.util.TextUtil`\n\t\t- `name.abuchen.portfolio.datatransfer.ExtractorUtils`\n\t\t- `name.abuchen.portfolio.datatransfer.ExtractorMatchers`\n\t\t- `name.abuchen.portfolio.datatransfer.ExtractorTestUtilities`\n\t\t- `name.abuchen.portfolio.junit.TestUtilities`\n* `Java` --> `Installed JREs`\n\t- Add the Java 21 JDK\n\n\n## Project setup\n \nFor further disucssion, check out the thread in the [(German) Forum](https://forum.portfolio-performance.info/t/verbesserungen-im-source-code-in-github-einbringen/7063).\n\n\n### Source code\n\nTo contribute to Portfolio Performacne, you create a fork, clone the repository, make and push changes to your repository, and then create a pull request.\n\n* [Create your own fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)\n* Within Eclipse, [clone your repository](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html#exercise-clone-an-existing-repository). In the last step, choose to *import all existing Eclipse projects*.\n* Within Eclipse, [import projects from an existing repository](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGit/article.html#exercise-import-projects-from-an-existing-repository)\n\n\n### Setup Target Platform\n\n* Open the `portfolio-target-definition` project\n* Open the `portfolio-target-definition.target` file with the Target Editor (this may take a while as it requires Internet access). If you just get an XML file, use right click and chose Open With *Target Editor*\n* In the resulting editor, click on the \"Set as Active Target Platform\" link at the top right (this may also take a while)\n\n\n### Launch Portfolio Performance\n\nPP uses [Eclipse Launch Configuration DSL](https://github.com/mduft/lcdsl) to define Eclipse launch configurations in a OS independent way.\n\nFirst, add the *Launch Configuration* view to your workspace:\n* `Menu` --> `Window` --> `Show View` --> `Other...` --> `Debug` --> `Launch Configuration`\n\n**To run the application**, select `Eclipse Application` --> `PortfolioPerformance` and right-click *Run*.\n\n**To run the tests**, select under `JUnit Plug-in Tests` --> `PortfolioPerformance_Tests` or `PortfolioPerformance_UI_Tests`.\n\n\n### Build with Maven\n\nIt is not required to use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) as you can develop using the Eclipse IDE with the setup above. The Maven build is used for the [Github Actions](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/actions) build.\n\nThe Maven build works fine when `JAVA_HOME` points to an (Open-)JDK 21 installation.\n\nLinux/macOS\n```\nexport MAVEN_OPTS=\"-Xmx4g\"\nmvn -f portfolio-app/pom.xml clean verify\n```\n\n```\nset MAVEN_OPTS=\"-Xmx4g\"\nmvn -f portfolio-app\\pom.xml -Denforcer.skip=true clean verify\n```\n\nHint: if you run into resolution problems, try deleting the `~/.m2/repository/p2` directory. Apparently, when switching to Maven Tycho 3, there are some layout changes.\n\n\n## Contribute code\n\n* Write a [good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) in English\n* If the change is related to a Github issue, add a line `Closes #<ISSUE NUMBER>` after an empty line\n* If the change is related to an thread in the forum, add a line `Issue: https://...` with the link to the post in the forum\n* Format the source code. The formatter configuration is part of the project source code. Exception: Do *not* reformat the PDF importer source code. Instead, carefully insert new code into the existing formatting.\n* Add [test cases](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/tree/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests) where applicable. Today, there are no tests that test the SWT UI. But add tests for all calculations.\n* Do not merge the the master branch into your feature branch. Instead, [rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-rebase) your local changes to the head of the master branch.\n* [Create a Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) - for example using [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) using this [tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop)\n\n\n## Translations\n\nCurrently, Portfolio Performance is translated into 13 languages.\n\nTo contribute a new language or assist with translations:\n\n* Register with the [POEditor project](https://poeditor.com/join/project?hash=4lYKLpEWOY).\n* Open a [ticket](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/issues/new/choose) if you plan to a add a new language and need test builds.\n* Before we create a new release, we download and merge the updated translations into the code base.\n\nIf you are contributing code:\n\n- Use [Source -> Externalize Strings](https://help.eclipse.org/latest/topic/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/ref-wizard-externalize-strings.htm?cp=1_4_10_3) to externalize strings.\n- Utilize [ResourceBundle Editor](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/resourcebundle-editor) to edit and format resource files, as the update process from POEditor relies on the same format.\n- Translate new labels into all existing languages using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com).\n\n### Label descriptions\n\nFor naming externalized labels:\n\n- Use ```Label```, ```Msg```, ```Column``` as common prefixes for short labels, longer messages, and column headers respectively.\n- Use specific prefixes like ```PDF```, ```CSV```, ```Preferences```, etc. if the area is big and distinct enough, but avoid creating new areas.\n- Follow the label naming pattern used in the code area you are contributing to.\n\n\n## Images, Logo and color\n\nImages and logos used must be subject to [Creative Commons CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).\n\n* We only use icon from [iconmonstr.com](https://iconmonstr.com).\n* If a color change icon is used, the passive state is gray and the active state is orange.\n* Please add all used images, logos and icons in the [Images](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.ui/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/ui/Images.java) file.\n\n\n### Format and size\n\nImages, logos and icons are to be created as Portable Network Graphic ([PNG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics)) format.\n\n* The background must be transparent.\n* The basic format is 16x16px.\n* A designation is to be chosen as name. (e.g. information.png)\n* The file name must be written in lower case letters.\n* It must be created in at least two sizes. 16x16px and 32x32px.\n\nDesignation basic format as an example:\n\n* `information.png` (16x16px)\n* `information@2x.png` (32x32px)\n* ...\n\n\n### Color code and status\n\n| Color\t| Color code (hex)\t| Color code (RGB)\t| Used for\t|\n| :---------\t| :----------- \t| :----------- \t| :----------- \t|\n| orange (logo)\t| ![#f18f01](https://placehold.co/15x15/f18f01/f18f01.png) `#f18f01`\t| `rgb(241, 143, 1)`\t| Activated (ex: filter)\t|\n| blue (logo)\t| ![#0e6e8e](https://placehold.co/15x15/0e6e8e/0e6e8e.png) `#0e6e8e`\t| `rgb(14, 110, 142)`\t|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| green (logo)\t| ![#9ac155](https://placehold.co/15x15/9ac155/9ac155.png) `#9ac155`\t| `rgb(154, 193, 85)`\t|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| dark blue\t\t| ![#95a4b3](https://placehold.co/15x15/95a4b3/95a4b3.png) `#95a4b3`\t| `rgb(149, 164, 179)`\t| Default color for icons\t|\n| red\t\t\t| ![#d11d1d](https://placehold.co/15x15/d11d1d/d11d1d.png) `#d11d1d`\t| `rgb(209, 29, 29)`\t| Error, Fault\t\t\t\t|\n| yellow\t\t| ![#ffd817](https://placehold.co/15x15/ffd817/ffd817.png) `#ffd817`\t| `rgb(255, 216, 23)`\t| Warning\t\t\t\t\t|\n\n\n## Interactive-Flex-Query Importer\n\nAn XML-compliant document is a file that is structured and formatted according to the rules of the eXtensible Markup Language (XML). It consists of a set of tags and attributes that contain information about the structure and content of the document.\n\nA valid XML document must meet the following conditions:\n\n* It must have a root element that contains all other elements.\n* Each element must be properly closed.\n* Attributes must be defined within a start tag and their values must be specified within quotes.\n* All elements must be properly nested, i.e. they must contain each other and not overlap.\n* There must be no comments or processing instructions outside the root element.\n\n### Source location\n\nInteractive-Flex-Query importer: `name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/ibflex/`\n\nTest cases: `name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/ibflex/`\n\n\n### Imported transactions\n\nImported transactions are processed in the same way as the [PDF importer](#imported-transactions-1).\n\n\n### Naming conventions for detected elements\n\nThe importer extracts the following elements:\n\n* `type` --> The transaction type e.g. buy, sell, deposit, removal, dividends, taxes, fees\n* `buySell` --> The portfolio transaction type e.g. buy, sell.\n* `symbol` --> The symbol of the instrument traded.\n* `isin` --> International Securities Identification Number\n* `conid` --> The conid of the instrument traded. Same as the security code number (wkn).\n* `cusip` --> The CUSIP of the instrument traded. Same as the security code number (wkn).\n* `quantity` --> The number of units for the transaction.\n* `multiplier` --> The multiplier of the contract traded.\n* `proceeds` --> Calculated by multiplying the quantity and the transaction price. The proceeds figure will be negative for buys and positive for sales.\n* `reportDate` --> The date of the statement.\n* `tradeDate` --> The date of the execution.\n* `tradeTime` --> The time of the execution.\n* `dateTime` --> The date and time of the statement.\n* `netCash` --> Net cash is calculated by adding the proceeds plus tax plus commissions. (buy and sell)\n* `amount` --> Amount for account transactions\n* `currency` --> Currency of the total amount.\n* `fxRateToBase` --> The conversion rate from asset currency to base currency.\n* `description` --> The description of the instrument traded.\n* `taxes` --> The total amount of tax for the transaction.\n* `ibCommission` --> The total amount of commission for the transaction.\n* `ibCommissionCurrency` --> The currency denomination of the trade.\n* `accountId` --> Account identification\n* `assetCategory` --> e.g. Stock, Options, Futures\n* `tradeID` --> The ID of the trade.\n* `transactionID` --> The ID of the transaction.\n* `accountId` --> The account number.\n\nAll available elements can be found at [ibkrguides.com](https://ibkrguides.com/reportingreference/reportguide/tradesfq.htm).\n\n### Test cases\n\nThe test file is an XML file. People anonymize their personal information and account numbers using alternate text or number strings.\n\n* The test files should not be modified beyond the anonymization\n* Follow the naming convention for test files (type in the local language, two digit counter):\n\t* `testIBFlexStatementFile01.xml`\n* Samples\n\t*  Transaction in XML-File: [IBFlexStatementExtractorTest](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/ibflex/IBFlexStatementExtractorTest.java) - see `testIBFlexStatementFile01()`\n\n\n## PDF importer\n\nImporters are created for each supported bank and/or broker. The process works like this:\n* The users selects one or more PDF files via the import menu (or drags and drops multiple PDF files to the sidebar navigation)\n* Each PDF file are converted to an array of strings; one entry per line\n* Each importer is presented with the strings and applies the regular expressions to extract transactions\n\nIf you want to add an importer for a new bank or a new transaction type, check out the existing importers for naming conventions, structure, formatting, etc.\n\n\n### Debug information\n\nThere is a quick way to generate the required debug information from a pdf file:\n\n`File` => `Import` => `Debug: Create text from PDF...`\n\nMake sure to remove all personal data.\nHowever, make also sure that you do not insert any new lines, line breaks, spaces or similar.\n\n### Source location\n\nPDF importer: `name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/`\n\nTest cases: `name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/`\n\nThe naming convention is BANK**Extractor** and BANK**ExtractorTest** for extractor class and test class respectively.\n\n\n### Imported transactions\n\nPortfolio Performance separates between [PortfolioTransaction](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/model/PortfolioTransaction.java) (booked on a securities account) and [AccountTransaction](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/model/AccountTransaction.java) (booked on a cash account). The available types are defined as enum within the file, for example for purchase (BUY) and sale (SELL) of securities, etc.\n\n\n### Anatomy of a PDF importer\n\nThe structure of the PDF importers is as follows:\n\n* Client\n\t* `addBankIdentifier` --> Unique recognition feature of the PDF document\n* Bank name\n  \t* `getLabel` --> display label of bank/broker, e.g. *Deutsche Bank Privat- und Geschäftskunden AG*\n* Transaction types (basic types)\n\t* `addBuySellTransaction` --> Purchase and sale (single settlement)\n\t* `addSummaryStatementBuySellTransaction`  --> Purchase and sale (multiple settlements)\n\t* `addBuyTransactionFundsSavingsPlan` --> Savings plans\n\t* `addDividendeTransaction` --> Dividends\n\t* `addTaxTreatmentForDividendeTransaction` --> Tax treatment for dividends\n\t* `addAdvanceTaxTransaction` --> Advance tax payment\n  \t* `addCreditcardStatementTransaction` --> Credit card transactions\n  \t* `addAccountStatementTransaction` --> Giro account transactions\n  \t* `addDepotStatementTransaction` --> Securities account transactions (settlement account)\n  \t* `addTaxStatementTransaction` --> Tax settlement\n  \t* `addDeliveryInOutBoundTransaction` --> Inbound and outbound deliveries\n  \t* `addTransferInOutBoundTransaction` --> Transfer in and outbound deliveries\n  \t* `addReinvestTransaction` --> Reinvestment transaction\n  \t* `addTaxReturnBlock` --> Tax refund\n  \t* `addFeeReturnBlock` --> Fee refund\n* Taxes and fees\n  \t* `addTaxesSectionsTransaction` --> handling of taxes\n  \t* `addFeesSectionsTransaction` --> handling of fees\n* Overwrite the value extractor methods if the documents work with non-standard (English, German) locales:\n\t* Example: [Bank SLM](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/BankSLMPDFExtractor.java) (de_CH)\n\t* Example:  [Baader Bank AG](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/BaaderBankPDFExtractor.java) (de_DE + en_US)\n* Add post processing on imported transaction using a `postProcessing` method:\n\t* Example: [ComDirect](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/ComdirectPDFExtractor.java)\n\n\n### Naming conventions for detected values\n\nThe importers are structured according to the following scheme and the mapping variables are to be adhered to as far as possible:\n\n* Type (Optional)\n  * `type` --> Exchange of the transaction pair (e.g. from purchase to sale)\n* Security identification\n  * `name` --> Security name\n  * `isin` --> International Securities Identification Number\n  * `wkn` --> Security code number\n  * `tickerSymbol` --> Tickersymbol\n  * `currency` --> Security currency\n* Shares of the transaction\n  * `shares` --> Shares\n* Date and time\n  * `date` --> Date\n  * `time` --> Time (optional)\n* Total amount (with fees and taxes)\n  * `amount` --> Amount e.g. 123,15\n  * `currency` --> Currency of the total amount\n* Foreign currency\n  * `gross` --> Total amount in transaction currency without fees and taxes\n  * `currency` --> Currency of the total amount\n  * `fxGross` --> Total amount in foreign currency without fees and taxes\n  * `fxCurrency` --> Currency of the total amount in foreign currency\n* Exchange rate\n  * `exchangeRate` --> Foreign currency exchange rate\n  * `baseCurrency` --> Base currency\n  * `termCurrency` --> Foreign currency\n* Notes (Optional)\n  * `note` --> Notes e.g. quarterly dividend, limits, transaction number\n* Tax section\n   * `tax` --> Amount\n   * `currency` --> Currency\n   * `withHoldingTax` --> Withholding tax\n   * `creditableWithHoldingTax` --> Creditable withholding tax\n* Fee section\n   * `fee` --> Amount\n   * `currency` --> Currency\n\nA finished PDF importer as a basis would be e.g. the [V-Bank AG](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/VBankAGPDFExtractor.java) PDF importer.\n\n\n### Auxiliary classes\n\nThe utility class about standardized conversions, is called by the [AbstractPDFExtractor](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/AbstractPDFExtractor.java)\nand processed in the [ExtractorUtils](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/ExtractorUtils.java).\nThe [ExtrExchangeRate](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/ExtrExchangeRate.java) helps processing for foreign currencies.\n\nUse the [Money](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/money/Money.java) class when working with amounts (it includes the currency and the value rounded to cents). Use *BigDecimal* for exchange rates and the conversion between currencies.\n\nUse [TextUtil](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/TextUtil.java) class for some string manipulation such as trimming strings and stripping whitespace characters. The text created from PDF files has some corner cases that are not supported by the usual Java methods.\n\n\n### Formatting of PDF importer\n\nDue to the many comments with text fragments from the PDF documents, we do not auto-format the PDF importer class files. Instead, carefully insert new code into the existing formatting manually. To protect formatting from automatic formatting, use the `@formatter:off` and `@formatter:on`.\n\nPlease take a look at the formatting and structure in the other PDF importers!

The test file is the extracted text from the PDF documents. Users then anonymize the text by replacing personal idenfiable information and account numbers with alternative text.\n\n* The test files should not be modified beyond the anonymization\n* All source code (including the test files) are stored in UTF-8 encoding\n* Follow the naming convention for test files (type in the local language, two digit counter):\n\t* `Buy01.txt, Sell01.txt` --> Purchase and sale (single settlements) (e.g. SecurityBuy01.txt or SecuritySale01.txt)\n\t* `Dividend01.txt` --> Dividends (single statements)\n\t* `SteuermitteilungDividende01.txt` --> Tax settlement for dividends (single settlement)\n\t* `SammelabrechnungKaufVerkauf01.txt` --> Purchase and sale (multiple settlements)\n\t* `Wertpapiereingang01.txt` --> Incoming securities\n\t* `Wertpapierausgang01.txt` --> Outgoing securities\n\t* `Vorabpauschale01.txt` --> Advance taxes\n\t* `GiroKontoauzug01.txt` --> Giro account statement\n\t* `KreditKontoauszug01.txt` --> Credit card account statement\n\t* `Depotauszug01.txt` --> security account transaction history (settlement account)\n* Samples\n\t* From April 2023 we will use the simplified notation of test cases (preferred variant)\n\t   * [Baader Bank](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/baaderbank/BaaderBankPDFExtractorTest.java) with `testWertpapierKauf23()`\n\t   * [Sbroker](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/sbroker/SBrokerPDFExtractorTest.java) with `testDividende11()`\n\t   * [Sbroker](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/sbroker/SBrokerPDFExtractorTest.java) with `testGiroKontoauszug10()`\n\t*  one transaction per PDF (old version): [Erste Bank Gruppe](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/erstebank/erstebankPDFExtractorTest.java) - see `testWertpapierKauf06()` and `testDividende05()`\n\t* supporting securities with multiple currencies: [Erste Bank Gruppe](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/erstebank/erstebankPDFExtractorTest.java) with `testWertpapierKauf09()` / `testWertpapierKauf09WithSecurityInEUR()` and `testDividende10()`/`testDividende10WithSecurityInEUR()`\n\t\t* Background: in the PP model, the currency of the transaction always must match the currency of the security and its historical prices. However, sometimes securities are purchased on an different exchange with prices in an another currency. The importer try to handle this case automatically. This is reflected in the two test cases\n\t* multiple transactions per PDF: [DKB AG](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/dkb/DkbPDFExtractorTest.java) with `testGiroKontoauszug01()`\n\t* if transactions are created based on two separate PDF files, use post processing: [Targobank](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/datatransfer/pdf/targobank/TargobankPDFExtractorTest.java) with:\n\t\t* `testDividende01()` (single import)\n\t\t* `testDividende01WithSecurityInEUR()` (single import)\n\t\t* `testTaxTreatmentForDividende01()` (single import)\n\t\t* `testDividendeWithTaxTreatmentForDividende01()` (simultaneously import)\n\t\t* `testDividendeWithTaxTreatmentForDividende01WithSecurityInEUR()` (simultaneously import)\n\t\t* `testDividendeWithTaxTreatmentForDividende01WithSecurityInUSD()` (simultaneously import)\n\t\t* `testDividendeWithTaxTreatmentReversedForDividende01WithSecurityInEUR()` (simultaneously import)\n\t\t* `testDividendeWithTaxTreatmentReversedForDividende01WithSecurityInUSD()` (simultaneously import)\n\n### Regular expressions\n\nTo test regular expression you can use [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/).\n\nBeside general good practices for regular expresions, keep in mind:\n* all special characters in the PDF document (`äöüÄÖÜß` as well as e.g. circumflex or similar) should be matched by a `.` (dot) because the PDF to text conversion can create different results \n* the special characters `$^{[(|)]}*+?\\` in the PDF document are to be escaped\n* expression in `.match(\" ... \")` is started with an anchor `^` and ended with `$`\n* with `.find(\" ... \")` do not add anchors as they will be automatically added\n\nKeep in mind that the regular expressions work against text that is automatically created from PDF files. Due to the nature of the process, there can always be slight differences in the text files. The following table collects the regular expressions that **worked well** to match typical values.\n\n| Value\t| Example\t| Not Helpful\t| Works Well\t|\n| :-----------\t| :-----------\t| :------------\t| :-----------\t|\n| Date\t\t\t| 01.01.1970\t| `\\\\d+.\\\\d+.\\\\d{4}`\t| `[\\\\d]{2}\\\\.[\\\\d]{2}\\\\.[\\\\d]{4}`\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t| 1.1.1970\t\t| `\\\\d+.\\\\d+.\\\\d{4}`\t| `[\\\\d]{1,2}\\\\.[\\\\d]{1,2}\\\\.[\\\\d]{4}`\t|\n| Time\t\t\t| 12:01\t\t\t| `\\\\d+:\\\\d+`\t\t\t| `[\\\\d]{2}\\\\:[\\\\d]{2}}`\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| ISIN\t\t\t| IE00BKM4GZ66\t| `\\\\w+`\t\t\t\t\t| `[A-Z]{2}[A-Z0-9]{9}[0-9]`\t\t\t\t\t|\n| WKN\t\t\t| A111X9\t\t| `\\\\w+`\t\t\t\t\t| `[A-Z0-9]{6}`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Valoren\t\t| 1098758\t\t| `\\\\w+`\t\t\t\t\t| `[A-Z0-9]{5,9}`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| SEDOL\t\t\t| B5B74S0\t\t| `\\\\w+`\t\t\t\t\t| `[A-Z0-9]{7}`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| CUSIP\t\t\t| 11135F101\t\t| `\\\\w+`\t\t\t\t\t| `[A-Z0-9]{9}`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Amount\t\t| 751,68\t\t| `[\\\\d,.]+`\t\t\t\t| `[\\\\.,\\\\d]+`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t|\t\t\t\t|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| `[\\\\.\\\\d]+,[\\\\d]{2}`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t| 74'120.00\t\t| `[\\\\d.']+`\t\t\t\t| `[\\\\.'\\\\d]+`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t| 20 120.00\t\t| `[\\\\d.\\\\s]+`\t\t\t| `[\\\\.\\\\d\\\\s]+`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Currency      | EUR\t\t\t| `\\\\w+`\t\t\t\t\t| `[A-Z]{3}`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n|\t\t\t\t|\t\t\t\t|\t\t\t\t\t\t\t| `[\\\\w]{3}`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n| Currency      | € or $\t\t| `\\\\D`\t\t\t\t\t| `\\\\p{Sc}`\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t|\n\n\n## Trade calendar\n\nUsing the application menu, the user can select a trading calendar accordingly globally or for each individual security.\nThe calendar takes into account the weekends and regional holidays when there is no stock exchange trading.\nThe trading-free days of the stock exchange itself, if it is a stock exchange calendar, are also taken into account.\nThe individual trading-free days are stored in a HashMap and made available for further processing, e.g. reporting period, performance index and so on.\n\n\n### Source location\n\nTrade calendar Manager: `name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/TradeCalendarManager.java`\n\nTrade calendar Class: `name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/TradeCalendar.java`\n\nHoliday types: `name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/HolidayType.java`\n\nHoliday class: `name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/Holiday.java`\n\nHoliday name: `name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/HolidayName.java`\n\nTests: `name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/TradeCalendarTest.java`\n\n\n### Anatomy of a trade calendar\n\nThe structure of the trade calendars is as follows:\n\n* Identification\n\t* `code` --> Identification nyse --> New York Stock Exchange\n* Label\n\t* `description` --> Display label of trade calendar, e.g., *New York Stock Exchange*\n* Days of weekend\n\t* `weekend` --> Sets the default days for the weekend in the Trade Calendar, e.g., *Saturday and Sunday*\n\nThe [HolidayTypes](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/HolidayType.java) helps to edit holidays and in the [HolidayName](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/HolidayName.java) there are all holidays or trade-free days.\n\n\n### Test cases\n\nThe test cases are checking individual dates that have been stored in TradeCalendarManager.\nIn these cases we check whether the date to be checked is a trading day for this calendar or not.\nWe assume that every day is a trade day. (Except e.g. regular weekends).\n\nThe structure of the test cases is as follows:\n\n* Starting from the first day of the year with at least three test checks each, e.g. 01.01.20xx, 01.01.20xy, 01.01.20xz until 31.12.20xy of the respective year.\n* The regular trading-free days are followed by the one-time trading-free days.\n* The respective trade-free day to the test is named in the comment.\n* Samples \n\t* Trade calendar: [New York Stock Exchange](https://github.com/portfolio-performance/portfolio/blob/master/name.abuchen.portfolio.tests/src/name/abuchen/portfolio/util/TradeCalendarTest.java) - see `testTradeCalenderNYSE()`\n"

A Contribution 'originates'\n   from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor\n   itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not\n   include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n   software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own\n   license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n     reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n     perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor,\n     if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n     Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n     Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\n     transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\n     object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of\n     the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is\n     added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such\n     combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license\n     shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution.\n     No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses\n     to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\n     Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\n     intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor\n     disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other\n     entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or\n     otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted\n     hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure\n     any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a\n     third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute\n     the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n     before distributing the Program.\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n     copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n     license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\n\n  a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n  b) its license agreement:\n      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n         and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n         conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n         conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\n         damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n         consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n         offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n     iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n         Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n         manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n     Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n     within the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\nif\nany, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\noriginator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\nif a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\nother legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial\nContributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims\nor Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\na) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and\nb) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\nCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at\nits own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If\nthat Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\nwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are\nsuch Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the\nCommercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\nand distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\nrisks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\nor loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of\noperations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\nLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\nOF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\nremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the\nparties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\nnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\nunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\nand survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\norder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\npublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to\ntime. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this\nAgreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The\nEclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\nSteward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will\nbe given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\nAgreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the\nAgreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\nstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\nlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\nProgram not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose.
