Preparation\n\n**Recommended**: You can use [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to greatly simplify the PR process.\n\nWe can contribute by reporting issues, submitting code patches or any other feedback.\n\nBefore submitting the code, we need to do some preparation:\n\n1. Sign up or login to GitHub: [https://github.com](https://github.com)\n\n2. Fork HugeGraph repo from GitHub: [https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/fork](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/fork)\n\n3. Clone code from fork repo to local: [https://github.com/${GITHUB_USER_NAME}/incubator-hugegraph](https://github.com/${GITHUB_USER_NAME}/incubator-hugegraph)\n\n   ```shell\n   # clone code from remote to local repo\n   git clone https://github.com/${GITHUB_USER_NAME}/incubator-hugegraph.git hugegraph\n   ```\n\n4. Configure local HugeGraph repo\n\n   ```shell\n   cd hugegraph\n\n   # add upstream to synchronize the latest code\n   git remote add hugegraph https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph\n\n   # set name and email to push code to github\n   git config user.name \"{full-name}\" # like \"Jermy Li\"\n   git config user.email \"{email-address-of-github}\" # like \"jermy@apache.org\"\n   ```\n\n## 2. Create an Issue on GitHub\n\nIf you encounter bugs or have any questions, please go to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/issues) to report them and feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/issues/new).\n\n## 3. Make changes of code locally\n\n#### 3.1 Create a new branch\n\nPlease don't use master branch for development. Instead, we should create a new branch:\n\n```shell\n# checkout master branch\ngit checkout master\n# pull the latest code from official hugegraph\ngit pull hugegraph\n# create new branch: bugfix-branch\ngit checkout -b bugfix-branch\n```\n\n#### 3.2 Change the code\n\nAssume that we need to modify some files like \"HugeGraph.java\" and \"HugeFactory.java\":\n\n```shell\n# modify code to fix a bug\nvim hugegraph-server/hugegraph-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hugegraph/HugeGraph.java\nvim hugegraph-server/hugegraph-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hugegraph/HugeFactory.java\n# run test locally (optional)\nmvn test -Pcore-test,memory\n```\nNote: To be consistent with the code style easily, if you use [IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) as your IDE, you can directly [import](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html) our code style [configuration file](./hugegraph-style.xml). \n\n##### 3.2.1 Check licenses\nIf we want to add new third-party dependencies to the `HugeGraph` project, we need to do the following things:\n1. Find the third-party dependent repository, put the dependent `license` file into [./hugegraph-dist/release-docs/licenses/](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/tree/master/hugegraph-dist/release-docs/licenses) path.\n2. Declare the dependency in [./install-dist/release-docs/LICENSE](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/blob/master/install-dist/release-docs/LICENSE) `LICENSE` information.\n3. Find the NOTICE file in the repository and append it to [./install-dist/release-docs/NOTICE](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/blob/master/install-dist/release-docs/NOTICE) file (skip this step if there is no NOTICE file).\n4. Execute locally [./install-dist/scripts/dependency/regenerate_known_dependencies.sh](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/blob/master/install-dist/scripts/dependency/regenerate_known_dependencies.sh) to update the dependency list [known-dependencies.txt](https://github.com/apache/incubator-hugegraph/blob/master/install-dist/scripts/dependency/known-dependencies.txt) (or manually update).\n\n**Example**: A new third-party dependency is introduced into the project -> `ant-1.9.1.jar`\n- The project source code is located at: https://github.com/apache/ant/tree/rel/1.9.1\n- LICENSE file: https://github.com/apache/ant/blob/rel/1.9.1/LICENSE\n- NOTICE file: https://github.com/apache/ant/blob/rel/1.9.1/NOTICE\n\nThe license information of `ant-1.9.1.jar` needs to be specified in the LICENSE file, and the notice information needs to be specified in the NOTICE file. The detailed LICENSE file corresponding to ant-1.9.1.jar needs to be copied to our licenses/ directory. Finally, update the known-dependencies.txt file.\n\n#### 3.3 Commit changes to git repo\n\nAfter the code has been completed, we submit them to the local git repo:\n\n```shell\n# add files to local git index\ngit add hugegraph-server/hugegraph-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hugegraph/HugeGraph.java\ngit add hugegraph-server/hugegraph-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hugegraph/HugeFactory.java\n# commit to local git repo\ngit commit\n```\n\nPlease edit the commit message after running `git commit`, we can explain what and how to fix a bug or implement a feature, the following is an example:\n\n```sh\nFix bug: run deploy multiple times \n\nfix #ISSUE_ID\n```\n\n>  Please remember to fill in the issue id, which GitHub generated after issue creation.\n\n#### 3.4 Push commit to GitHub fork repo\n\nPush the local commit to GitHub fork repo:\n\n```shell\n# push the local commit to fork repo\ngit push origin bugfix-branch:bugfix-branch\n```\n\nNote that since GitHub requires submitting code through `username + token` (instead of using `username + password` directly), you need to create a GitHub token from https://github.com/settings/tokens:\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9625821/163524204-7fe0e6bf-9c8b-4b1a-ac65-6a0ac423eb16.png\">\n\n## 4. Create a Pull Request\n\nGo to the web page of GitHub fork repo, there would be a chance to create a Pull Request after pushing to a new branch, click the button \"Compare & pull request\" to do it. Then edit the description for proposed changes, which can just be copied from the commit message.\n\nNote: please make sure the email address you used to submit the code is bound to the GitHub account. For how to bind the email address, please refer to https://github.com/settings/emails:\n<img width=\"1280\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9625821/163522445-2a50a72a-dea2-434f-9868-3a0d40d0d037.png\">\n\n## 5. Code review\n\n Maintainers will start the code review after all the **automatic** checks are passed:\n\n- Check: Contributor License Agreement is signed\n- Check: Travis CI builds are passed (automatically Test and Deploy)\n\nThe commit will be accepted and merged if there is no problem after review.\n\nPlease click on \"Details\" to find the problem if any check does not pass.\n\nIf there are checks not passed or changes requested, then continue to modify the code and push again.\n\n## 6. Further changes after review \n\nIf we have not passed the review, don't be discouraged. Usually a commit needs to be reviewed several times before being accepted! Please follow the review comments and make further changes.\n\nAfter the further changes, we submit them to the local repo:\n\n```shell\n# commit all updated files in a new commit,\n# please feel free to enter any appropriate commit message, note that\n# we will squash all commits in the pull request as one commit when\n# merging into the master branch.\ngit commit -a\n```\n\n> If there are conflicts that prevent the code from being merged, we need to rebase on master branch:\n>\n> ```shell\n> # synchronize the latest code\n> git checkout master\n> git pull hugegraph\n> # rebase on master\n> git checkout bugfix-branch\n> git rebase -i master\n> ```\n\nAnd push it to GitHub fork repo again:\n\n```shell\n# force push the local commit to fork repo\ngit push -f origin bugfix-branch:bugfix-branch\n```\n\nGitHub will automatically update the Pull Request after we push it, wait for code review.\n\nFor Any question, please contact us through [dev@hugegraph.apache.org](mailto:dev@hugegraph.apache.org) ([subscriber](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/contribution-guidelines/subscribe/) only)\n\n\n"

Docker Way (Convenient for Test)\n\nWe can use `docker run -itd --name=graph -p 8080:8080 hugegraph/hugegraph:1.3.0` to quickly start an inner \nHugeGraph server with `RocksDB` (in backgrounds) for **test/dev**.\nYou can visit [doc page](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-server/#3-deploy) or\nthe [README](hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/docker/README.md) for more details. ([Docker Compose](./hugegraph-server/hugegraph-dist/docker/example))\n\n> Note:\n>  \n> 1. The docker image of hugegraph is a convenience release, but not **official distribution** artifacts. You can find more details from [ASF Release Distribution Policy](https://infra.apache.org/release-distribution.html#dockerhub).\n> \n> 2. Recommend to use `release tag` (like `1.3.0`/`1.5.0`) for the stable version. Use `latest` tag to experience the newest functions in development.\n\n### 2. Download Way\n\nVisit [Download Page](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/download/download/) and refer the [doc](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-server/#32-download-the-binary-tar-tarball) \nto download the latest release package and start the server.\n\n### 3. Source Building Way\n\nVisit [Source Building Page](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/quickstart/hugegraph-server/#33-source-code-compilation) and follow the \nsteps to build the source code and start the server.\n\nThe project [doc page](https://hugegraph.apache.org/docs/) contains more information on HugeGraph\nand provides detailed documentation for users. (Structure / Usage / API / Configs...)\n\nAnd here are links of other **HugeGraph** component/repositories:\n1.
