library providing simple way to control divider items of RecyclerView\n\n ![Simple Divider](/sample/sample1.gif) ![Complex Divider](/sample/sample2.gif)\n\n# Release Note\n\n[Release Note] (https://github.com/yqritc/RecyclerView-FlexibleDivider/releases)\n\n# Gradle\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n    jcenter()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    compile 'com.yqritc:recyclerview-flexibledivider:1.4.0'\n}\n```\n\n# Usage\n\nThe following is the simplest usage.  \nDrawing a divider drawable retrieved from android.R.attr.listDivider between each cell.\n```java\nRecyclerView recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recyclerview);\nrecyclerView.addItemDecoration(new HorizontalDividerItemDecoration.Builder(this).build());\n```\n\n| ItemDecoration         | Usage |\n|:------------------|:----------|\n| HorizontalDividerItemDecoration         | For layout manager having vertical orientation to draw horizontal divider |\n| VerticalDividerItemDecoration         | For layout manager having horizontal orientation to draw vertical divider |\n_*Please note that you can only set one of above item decorations at a time._\n\nIf you want to set color, size and margin values, you can specify as the followings.\n```java\nRecyclerView recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recyclerview);\nrecyclerView.addItemDecoration(\n        new HorizontalDividerItemDecoration.Builder(this)\n                .color(Color.RED)\n                .sizeResId(R.dimen.divider)\n                .marginResId(R.dimen.leftmargin, R.dimen.rightmargin)\n                .build());\n```\n\n\nInstead of setting color and size, you can set paint object.\n```java\nPaint paint = new Paint();\npaint.setStrokeWidth(5);\npaint.setColor(Color.BLUE);\npaint.setAntiAlias(true);\npaint.setPathEffect(new DashPathEffect(new float[]{25.0f, 25.0f}, 0));\nrecyclerView.addItemDecoration(\n        new HorizontalDividerItemDecoration.Builder(this).paint(paint).build());\n```\n\nAlso 9patch drawable can be used for drawing divider.\n```java\nRecyclerView recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recyclerview);\nrecyclerView.addItemDecoration(new HorizontalDividerItemDecoration.Builder(this)\n        .drawable(R.drawable.sample)\n        .size(15)\n        .build());\n```\n\nIf you want to customize divider depending on the position, implement the following interfaces.\n\n### List of provider\nThe following providers can be implemented and controllable for each divider drawn between cells.  \nPlease refer to ComplexAdapter class in the [sample](/sample/src/main/java/com/yqritc/recyclerviewflexibledivider/sample) for the usage of providers in detail.\n\n- ColorProvider\nProvide color for divider\n\n- PaintProvider\nProvide paint object for divider line to draw.\n\n- DrawableDivider\nProvide drawable object for divider line\n\n- SizeProvider\nProvide height for horizontal divider, width for vertical divider.\n\n- VisibilityProvider  \nEnables you to control the visibility of dividers.\n\n- MarginProvider for horizontal divider (vertical list)  \nEnables you to specify left and right margin of divider.\n\n- MarginProvider for vertical divider (horizontal list)  \nEnables you to specify top and bottom margin of divider.  \n\n**For GridLayoutManager**, the position parameter of above providers is group index of items.\nSo, control your divider based on [group index](http://developer.android.com/intl/ja/reference/android/support/v7/widget/GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup.html#getSpanGroupIndex(int, int)) instead of the position of items.\n\n### Optional\n- Builder.showLastDivider  \nDraw divider line at the end of last item in RecyclerView.\nIf you enable this, the range of position parameter of providers listed above is 0 to itemCount-1.\nOtherwise, the range is 0 to itemCount-2.  \n\n- Builder.positionInsideItem  \nDraw divider inside items.  \nIf you want to follow [material design guideline](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/dividers.html#dividers-specs), enable this feature.\n\n\n### Note\n- When neither of color, paint, drawable is set, default divider retrieved from android.R.attr.listDivider will be used.\n- When you set Paint, you must use setColor and setStrokeWidth methods of paint class.\n- If you want to use DashPathEffect, please note the following issue.\nhttps://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=29944\n\n##### _Looking for custom ItemDecoration to achieve equal column space for GridLayoutManager?_\nCheck out
