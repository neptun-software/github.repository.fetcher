Feel free to fork this application or use [AndroidStarters](http://androidstarters.com/) to create new app using this boilerplate.\n\n# MVP template\n\nWhen we follow any architecture pattern like MVP, MVVM, MVP clean, we always come across a small but repetitive task to create basic files like Android Activity, Presenter, View, Api models and then writing boiler plate code. This usually takes 1-2 hours for each single screen. To ease out work and save time We have created an automated template which will do above work in less than 20 seconds.\n\n### How to Install\n\nFind the template/MVPActivity folder under root directory of android-mvp-architecture app. Paste the MVPActivity folder at below location.\n1. Windows - C:\\Program Files\\Android\\Android Studio\\plugins\\android\\lib\\templates\\activities\n2. Mac - /Applications/Android/Studio.app/Contents/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities\n\nRestart the Android Studio.\n\n![Blueprint](https://github.com/sachinrana135/android-mvp-architecture/blob/feature/mvp_template/template/how_to_install.gif)\n<br>\n\n### How to use\n\nSelect the folder under which you want to create a new MVP folder. This MVP folder will contain Activity, Presenter, MVpPresenter and View class. For example, to create a new MVP folder under “view” folder, do as shown below.\n\n![Blueprint](https://github.com/sachinrana135/android-mvp-architecture/blob/feature/mvp_template/template/How_to_use_template.gif)\n<br>\n\n\n\n### License\n```\n   Copyright (C) 2023 JANISHAR ALI ANWAR\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n```\n\n### Contributing to Android MVP Architecture\nAll pull requests are welcome, make sure to follow the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\nwhen you submit pull request.\n"
