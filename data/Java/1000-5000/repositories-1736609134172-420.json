          "content": "# Contributing\n\nContributions are very welcome. The following will provide some helpful guidelines.\n\n## How to build the project\n\nArchUnit requires at least JDK 15 to build.\nThe following is just an example input/output from a Unix command line.\nWindows users should use `gradlew.bat` instead.\n\n```\n$ cd /path/to/git/clone/of/ArchUnit\n$ ./gradlew showJdkVersion\nConfigured JDK: 15\n$ ./gradlew build\n```\n\nYou can configure the JDK Gradle uses according to the \n[Gradle User Guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html)\n\n## How to contribute\n\nIf you want to tackle an existing issue please add a comment to make sure the issue is sufficiently discussed\nand that no two contributors collide by working on the same issue. \nTo submit a contribution, please follow the following workflow:\n\n* Fork the project\n* Create a feature branch\n* Add your contribution\n* When you're completely done, build the project and run all tests via `./gradlew clean build -PallTests`\n* Create a Pull Request\n\n### Commits\n\nCommit messages should be clear and fully elaborate the context and the reason of a change.\nEach commit message should follow the following conventions:\n\n* it may use markdown to improve readability on GitHub\n* it must start with a title\n  * less than 70 characters\n  * starting lowercase\n  * written in imperative style as to complete the statement \"if applied this commit will\" (e.g. \"fix race condition when loading import plugins\")\n* if the commit is not trivial the title should be followed by a body\n  * separated from the title by a blank line\n  * explaining all necessary context and reasons for the change\n* if your commit refers to an issue, please post-fix it with the issue number, e.g. `Issue: #123` or `Resolves: #123`\n\nA full example:\n\n```\nreport classes contained in multiple PlantUML components as violation\n\nSo far when checking an `ArchRule` based on `PlantUmlArchCondition` we were throwing an exception\nif a class was contained in multiple diagram components. \nThis causes problems for legacy code bases where some classes might violate the conventions\nin such a way, which should be frozen as violations to be iteratively fixed. \nBut throwing a `ComponentIntersectionException` prevents any such approach. \nWe thus replace the `ComponentIntersectionException` by a regular rule violation that can be treated\nlike any other violation of the architecture and in particular be frozen via `FreezingArchRule`.\n\nResolves: #960\n```\n\nFurthermore, commits must be signed off according to the [DCO](DCO).\n\n### Pull Requests\n\nIf your Pull Request resolves an issue, please add a respective line to the end, like\n\n```\nResolves #123\n```\n\n### Formatting\n\nPlease adjust your code formatter to the general style of the project. To help with this, you can\nuse the code formatters within the [develop](develop) folder. Furthermore, imports should be\nadded in a consistent way, in particular lay out your imports\n\n* java.*\n* javax.*\n* all other imports\n* all static imports\n\nand don't use any `*` imports at any time.\n"

The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below (from developercertificate.org):\n\n> Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1\n>\n> By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:\n>\n> (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I\n>     have the right to submit it under the open source license\n>     indicated in the file; or\n>\n> (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best\n>     of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source\n>     license and I have the right under that license to submit that\n>     work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part\n>     by me, under the same open source license (unless I am\n>     permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated\n>     in the file; or\n>\n> (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other\n>     person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified\n>     it.\n>\n> (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution\n>     are public and that a record of the contribution (including all\n>     personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is\n>     maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with\n>     this project or the open source license(s) involved.\n\n#### DCO Sign-Off Methods\n\nThe DCO requires a sign-off message in the following format appear on each commit in the pull request:\n\n> Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>\n\nusing your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)\n\nThe DCO text can either be manually added to your commit body, or you can add either **-s** or **--signoff** to your usual git commit commands. If you forget to add the sign-off you can also amend a previous commit with the sign-off by running **git commit --amend -s**. If you've pushed your changes to Github already you'll need to force push your branch after this with **git push -f**.\n\n\n#### Alternative Sign-Off Methods in rare cases\n\n\nIf it is really no option for you to disclose your real name and email address, there might be a chance that you can get your contribution accepted. In this case please contact the maintainers directly and verify the adherence to the DCO of the contribution manually. This might include quite some legal overhead for both parties."
