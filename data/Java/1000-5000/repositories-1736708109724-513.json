Or you can create your own Style.\n\nIn general you can modify\n\n- display duration\n- dimension settings\n- options for the text to display\n- custom Views\n- appearance & disappearance Animation\n- displayed Image\n\nSince [Style](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/blob/master/library/src/main/java/de/keyboardsurfer/android/widget/crouton/Style.java) is the general entry point for tweaking Croutons, go and see for yourself what can be done with it.\n\n## Building\n### Gradle\n\n#### From maven central\n\nAdd maven central to your `build.gradle`:\n\n```groovy\nbuildscript {\n  repositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n  }\n}\n \nrepositories {\n  mavenCentral()\n}\n```\n\nThen declare Crouton within your dependencies:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n  ...\n  compile('de.keyboardsurfer.android.widget:crouton:1.8.5@aar') {\n    // exclusion is not necessary, but generally a good idea.\n    exclude group: 'com.google.android', module: 'support-v4'\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n\n### Maven\n\n#### From maven central\n\nTo use crouton within your maven build simply add\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <artifactId>crouton</artifactId>\n  <version>${crouton.version}</version>\n  <groupId>de.keyboardsurfer.android.widget</groupId>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nto your pom.xml\n\nIf you also want the sources or javadoc add the respective classifier  \n\n```xml\n  <classifier>sources</classifier>\n```\n\nor\n\n```xml\n  <classifier>javadoc</classifier>\n```\nto the dependency.\n\nIf you are referencing a newer version of the Android Support Library in your application, you might want to exclude Crouton's dependency like this:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n\t<artifactId>crouton</artifactId>\n\t<version>${crouton.version}</version>\n\t<groupId>de.keyboardsurfer.android.widget</groupId>\n\t<exclusions>\n\t    <exclusion>\n\t        <groupId>com.android.support</groupId>\n\t        <artifactId>support-v4</artifactId>\n\t    </exclusion>\n\t</exclusions>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n### DIY\n\nThe build requires Gradle. Operations are very simple:\n\n* install [gradle](http://www.gradle.org/)\n* `gradle assemble` builds all artifacts\n* `gradle jar` builds the jar\n\nAfter putting Crouton in a repository you can add it as dependency.\n\n```groovy\ncompile('de.keyboardsurfer.android.widget:crouton:1.8.5@aar') {\n  exclude group: 'com.google.android', module: 'support-v4'\n}\n```\n\n###Building and Signing\n\nIn order to build and sign Crouton locally you'll need to rename `gradle.properties.sample` to `gradle.properties`.\n\n## Contribution\n\n###Questions\n\nQuestions regarding Crouton can be asked on [StackOverflow, using the crouton tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/crouton).\n\n### Pull requests welcome\n\nFeel free to contribute to Crouton.\n\nEither you found a bug or have created a new and awesome feature, just create a pull request.\n\nIf you want to start to create a new feature or have any other questions regarding Crouton, [file an issue](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/issues/new).\nI'll try to answer as soon as I find the time.\n\nPlease note, if you're working on a pull request, make sure to use the [develop branch](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/tree/develop) as your base.\n\n### Formatting\n\nFor contributors using Eclipse there's a formatter available at the [download section](https://github.com/downloads/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/Crouton_Eclipseformatter.xml).\n\nIn order to reduce merging pains on my end, please use this formatter or format your commit in a way similar to it's example.\n\nIf you're using IDEA, the Eclipse Formatter plugin should allow you to use the formatter as well.\n\n## License\n\n* [Apache Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)\n\n## Attributions\n\nThe initial version was written by  <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/117509657298845443204?rel=author\">Benjamin Weiss</a>.\nThe name and the idea of [Crouton](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/blob/master/library/src/de/keyboardsurfer/android/widget/crouton/Crouton.java) originates in a [blog article](http://android.cyrilmottier.com/?p=773) by Cyril Mottier.\n\nThe Crouton logo has been created by [Marie Schweiz](http://marie-schweiz.de).\n"
