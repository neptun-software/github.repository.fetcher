Distribution Obligations.\n\n3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\nAny Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\n3.2. Modifications.\n\nThe Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n3.3. Required Notices.\n\nYou must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer.\n\n3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\nYou may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients’ rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\nYou may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient’s rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n3.6. Larger Works.\n\nYou may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n4.1. New Versions.\n\nSun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this License.\n\n4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\nYou may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n4.3. Modified Versions.\n\nWhen You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\nCOVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN “AS IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.\n\n6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is referred to as “Participant”) alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.\n\n6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY’S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\nThe Covered Software is a “commercial item,” as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of “commercial computer software” (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and “commercial computer software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction’s conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United States export administration regulations (and the export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\nAs between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\n\nThe code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the state courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.\n\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\na) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\nc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10.

          "content": "# Java EE 7 Samples #\n\n\nThis workspace consists of Java EE 7 Samples and unit tests. They are categorized in different directories, one for each Technology/JSR.\n\nSome samples/tests have documentation, otherwise read the code. The [Java EE 7 Essentials](http://www.amazon.com/Java-EE-Essentials-Arun-Gupta/dp/1449370179/) book refers to most of these samples and provides an explanation. Feel free to add docs and send a pull request.\n\n\n## How to run? ##\n\nSamples are tested on Payara, GlassFish, Wildfly and more using the Arquillian ecosystem.\n\nA brief instruction how to clone, build, import and run the samples on your local machine @radcortez provides in this sample video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB4b-Yz9cF0\n\nOnly one container profile can be active at a given time otherwise there will be dependency conflicts.\n\nThere are 16 available container profiles, for 6 different servers:\n\n* Payara and GlassFish\n  * ``payara-ci-managed``\n    \n      This profile will install a Payara server and start up the server per sample.\n      Useful for CI servers. The Payara version that's used can be set via the ``payara.version`` property.\n      This is the default profile and does not have to be specified explicitly.\n\n  * ``payara-embedded``\n    \n      This profile uses the Payara embedded server and runs in the same JVM as the TestClass.\n      Useful for development, but has the downside of server startup per sample.\n\n  * ``payara-remote``\n    \n      This profile requires you to start up a Payara server outside of the build. Each sample will then\n      reuse this instance to run the tests.\n      Useful for development to avoid the server start up cost per sample.\n      \n      This profile supports for some tests to set the location where Payara is installed via the ``glassfishRemote_gfHome``\n      system property. E.g.\n    \n      ``-DglassfishRemote_gfHome=/opt/payara171``\n      \n      This is used for sending asadmin commands to create container resources, such as users in an identity store.\n\n  * ``glassfish-embedded``\n    \n      This profile uses the GlassFish embedded server and runs in the same JVM as the TestClass.\n      Useful for development, but has the downside of server startup per sample.\n\n  * ``glassfish-remote``\n    \n      This profile requires you to start up a GlassFish server outside of the build. Each sample will then\n      reuse this instance to run the tests.\n      Useful for development to avoid the server start up cost per sample.\n      \n      This profile supports for some tests to set the location where GlassFish is installed via the ``glassfishRemote_gfHome``\n      system property. E.g.\n    \n      ``-DglassfishRemote_gfHome=/opt/glassfish41``\n      \n      This is used for sending asadmin commands to create container resources, such as users in an identity store.\n\n* WildFly\n\n  * ``wildfly-ci-managed``\n    \n      This profile will install a Wildfly server and start up the server per sample.\n      Useful for CI servers. The WildFly version that's used can be set via the ``wildfly.version`` property.\n    \n  * ``wildfly-embedded``\n    \n      This profile is almost identical to wildfly-ci-managed. It will install the same Wildfly server and start up \n      that server per sample again, but instead uses the Arquillian embedded connector to run it in the same JVM. \n      Useful for CI servers. The WildFly version that's used can be set via the ``wildfly.version`` property.\n\n  * ``wildfly-remote``\n    \n      This profile requires you to start up a Wildfly server outside of the build. Each sample will then\n      reuse this instance to run the tests.\n      Useful for development to avoid the server start up cost per sample.\n      \n  * ``wildfly-swarm``\n\n      This profile uses WildFly Swarm, which allows building uberjars that contain just enough of the WildFly\n      application server. Here, the parts of WildFly that are included are selected based on inspecting the application\n      and looking for the Java EE APIs that are actually used. The WildFly Swarm version that's used can be set via\n      the ``wildfly.swarm.version`` property.\n\n* TomEE\n    \n  * ``tomee-ci-managed``\n\n      This profile will install a TomEE server and start up that server per sample.\n      Useful for CI servers. This profile cannot connect to a running server.\n    \n      Note that the version of TomEE to be used has to be present in an\n      available maven repository. The defaults in this profile assume that the arquillian adapter and\n      the TomEE server have the same version. E.g both 7.0.0.\n    \n      To use a TomEE server that's not available in maven central, one way to use it for the samples is to\n      install it in a local .m2 as follows:\n    \n      Clone TomEE repo:\n    \n      ``git clone https://github.com/apache/tomee``\n      ``cd tomee``\n    \n      Switch to the desired version if needed, then build and install in .m2:\n    \n      ``mvn clean install -pl tomee/apache-tomee -am -Dmaven.test.skip=true``\n    \n      ``mvn clean install -pl arquillian -amd -Dmaven.test.skip=true``\n    \n      Make sure the version that's installed (see pom.xml in TomEE project) matches the ``tomee.version`` in the\n      properties section in the root pom.xml of the samples project.\n    \n  * ``tomee-embedded``\n\n      This profile uses the TomEE embedded server and runs in the same JVM as the TestClass.\n      \n* Liberty\n    \n  * ``liberty-managed``\n\n      This profile will start up the Liberty server per sample, and optionally connects to a running server that you\n      can start up outside of the build (with the restriction that this server has to run on the host as where\n      the tests are run using the same user).\n    \n      To connect to a running server the ``org.jboss.arquillian.container.was.wlp_managed_8_5.allowConnectingToRunningServer`` \n      system property has to be set to true. E.g.\n    \n      ``-Dorg.jboss.arquillian.container.was.wlp_managed_8_5.allowConnectingToRunningServer=true``\n    \n      This profile requires you to set the location where Liberty is installed via the ``libertyManagedArquillian_wlpHome``\n      system property. E.g.\n    \n      ``-DlibertyManagedArquillian_wlpHome=/opt/wlp``\n    \n      This profile also requires the localConnector feature to be configured in server.xml, and if all tests are to be run the\n      javaee-7.0 feature E.g.\n    \n      ```xml\n      <featureManager>\n          <feature>javaee-7.0</feature>\n          <feature>localConnector-1.0</feature>\n      </featureManager>\n      ```\n    \n      For older versions of Liberty (pre 16.0.0.0) for the JASPIC tests to even be attempted to be executed a cheat is needed that creates a group in Liberty's internal user registry:\n    \n      ```xml\n      <basicRegistry id=\"basic\">\n          <group name=\"architect\"/>\n      </basicRegistry>\n      ```\n    \n      This cheat is not needed for the latest versions of Liberty (16.0.0.0/2016.7 and later)\n        \n  * ``liberty-ci-managed``\n    \n      This profile will download and install a Liberty server and start up the server per sample.\n      Useful for CI servers. Note, this is not a real embedded server, but a regular server. It's now\n      called \"embedded\" because no separate install is needed as it's downloaded automatically. \n      \n* Weblogic\n    \n  * ``weblogic-remote``\n    \n      This profile requires you to start up a WebLogic server outside of the build. Each sample will then\n      reuse this instance to run the tests.\n    \n      This profile requires you to set the location where WebLogic is installed via the ``weblogicRemoteArquillian_wlHome``\n      system property. E.g.\n    \n    ``-DweblogicRemoteArquillian_wlHome=/opt/wls12210``\n    \n      The default username/password are assumed to be \"admin\" and \"admin007\" respectively. This can be changed using the\n      ``weblogicRemoteArquillian_adminUserName`` and ``weblogicRemoteArquillian_adminPassword`` system properties. E.g.\n    \n      ``-DweblogicRemoteArquillian_adminUserName=myuser``\n      ``-DweblogicRemoteArquillian_adminPassword=mypassword``\n      \n* Tomcat\n    \n  * ``tomcat-remote``\n\n      This profile requires you to start up a plain Tomcat (8.5 or 9) server outside of the build. Each sample will then\n      reuse this instance to run the tests.\n    \n      Tomcat supports samples that make use of Servlet, JSP, Expression Language (EL), WebSocket and JASPIC.\n    \n      This profile requires you to enable JMX in Tomcat. This can be done by adding the following to ``[tomcat home]/bin/catalina.sh``:\n    \n      ```\n      JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=8089 -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote=true \"\n      JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false \"\n      JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false\"\n      JAVA_OPTS=\"$JAVA_OPTS -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=localhost \"\n      ```\n    \n      This profile also requires you to set a username (``tomcat``) and password (``manager``) for the management application in \n      ``tomcat-users.xml``. See the file ``test-utils/src/main/resources/tomcat-users.xml`` in this repository for a full example.\n    \n      Be aware that this should *only* be done for a Tomcat instance that's used exclusively for testing, as the above will make\n      the Tomcat installation **totally insecure!**\n    \n  * ``tomcat-ci-managed``\n\n      This profile will install a Tomcat server and start up the server per sample.\n      Useful for CI servers. The Tomcat version that's used can be set via the ``tomcat.version`` property.\n      \n   \n    \nThe containers that download and install a server (the \\*-ci-managed profiles) allow you to override the version used, e.g.:\n\n* `-Dpayara.version=4.1.1.163`\n\n    This will change the version from the current one (e.g 4.1.1.171.1) to 4.1.1.163 for Payara testing purposes.\n\n* `-Dglassfish.version=4.1`\n\n    This will change the version from the current one (e.g 4.1.1) to 4.1 for GlassFish testing purposes.\n\n* `-Dwildfly.version=8.1.0.Final`\n\n    This will change the version from the current one (e.g. 10.1.0.Final) to 8.1.0.Final for WildFly.\n\n\n\n\n**To run them in the console do**:\n\n1. In the terminal, ``mvn test -fae`` at the top-level directory to start the tests for the default profile.\n\nWhen developing and runing them from IDE, remember to activate the profile before running the test.\n\nTo learn more about Arquillian please refer to the [Arquillian Guides](http://arquillian.org/guides/)\n\n**To run only a subset of the tests do at the top-level directory**:\n\n1. Install top level dependencies: ``mvn clean install -pl \"test-utils,util\" -am``\n1. cd into desired module, e.g.: ``cd jaspic``\n1. Run tests against desired server, e.g.: ``mvn clean test -P liberty-ci-managed``\n\n\n## How to contribute ##\n\nWith your help we can improve this set of samples, learn from each other and grow the community full of passionate people who care about the technology, innovation and code quality. Every contribution matters!\n\nThere is just a bunch of things you should keep in mind before sending a pull request, so we can easily get all the new things incorporated into the master branch.\n\nStandard tests are jUnit based - for example [this commit](servlet/servlet-filters/src/test/java/org/javaee7/servlet/filters/FilterServletTest.java). Test classes naming must comply with surefire naming standards `**/*Test.java`, `**/*Test*.java` or `**/*TestCase.java`.\n\nFor the sake of clarity and consistency, and to minimize the upfront complexity, we prefer standard jUnit tests using Java, with as additional helpers HtmlUnit, Hamcrest and of course Arquillian. Please don't use alternatives for these technologies. If any new dependency has to be introduced into this project it should provide something that's not covered by these existing dependencies.\n\n\n### Some coding principles ###\n\n* When creating new source file do not put (or copy) any license header, as we use top-level license (MIT) for each and every file in this repository.\n* Please follow JBoss Community code formatting profile as defined in the [jboss/ide-config](https://github.com/jboss/ide-config#readme) repository. The details are explained there, as well as configurations for Eclipse, IntelliJ and NetBeans.\n\n\n### Small Git tips ###\n\n* Make sure your [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) is always up-to-date. Simply run ``git pull upstream master`` and you are ready to hack.\n* When developing new features please create a feature branch so that we incorporate your changes smoothly. It's also convenient for you as you could work on few things in parallel ;) In order to create a feature branch and switch to it in one swoop you can use ``git checkout -b my_new_cool_feature``\n\nThat's it! Welcome in the community!\n\n## CI Job ##\n\nCI jobs are executed by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/javaee-samples/javaee7-samples). Note that by the very nature of the samples provided here it's perfectly normal that not all tests pass. This normally would indicate a bug in the server on which the samples are executed. If you think it's really the test that's faulty, then please submit an issue or provide a PR with a fix.\n\n\n## Run each sample in Docker\n\n* Install Docker client from http://boot2docker.io\n* Build the sample that you want to run as\n  \n  ``mvn clean package -DskipTests``\n\n  For example:\n\n  ``mvn -f jaxrs/jaxrs-client/pom.xml clean package -DskipTests``\n\n* Change the second line in ``Dockerfile`` to specify the location of the generated WAR file\n* Run boot2docker and give the command\n\n  ``docker build -it -p 80:8080 javaee7-sample``\n\n* In a different shell, find out the IP address of the running container as:\n\n  ``boot2docker ip``\n\n* Access the sample as http://IP_ADDRESS:80/jaxrs-client/webresources/persons. The exact URL would differ based upon the sample.\n\n"
