          "content": "FadingActionBar\n==================\n\nFadingActionBar is a library which implements the cool fading action bar effect that can be seen in the new Play Music app.\n\nThis library uses the techniques outlined by Cyril Mottier in [a popular blog post][1].\n\nThe three most commonly used action bar implementations are supported: stock (API 11+), ActionBarCompat and ActionBarSherlock.\n\n![Example Image][2]\n\nTry out the sample application:\n\n<a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.manuelpeinado.fadingactionbar.demo\">\n  <img alt=\"Android app on Google Play\"\n       src=\"https://developer.android.com/images/brand/en_app_rgb_wo_45.png\" />\n</a>\n\nOr browse the [source code of the sample application][3] for a complete example of use.\n\nIncluding in your project\n-------------------------\n\nThe library is pushed to Maven Central as a AAR, so you just need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`.\n    \n    dependencies {\n        compile 'com.github.manuelpeinado.fadingactionbar:fadingactionbar:3.1.2'\n    }\n    \nIf your project doesn't use the stock action bar, but one of the compatibility implementations, you would use the following:\n\n    dependencies {\n        // Use the following if your project uses ActionBarCompat\n        compile 'com.github.manuelpeinado.fadingactionbar:fadingactionbar-abc:3.1.2'\n        // Or the following if your project uses ActionBarSherlock\n        compile 'com.github.manuelpeinado.fadingactionbar:fadingactionbar-abs:3.1.2'\n    }\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nUsing the library is really simple, just look at the source code of the provided samples:\n\n* [If your content should be in a `ScrollView`][4].\n* [If your content should be in a `ListView`][5].\n* [If your content is a `WebView`][6].\n\nYou can even use the library [from a fragment][7], which is useful when implementing a dual phone/tablet layout.\n\nSee the demos included in the sample application for a complete overview of the features supported by the library.\n\nKnown Issues\n------------\n\nThere is an important issue with the library and ListViews. More specifically, things don't work quite right when the activity is re-created due to a configuration change. So, unless you handle configuration changes yourself (or your activity is portrait/landscape only), I strongly suggest you stick to having your content in a ScrollView until a solution to this issue is found.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n--------------------\n\n* Thanks to [Cyril Mottier][8] for sharing the techniques that make this library possible.\n* Thanks to [Antonio Leiva][9] for writing the Navigation Drawer sample.\n* Thanks to [Michał Motyczko][10] for coming up with a fix for an important bug.\n\n\nWho's using it\n--------------\n\n* [#ДАНСwithme][11]. This app attempts to organise information from various social network streams into a single source.\n* [Pearl Jam Lyrics][12]. Unofficial app for Pearl Jam fans that want to have all the lyrics of their favorite band in the palm of their hands.\n* [Weatherize][13].
