Include the library as local library project.\n\n    ``` compile 'com.yalantis:phoenix:1.2.3' ```\n\n2. Include the PullToRefreshView widget in your layout.\n\n\t```xml\n    <com.yalantis.phoenix.PullToRefreshView\n        android:id=\"@+id/pull_to_refresh\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n        <ListView\n            android:id=\"@+id/list_view\"\n            android:divider=\"@null\"\n            android:dividerHeight=\"0dp\"\n            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n            android:layout_height=\"match_parent\" />\n\n    </com.yalantis.phoenix.PullToRefreshView>\n    ```\n\n3. In your `onCreate` method refer to the View and setup OnRefreshListener.\n\t```java\n    mPullToRefreshView = (PullToRefreshView) findViewById(R.id.pull_to_refresh);\n    mPullToRefreshView.setOnRefreshListener(new PullToRefreshView.OnRefreshListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onRefresh() {\n            mPullToRefreshView.postDelayed(new Runnable() {\n                @Override\n                public void run() {\n                    mPullToRefreshView.setRefreshing(false);\n                }\n            }, REFRESH_DELAY);\n        }\n     });\n     ```\n\n#Customization\n\nTo customize drawables you can change:\n   * sun.png - Sun image\n   * sky.png - background image\n   * buildings.png - foreground image\n\n# Misc\nIf you need to change progress state:\n```java\n\tmPullToRefreshView.setRefreshing(boolean isRefreshing)\n```\n#Compatibility\n  \n  * Android GINGERBREAD 2.3+\n  \n# Changelog\n\n### Version: 1.2\n\n  * Sample updated with RecyclerView example\n  * Showing the refresh view just in it's bounds. (Issue with transparent / empty ListView)\n  * Possibility to set refresh view padding\n\n### Version: 1.0\n\n  * Initial Build\n\n#### Let us know!\n\nWe’d be really happy if you sent us links to your projects where you use our component. Just send an email to github@yalantis.com And do let us know if you have any questions or suggestion regarding the animation. \n\nP.S. We’re going to publish more awesomeness wrapped in code and a tutorial on how to make UI for Android (iOS) better than better.
