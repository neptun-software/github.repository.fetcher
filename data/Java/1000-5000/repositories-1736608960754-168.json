交流群\n\n扫码如下**二维码**。回复【物联网技术指南】关键字。\n\n可以添加帅气而又风趣的我为好友，并拉你进一个~~学习交流~~**装逼群**。\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img

物联网技术学习指南\n\n基于物联网场景和技术的入门和深度学习教程。\n\n物联网相较于电商、支付和金融等是一个全新的行业。但是物联网又是一个高速发展的行业，很多人想要从事这个行业，但是不得其法，于是诞生了此教程。\n\n市面上的物联网技术文章很少，且文章的质量都较为粗浅和不成体系。对于很多开发者来说，入门即是其对某个技术栈的最终理解，一方面是开发者“比较懒”，另一方面是文章作者把物联网技术写的太浅，又或者不够全面。\n\n- 整理了物联网学习资源和书籍，涉及计算机网络、算法和书籍结构、框架、数据存储等每个细节的知识。\n\n- 在学习基础知识的同时，我想要你了解物联网开发常见的~~**黑话**~~专业术语，例如数字孪生、设备影子、通信相关的术语名词、蓝牙、Zigbee、CoAP、MQTT协议等。\n\n- 在带你学会MQTT v3.1、v3.1.1和v5.0协议的同时，我还想告诉你当前流行和好用的MQTT 客户端工具和不同语言的MQTT Client依赖包，最后以实战的方式带你实现一个单机百万的MQTT Broker。\n\n- 学习上面的知识后，我相信你对物联网有所了解了，我允许你叉着腰**骄傲**一下，接下来我会带你学习从零搭建高性能IoT平台所需要的技术栈、包括架构设计、MQTT Broker搭建、CoAP服务搭建、消息削峰、数据模型设计和数据库选型等。\n\n- 最好我带你编译和学习当前GitHub上最流行的开源物联网平台-[Thingsboard](https://thingsboard.io/), 其在GitHub上点赞超过1w+, 学习前沿的物联网理念和知识，如果你有二次开发的需求，也可沟通联系我欧！一起探讨学习！\n\n- ...\n  \n  让我们一起愉快的挖坑，挖深坑，哇哈哈。\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n
