          "content": "ThreeTen Android Backport\n=========================\n\nAn adaptation of the JSR-310 backport for Android.\n\n**Attention**: Development on this library is winding down. Please consider switching to\nAndroid Gradle plugin 4.0, `java.time.*`, and its\n[core library desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring) feature\nin the coming months.\n\n\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nInitialize the timezone information in your `Application.onCreate()` method:\n```java\n@Override public void onCreate() {\n  super.onCreate();\n  AndroidThreeTen.init(this);\n}\n```\n\nThat's it. Otherwise usage is the exact same as the ThreeTenBP library and you should consult\nits website for usage information: https://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/.\n\n\n\nWhy JSR-310?\n------------\n\nJSR-310 was included in Java 8 as [the `java.time.*` package][time]. It is a full replacement\nfor the ailing `Date` and `Calendar` APIs in both Java and Android. JSR-310 was backported to\nJava 6 by its creator, Stephen Colebourne, from which this library is adapted.\n\n\n\nWhy not use ThreeTenBP?\n-----------------------\n\nSimilar to the problems with using [Joda-Time on Android][joda-android], the [threetenbp][ttbp]\nuses a JAR resource for loading timezone information. This is an extremely [inefficient mechanism\non Android][slow].\n\nThis library places the timezone information as a standard Android asset and provides a custom\nloader for parsing it efficiently.\n\n\n\nWhy not use Joda-Time?\n----------------------\n\nJoda-Time has a very large API which brings with it a very large binary size and large method\ncount. The creator of both JSR-310 and Joda-Time has also said that while Joda-Time isn't broken,\nit does [have design flaws][flaws].\n\nIf you are using Joda-Time already, there's little reason to switch unless its size or method\ncount is relevant to you. For new projects, however, this library offers the standard APIs in\nJava 8 as a much smaller package in not only binary size and method count, but also in API size.\n\n\n\nDownload\n--------\n\n```groovy\nimplementation 'com.jakewharton.threetenabp:threetenabp:1.4.8'\n```\n\nSnapshots of the development version are available in [Sonatype's `snapshots` repository][snap].\n\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\n    Copyright (C) 2015 Jake Wharton\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n\n\n\n\n [snap]: https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/\n [time]: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html\n [joda-android]: https://github.com/dlew/joda-time-android#why-this-library\n [ttbp]: https://github.com/ThreeTen/threetenbp\n [flaws]: http://blog.joda.org/2009/11/why-jsr-310-isn-joda-time_4941.html\n [slow]: http://blog.danlew.net/2013/08/20/joda_time_s_memory_issue_in_android/\n"
