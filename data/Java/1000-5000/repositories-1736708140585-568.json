Read the rationale behind this change in\r\nthe [announcement](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/discussions/1517).\r\nThe gist of it is that CommaFeed can now be compiled to a native binary, resulting in blazing fast startup times (around\r\n0.3s) and very low memory footprint (< 50M).\r\n\r\n- CommaFeed now has a different package for each supported database.\r\n    - If you are deploying CommaFeed with a precompiled package, please\r\n      read [this section of the README](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#download-a-precompiled-package).\r\n    - If you are building CommaFeed from sources, please\r\n      read [this section of the README](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#build-from-sources).\r\n    - If you are using the Docker image, please read the instructions on\r\n      the [Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/r/athou/commafeed).\r\n- Due to the switch to Quarkus, the way CommaFeed is configured is very different (the `config.yml` file is gone).\r\n  Please\r\n  read [this section of the README](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration).\r\n  Note that a lot of configuration elements have been removed or renamed and are now nested/grouped by feature.\r\n- Added a setting to prevent parsing large feeds to avoid out of memory errors. The default is 5MB.\r\n- Use a different icon for filtering unread entries and marking an entry as read (#1506)\r\n- Added various HTML attributes to ease custom JS/CSS customization (#1507)\r\n- The Redis cache has been removed. There have been multiple enhancements to the feed refresh engine and it is no longer\r\n  needed, even for instances with a large number of feeds.\r\n- The H2 migration tool that automatically upgrades H2 databases from format 2 to 3 has been removed. If you're using\r\n  the H2 embedded database, please upgrade to at least version 4.3.0 before upgrading to CommaFeed 5.0.0.\r\n\r\n## [4.6.0]\r\n\r\n- switched from Temurin to OpenJ9 as the JVM used in the Docker image, resulting in memory usage reduction by up to 50%\r\n- fix an issue that could cause old entries to reappear if they were updated by their author (#1486)\r\n- show all entries regardless of their read status when searching with keywords, even if the ui is configured to show\r\n  unread entries only\r\n\r\n## [4.5.0]\r\n\r\n- significantly reduce the time needed to retrieve entries or mark them as read, especially when there are a lot of\r\n  entries (#1452)\r\n- fix a race condition where a feed could be refreshed before it was created in the database\r\n- fix an issue that could cause the websocket notification to contain the wrong number of unread entries when using\r\n  mysql/mariadb\r\n- fix an error when trying to mark all starred entries as read\r\n- remove the `onlyIds` parameter from REST endpoints since retrieving all the entries is now just as fast\r\n- remove support for microsoft sqlserver because it's not covered with integration tests (please open an issue if you'd\r\n  like it back)\r\n\r\n## [4.4.1]\r\n\r\n- fix vertical scrolling issues with Safari (#1168)\r\n- the default value for new users for the \"star entry\" button and the \"open in new tab\" button in the entry headers is\r\n  now \"on desktop\" instead of \"always\"\r\n- the \"keyboard shortcuts\" help page now shows \"Cmd\" instead of \"Ctrl\" on macOS (#1389)\r\n- remove a superfluous feed fetch when subscribing to a feed (#1431)\r\n- the Docker image now uses Java 21\r\n\r\n## [4.4.0]\r\n\r\n- add support for sharing using the browser native capabilities if available (#1255)\r\n- add a button in the entry headers to star an entry (#1025)\r\n- add a button in the entry headers to open links in a new tab (#1333)\r\n- add two options in the settings to toggle those buttons\r\n- accept .opml file extension when importing and export with the .opml extension\r\n- the \"mark as read\" option is no longer shown in the context menu for entries that are too old to be marked as read (\r\n  older than `keepStatusDays`) (#1303)\r\n\r\n## [4.3.3]\r\n\r\n- fix OPML import (#1279)\r\n\r\n## [4.3.2]\r\n\r\n- added support for unix sockets (#1278)\r\n\r\n## [4.3.1]\r\n\r\n- fix an issue that prevents new feeds from being added when mysql/mariadb is used as the database and the database\r\n  timezone is not UTC (#1239)\r\n- videos in enclosures can no longer have a width larger than the page (#1240)\r\n\r\n## [4.3.0]\r\n\r\n- h2 (the embedded database) has been upgraded to 2.2.224\r\n    - this version uses a different file format than 2.1.x, the first time you start CommaFeed with this version, the\r\n      database will be automatically converted to the new format\r\n- add a setting to completely disable scrolling to selected entry (#1157)\r\n- add a css class reflecting the current view mode to ease custom css rules (#1232)\r\n- fix an issue that prevents new feeds from being added when mysql/mariadb is used as the database (#1239)\r\n\r\n## [4.2.1]\r\n\r\n- fix an issue that caused the tree to show an incorrect unread count after a websocket notification because entries\r\n  that were already marked as read by a filtering expression were not ignored (#1191)\r\n\r\n## [4.2.0]\r\n\r\n- add a setting to display the action buttons in the footer instead of in the header on mobile (#1121)\r\n- the websocket notification now contains everything needed to update the UI, the client no longer needs to make an API\r\n  call to get the latest data when receiving the notification\r\n- add a workaround to the Fever API for the Unread iOS app (#1188)\r\n- fix an issue that caused dates to be saved incorrectly if the database server and the application server were in\r\n  different timezones (#1187)\r\n\r\n## [4.1.0]\r\n\r\n- it is now possible to open the sidebar on mobile by swiping to the right (#1098)\r\n- swiping to mark entries as read/unread changed from swiping right to left because swiping right now opens the sidebar\r\n- the full hierarchy of categories are now displayed in the category dropdown (#1045)\r\n- added a setting `maxEntriesAgeDays` to delete old entries based on their age during database cleanup.\r\n  The setting is disabled by default for existing installations, except for the docker image where it is enabled and set\r\n  to 365 days\r\n- if user registrations are disabled on your instance which is the default behavior, users are redirected on the login\r\n  page instead of the welcome page when not logged in (#1185)\r\n- the sidebar resizer is no longer shown in the middle of the screen on mobile\r\n- when using the system color scheme and the system is using a dark theme, feed entries no longer flicker on load\r\n- the demo account (if enabled) cannot register custom javascript code anymore\r\n- removed the usage of `toSorted` in the client because older browsers do not support it (#1183)\r\n- the openapi documentation is no longer cached by the browser so you always have access to the latest version\r\n- added a memory management section to the readme, reading it is recommended if you are running CommaFeed on a server\r\n  with limited memory\r\n- fixed an issue that caused users without an email address set to be unable to edit their profile (#1184)\r\n\r\n## [4.0.0]\r\n\r\n- migrated from dropwizard 2 to dropwizard 4, Java 17+ is now required\r\n- entries that were fetched and inserted in the database but not yet shown in the UI are no longer marked as read when\r\n  marking all entries as read\r\n- your custom sidebar width is now persisted in the local storage of your browser\r\n- there is now a third color scheme option in addition to light and dark: system (follows the system color scheme)\r\n- added support for youtube playlist favicons\r\n- custom JS code is now executed when the app is done loading instead of when the page is loaded\r\n- the favicon is now correctly returned for feeds that return an invalid content type\r\n- the feed refresh engine now uses httpclient5 with connection pooling and no longer creates a new client for each\r\n  request, reducing CPU usage\r\n- updated UI library Mantine to 7.0, improving performance\r\n- the h2 embedded database is now compacted on shutdown to reclaim unused space\r\n- the admin connector on port 8084 is now disabled in config.yml.example. Disabling it in your config.yml is\r\n  recommended (see https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/commit/929df60f09cce56020b0962ab111cd8349b271b0)\r\n- migrated documentation from swagger 2 to openapi 3\r\n- added a GET method to the fever api to indicate that the endpoint is working correctly when accessed from a browser\r\n- the websocket connection can now be disabled, the websocket ping

This package works on all\n  platforms and is started with `java -jar quarkus-run.jar`.\n\nIf available for your operating system, the native package is recommended because it has a faster startup time and lower\nmemory usage.\n\n### Build from sources\n\n    ./mvnw clean package [-P<database>] [-Pnative] [-DskipTests]\n\n- `<database>` can be one of `h2`, `postgresql`, `mysql` or `mariadb`. The default is `h2`.\n- `-Pnative` compiles the application to native code. This requires GraalVM to be installed (`GRAALVM_HOME` environment\n  variable pointing to a GraalVM installation).\n- `-DskipTests` to speed up the build process by skipping tests.\n\nWhen the build is complete:\n\n- a zip containing all jars required to run the application is located at\n  `commafeed-server/target/commafeed-<version>-<database>-jvm.zip`. Extract it and run the application with\n  `java -jar quarkus-run.jar`\n- if you used the native profile, the executable is located at\n  `commafeed-server/target/commafeed-<version>-<database>-<platform>-<arch>-runner[.exe]`\n\n## Configuration\n\nCommaFeed doesn't require any configuration to run with its embedded database (H2). The database file will be stored in\nthe `data` directory of the current directory.\n\nTo use a different database, you will need to configure the following properties:\n\n- `quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url`\n    - e.g. for H2: `jdbc:h2:./data/db;DEFRAG_ALWAYS=TRUE`\n    - e.g. for PostgreSQL: `jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/commafeed`\n    - e.g. for MySQL:\n      `jdbc:mysql://localhost/commafeed?autoReconnect=true&failOverReadOnly=false&maxReconnects=20&rewriteBatchedStatements=true&timezone=UTC`\n    - e.g. for MariaDB:\n      `jdbc:mariadb://localhost/commafeed?autoReconnect=true&failOverReadOnly=false&maxReconnects=20&rewriteBatchedStatements=true&timezone=UTC`\n- `quarkus.datasource.username`\n- `quarkus.datasource.password`\n\nThere are multiple ways to configure CommaFeed:\n\n- a `config/application.properties` [properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) file relative to the working\n  directory (keys in kebab-case)\n- Command line arguments prefixed with `-D` (keys in kebab-case)\n- Environment variables (keys in UPPER_CASE)\n- a `.env` file in the working directory (keys in UPPER_CASE)\n\nThe properties file is recommended because CommaFeed will be able to warn about invalid properties and typos.\n\nAll [CommaFeed settings](commafeed-server/doc/commafeed.md) are optional and have sensible default values.\n\nWhen logging in, credentials are stored in an encrypted cookie. The encryption key is randomly generated at startup,\nmeaning that you will have to log back in after each restart of the application. To prevent this, you can set the\n`quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` property to a fixed value (min. 16 characters).\nAll other Quarkus settings can be found [here](https://quarkus.io/guides/all-config).\n\nWhen started, the server will listen on http://localhost:8082.\nThe default user is `admin` and the default password is `admin`.\n\n### Updates\n\nWhen CommaFeed is up and running, you can subscribe to [this feed](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/releases.atom) to be notified of new releases.\n\n### Memory management\n\nThe Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is rather greedy by default and will not release unused memory to the\noperating system. This is because acquiring memory from the operating system is a relatively expensive operation.\nThis can be problematic on systems with limited memory.\n\n#### Hard limit (`native` and `jvm` packages)\n\nThe JVM can be configured to use a maximum amount of memory with the `-Xmx` parameter.\nFor example, to limit the JVM to 256MB of memory, use `-Xmx256m`.\n\n#### Dynamic sizing (`jvm` package)\n\nIn addition to the previous setting, the JVM can be configured to release unused memory to the operating system with the\nfollowing parameters:\n\n    -Xms20m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:+UseStringDeduplication -XX:-ShrinkHeapInSteps -XX:G1PeriodicGCInterval=10000 -XX:-G1PeriodicGCInvokesConcurrent -XX:MinHeapFreeRatio=5 -XX:MaxHeapFreeRatio=10\n\nSee [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/gctuning/garbage-first-g1-garbage-collector1.html)\nand [here](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/gctuning/factors-affecting-garbage-collection-performance.html) for\nmore\ninformation.\n\n#### OpenJ9 (`jvm` package)\n\nThe [OpenJ9](https://eclipse.dev/openj9/) JVM is a more memory-efficient alternative to the HotSpot JVM, at the cost of\nslightly slower throughput.\n\nIBM provides precompiled binaries for OpenJ9\nnamed [Semeru](https://developer.ibm.com/languages/java/semeru-runtimes/downloads/).\nThis is the JVM used in\nthe [Docker image](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/blob/master/commafeed-server/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.jvm).\n\n## Translation\n\nFiles for internationalization are\nlocated [here](https://github.com/Athou/commafeed/tree/master/commafeed-client/src/locales).\n\nTo add a new language:\n\n- add the new locale to the `locales` array in:\n    - `commafeed-client/.linguirc`\n    - `commafeed-client/src/i18n.ts`\n- run `npm run i18n:extract`\n- add translations to the newly created `commafeed-client/src/locales/[locale]/messages.po` file\n\nThe name of the locale should be the\ntwo-letters [ISO-639-1 language code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).\n\n## Local development\n\n### Backend\n\n- Open `commafeed-server` in your preferred Java IDE.\n    - CommaFeed uses Lombok, you need the Lombok plugin for your IDE.\n- run `./mvnw quarkus:dev`\n\n### Frontend\n\n- Open `commafeed-client` in your preferred JavaScript IDE.\n- run `npm install`\n- run `npm run dev`\n\nThe frontend server is now running at http://localhost:8082 and is proxying REST requests to the backend running on\nport 8083\n"
