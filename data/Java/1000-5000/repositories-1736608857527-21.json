微服务架构实战\n\n咕泡商城是[咕泡学院](https://www.gupaoedu.com) Java架构课程中，帮助学员对于技术更好落地的一个实战项目，项目基于springboot2.1.6.RELEASE+Dubbo2.7.3 来构建微服务。\n\n业务模块划分，尽量贴合互联网公司的架构体系。所以，除了业务本身的复杂度不是很高之外，整体的架构基本和实际架构相差无几。\n\n但实际上，真实的生产级的项目由于用户量以及业务的复杂度，会变得非常复杂。 所以我们会让更多的人参与进来，从需求、设计、解决方案等方面出发来对项目进行迭代，从而培养出一定的\n\n实际解决方案的经验和能力。\n\n#

这个是整个项目的父控文件，需要执行install安装到本地，如果自己搭建了nexus，可以deploy到nexus上\n\n   * gpmall-commons ， 这个是整个项目的公共依赖，执行install安装到本地，如果自己搭建了nexus，可以deploy到nexus上\n\n     > 注： 下列微服务，用到了mysql、redis、kafka等，需要提前安装好相关中间件，并且所有的服务配置的是host地址，建议用hostswitch工具统一维护\n\n   * user-service ,  用户服务，把`user-service-api`模块，install到本地仓库，因为其他模块有依赖。然后启动服务。\n\n   * order-service , 订单服务， 把`order-service-api`模块，install到本地，给其他模块依赖\n\n   * shopping-service , 商品服务， 把`shopping-service-api`模块，install到本地，给其他模块依赖\n\n   * marking-service , 营销服务，暂时未开发功能。\n\n   * pay-service , 支付服务，代码已经写完并调试通过（但是用的是老的接口版本，如果是新的版本，需要改接口），还需要提供appid这些，不过这个项目不启动，并不影响前面的页面的功能\n\n   * comment-service , 评论服务，用于展示商品评论信息\n\n     > 下面的服务为BFF，做服务聚合，分别依赖上面的微服务模块\n\n   * gpmall-shopping \n\n   * gpmall-user\n\n   * gpmall-cashier \n\n3. 前端工程 gpmall-front， 这个项目采用vue开发。\n\n   1. 安装node环境\n   2. 安装python2.7\n   3. 在gpmall-front中执行`npm install` ，\n   4. 再执行`npm run dev`运行，  如果后端的服务都正常启动，此时gpmall-front会把请求转发到服务端获取相关数据进行渲染。\n\n# 项目开发进度\n\n## 前台项目整体的规划有\n\n* 首页渲染，轮播、自定义展示板块\n* 商品查询、商品展示、商品详情\n* 个人中心、用户注册、个人信息修改、收获地址维护\n* 购物车、订单查询、下单、支付\n* 促销活动\n\n![1565235690613](README.assets/1565235690613.png)\n\n## 后台规划\n\n\n\n# 效果图\n\n![](README.assets/项目演示图1.png)\n\n\n\n![](README.assets/项目演示图2.png)\n\n![](README.assets/项目演示图3.png)\n\n#
