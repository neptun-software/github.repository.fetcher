Most\nof those projects will use our [modified Contributor Covenant][].\n\n[may adopt]: https://opensource.google/docs/releasing/preparing/#conduct\n[modified Contributor Covenant]: https://opensource.google/docs/releasing/template/CODE_OF_CONDUCT/\n\n## Resolve peacefully\n\nWe do not believe that all conflict is necessarily bad; healthy debate and\ndisagreement often yields positive results. However, it is never okay to be\ndisrespectful.\n\nIf you see someone behaving disrespectfully, you are encouraged to address the\nbehavior directly with those involved. Many issues can be resolved quickly and\neasily, and this gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute.\nIf you are unable to resolve the matter for any reason, or if the behavior is\nthreatening or harassing, report it. We are dedicated to providing an\nenvironment where participants feel welcome and safe.\n\n## Reporting problems\n\nSome Google open source projects may adopt a project-specific code of conduct.\nIn those cases, a Google employee will be identified as the Project Steward,\nwho will receive and handle reports of code of conduct violations. In the event\nthat a project hasnâ€™t identified a Project Steward, you can report problems by\nemailing opensource@google.com.\n\nWe will investigate every complaint, but you may not receive a direct response.\nWe will use our discretion in determining when and how to follow up on reported\nincidents, which may range from not taking action to permanent expulsion from\nthe project and project-sponsored spaces. We will notify the accused of the\nreport and provide them an opportunity to discuss it before any action is\ntaken. The identity of the reporter will be omitted from the details of the\nreport supplied to the accused. In potentially harmful situations, such as\nongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may take action without\nnotice.\n\n*This document was adapted from the [IndieWeb Code of Conduct][] and can also\nbe found at <https://opensource.google/conduct/>.*\n\n[IndieWeb Code of Conduct]: https://indieweb.org/code-of-conduct\n"
