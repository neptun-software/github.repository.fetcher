The PMC will lean towards developer community support, to help discovery and initial steps towards incubation in the external repository. Incubator Projects could graduate if they meet the following requirements.\n\n * Require 3+1 vote from the PMC.\n * Used successfully in production by at least three independent end users which, in the PMC judgement, are of adequate quality and scope.\n * Have a healthy number of committers.\n\n# Docs\n\n[User Guide for Connect 中文版](./docs/connect/cn/README.md)\n\n# Graduated Projects\n\n### [RocketMQ Client CPP](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-cpp)\n\n### [RocketMQ Client Python](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-python)\n\n### [RocketMQ Spring](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-spring)\n\n### [RocketMQ Client Go](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-go)\n\n\n# Incubator Projects\n\n## [RocketMQ Dashboard](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-dashboard)\n**Notice**: Console has renamed to dashboard and transfered the new repo, it will graduate in the near future, and welcome you to fill in the user due diligence.\n\n## [RocketMQ MQTT](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-mqtt)\nA new MQTT protocol architecture model, based on which RocketMQ can better support messages from terminals such as IoT devices and Mobile APP. Based on the RocketMQ message unified storage engine, it supports both MQTT terminal and server message sending and receiving.\n\n## [RocketMQ-Flink](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-flink)\n**Notice**: The project has transfered the new repo and will be removed from this repo, it will graduate in the near future, and welcome you to fill in the user due diligence.\n\n## [RocketMQ Streams](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-streams)\n\n\n## [RocketMQ Operator](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-operator)\nDeploys RocketMQ on Kubernetes. it is built using the Operator SDK, which is part of the Operator Framework and hosted on [OperatorHub](https://operatorhub.io/operator/rocketmq-operator)\n\n## [RocketMQ Client Nodejs](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-client-nodejs)\n\n\n## [RocketMQ-Docker](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-docker)\nProvides Dockerfile and bash scripts for building and running docker image.\n\n## [RocketMQ-Exporter](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-exporter)\nExports metrics from RocketMQ servers for consumption by Prometheus.\n\n## [RocketMQ-Connect](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-connect)\nRocketMQ connector, connect everything.\n\n## RocketMQ-Flume\nFlume RocketMQ source and sink implementation.\n\n## RocketMQ-Spark\n\nIntegration of Apache Spark and Apache RocketMQ. Both push & pull consumers are provided. For more details please refer to [README](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-externals/tree/master/rocketmq-spark).\n\n## RocketMQ-JMS\nRocketMQ's JMS 1.1 spec. implementation.\n\n## RocketMQ-MySQL\nThis project is a data replicator between MySQL and other systems. For more details please refer to [README](https://github.com/apache/rocketmq-externals/tree/master/rocketmq-mysql).\n\n\n## Others\n[RocketMQ-OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/tree/main/instrumentation/rocketmq), [RocketMQ-Ignite](https://github.com/apache/ignite-extensions/tree/master/modules/rocketmq-ext) and [RocketMQ-Storm](https://github.com/apache/storm/tree/master/external/storm-rocketmq) integration can be found in those repositories.\n\n## Contribution\n\nWe are always very happy to have contributions, whether for trivial cleanups or big new features. We want to have high quality, well documented codes for each programming language, as well as the surrounding ecosystem of integration tools that people use with RocketMQ.\n\nNor is code the only way to contribute to the project. We strongly value documentation, integration with other project, and gladly accept improvements for these aspects.\n\nMore info please refer to [How To Contribute](http://rocketmq.apache.org/docs/how-to-contribute/).\n"
