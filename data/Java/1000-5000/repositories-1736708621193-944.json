By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report\nunacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.\n\n== Proposal for New Entries\nIf you are maintaining an open source component, you can suggest the addition of a new\nentry using a dedicated issue (Make sure to choose \"New Entry Proposal\"). If you are a\nuser of the component, please reach out to the team maintaining it.\n\nNew entries have to be discussed first via the dedicated template so please do not open a\nPull Request as a first step.\n\n== Using GitHub issues\nWe use GitHub issues to track bugs and enhancements. If you have a general usage question\nplease ask on https://stackoverflow.com[Stack Overflow] or join us on the\nhttps://gitter.im/spring-io/initializr[Gitter channel].\n\n== Sign the Contributor License Agreement\nBefore we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to\nhttps://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[sign the Contributor License Agreement].\nSigning the contributor's agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main\nrepository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an\nauthor credit if we do.  Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and\ngiven the ability to merge pull requests.\n\n== Code Conventions and Housekeeping\nNone of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be\nadded after the original pull request but before a merge.\n\n* Use the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/Spring-Framework-Code-Style[Spring Framework code format conventions].\n* Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an\n  `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is\n  for.\n* Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files\n  in the project)\n* Add yourself as an `@author` to the .java files that you modify substantially (more\n  than cosmetic changes).\n* Add some Javadocs and, if you change the namespace, some XSD doc elements.\n* A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.\n* If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current `main` (or\n  other target branch in the original project).\n* When writing a commit message please follow https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html[these conventions],\n  if you are fixing an existing issue please add `Fixes gh-XXXX` at the end of the commit\n  message (where XXXX is the issue number).\n\n== Working with the Code\n\n=== Building from Source\nstart.spring.io can be build from the command line using\nhttps://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Apache Maven] on JDK 17 or above.\nWe include '`Maven Wrapper`' scripts (`./mvnw` or `mvnw.bat`) that you can run rather\nthan needing to install Maven locally.\n\n==== Default Build\nThe project can be built from the root directory using the standard Maven command:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n\t$ ./mvnw clean install\n----\n\nTo start the site locally, execute the following command:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ cd start-site\n    $ ../mvnw spring-boot:run\n----\n"

The following modules are available:\n\n* `start-client`: client-side assets\n* `start-site`: server infrastructure and metadata configuration\n* `start-site-verification`: tests to verify the validity of the metadata\n\n[[using]]\n== Using\nThere is a link:USING.adoc[dedicated page] that describes how you can interact with the\nservice.\n\n\n\n[[build]]\n== Building from Source\n\nYou need Java 17 and a bash-like shell.\n\n[[building]]\n=== Building\n\nInvoke the build at the root of the project\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ ./mvnw clean install\n----\n\nThe project also includes a number of longer-running verification tests. They\ncan be built and run using the `verification` profile:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ ./mvnw -Pverification clean install\n----\n\nThe project's other tests are not included in the `verification` profile. All of\nthe project's tests can be run using the `full` profile:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ ./mvnw -Pfull clean install\n----\n\nIf building `start-client` fails, you may have an outdated cache that can be deleted as\nfollows:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ cd start-client\n    $ rm -rf .cache node_modules\n----\n\n\n\n[[run-app]]\n=== Running the app locally\nAs long as you've built the project beforehand (in particular `start-client`), you can\neasily start the app as any other Spring Boot app:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ cd start-site\n    $ ../mvnw spring-boot:run\n----\n\n[[run-ide]]\n=== Running the app in an IDE\nYou should be able to import the project into your IDE with no problems. Once there you\ncan run the `StartApplication` from its main method and debug it. If you also need to\nwork on the library, adding the `initializr` project in your workspace would make sure\nto reload the app whenever you make any change.\n\nThis is the recommended way to operate while you are developing the application,\nespecially the UI.\n\n== Reusing the Web UI\nThis instance has a thin layer with our opinions about getting started with Spring Boot.\nYou can reuse them but please keep in mind that this is not supported with the same\nlevel as the Spring Initializr library. The Web UI, in particular, is for our own\npurpose and is not particularly engineered to be easily extended.\n\n\n\n== Deploying to Cloud Foundry\n\nIf you are on a Mac and using https://brew.sh/[homebrew], install the Cloud Foundry\nCLI:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ brew install cloudfoundry-cli\n----\n\nAlternatively, download a suitable binary for your platform from\nhttps://console.run.pivotal.io/tools[Pivotal Web Services].\n\nYou should ensure that the application name and URL (name and host values) are\nsuitable for your environment before running `cf push`.\n\nFirst, make sure that you have <<building, built the application>>, then make sure first\nthat the jar has been created:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ cd start-site\n    $ ../mvnw package\n----\n\nThe project creates a regular library jar and a repackaged archive that can be used to\nstart the application with the `exec` classifier. Once the build as completed, you can\npush the application:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n    $ cf push your-start -p target/start-site-exec.jar\n----\n\n\n== License\nThe start.spring.io website is Open Source software released under the\nhttps://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html[Apache 2.0 license].\n"

          "content": "= User Guide\n\nIf you're wondering how to use https://start.spring.io or what features are available,\nthis page is for you! You'll find the various ways you can interact with the service\nand get a better insight at what you can do with it.\n\nThe service allows you to generate Spring Boot projects quickly. You can customize the\nproject to generate: the build system and packaging, the language, the packaging,\nthe coordinates, the platform version and, finally, the dependencies to add to the\nproject. Most dependencies available on https://start.spring.io are Spring Boot starters\nwhich is the recommended way to add dependencies to a Spring Boot application.\n\nYou can interact with the service using the browser at https://start.spring.io of course\nbut other options are available:\n\n* <<ides,IDEs>> with support for IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, NetBeans, and VSCode.\n* <<spring-boot-cli,The Spring Boot CLI>>.\n* <<command-line,Command-line tools>> such as cURL, HTTPie.\n\n\n\n[[getting-started]]\n== Getting Started\nLet's create a project and discover the various options that you can use to tune it.\nGo to https://start.spring.io, change the `Group` field from \"com.example\" to \"org.acme\"\nand click on \"Add Dependencies\". This opens a pop-up where you can search for dependencies\nto add. If you type \"web\", you will see a list of matching choices with that simple\ncriteria. Use the mouse or the arrow keys and `Enter` to select the \"Spring Web\" starter.\n\nYour browser should now be in this state:\n\nimage::using-web-ui.png[Browser,1200, 720]\n\nNOTE: The Spring Boot version above probably doesn't match the one you have. The service\nis continuously updated as new Spring Boot versions are published and it uses the latest\nGA version by default.\n\nClick on \"Generate\", this downloads a zip file containing a Maven project with the\nfollowing structure:\n\n[source]\n----\n.gitignore\nHELP.md\nmvnw\nmvnw.cmd\npom.xml\nsrc\n├── main\n│ ├── java\n│ │ └── org\n│ │     └── acme\n│ │         └── DemoApplication.java\n│ └── resources\n│     ├── application.properties\n│     ├── static\n│     └── templates\n└── test\n    └── java\n        └── org\n            └── acme\n                └── DemoApplicationTests.java\n----\n\nA typical project contains a Spring Boot application (`DemoApplication`), a test and an\nempty configuration. If you run the `main` method of `DemoApplication`, you'll see an\n\"empty\" spring boot app starting on `localhost:8080`.\n\nBased on your selection, a `HELP.md` document contains links to documentation and\nsamples you can use to learn more about the dependencies you have selected.\n\nBecause the conventions have detected it is a web application, the `static` and\n`templates` directories have been created to hold your static resources and UI templates.\n\nAlso, a Maven wrapper is automatically included so that you don't have to install Maven to\nrun this project (you can build it with `./mvnw install`). If you prefer, you can select\nGradle instead in the first option at the top of the screen. This will generate a\nGradle-based project that also contains a wrapper which can be used if you don't have\nGradle installed (build it with `./gradlew build`).\n\n\n\n[[getting-started-other-options]]\n=== Other options\nBesides the build system, language and Spring Boot generation, the service exposes a\nnumber of additional options:\n\n* *Group*: project coordinates (id of the project's group, as referred by the `groupId`\nattribute in Apache Maven). Also infers the root package name to use.\n* *Artifact*: project coordinates (id of the artifact, as referred by the `artifactId`\nattribute in Apache Maven). Also infers the name of the project\n* *Name*: display name of the project that also determines the name of your Spring Boot\napplication. For instance, if the name of your project is `my-app`, the generated project\nwill have a `MyAppApplication` class\n* *Description*: description of the project\n* *Package Name*: root package of the project. If not specified, the value of the *Group*\nattribute is used\n* *Packaging*: project packaging (as referred by the concept of the same name in Apache\nMaven). start.spring.io can generate jar or war projects\n* *Java*: the Java version to use\n\n\n\n[[getting-started-dependencies]]\n=== Dependencies\nThe UI allows you to select the Spring Boot version you want to use. You may want to be\nconservative and keep the default which corresponds at all times to the latest stable\nrelease. Or you may want to choose a milestone or snapshot of the next major\nversion. Either way, you'll notice that certain dependencies become available and others\naren't anymore when you change the version.\n\nIf you search for a dependency that you know to be available and you get a disabled\npanel, it indicates that you cannot use it with the currently selected Spring Boot\nversion:\n\n[source]\n----\nRequires Spring Boot >=3.0.0 and <3.2.0-M1\n----\n\nConcretely, this defines a \"version range\" that states the dependency is deprecated and is\nno longer available as of Spring Boot 3.2. You may want to check the release notes of the\nrelated project to understand what your migration path can be. Alternatively, the message\ncould be:\n\n[source]\n----\nRequires Spring Boot >=3.2.0\n----\n\nThat version range means the dependency is not available with the selected Spring Boot\ngeneration. If you select Spring Boot 3.2 (or later if available), you'll be\nable to select that dependency.\n\n\n\n[[sharing]]\n== Tuning default values\nThe service is configured with default values so that you can generate a new project with\nminimum fuss. Maybe you are a Kotlin fan? Or a Gradle fan? Currently,\nstart.spring.io defaults to Java and Maven but it also allows you to tune these defaults\neasily. If you are writing a tutorial that requires certain dependencies to be selected,\nyou can also generate a link that you can use as a reference.\n\nTo use this feature, simply use the UI like you would do to create a new project. Once\nyou're done, click the \"Share\" button. A pop-up opens with a generated link with a handy\n\"copy\" button to copy the link to your clipboard.\n\nThe link contains all settings that are available on start.spring.io. You can shorten it\nby removing any attribute that you don't want to enforce. For instance, here is a link\nthat only changes the `groupId`:\n\n[source]\n----\nhttps://start.spring.io/#!groupId=org.acme.test\n----\n\nIf you copy/paste the link above in your browser, you'll end up on start.spring.io with\nthe usual UI except that the `Group` field is not equal to the usual `com.example`\ndefault.\n\nNOTE: Any value that is not specified in the link will use whatever default is applicable\nonce the link is used. If you want to enforce certain values, make sure they are part of\nthe link.\n\nNOTE: If the Spring Boot version is outdated, the UI will request you to make a choice\nand select a supported version.\n\n\n\n[[ides]]\n== IDEs support\nYou can generate a project with start.spring.io using all major Java IDEs. This lets you\ncreate and import new projects without having to leave the IDE.\n\nThe following IDEs have dedicated support:\n\n* Eclipse/STS\n* IntelliJ IDEA (Ultimate Edition)\n* NetBeans, using the https://plugins.netbeans.org/plugin/67888/nb-springboot[NB SpringBoot plugin])\n* Microsoft VSCode, using the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-spring-initializr[Spring Initializr Java Support].\n\nRefer to the documentation of your favorite IDE for more details.\n\n\n\n[[spring-boot-cli]]\n== Spring Boot CLI support\nThe `spring` command line tool defines an `init` command that allows you to create a\nproject using Spring Initializr. It defaults to start.spring.io.\n\nCheck https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/cli/index.html[the documentation for more details].\n\n\n\n[[command-line]]\n== Command line support\nYou can also generate a project in a shell using `cURL` or `HTTPie`. To discover the\navailable options of a particular instance, simply \"curl it\". If you have `curl`\ninstalled invoke the following:\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n\t$ curl https://start.spring.io\n----\n\nAlternatively, if you prefer `HTTPie`, you can discover the available options as follows:\n\n\n[indent=0]\n----\n\t$ http https://start.spring.io\n----\n\nThe result is a textual representation of the capabilities of the service that are split\nin three sections:\n\nFirst, a table that describes the available project types. On start.spring.io you can\ngenerate a Maven or Gradle project.\n\nThen, a table that describes the available parameters. For the most part, these are the\nsame options as the ones available in the web UI. There are, however, a few additional\nones:\n\n* `applicationName` can be used to define the name of the application, disabling the\nalgorithm that infer it based on the `name` parameter\n* `baseDir` can be used to create a base directory in the archive so that you can extract\nthe generated zip without creating a directory for it first\n\nFinally, the list of dependencies are defined. Each entry provides the identifier that\nyou'll have to use if you want to select the dependency, a description and the Spring Boot\nversion range, if any.\n\nAlongside the capabilities of the service, you'll also find a few examples that help you\nunderstand how you can generate a project. These are obviously tailored to the client that\nyou are using.\n\nLet's assume that you want to generate a \"my-project.zip\" project based on Spring Boot\n`3.0.8`, using the `web` and `devtools` dependencies (remember, those two ids are\ndisplayed in the capabilities of the service):\n\n[source]\n----\n$ curl https://start.spring.io/starter.zip -d dependencies=web,devtools \\\n           -d bootVersion=3.0.8 -o my-project.zip\n----\n\nIf you extract `my-project.zip`, you'll notice a few differences compared to what happens\nwith the web UI:\n\n* The project will be extracted in the current directory (the web UI adds a base directory\nautomatically with the same name as the one of the project)\n* The name of the project is not `my-project` (the `-o` parameter has no impact on the\nname of the project)\n\nThe exact same project can be generated using the `http` command as well:\n\n[source]\n----\n$ http https://start.spring.io/starter.zip dependencies==web,devtools \\\n           bootVersion==3.0.8 -d\n----\n\nNOTE: `HTTPie` reads the same hint as the browser, so it will store a `demo.zip` file in\nthe current directory with the same differences as discussed above.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
