THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.\n\nBY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n\n1. Definitions\na. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.\nb. \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.\nc. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work through sale or other transfer of ownership.\nd. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\ne. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\nf. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\ng. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.\nh. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or images.\ni. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic medium.\n2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\na. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections; and,\nb. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections.\nc. For the avoidance of doubt:\ni. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\nii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\niii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\nThe above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise you have no rights to make Adaptations. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n\n4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\na. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\nb. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work. The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.\nc. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\n5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\nUNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n7. Termination\na. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.\nb. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.\n8. Miscellaneous\na. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\nb. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\nc. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\nd. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.\ne. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.\nCreative Commons Notice\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.\n\nExcept for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative Commons' then-current trademark usage guidelines, as may be published on its website or otherwise made available upon request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction does not form part of this License.\n\nCreative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/.\n\n"

JDK: 17\n2. 我们采用最新稳定版Android Studio及对应的gradle进行开发，对于旧版本的IDE，我们没有测试，编译之类问题，需自行解决。\n\n##  关于 debug 版 apk 可能不能进行音视频通话的特殊说明\n1. 关闭混淆时，命令行下，通过`./gradlew clean aDebug` 或 Android Studio 里面，通过 `Build App Bundle(s)/APK(s) -> Build APK(s)` 生成的 debug 版本 apk，不支持音视频通话，具体原因请参考[useFullClasspathForDexingTransform](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/333107832)\n2. 开启混淆，debug 版 apk 一切正常，将`chat/build.gradle#buildTypes#debug#minifyEnabled`置为 true，即为 debug 版也开启混淆\n3. 命令行下，通过`./gradlew clean aR`或 Android Studio 里面，通过`Generate Signed App Bundle/APK...`可生成 release 版 apk，release 版 apk，一切正常\n\n## 二次开发说明\n野火IM采用bugly作为日志手机工具，大家二次开发时，务必将```MyApp.java```中的 ```bugly id``` 替换为你们自己的，否则错误日志都跑我们这儿来了，你们收集不到错误日志，我们也会受到干扰。\n\n## 混淆说明\n1. 确保所依赖的```lifecycle```版本在2.2.0或以上。\n2. 参考```chat/proguard-rules.pro```进行配置。\n\n## 安全说明\n为了方便开发者部署、测试，默认允许`HTTP`进行网络请求，为了提高安全性，上线之前，请进行以下操作：\n1. 为`app-server`配置`HTTPS`支持，并将`APP_SERVER_ADDRESS`配置为`HTTPS`地址\n2. 如果支持开放平台的话，为开发平台配置`HTTPS`支持，并将`WORKSPACE_URL`配置为`HTTPS`地址\n3. 如果支持组织结构的话，为组织结构服务配置`HTTPS`支持，并将`ORG_SERVER_ADDRESS`配置为`HTTPS`地址\n4. 将`AndroidManifest.xml`里面的`usesCleartextTraffic`置为`false`\n\n## 敏感权限说明\n1. `android.permission.PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS`，音视频通话时，允许普通电话打断音视频通话\n2. `android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`，允许音视频通话窗口最小化，并悬浮在其他窗口之上\n3. `android.permission.BLUETOOTH`、`android.permission.BLUETOOTH_ADMIN`，音视频通话时，允许使用蓝牙耳机\n\n## Android 4.x 说明\n请使用[api-19](https://github.com/wildfirechat/android-chat/tree/api-19)分支，如果编译失败等，可能是4.x版本的协议栈版本没有及时更新所导致，请微信联系 `wfchat` 进行更新。\n\n### 联系我们\n\n> 商务合作请优先采用邮箱和我们联系。技术问题请到[野火IM论坛](http://bbs.wildfirechat.cn/)发帖交流。\n\n1. heavyrain.lee  邮箱: heavyrain.lee@wildfirechat.cn  微信：wildfirechat\n2. imndx  邮箱: imndx@wildfirechat.cn  微信：wfchat\n\n### 问题交流\n\n1. 如果大家发现bug，请在GitHub提issue\n2. 其他问题，请到[野火IM论坛](http://bbs.wildfirechat.cn/)进行交流学习\n3. 微信公众号\n\n<img src=\"http://static.wildfirechat.cn/wx_wfc_qrcode.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n> 强烈建议关注我们的公众号。我们有新版本发布或者有重大更新会通过公众号通知大家，另外我们也会不定期的发布一些关于野火IM的技术介绍。\n\n## 体验Demo\n我们提供了体验demo，请使用微信扫码下载安装体验\n\n![野火IM](http://static.wildfirechat.cn/download_qrcode.png)\n\n## 应用截图\n[点击查看 Android Demo 视频演示](https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-live.mp4)\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-1.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-2.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-3.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-4.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-5.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-6.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-7.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-8.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-9.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-10.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-11.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-12.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-13.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-14.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-15.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-16.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-17.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-18.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n<img src=\"https://static.wildfirechat.cn/wf-android-demo-19.jpg\" width = 40% height = 40% />\n\n\n## 集成\n1. client部分，自行下载代码，并将client module引入你们自己的项目。\n2. uikit部分，自行下载代码，并将uikit module引入你们自己的项目。\n3. push部分，自行下载代码，将push module引入你们自己的项目。\n\n## 推送\n当应用在后台后，不同手机厂家有着不同的后台策略，可能很快或者最终会被冻结和杀掉，此时收到消息需要厂商的推送通知服务。请部署推送服务，推送服务代码可以在[Github](https://github.com/wildfirechat/push_server)和[码云](https://gitee.com/wfchat/push_server)下载。具体使用方式，请参考推送服务项目上的说明。\n\n## 贡献\n欢迎提交pull request，一起打造一个更好的开源IM。\n\n## 鸣谢\n1.
