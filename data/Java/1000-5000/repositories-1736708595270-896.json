          "content": "zkui - Zookeeper UI Dashboard\n====================\nA UI dashboard that allows CRUD operations on Zookeeper.\n\nRequirements\n====================\nRequires Java 7 to run.\n\nSetup\n====================\n1. mvn clean install\n2. Copy the config.cfg to the folder with the jar file. Modify it to point to the zookeeper instance. Multiple zk instances are coma separated.  eg: server1:2181,server2:2181. First server should always be the leader.\n3. Run the jar. ( nohup java -jar zkui-2.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar & )\n4. <a href=\"http://localhost:9090\">http://localhost:9090</a> \n\nLogin Info\n====================\nusername: admin, pwd: manager (Admin privileges, CRUD operations supported)\nusername: appconfig, pwd: appconfig (Readonly privileges, Read operations supported)\n\nYou can change this in the config.cfg\n\nTechnology Stack\n====================\n1. Embedded Jetty Server.\n2. Freemarker template.\n3. H2 DB.\n4. Active JDBC.\n5. JSON.\n6. SLF4J.\n7. Zookeeper.\n8. Apache Commons File upload.\n9. Bootstrap.\n10. Jquery.\n11. Flyway DB migration.\n\nFeatures\n====================\n1. CRUD operation on zookeeper properties.\n2. Export properties.\n3. Import properties via call back url.\n4. Import properties via file upload.\n5. History of changes + Path specific history of changes.\n6. Search feature.\n7. Rest API for accessing Zookeeper properties.\n8. Basic Role based authentication.\n9. LDAP authentication supported.\n10. Root node /zookeeper hidden for safety.\n11. ACL supported global level.\n\nImport File Format\n====================\n# add property\n/appconfig/path=property=value\n# remove a property\n-/path/property\n\nYou can either upload a file or specify a http url of the version control system that way all your zookeeper changes will be in version control. \n\nExport File Format\n====================\n/appconfig/path=property=value\n\nYou can export a file and then use the same format to import.\n\nSOPA/PIPA BLACKLISTED VALUE\n====================\nAll password will be displayed as SOPA/PIPA BLACKLISTED VALUE for a normal user. Admins will be able to view and edit the actual value upon login.\nPassword will be not shown on search / export / view for normal user.\nFor a property to be eligible for black listing it should have (PWD / pwd / PASSWORD / password) in the property name.\n\nLDAP\n====================\nIf you want to use LDAP authentication provide the ldap url. This will take precedence over roleSet property file authentication.\nldapUrl=ldap://<ldap_host>:<ldap_port>/dc=mycom,dc=com\nIf you dont provide this then default roleSet file authentication will be used.\n\nREST call\n====================\nA lot of times you require your shell scripts to be able to read properties from zookeeper. This can now be achieved with a http call. Password are not exposed via rest api for security reasons. The rest call is a read only operation requiring no authentication.\n\nEg:\nhttp://localhost:9090/acd/appconfig?propNames=foo&host=myhost.com\nThis will first lookup the host name under /appconfig/hosts and then find out which path the host point to. Then it will look for the property under that path.\n\nThere are 2 additional properties that can be added to give better control.\ncluster=cluster1\nhttp://localhost:9090/acd/appconfig?propNames=foo&cluster=cluster1&host=myhost.com\nIn this case the lookup will happen on lookup path + cluster1.\n\napp=myapp\nhttp://localhost:9090/acd/appconfig?propNames=foo&app=myapp&host=myhost.com\nIn this case the lookup will happen on lookup path + myapp.\n\nA shell script will call this via\nMY_PROPERTY=\"$(curl -f -s -S -k \"http://localhost:9090/acd/appconfig?propNames=foo&host=`hostname -f`\" | cut -d '=' -f 2)\"\necho $MY_PROPERTY\n\nStandardization\n====================\nZookeeper doesnt enforce any order in which properties are stored and retrieved. ZKUI however organizes properties in the following manner for easy lookup.\nEach server/box has its hostname listed under /appconfig/hosts and that points to the path where properties reside for that path. So when the lookup for a property occurs over a rest call it first finds the hostname entry under /appconfig/hosts and then looks for that property in the location mentioned.\neg: /appconfig/hosts/myserver.com=/appconfig/dev/app1 \nThis means that when myserver.com tries to lookup the propery it looks under /appconfig/dev/app1\n\nYou can also append app name to make lookup easy.\neg: /appconfig/hosts/myserver.com:testapp=/appconfig/dev/test/app1 \neg: /appconfig/hosts/myserver.com:prodapp=/appconfig/dev/prod/app1\n\nLookup can be done by grouping of app and cluster. A cluster can have many apps under it. When the bootloader entry looks like this /appconfig/hosts/myserver.com=/appconfig/dev the rest lookup happens on the following paths.\n/appconfig/dev/..\n/appconfig/dev/hostname..\n/appconfig/dev/app..\n/appconfig/dev/cluster..\n/appconfig/dev/cluster/app..\n\nThis standardization is only needed if you choose to use the rest lookup. You can use zkui to update properties in general without worry about this organizing structure.\n\nHTTPS\n====================\nYou can enable https if needed. \nkeytool -keystore keystore -alias jetty -genkey -keyalg RSA\n\n\nLimitations\n====================\n1. ACLs are fully supported but at a global level.\n\nScreenshots\n====================\nBasic Role Based Authentication\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/DeemOpen/zkui/master/images/zkui-0.png\"/>\n<br/>\n\nDashboard Console\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/DeemOpen/zkui/master/images/zkui-1.png\"/>\n<br/>\n\nCRUD Operations\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/DeemOpen/zkui/master/images/zkui-2.png\"/>\n<br/>\n\nImport Feature\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/DeemOpen/zkui/master/images/zkui-3.png\"/>\n<br/>\n\nTrack History of changes\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/DeemOpen/zkui/master/images/zkui-4.png\"/>\n<br/>\n\nStatus of Zookeeper Servers\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.github.com/DeemOpen/zkui/master/images/zkui-5.png\"/>\n<br/>\n\nLicense & Contribution\n====================\n\nZKUI is released under the Apache 2.0 license.
