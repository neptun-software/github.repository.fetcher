[通过一次读者反馈，引出对 AspectJ 的介绍](https://github.com/fuzhengwei/small-spring/issues/4)\n\n- **加群交流**\n\n    本群的宗旨是给大家提供一个良好的技术学习交流平台，所以杜绝一切广告！由于微信群人满 100 之后无法加入，请扫描下方二维码先添加作者 “小傅哥” 微信(fustack)，备注：`Spring学习加群`。\n    \n    <img src=\"https://bugstack.cn/images/personal/fustack.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"/>\n\n- **公众号(bugstack虫洞栈)**\n\n    沉淀、分享、成长，专注于原创专题案例，以最易学习编程的方式分享知识，让自己和他人都能有所收获。目前已完成的专题有；Netty4.x实战专题案例、用Java实现JVM、基于JavaAgent的全链路监控、手写RPC框架、DDD专题案例、源码分析等。\n    \n    <img src=\"https://bugstack.cn/images/personal/qrcode.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\"/>\n\n## :tulip: 参考资料\n\n在资料整理的过程中，发现了两个非常优秀的手写 Spring 框架源码，tiny-spring、mini-spring，这两个简化版的Spring框架都实现了一个非常易懂、易学、易上手的源码教程，如果你已经有了一定的基础，那么可以直接阅读源码学习。地址：\n\n- https://github.com/code4craft/tiny-spring\n- https://github.com/DerekYRC/mini-spring\n"
