If you would like to contribute something, \nor simply want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.\n\n### Sign the Contributor License Agreement\nBefore we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to\nsign the Contributor License Agreement. Signing the contributor’s agreement\ndoes not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean\nthat we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if\nwe do. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given\nthe ability to merge pull requests.\n\n### Code Conventions\nNone of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.\n\n1. we provided a [code formatter file](./tools/codestyle/formatter.xml), it \nwill formatting automatically your project when during process of building.\n\n2. Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment\nwith at least an `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a\nparagraph on what the class is for.\n\n3. Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from \nexisting files in the project)\n\n4. Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.java` files that you modify \nsubstantially (more than cosmetic changes).\n\n5. Add some Javadocs.\n\n6. A few unit tests would help a lot as well — someone has to do it.\n\n7. When writing a commit message please follow [these conventions](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html),\nif you are fixing an existing issue please add Fixes gh-XXXX at the end of the commit message (where XXXX is the issue number)."

In Ant Financial, SOFARPC has been used for more than ten years and developing for five generations. SOFARPC is dedicated to simplify RPC calls between applications, and provide convenient, no code intrusion, stable, and efficient point-to-point remote service invocation solutions for applications. For user and developer easy to improve features, SOFARPC provides a wealth of model abstraction and extensible interfaces, including filter, routing, load balancing, and so on. At the same time, it provides a rich MicroService governance solution around the SOFARPC framework and its surrounding components.\n\n![SOFARPC Architecture](./resource/sofa-rpc-architecture.png)\n\n## Features\n\n- No code intrusion, high-performance remote service call\n- Supports multiple service routing and load balancing policies\n- Supports multiple service registries\n- Supports multiple protocols\n- Supports multiple invoke type, such as synchronous, oneway, callback, generalized and more.\n- Support cluster failover, service warm-up, automatic fault tolerance\n- High extensibility for easy to improve features as needed\n\n## Related Projects\n\n- [sofa-rpc-boot-project](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc-boot-projects) SOFABoot projects for SOFARPC, include starter and samples.\n\n## Requirements\n\nBuild-time requirement: JDK 8 or above and Maven 3.2.5 or above.\n\nRuntime requirement: JDK 8 or above.\n\n\n## Documents\n\n- [Getting Started](https://www.sofastack.tech/sofa-rpc/docs/Getting-Started-With-SOFA-Boot?lang=en)\n- [User Guide](https://www.sofastack.tech/sofa-rpc/docs/Programming?lang=en)\n- [Developer Guide](https://www.sofastack.tech/sofa-rpc/docs/How-To-Build?lang=en)\n- [Release Notes](https://www.sofastack.tech/sofa-rpc/docs/ReleaseNotes?lang=en)\n- [Road Map](https://www.sofastack.tech/sofa-rpc/docs/RoadMap?lang=en)\n\n## Contribution \n\n[How to Contributing](https://www.sofastack.tech/sofa-rpc/docs/Contributing?lang=en)\n\n## Contact Us\n\n- **DingTalk Group**\n\n  <img alt=\"DingTalk\" src=\"https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/sofastack/afts/img/A*1DklS7SZFNMAAAAAAAAAAAAAARQnAQ\" height=\"250\" width=\"250\">\n\n## License\n\nSOFARPC is licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-rpc/blob/master/LICENSE), and SOFARPC uses some third-party components, you can view their open source license here [NOTICE](https://www.sofastack.tech/sofa-rpc/docs/NOTICE?lang=en).\n"

You are also urged to recommend the way to reproduce and replicate the issue. The SOFAStack community will get back to you after assessing and analysing the findings.\n\nPLEASE PAY ATTENTION to report the security issue on the security email before disclosing it on public domain.\n\n## Solution\n\nSOFARPC uses Hessian serialization by default. Hessian is a binary serialization protocol. For more information, please refer to Hessian's [documentation](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-hessian).\n\nBecause of the implement of Hessian, by constructing a specific serialization stream, it may cause arbitrary code execution when doing deserialization. It is recommended that users configure blacklist to solve the problem.\n\nSOFARPC also provides a way to configure blacklists in `BlackListFileLoader`, you can override the blacklist configuration based on the code.\n\nThe blacklist built into the project comes from internal practices and external contributions, and is for reference only and is not actively updated, we do not assume any legal responsibility for this."
