You will see many warnings and errors because unit tests validate error conditions.\nAs long as the final result is BUILD SUCCESS, then the tests have passed.\n```\nmvn -f javamelody-core test\n...\nBUILD SUCCESS\n```\n* Push your changes and send a pull request.\n```\ngit push origin\n```\n\nWhen submitting code, please follow existing [conventions and style](../../wiki/DevGuide#development) in order to keep the code as readable as possible.\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing your code, you agree to license your contribution under the terms of the [ASL](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n\nAll files are released with the Apache 2.0 license.\n\nIf you are adding a new file it should have a header like this:\n\n```\n/*\n * Copyright 2008-2019 by Emeric Vernat\n *\n *     This file is part of Java Melody.\n *\n * Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n * you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n * You may obtain a copy of the License at\n *\n *     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n *\n * Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n * distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n * WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n * See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n * limitations under the License.\n */\n```\n"
