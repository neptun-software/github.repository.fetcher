Before we can take them, we\nhave to jump a couple of legal hurdles.\n\nPlease fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement\n(CLA).\n\n  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you\n    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an\n    [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).\n  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,\n    then you'll need to sign a\n    [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).\n\nFollow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and\ninstructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to\naccept your pull requests.\n\n## Contributing a Patch\n\n1. Sign a Contributor License Agreement, if you have not yet done so (see\n   details above).\n1. Create your change to the repo in question.\n    * Fork the desired repo, develop and test your code changes.\n    * Ensure that your code is clear and comprehensible.\n    * Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.\n1. Submit a pull request.\n1. The repo owner will review your request. If it is approved, the change will\n   be merged. If it needs additional work, the repo owner will respond with\n   useful comments.\n\n## Contributing a New Sample App\n\n1. Sign a Contributor License Agreement, if you have not yet done so (see\n   details above).\n1. Create your own repo for your app following this naming convention:\n    * mirror-{app-name}-{language or platform}\n    * apps: quickstart, photohunt-server, photohunt-client\n    * example:  mirror-quickstart-android\n    * For multi-language apps, concatenate the primary languages like this:\n      mirror-photohunt-server-java-python.\n\n1. Create your sample app in this repo.\n    * Be sure to clone the README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md and LICENSE files from the\n      googlecast repo.\n    * Ensure that your code is clear and comprehensible.\n    * Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of unit tests which all pass.\n    * Instructional value is the top priority when evaluating new app proposals for\n      this collection of repos.\n1. Submit a request to fork your repo in googlesamples organization.\n1. The repo owner will review your request. If it is approved, the sample will\n   be merged. If it needs additional work, the repo owner will respond with\n   useful comments.\n"
