It is very easy to use and there are **plenty of customization options** available to change the functionality and look-and-feel of this view to match your needs.\n\nIt also **supports RxJava 2 view bindings**, so if you are a fan of reactive programming (just like me), you can get a stream of updates as the user draws the pattern.\n\n![PatternLockView](https://github.com/aritraroy/PatternLockView/blob/master/screenshots/pattern_lock_view_small.gif?raw=true) ![PatternLockView](https://github.com/aritraroy/PatternLockView/blob/master/screenshots/pattern_lock_view_2_small.gif?raw=true)\n\n\n# Download\n\nThis library is available in **jCenter** which is the default Maven repository used in Android Studio.\n\n## Gradle \n```gradle\ndependencies {\n    // other dependencies here\n    \n    compile 'com.andrognito.patternlockview:patternlockview:1.0.0'\n    // Optional, for RxJava2 adapter\n    compile 'com.andrognito.patternlockview:patternlockview-reactive:1.0.0'\n}\n```\n\n### Spread Some :heart:\n[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/aritraroy/PatternLockView.svg?style=social&label=Star)](https://github.com/aritraroy) [![GitHub followers](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/aritraroy.svg?style=social&label=Follow)](https://github.com/aritraroy)  \n[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/aritraroy.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/aritraroy) \n\n\n# Usage\nWe recommend you to check the [sample project](https://github.com/aritraroy/PatternLockView/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/andrognito/patternlockdemo/MainActivity.java) to get a complete understanding of the library. The step-by-step implementation guide is as follows.\n\n### Step 1\n\nPlace the view in your XML layout file.\n\n```xml\n    <com.andrognito.patternlockview.PatternLockView\n        android:id=\"@+id/pattern_lock_view\"\n        android:layout_width=\"280dp\"\n        android:layout_height=\"280dp\"/>\n```\n\nThis is enough to get the view rendered in your layout. But you would certainly want to add a callback listener to listen to pattern changes.\n\n### Step 2\n\nReference the view in code and add a listener to it.\n\n```java\nmPatternLockView = (PatternLockView) findViewById(R.id.pattern_lock_view);\nmPatternLockView.addPatternLockListener(mPatternLockViewListener);\n```\n\nImplement the listener interface as follows,\n\n```java\nprivate PatternLockViewListener mPatternLockViewListener = new PatternLockViewListener() {\n        @Override\n        public void onStarted() {\n            Log.d(getClass().getName(), \"Pattern drawing started\");\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onProgress(List<PatternLockView.Dot> progressPattern) {\n            Log.d(getClass().getName(), \"Pattern progress: \" +\n                    PatternLockUtils.patternToString(mPatternLockView, progressPattern));\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onComplete(List<PatternLockView.Dot> pattern) {\n            Log.d(getClass().getName(), \"Pattern complete: \" +\n                    PatternLockUtils.patternToString(mPatternLockView, pattern));\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onCleared() {\n            Log.d(getClass().getName(), \"Pattern has been cleared\");\n        }\n    };\n```\n\nAnd that's it! Your PatternLockView is ready to rock. You might also want to remove the listeners when not needed,         `removePatternLockListener(mPatternLockViewListener);`\n\n\n### Step 3 (Optional: ReactiveX Interface)\n\nFor the RxJava fanboys, this library supports RxJava 2 view bindings. You can subscribe to this view to get a stream of pattern change updates.\n\n```java\nRxPatternLockView.patternChanges(mPatternLockView)\n                .subscribe(new Consumer<PatternLockCompoundEvent>() {\n                    @Override\n                    public void accept(PatternLockCompoundEvent event) throws Exception {\n                        if (event.getEventType() == PatternLockCompoundEvent.EventType.PATTERN_STARTED) {\n                            Log.d(getClass().getName(), \"Pattern drawing started\");\n                        } else if (event.getEventType() == PatternLockCompoundEvent.EventType.PATTERN_PROGRESS) {\n                            Log.d(getClass().getName(), \"Pattern progress: \" +\n                                    PatternLockUtils.patternToString(mPatternLockView, event.getPattern()));\n                        } else if (event.getEventType() == PatternLockCompoundEvent.EventType.PATTERN_COMPLETE) {\n                            Log.d(getClass().getName(), \"Pattern complete: \" +\n                                    PatternLockUtils.patternToString(mPatternLockView, event.getPattern()));\n                        } else if (event.getEventType() == PatternLockCompoundEvent.EventType.PATTERN_CLEARED) {\n                            Log.d(getClass().getName(), \"Pattern has been cleared\");\n                        }\n                    }\n                });\n```\n\nIf you are not interested in getting the compound event, you should subscribe to `patternComplete()` and/or `patternProgress()` for the specific updates. Have a detailed look [here](https://github.com/aritraroy/PatternLockView/blob/master/patternlockview-rxadapter/src/main/java/com/andrognito/rxpatternlockview/RxPatternLockView.java).\n\n# Customization\n\nThere are several customization options available which you can use to completely change the look-and-feel and functionality of this view to match your needs.\n\n### XML (Quick and Easy)\n\nYou can add various attributes to the PatternLockView from your XML layout.\n\n```xml\n  app:dotCount=\"3\"                                        // Change the no.of dots in a row (or column)\n  app:dotNormalSize=\"12dp\"                                // Change the size of the dots in normal state\n  app:dotSelectedSize=\"24dp\"                              // Change the size of the dots in selected state\n  app:pathWidth=\"4dp\"                                     // Change the width of the path\n  app:aspectRatioEnabled=\"true\"                           // Set if the view should respect custom aspect ratio\n  app:aspectRatio=\"square\"                                // Set between \"square\", \"width_bias\", \"height_bias\"\n  app:normalStateColor=\"@color/white\"                     // Set the color of the pattern view in normal state\n  app:correctStateColor=\"@color/primary\"                  // Set the color of the pattern view in correct state\n  app:wrongStateColor=\"@color/pomegranate\"                // Set the color of the pattern view in error state     \n  app:dotAnimationDuration=\"200\"                          // Change the duration of the animating dots\n  app:pathEndAnimationDuration=\"100\"                      // Change the duration of the path end animaiton\n```\n\n### JAVA (Programatically)\n\nYou can also programatically change the properties of the view, thereby having more control over it.\n\n```java\nmPatternLockView.setViewMode(PatternLockView.PatternViewMode.CORRECT);       // Set the current viee more \nmPatternLockView.setInStealthMode(true);                                     // Set the pattern in stealth mode (pattern drawing is hidden)\nmPatternLockView.setTactileFeedbackEnabled(true);                            // Enables vibration feedback when the pattern is drawn\nmPatternLockView.setInputEnabled(false);                                     // Disables any input from the pattern lock view completely\n\nmPatternLockView.setDotCount(3);\nmPatternLockView.setDotNormalSize((int) ResourceUtils.getDimensionInPx(this, R.dimen.pattern_lock_dot_size));\nmPatternLockView.setDotSelectedSize((int) ResourceUtils.getDimensionInPx(this, R.dimen.pattern_lock_dot_selected_size));\nmPatternLockView.setPathWidth((int) ResourceUtils.getDimensionInPx(this, R.dimen.pattern_lock_path_width));\nmPatternLockView.setAspectRatioEnabled(true);\nmPatternLockView.setAspectRatio(PatternLockView.AspectRatio.ASPECT_RATIO_HEIGHT_BIAS); \nmPatternLockView.setNormalStateColor(ResourceUtils.getColor(this, R.color.white));\nmPatternLockView.setCorrectStateColor(ResourceUtils.getColor(this, R.color.primary));\nmPatternLockView.setWrongStateColor(ResourceUtils.getColor(this, R.color.pomegranate));\nmPatternLockView.setDotAnimationDuration(150);\nmPatternLockView.setPathEndAnimationDuration(100);\n\n```\n\n# Contribution\n\nThis library is inspired from AOSP's [LockPatternView](https://github.com/android/platform_frameworks_base/blob/master/core/java/com/android/internal/widget/LockPatternView.java). There are lots of improvements and customization options added so that you can get started without any hassle. If you find a bug or would like to improve any aspect of it, feel free to contribute with pull requests.\n\n\n# About The Author\n\n### Aritra Roy\n\nAndroid & Backend Developer. Blogger. Designer.
