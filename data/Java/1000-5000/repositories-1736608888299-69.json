Thank you!\n\n## Reporting a bug\n\n- Create a new issue on [the tracker](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/issues).\n- The best way to report a bug is to create a failing test case. Please see the [Contributing code](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code) section.\n\n## Proposing a new feature\n\n- It is a good idea to discuss your changes on [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/mybatis-user) to get feedback from the community.\n- If you have a patch with unit tests, send a pull request. Please see the [Contributing code](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-code) section.\n\n\n## Improving documentation\n\n- Documentations are placed under [src/site](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-3/tree/master/src/site) directory in [the xdoc format](http://maven.apache.org/doxia/references/xdoc-format.html), so it is basically the same as creating a patch to contribute documentation changes.

Fork the repository on GitHub.\n2. Clone your fork to your local machine.\n3. Create a topic branch with a descriptive name.\n4. Make changes with unit tests in the topic branch.\n5. Push commits to your fork on GitHub.\n6. Send a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).\n\nFor steps 1 to 3, please read [this GitHub help](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) if you are not familiar with these operations.  \nStep 4 and 5 are basic [git](http://git-scm.com/) operations. Please see the [online documentation](http://git-scm.com/documentation) for its usage.\n\nFor how to write a unit test, please see the [unit test](Unit-Test) page.\n"
