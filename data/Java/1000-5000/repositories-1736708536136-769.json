Once the code generated in the later stage is modified, it is difficult to merge. Think of Mybatis-Generator, which is basically a one-time thing.\n\nIn most cases, I only want to make a common interface of adding, deleting, modifying and checking for data management, similar to the following:\n![result](readme/view.png)\n![result](readme/edit.png)\n\n``` java\n@Erupt(\n       name = \"Simple example\",\n       power = @Power(importable = true, export = true)\n)\n@Table(name = \"t_simple\")   //Database table name\n@Entity\npublic class Simple extends BaseModel {\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"textInput\"),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"textInput\", notNull = true, search = @Search)\n    )\n    private String input;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"numberInput\", sortable = true),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"numberInput\", search = @Search)\n    )\n    private Float number;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"switch\"),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"switch\")\n    )\n    private Boolean bool;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"datePicker\"),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"datePicker\", search = @Search(vague = true))\n    )\n    private Date date;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"slider\"),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"slider\", type = EditType.SLIDER, search = @Search,\n                    sliderType = @SliderType(max = 90, markPoints = {0, 30, 60, 90}, dots = true))\n    )\n    private Integer slide;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"choice\"),\n            edit = @Edit(\n                    search = @Search,\n                    title = \"choice\", type = EditType.CHOICE,\n                    choiceType = @ChoiceType(fetchHandler = SqlChoiceFetchHandler.class,\n                            fetchHandlerParams = \"select id,name from e_upms_menu\"\n                    )\n            )\n    )\n    private Long choice;\n\n}\n```\n[Functional experience](https://www.erupt.xyz/#!/contrast)\n\nAlthough this interface can be roughly made with Vue + Ant Design + SSM, a closer look reveals that it has a lot of detailed functions, such as:\n\n+ can filter the data\n+ There are buttons to refresh, add and data\n+ tables have pagination and summary\n+ Preview a single row of data\n+ Batch delete\n+ hides a column\n+ Multiple components\n+ sort by some column\n+ has a non-null check\n+ Supports import and export of Excel\n\nIt takes a lot of code to implement all of this just on the front end, not to mention the interfaces and business logic on the back end.\n\nYou don't need to know Angular/React/Vue/Jquery or JavaScript/HTML/CSS or even Spring MVC/JPA/Mybatis/SQL to declare. You can guess what most of the configuration will do even if you haven't learned how to declare; all the background page development can be done with simple configuration.\n\nThis is the original intention of establishing The Restraint. For most of the commonly used pages, the simplest way should be used. There is no need to learn all kinds of frameworks and tools, so as to focus on the core business and save time to do what you like, instead of being troubled by tedious background development.\n\n## Home\nhttps://www.erupt.xyz\n\n## Intro\n+ zero front-end code, only a single file + simple annotation configuration, you can quickly develop enterprise-class Admin management background.\n+ Quickly build the full stack solution of enterprise-level middle and back office management system, provide a large number of business components, compress the r&d cycle, reduce the r&d cost.\n+ There are certain pain points in the back-end development, such as low development efficiency, unattractive interface, unsatisfactory interaction, repetitive workload, front-end code written by the back-end development, and the code generated by the code generator for the second time cannot be combined, so these problems can be easily resolved.\n+ Has a simple and beautiful background page, support 23 types of data entry components, a variety of data source support, strict security policy.\nI am not a code generator, and a code generator is not the best solution for background development. The essence of a code generator is to generate cumbersome background code. Once the code is modified, it is difficult to merge the code generated in the later period. Although it alleviates some work, the solution is not the best way.\n\n## Features\n+ **Easy to emerge** : Just understand the two annotations of @erupt and @EruptField to get started.\n+ **Code is simple** : Front-end zero code, back-end template, Controller, Service, DAO are not needed, only one entity class is needed.\n+ **Agile development** : only a single `. Java` file can achieve the background management function, focus on business and core functions of the RESEARCH and development.\n+ **Fast iteration** : Requirement changes can be made by simply modifying or adding annotation configurations faster than requirement discussions.\n+ **powerful** : dynamic condition processing, support to add, delete, change, check and other functions of proxy interface, Session storage mechanism selection, behavior logging, etc.\n+ **High security** : Reliable security mechanism, login whitelist, menu permission authentication, request header check, annotation item check, to protect your data.\n+ **Automatic table building** : Relying on JPA can help you do database table building automatically.\n+ **Non-invasive** : Does not affect the use of Spring Boot and other module functions at all.\n+ **Multiple data sources** : MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, H2, and even MongoDB.\n+ **Variety of components** : support sliding input, time selection, switch, picture upload, code editor, auto complete, tree, checkbox, map and other 23 types of components\n+ **Rich display** : ordinary text, TWO-DIMENSIONAL code, links, pictures, HTML, code segments, iframe, SWF, etc\n+ **Code generation** : Erupt code is concise enough that the code generator can further improve the development efficiency.\n+ **Strong scalability** : support custom data source implementation, custom page, custom template, custom attachment upload mechanism, etc.\n+ **Beautiful interface** : Each interaction is carefully designed and product thinking is polished for a better operating experience.\n\n## Screenshot\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td><img src=\"readme/login.png\"/></td>\n        <td><img src=\"readme/home.png\"/></td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n

[@DataProxy](https://www.yuque.com/erupts/erupt/nicqg3) 、自定义数据源、逻辑删除、LDAP、OSS。\n\n提供企业级中后台管理系统的全栈解决方案，大幅压缩研发周期，专注核心业务。\n\n完美取代 **代码生成器**，开发后台管理系统更优解决方案\n\n> 从 2020 年开始不断优化升级，目前已有上百家中小型公司使用，上千名开发者开发相关应用。上百名开发者参与提交了功能建议，30多名贡献者参与提交代码。\n\n\n## 🌈 特性 | Features\n+ **自动建表**：表结构自动生成，无需手动建表\n\n+ **易于上手**：会简单的 **Spring Boot** 基础知识即可\n\n+ **使用简单**：仅需了解 **@Erupt** 与 **@EruptField** 两个注解即可上手开发\n\n+ **代码简洁**：仅需一个 `.java` 文件, template、controller、service、dao 都不需要创建\n\n+ **功能强大**：动态条件处理，逻辑删除，LDAP，自定义登录逻辑，RedisSession，操作日志等\n\n+ **多数据源**：支持：MySQL、Oracle、SQL Server、**PostgreSQL**、H2，甚至支持 **MongoDB**\n\n+ **高扩展性**：支持自定义数据源实现、自定义登录逻辑、动态权限管理、生命周期函数、**自定义 OSS**\n\n+ **大量组件**：滑动输入、时间选择、**一对多**、图片上传、代码编辑器、自动完成、树、**多对多**、地图等23类组件\n\n+ **丰富展示**：普通文本、**二维码**、链接、图片、HTML、代码段、iframe、swf等\n\n---\n\n+ **低侵入性**：几乎所有功能都围绕注解而展开，不影响Spring Boot其他功能或三方库库的使用\n\n+ **前后端分离**：后端与前端可分开部署\n\n+ **响应式布局**：支持PC端手机端等各种规格的设备中使用\n\n+ **自定义页面**：支持自定义页面，自定义弹出层，且支持：原生H5 / Freemarker / Thymeleaf等方式渲染\n\n+ **前端零代码**：前端布局自动构建，一行前端代码都不用写\n\n+ **无需二次开发**：仅需引用 jar 包即可 ！\n\n## 🏅 代码仓库 | Git Repository\n| |  Github  | 码云 |\n|  ---- |  ----  |

https://github.com/erupts/erupt-example | https://gitee.com/erupt/erupt-example |\n\n## 🧐 为什么要做 Erupt ?\n虽然近些年来 **代码生成器** 成了后台开发的新宠，但它真的是后台开发的最优解吗？\n\n代码生成器的本质还是生成繁琐的前端与后台代码，一旦修改后期生成的代码很难合并，想想 Mybatis-Generator，基本上就是一次性的东西，虽然减轻了部分工作，可解决方式并非最佳。\n\n开发后台管理系统大部分情况下只想做个普通的增删改查界面，用于数据管理，类似下面这种：\n\nPS: erupt支持定义复杂的页面自定义，详见 [erupt-tpl](https://www.yuque.com/erupts/erupt/sgx66o) 模块\n\n![result](readme/view.png)\n![result](readme/edit.png)\n\n``` java\n@Erupt(\n       name = \"简单的例子\",\n       power = @Power(importable = true, export = true)\n)\n@Table(name = \"t_simple\")   //数据库表名\n@Entity\npublic class Simple extends BaseModel {\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"文本\"),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"文本\", notNull = true, search = @Search)\n    )\n    private String input;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"数值\", sortable = true),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"数值\", search = @Search)\n    )\n    private Float number;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"布尔\"),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"布尔\", search = @Search)\n    )\n    private Boolean bool;\n\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"时间\"),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"时间\", search = @Search(vague = true))\n    )\n    private Date date;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"滑动条\"),\n            edit = @Edit(title = \"滑动条\", type = EditType.SLIDER, search = @Search,\n                    sliderType = @SliderType(max = 90, markPoints = {0, 30, 60, 90}, dots = true))\n    )\n    private Integer slide;\n\n    @EruptField(\n            views = @View(title = \"下拉选择\"),\n            edit = @Edit(\n                    search = @Search,\n                    title = \"下拉选择\", type = EditType.CHOICE,\n                    choiceType = @ChoiceType(fetchHandler = SqlChoiceFetchHandler.class,\n                            fetchHandlerParams = \"select id,name from e_upms_menu\"\n                    )\n            )\n    )\n    private Long choice;\n\n}\n```\n\n[功能体验](https://www.erupt.xyz/#!/contrast)\n\n这个界面虽然用 Vue + Ant Design + SSM 也能做出个大概，但仔细观察会发现它有大量细节功能如：\n\n+ 有按钮可以查询、新增、批量删除、excel 导入导出\n+ 可以对数据做筛选、隐藏某列、按某列排序\n+ 表格有分页与汇总，可预览单行数据\n+ 多种组件、有校验规则\n\n全部实现这些仅前端就需要大量的代码，后端的接口与业务逻辑更不在少数。\n\n但可以看到，用 erupt 只需要 **30几行** 代码就能完成 ！\n\n> 完全不需要了解 **Angular / React / Vue / Jquery**   \n>\n> 而且不需要了解 **JavaScript / HTML / CSS**   \n>\n> 甚至不需要了解 **Spring MVC / Mybatis / SQL**   \n\n即便没学过 erupt 也能猜到大部分配置的作用，只需要简单配置就能完成所有后台页面开发。\n\n这正是建立 erupt 的初衷，对于大部分常用页面，应该使用最简单的方法来实现，甚至不需要学习各种框架和工具，专注核心业务。\n\n\n## 🆚 开发方式横向比对 | VS\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td></td>\n        <td>传统 Spring Web 开发</td>\n        <td>代码生成器</td>\n
