To do that try to isolate the bug, create a very simple app with that bug and launch it on two or three different devices.\n - In 'Issues' section click 'Add Issue'.\n - Describe the issue you're experiencing.\n - Add steps to reproduce.\n - Add device and system info.\n - Add stacktrace.\n - Add a sample code used to reproduce the issue.\n\nOf course not always you'll be able to get all of those information. Sometimes it's not necessary. In all other cases try to be precise and provide as much info as possible.\n\n### Feature requests\n\nIf you think that Carbon lacks anything such library should have, you can open a feature request. To do that simply create a new issue and describe the thing you're thinking of. Then you have two options:\n\n - Wait. If the feature is reasonable, I will add it. It may take some time, be patient.\n - Make a pull request with your feature. Make sure that I'm ok with the feature, the code is clean, complete and bug-free.\n\nFeature requests can be rejected in some cases:\n\n - The feature is very specific and solves only your problem.\n - The feature is impossible to be run on all platforms supported by Carbon.\n \n ### Wiki\n \n You may add and edit Wiki pages as well. When doing so, please make sure that:\n \n  - Your page is consistent with the rest of the Wiki\n  - The information you're adding is also useful to others\n  - The information is up to date, precise and contain only facts\n  - The language is appropriate and the grammar is correct\n"

This is not the exact copy of the Lollipop's API and features. It's a custom implementation of the most useful things as shown in the design specification. Carbon tries to:\n\n - make things easier (specify cornerRadius='dp' instead of creating an xml and/or a ViewOutlineProvider)\n - make it all work and look the same on all APIs (like CheckBox's left padding)\n - really backport features (don't use gradients for shadows!)\n - fix Android's everlasting bugs (FrameLayout ignores child's padding when no gravity is set)\n \n### What's new\n\n - custom item layouts for BottomNavigationView, TabLayout and NavigationView\n - DayNight themes\n - updated control colors\n - fixed color animations, background tint, menu inflation, shadow transformations\n\n### Features\n\n##### Android 4.x\n\n - generated, animated shadows with elevation system\n - the touch ripple\n - rounded corners with content clipping\n - circular reveal\n - theme xml attribute\n - widget and drawable tinting\n - font resources\n - edge effects\n\n##### All APIs\n\n - simple to use xml attributes for stroke, cut corners, rounded corners and ripples\n - colored shadows\n - brightness/saturation fade\n - SVG support (with transformations, text, gradients, etc.)\n \n###### Useful extensions and bugfixes\n\n - html text\n - percent layouts, anchors, colored insets\n - view stroke\n - visibility animations\n - color state animations\n - ttf/otf fonts\n - text auto size\n - TextMarker\n\n##### Material constants, widgets and components\n\n - colors, dimensions, typography\n - ready-to-use rows and adapters for RecyclerView\n - DropDown, FloatingActionMenu, RangeSeekBar, ExpandableRecyclerView, FlowLayout, TableView, BackdropLayout, Banner, BottomNavigationView, TabLayout\n\n### Samples\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/shadow.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/searchtoolbar.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/flowlayoutchips.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/musicplayer.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/fab.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/code.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/bottomnavigation.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/profile.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/backdrop.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/checkboxes.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/components.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/dropdown.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/fontresource.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/guidelinesbuttons.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/guidelinesmenus.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/listdialog.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/buttons.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/textfields.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/tablelayout.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/multiselect.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/powermenu.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/studiescrane.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/tabs.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> <img src=\"https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/blob/master/images/themes.png\" width=\"135px\" height=\"240px\"/> \n\n### [Installation](https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/wiki/Installation)\n\n### [FAQ](https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/wiki/FAQ)\n\n### [Changelog](https://github.com/ZieIony/Carbon/wiki/Changelog)\n\n### [JavaDoc](http://zieiony.github.io/Carbon/javadoc/)\n\n### Articles\n\n -
