Due to improvements made to the main project, it is\nnow possible for us to properly use the joda-time dependency. This means that:\n\n1. If you are using Gradle, nothing should change, unless you were doing something weird.\n\n2. If you're using Eclipse libraries, you will have to manually include joda-time.jar yourself now; make sure to\n   get the no-tzdb artifact.\n\n#### Initialization\n\nInitially you initialized the library via `ResourceZoneInfoProvider.init()`. Later this was moved to\n`JodaTimeAndroid.init()`. We're removing the other endpoint because it just makes this more difficult to\nmaintain; it should be simple to change from one to the other.\n\n#### Other changes\n\n* Updated to joda-time 2.7\n\n# 2.6.0 *(2014-12-20)*\n\n* Updated to joda-time 2.6\n\n# 2.5.1 *(2014-11-15)*\n\n* Modified how default DateTimeZone is updated by system (#20)\n* Updated to tzdata 2014j\n\n# 2.5.0 *(2014-11-02)*\n\n* Updated to joda-time 2.5\n* Updated to tzdata 2014i\n\n# 2.4.1 *(2014-10-02)*\n\n* Updated to tzdata 2014h\n\n# 2.4.0 *(2014-08-02)*\n\n* Updated to joda-time 2.4\n\n# 2.3.4 *(2014-06-14)*\n\n* `#10` Receive TIMEZONE_CHANGED broadcasts only when running, add JodaTimeAndroid.init\n* Updated to tzdata 2014e\n\n# 2.3.3 *(2014-04-20)*\n\n* `#4` Added library sample app\n* `#9` Reset default DateTimeZone when TIMEZONE_CHANGED broadcast is received\n\n## 2.3.2 *(2014-04-09)*\n\n* `#7` Added DateUtils.formatDuration()\n\n## 2.3.1 *(2014-04-08)*\n\n* `#5` Add compatibility version of DateUtils\n* `#6` Fixed lint error\n\n## 2.3 *(2014-01-25)*\n\n* Initial port of joda-time to Android\n"

          "content": "joda-time-android\n=================\n\nThis library is a version of [Joda-Time](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time) built with Android in mind.\n\nWhy Joda-Time?\n==============\n\nAndroid has built-in date and time handling - why bother with a library?  If you've worked with Java's Date and Calendar classes you can probably answer this question yourself, but if not, check out [Joda-Time's list of benefits](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/#Why_Joda-Time).\n\nFor Android developers Joda-Time solves one critical problem: stale timezone data.  Built-in timezone data is only updated when the OS is updated, and we all know how often that happens.  [Countries modify](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15512177) [their timezones](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/samoa-to-move-the-international-dateline/story-e6frf7jx-1226051660380) [all the](http://www.indystar.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070207/LOCAL190108/702070524/0/LOCAL) [time](http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKBLA65048420070916); being able to update your own tz data keeps your app up-to-date and accurate.\n\nWhy This Library?\n=================\n\nI know what you are thinking: Joda-Time is a great library and it's just a single JAR, so why make things more complex by wrapping it in an Android library?\n\nThere is a particular problem with the JAR setup on Android: due to its usage of [ClassLoader.getResourceAsStream()](http://developer.android.com/reference/java/lang/ClassLoader.html#getResourceAsStream%28java.lang.String%29), it greatly inflates its memory footprint on apps.  (For more details, see [this blog post](http://blog.danlew.net/2013/08/20/joda_time_s_memory_issue_in_android/).)  This library avoids the problem for Android by loading from resources instead of a JAR.\n\nThis library also has extra utilities designed for Android.  For example, see [DateUtils](library/src/main/java/net/danlew/android/joda/DateUtils.java), a port of Android's [DateUtils](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/format/DateUtils.html).\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nAdd the following dependency to `build.gradle`:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'net.danlew:android.joda:2.13.0'\n}\n```\n\nMulti-Process Apps\n===============\n\nDue to using App Startup, joda-time-android will not automatically initialize in non-main processes.\n\nIf you would like to automatically run App Startup in other processes, add this to your manifest:\n\n```xml\n<provider\n    android:name=\"androidx.startup.InitializationProvider\"\n    android:authorities=\"${applicationId}.androidx-startup\"\n    android:exported=\"false\"\n    android:process=\"[your-process-name-here]\"\n    tools:node=\"merge\" />\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can call [`AppInitializer`](https://developer.android.com/reference/kotlin/androidx/startup/AppInitializer) directly to initialize just joda-time-android:\n\n```kotlin\nAppInitializer.getInstance(this).initializeComponent(JodaTimeInitializer::class.java)\n```\n\nTroubleshooting\n===============\n__Q: My build fails with an error about a duplicate file__\n\n> Duplicate files copied in APK META-INF/LICENSE.txt\n\nor\n\n> Duplicate files copied in APK META-INF/NOTICE.txt\n\n__A: We can safely exclude those files from our build. You need to specify these two `exclude`s in your `build.gradle` file and you will be good to go:__\n\n```\nandroid {\n    ...\n    packagingOptions {\n        exclude 'META-INF/LICENSE.txt'\n        exclude 'META-INF/NOTICE.txt'\n    }\n}\n```\n\nor \n\n__B: We can safely choose to add those files to our build. You need to specify these two `merge`s in your `build.gradle` file and you will be good to go:__\n\n```\nandroid {\n    ...\n    packagingOptions {\n        merge '**/LICENSE.txt'\n        merge '**/NOTICE.txt'\n    }\n}\n```\n"
