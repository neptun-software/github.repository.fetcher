We work hard\nto provide a high quality and useful SDK for our customers, and we appreciate\nyour interest in helping us and the rest of our community of users. We welcome\nbug reports, feature requests, and code contributions.\n\n__Jump To:__\n* [Bug Reports](#bug-reports)\n* [Feature Requests](#feature-requests)\n* [Code Contributions](#code-contributions)\n\n## Bug Reports\nBug reports are accepted through the [Issues][issues] page.\n\nThe following labels are used to track bug related issues: [bug][label-bug],\n[documentation][label-doc-issue].\n\n### Before Submitting a Bug Report\nBefore submitting a bug report, please do the following:\n\n1. Do a search through the existing issues to make sure it has not already been\n   reported. If there's an existing one, be sure give a +1 reaction which will\n   help us prioritize which issues to address first.\n\n2. If possible, upgrade to the latest release of the SDK. The SDK has a near\n   daily release cadence so it's possible the bug has already been fixed in the\n   latest version. We maintain a strong backwards compatibility guarantee\n   between patch version releases so you can be confident that your application\n   will continue to work as expected with the newer version.\n\nIf, after doing the above steps, you determine that you need to submit a bug\nreport, refer to the next section.\n\n### Submitting a Bug Report\nSo that we are able to assist you as effectively as possible with the issue,\nplease ensure that your bug report has the following:\n\n* A short, descriptive title. Ideally, other community members should be able\n  to get a good idea of the issue just from reading the title.\n* A succint, detailed description of the problem you're experiencing. This\n  should include:\n  * Expected behavior of the SDK and the actual behavior exhibited.\n  * Any details of your application environment that may be relevant. At\n    minimum, this should include the __SDK version__ and __JRE version__.\n  * If applicable, the exception stacktrace.\n  * If you are able to create one, include a [Minimal Working Example][mwe]\n    that reproduces the issue.\n* [Markdown][markdown] formatting as appropriate to make the report easier to\n  read; for example use code blocks when pasting a code snippet and exception\n  stacktraces.\n\n## Feature Requests\nLike bug reports, feature requests are submitted through the [Issues][issues]\npage.\n\nAs with Bug Reports, please do a search of the open requests first before\nsubmitting a new one to avoid duplicates. If you find an existing one, give it\na +1.\n\n__NOTE:__ If this is a feature you intend to implement, please be sure to\nsubmit the feature request *before* working on any code changes. This will\nallow members on the SDK team to have a discussion with you to ensure that it's\nthe right design and that it makes sense to include in the SDK. Keep in mind\nthat other concerns like source and binary compatibility will also play a\ndeciding factor.\n\nFeature requests are labeled with [feature-request][label-feature-request].\n\n### Submitting a Feature Request\nOpen an [issue][issues] with the following:\n\n* A short, descriptive title. Ideally, other community members should be able\n  to get a good idea of the feature just from reading the title.\n* A detailed description of the the proposed feature. Include justification for\n  why it should be added to the SDK, and possibly example code to illustrate\n  how it should work.\n* [Markdown][markdown] formatting as appropriate to make the request easier to\n  read.\n* If you intend to implement this feature, indicate that you'd like to the\n  issue to be assigned to you\n\n## Code Contributions\nCode contributions to the SDK are done through [Pull Requests][pull-requests].\nPlease keep the following in mind when considering a code contribution:\n\n* The SDK is released under the [Apache 2.0 License][license].\n\n   Any code you submit will be released under this license. If you are\n   contributing a large/substantial feature, you may be asked to sign a\n   Contributor License Agreement (CLA).\n* For anything but very small or quick changes, you should always start by\n  checking the [Issues][issues] page to see if the work is already being done\n  by another person.\n\n  If you're working on a bug fix, check to see if the bug has already been\n  reported. If it has but no one is assigned to it, ask one of the maintainers\n  to assign it to you before beginning work.  If you're confident the bug\n  hasn't been reported yet, create a new [Bug Report](#bug-reports) then ask to\n  be assigned to it.\n\n  If you are thinking about adding entirely new functionality, open a [Feature\n  Request](#feature-requests) or [ping][gitter] the maintainers to ask for\n  feedback first before beginning work; again this is to make sure that no one\n  else is already working on it, and also that it makes sense to be included in\n  the SDK.\n* All code contributions must be accompanied with new or modified tests that\n  verify that the code works as expected; i.e. that the issue has been fixed or\n  that the functionality works as intended.\n\n### Pull Request Readiness\nBefore submitting your pull request, refer to the pull request readiness\nchecklist below:\n\n* [ ] Includes tests to exercise the new behavior\n* [ ] Code is documented, especially public and user-facing constructs\n* [ ] Local run of `mvn install` succeeds\n* [ ] Git commit message is detailed and includes context behind the change\n* [ ] If the change is related to an existing Bug Report or Feature Request,\n  the issue number is referenced\n\n__Note__: Some changes have additional requirements. Refer to the section below\nto see if your change will require additional work to be accepted.\n\n### Additional Pull Request Requirements\n#### Getting Your Pull Request Merged\nAll Pull Requests must be approved by at least one member of the SDK team\nbefore it can be merged in. The members only have limited bandwidth to review\nPull Requests so it's not unusual for a Pull Request to go unreviewed for a few\ndays, especially if it's a large or complex one. If, after a week, your Pull\nRequest has not had any engagement from the SDK team, feel free to ping a\nmember to ask for a review.\n\nIf your branch has more than one commit when it's approved, you will also be\nasked to [squash][git-rewriting-history] them into a single commit before it is\nmerged in.\n\n## Getting in Contact\n* Come chat with us on [Gitter][gitter]!\n\n[license]: ./LICENSE.txt\n[mwe]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_Working_Example\n[markdown]: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/\n[issues]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues\n[pull-requests]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/pulls\n[label-bug]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/labels/bug\n[label-doc-issue]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/labels/documentation\n[label-feature-request]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/labels/feature-request\n[git-rewriting-history]: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History\n[gitter]: https://gitter.im/aws/aws-sdk-java"

Import\nthe [aws-java-sdk-bom][] and specify the SDK Maven modules that your project needs in the\ndependencies.\n\n##### Importing the 1.x BOM #####\n\n```xml\n<dependencyManagement>\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>\n      <artifactId>aws-java-sdk-bom</artifactId>\n      <version>1.12.780</version>\n      <type>pom</type>\n      <scope>import</scope>\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</dependencyManagement>\n```\n\n##### Using the 1.x SDK Maven modules #####\n\n```xml\n<dependencies>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>\n    <artifactId>aws-java-sdk-ec2</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>\n    <artifactId>aws-java-sdk-s3</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n  <dependency>\n    <groupId>com.amazonaws</groupId>\n    <artifactId>aws-java-sdk-dynamodb</artifactId>\n  </dependency>\n</dependencies>\n```\n\nSee the [Set up the AWS SDK for Java 1.x][docs-setup] section of the developer guide for more\ninformation about installing the 1.x SDK through other means.\n\n## Building From Source\n\nOnce you check out the code from GitHub, you can build it using Maven. To disable the GPG-signing\nin the build, use:\n\n```sh\nmvn clean install -Dgpg.skip=true\n```\n\n## Getting Help\nGitHub [issues][sdk-issues] is the preferred channel to interact with our team. Also check these community resources for getting help:\n\n* Ask a question on [StackOverflow][stack-overflow] and tag it with `aws-java-sdk`\n* Articulate your feature request or upvote existing ones on our [Issues][features] page\n* Take a look at the [blog] for plenty of helpful walkthroughs and tips\n* Open a case via the [AWS Support Center][support-center] in the [AWS console][console]\n* If it turns out that you may have found a bug, please open an [issue][sdk-issues]\n\n## Maintenance and Support for SDK Major Versions\n\nFor information about maintenance and support for SDK major versions and their underlying dependencies, see the following in the AWS SDKs and Tools Reference Guide:\n\n* [AWS SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy][maintenance-policy]\n* [AWS SDKs and Tools Version Support Matrix][version-matrix]\n\n## Supported Minor Versions\n\n* **1.12.x** - In [maintenance mode][maintenance-mode-post]. We recommend migrating to the [AWS SDK for Java 2.x][aws-sdk-for-java-2x].\n\n* **1.11.x** - No longer supported, but migration to 1.12.x should require no code changes.\n\n## AWS SDK for Java 2.x\n\nA version 2.x of the SDK is generally available. It is a major rewrite of the 1.x code base, built on top of Java 8+ and adds several frequently requested features. These include support for non-blocking I/O, improved start-up performance, automatic iteration over paginated responses and the ability to plug in a different HTTP implementation at run time.\n\nFor more information see the [AWS SDK for Java 2.x Developer Guide][sdk-v2-dev-guide] or check the project repository in https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2.\n\n## Maintenance and Support for Java Versions\n\nThe AWS SDK for Java 1.x supports Java versions from 7 to 17, but may not be updated to support future Java versions. To ensure long-term compatibility with the latest JDK versions, we recommend that you migrate to the\n[AWS SDK for Java 2.x][aws-sdk-for-java-2x]. \n\n[aws-iam-credentials]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/java-dg-roles.html\n[aws]: https://aws.amazon.com/\n[blog]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/category/java/\n[docs-api]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/index.html\n[docs-guide]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/welcome.html\n[docs-guide-source]: https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-java-developer-guide\n[docs-java-env]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-install.html#installing-a-java-development-environment\n[docs-signup]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/signup-create-iam-user.html\n[docs-setup]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v1/developer-guide/setup-install.html\n[install-jar]: https://sdk-for-java.amazonwebservices.com/latest/aws-java-sdk.zip\n[sdk-issues]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues\n[sdk-license]: https://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/\n[sdk-website]: https://aws.amazon.com/sdkforjava\n[aws-java-sdk-bom]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/tree/master/aws-java-sdk-bom\n[release-notes-catalog]: https://aws.amazon.com/releasenotes/Java?browse=1\n[changes-file]: ./CHANGELOG.md\n[stack-overflow]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-java-sdk\n[features]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22feature-request%22\n[support-center]: https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/\n[console]: https://console.aws.amazon.com\n[jackson-deserialization-gadget]: https://medium.com/@cowtowncoder/on-jackson-cves-dont-panic-here-is-what-you-need-to-know-54cd0d6e8062\n[sdk-v2-dev-guide]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/v2/developer-guide/welcome.html\n[maintenance-policy]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/maint-policy.html\n[version-matrix]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/version-support-matrix.html\n[aws-sdk-for-java-2x]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2\n[deprecation-announcement-post]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/announcing-end-of-support-for-aws-sdk-for-java-v1-x-on-december-31-2025\n[maintenance-mode-post]: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/the-aws-sdk-for-java-1-x-is-in-maintenance-mode-effective-july-31-2024/\n[migration-guide]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/migration.html\n[sdk-v2-getting-started]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started"
