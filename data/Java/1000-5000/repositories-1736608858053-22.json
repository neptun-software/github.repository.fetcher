MapDB is flexible and can be used in many roles:\n\n* Drop-in replacement for Maps, Lists, Queues and other collections.\n* Off-heap collections not affected by Garbage Collector\n* Multilevel cache with expiration and disk overflow.\n* RDBMs replacement with  transactions, MVCC, incremental backups etc…\n* Local data processing and filtering. MapDB has utilities to process huge quantities of data in reasonable time.\n\nHello world\n-------------------\n\nMaven snippet, VERSION is [![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.mapdb/mapdb/badge.svg)](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.mapdb%22%20AND%20a%3Amapdb)\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>org.mapdb</groupId>\n    <artifactId>mapdb</artifactId>\n    <version>VERSION</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nHello world:\n\n```java\n//import org.mapdb.*\nDB db = DBMaker.memoryDB().make();\nConcurrentMap map = db.hashMap(\"map\").make();\nmap.put(\"something\", \"here\");\n```\n\nYou can continue with [quick start](https://jankotek.gitbooks.io/mapdb/content/quick-start/) or refer to the  [documentation](https://jankotek.gitbooks.io/mapdb/).\n\nSupport\n------------\n\nMore [details](http://www.mapdb.org/support/).\n\nDevelopment\n--------------------\n\nMapDB is written in Kotlin, you will need IntelliJ Idea.\n\nYou can use Gradle to build MapDB.\n\nMapDB is extensively unit-tested.\nBy default, only tiny fraction of all tests are executed, so build finishes under 10 minutes.\nFull test suite has over million test cases and runs for several hours/days.\nTo run full test suite, set `-Dmdbtest=1` VM option.\n\nLonger unit tests might require more memory. Use this to increase heap memory assigned to unit tests: `-DtestArgLine=\"-Xmx3G\"`\n\nBy default unit tests are executed in 3 threads. Thread count is controlled by `-DtestThreadCount=3` property\n\nOn machine with limited memory you can change fork mode so unit test consume less RAM, but run longer: `-DtestReuseForks=false`"
