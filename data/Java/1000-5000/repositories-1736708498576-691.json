Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

tab](https://github.com/nisrulz/sensey/releases).\r\n\r\n# Including in your project\r\n\r\nSensey is available in the Jcenter, so getting it as simple as adding it as a dependency\r\n\r\n```gradle\r\nimplementation 'com.github.nisrulz:sensey:{latest version}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `{latest version}` corresponds to published version in [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/nisrulz/maven/com.github.nisrulz%3Asensey/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/nisrulz/maven/com.github.nisrulz%3Asensey/_latestVersion)\r\n\r\n# Simple example\r\n\r\n- To initialize Sensey under your `onCreate()` in the activity/service, call\r\n\r\n```java\r\nSensey.getInstance().init(context);\r\n```\r\n\r\n- To stop Sensey, under your `onDestroy()` in the activity/service, call\r\n\r\n```java\r\n // *** IMPORTANT ***\r\n // Stop Sensey and release the context held by it\r\n Sensey.getInstance().stop();\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Next to enable shake detection\r\n\r\n  - Create an instance of ShakeListener\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  ShakeDetector.ShakeListener shakeListener=new ShakeDetector.ShakeListener() {\r\n      @Override public void onShakeDetected() {\r\n         // Shake detected, do something\r\n     }\r\n\r\n     @Override public void onShakeStopped() {\r\n         // Shake stopped, do something\r\n     }\r\n  };\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  - Now to start listening for Shake gesture, pass the instance `shakeListener` to `startShakeDetection()` function\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  Sensey.getInstance().startShakeDetection(shakeListener);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  If you want to modify the `threshold` and `time` before declaring that shake gesture is stopped, use\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  Sensey.getInstance().startShakeDetection(threshold,timeBeforeDeclaringShakeStopped,shakeListener);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  - To stop listening for Shake gesture, pass the instance `shakeListener` to `stopShakeDetection()` function\r\n\r\n  ```java\r\n  Sensey.getInstance().stopShakeDetection(shakeListener);\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n### :page_with_curl: For more info , check the **[Wiki Docs](https://github.com/nisrulz/sensey/wiki/Usage)**\r\n\r\n# Pull Requests\r\n\r\nI welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:\r\n\r\n1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using CMD+Option+L (Reformat code) on Mac (not sure for Windows) with Android Studio defaults. This project uses a [modified version of Grandcentrix's code style](https://github.com/nisrulz/AndroidCodeStyle/tree/nishant-config), so please use the same when editing this project.\r\n2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.\r\n3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)\r\n4. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.\r\n5. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/nisrulz/sensey/issues) first, before filing an issue.\r\n6. Have fun!\r\n\r\n## References of Sensey\r\n\r\nSensey is being used in production apps as well as research & development for thesis at universities.\r\n\r\n[Click here for the full list of references](references/Readme.md)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0, [click here for the full license](/LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\n# Author & Contributors\r\n\r\nThis project was created by [Nishant Srivastava](https://github.com/nisrulz/nisrulz.github.io#nishant-srivastava) but hopefully developed and maintained by many others.
