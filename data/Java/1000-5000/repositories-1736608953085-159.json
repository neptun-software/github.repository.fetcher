Limitations on Grant Scope\n    The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted\n    under this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied\n    from the distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\n    Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted\n    by a Contributor:\n\n        a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from\n        Covered Software; or\n\n        b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s\n        modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n        Contributions with other software (except as part of its\n        Contributor Version); or\n\n        c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the\n        absence of its Contributions.\n\n    This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\n    or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\n    the notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n    2.4. Subsequent Licenses\n    No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to\n    distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this\n    License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License\n    (if permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).\n\n    2.5. Representation\n    Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\n    Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\n    to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n    2.6.

Conditions\n    Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the\n    licenses granted in Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n\n    3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n    All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including\n    any Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be\n    under the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the\n    Source Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms\n    of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License.\n    You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights\n    in the Source Code Form.\n\n    3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n    If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n        a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n        Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n        the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n        Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than\n        the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n        b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n        License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n        license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n        the recipients’ rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n    3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n    You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\n    provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\n    the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of\n    Covered Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses,\n    and the Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses,\n    this License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\n    under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\n    the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the\n    Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such\n    Secondary License(s).\n\n    3.4. Notices\n    You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n    (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\n    or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\n    the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\n    the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n    3.5. Application of Additional Terms\n    You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,\n    indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of\n    Covered Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf,\n    and not on behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear\n    that any such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is\n    offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor\n    for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n    support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include\n    additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability\n    specific to any jurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License\nwith respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,\njudicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of\nthis License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations\nand the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a text file\nincluded with all distributions of the Covered Software under this License.\nExcept to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description\nmust be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill\nto be able to understand it.\n\n5. Termination\n\n    5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\n    if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\n    compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\n    Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\n    Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\n    ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\n    non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\n    come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\n    Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\n    notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means,\n    this is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with\n    this License from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to\n    30 days after Your receipt of the notice.\n\n    5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\n    infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\n    counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\n    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted\n    to You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under\n    Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n    5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\n    end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\n    have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\n    prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n6. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nCovered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis, without\nwarranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,\nwithout limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,\nmerchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk\nas to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.\nShould any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You\n(not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing, repair,\nor correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of\nthis License. No use of any Covered Software is authorized under this\nLicense except under this disclaimer.\n\n7. Limitation of Liability\n\nUnder no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort\n(including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or\nanyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to\nYou for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages\nof any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits,\nloss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and\nall other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been\ninformed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability\nshall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from\nsuch party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such\nlimitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of\nincidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may\nnot apply to You.\n\n8. Litigation\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of\na jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business\nand such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without\nreference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall\nprevent a party’s ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter\nhereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,\nsuch provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it\nenforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a\ncontract shall be construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe\nthis License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n\n    10.1. New Versions\n    Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in\n    Section 10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to\n    modify or publish new versions of this License. Each version will be\n    given a distinguishing version number.\n\n    10.2. Effect of New Versions\n    You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\n    of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\n    or under the terms of any subsequent version published\n    by the license steward.\n\n    10.3. Modified Versions\n    If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\n    create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified\n    version of this License if you rename the license and remove any\n    references to the name of the license steward (except to note that such\n    modified license differs from this License).\n\n    10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is\n    Incompatible With Secondary Licenses\n    If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is\n    Incompatible With Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of\n    the License, the notice described in Exhibit B of this\n    License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n\n    This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the\n    Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed\n    with this file, You can obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.\n\nIf it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file,\nthen You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a\nrelevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\nlook for such a notice.\n\nYou may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n\nExhibit B - “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses” Notice\n\n    This Source Code Form is “Incompatible With Secondary Licenses”,\n    as defined by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEclipse Public License, Version 1.0 (EPL-1.0)\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC\nLICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n        i) changes to the Program, and\n        ii) additions to the Program;\n\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates'\nfrom a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself\nor anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\nadditions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software\ndistributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement,\nand (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or\nwhen combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with\nthis Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\n       reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\n       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works,\n       in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\n       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\n       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and\n       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any,\n       in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply\n       to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time\n       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\n       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n       Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n       combinations which include the Contribution.\n       No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n       rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes\n       sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\n       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\n       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\n       Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n       before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\n       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\n       license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n        i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\n        and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\n        conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n        conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n        ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\n        for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\n        consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n        iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\n        offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n        iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\n        Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\n        manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution,\nif any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to\nidentify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore,\nif a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and\nindemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any\nlosses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims,\nlawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the\nIndemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of\nsuch Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply\nto any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual\nproperty infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must:\na) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\nCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor.\nIf that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers\nwarranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties\nare such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section,\nthe Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a\ncourt requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result,\nthe Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nEach Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of\nusing and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to the\nrisks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to\nor loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability\nor interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION\nLOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the\nremainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by\nthe parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent\nnecessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself\n(excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted\nunder Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and\ndoes not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming\naware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this\nAgreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the\nProgram as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations\nunder this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the\nProgram shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\nonly be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves\nthe right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement\nfrom time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to\nmodify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation is the initial\nAgreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to\nserve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\nof the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\n(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version\nof the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version\nof the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly\nstated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or\nlicenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the\nProgram not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to\nthis Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one\nyear after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a\njury trial in any resulting litigation.\n"
