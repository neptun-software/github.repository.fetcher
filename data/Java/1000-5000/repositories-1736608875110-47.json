Instead of the reflection calls this version uses the new public methods added in API Level 29. It is based on <b>androidx.transition:transition:1.2.0</b>.\n\nPrevious version if you are not yet on 29 (Q) SDK:\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n    implementation \"com.andkulikov:transitionseverywhere:2.0.0\"\n}\n```\nThis version is based on <b>androidx.transition:transition:1.1.0</b>.\n\nMigration from 1.x guide\n============\n1) Migrate to <b>AndroidX</b>! Support libraries are not updating anymore, to get all the bug fixes you have to use AndroidX transitions.\n2) Replace imports from <b>com.transitionseverywhere.</b> to <b>androidx.transition.</b> for all the classes which are a part of the AndroidX lib.\n3) If you were using <b>Transition.TransitionListenerAdapter</b> class use <b>TransitionListenerAdapter</b> now.\n4) Instead of <b>TransitionManager.setTransitionName()</b> use <b>ViewCompat.setTransitionName()</b>.\n5) If you were inflating transitions via xml move your files from <b>anim</b> folder to <b>transition</b> and use <b>android:</b> namespace instead of <b>app:</b>\n6) Some setters in AndroidX transitions are not following the builder pattern, please rewrite this usages with introducing a helper variable if you encounter the issue.\n7) Instead of <b>TranslationTransition</b> use <b>Translation</b>.\n\nArticles about the version 1.x\n============\n[Article about transitions and library][2]<br>\n[Russian version][3]<br>\nChinese: [version 1][5], [version 2][6]<br>\n\n[Changelog for version 1.x][4]\n============\n\n[1]: https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/transition/package-summary\n[2]: https://medium.com/@andkulikov/animate-all-the-things-transitions-in-android-914af5477d50\n[3]: http://habrahabr.ru/post/243363/\n[4]: https://github.com/andkulikov/Transitions-Everywhere/blob/master/library(1.x)/CHANGELOG.md\n[5]: https://yanlu.me/animate-all-the-things-transitions-in-android/\n[6]: http://www.jianshu.com/p/98f2ec280945\n[7]: https://medium.com/@andkulikov/support-library-for-transitions-overview-and-comparison-c41be713cf8c\n"
