Make sure you have latest [Butterknife](https://github.com/JakeWharton/butterknife) lib on your classpath\n 2. Right click on usage of desired layout reference (e.g. R.layout.main in your Activity or Fragment), then `Generate` and `Generate ButterKnife Injections`\n 3. Pick injections you want, you also have an option to create ViewHolder for adapters.\n 4. Click `Confirm` and enjoy injections in your code with no work!\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nPull requests are welcomed!\n\n- make sure you stick to [our coding style](/code-formatting-config.xml).\n- follow [Getting Started with Plugin Development](http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IDEADEV/Getting+Started+with+Plugin+Development)\n- make sure you have Java 6 installed if you want to publish it in the plugin repository\n\n## Common issue: The plugin is not working after I updated to new Android Studio\n- AS promts you to update plugins after update, you need to update them before using\n- Make sure you have Butterknife on your classpath\n- Make sure that your cursor is placed on a layout ID in a class having one of these types: Activity, Fragment, custom View or Adapter \n\n## Why 'Zelezny'?\n\n<img src=\"http://assets.espn.go.com/i/oly/summer08/afp/xml/en/biop/images/bio/15525.jpg\" width=\"60\"  align=\"right\"/>\n\n[Jan Železný](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jan_%C5%BDelezn%C3%BD) is a famous Czech javelin thrower, Olympic champion and world record holder. With Zelezny's javelin, your butter knife will be much sharper!\n\nSee [**our other Czech personalities**](http://inmite.github.io) who help with [#AndroidDev](https://plus.google.com/s/%23AndroidDev).\n"
