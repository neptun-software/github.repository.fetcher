addition to direct NIO buffers, also accept as function arguments non-direct ones backed by arrays ([issue bytedeco/javacpp-presets#36](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/issues/36))\r\n * Fix `@Virtual` callback functions defined inside a `@Namespace`\r\n * Adjust `TokenIndexer` and `Parser` to handle `#if`, `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#elif`, `#else`, and `#endif` preprocessor directives

and `preloadPath` parameters to `BuildMojo` to let Maven users append paths to the properties easily\r\n * In consequence, remove too arbitrary \"local\" paths from the default platform properties (issue #43)\r\n * Fix a few other more or less minor issues in the `Parser` with the `long double`, `ptrdiff_t`, `intptr_t`, `uintptr_t`, `off_t` types, floating-point numbers, macro redefinitions,

#2](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/issues/2))\r\n * Fix `Loader.load()` not properly force loading all inherited target classes ([issue #1](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/issues/1))\r\n\r\n### April 28, 2014 version 0.8\r\n * Move from Google Code to GitHub as main source code repository\r\n * Place build-time classes in the `org.bytedeco.javacpp.tools` package and bring out static nested classes, in an effort to avoid conflicts and ease development\r\n * Rename the `com.googlecode.javacpp` package to `org.bytedeco.javacpp`\r\n * Added `public long Pointer.address()` getter method, useful when one needs to subtract two pointers\r\n * Removed old NetBeans project files that cause a conflict when trying to open as a Maven project (issue javacv:210)\r\n * Fixed compilation error on `FunctionPointer` classes containing no native callback methods\r\n * Added a `platform.library.path` property, such as \"lib/armeabi/\" in the case of the \"android-arm\" platform, to be used instead of \"package/platform\" (issue javacv:427)\r\n * Generalized references to the path of the Android NDK\r\n * Improved a few small things in the set of `Pointer` classes\r\n * Introduced a simple `Logger` class and unified the logging output calls around it\r\n * Unified the property names with the `@Properties` and `@Platform` annotations into a consistent naming scheme\r\n * Continued to clean up the `Parser` and improve the support of, for the most part, comments, enumerations, functions pointers, anonymous `struct` or `union`, templates, overloaded operators, namespaces, standard containers, default parameter arguments, multiple inheritance, custom names of wrapped declarators, and helper classes written in Java\r\n * Annotations such as `@Adapter` or `@ByVal` are no longer ignored on parameters of getters or setters annotated with `@Index`\r\n * Fixed some other corner cases in `Generator` and a few potential issues with the hacks in `Loader`\r\n * Added for convenience to `PointerPointer` a generic parameter `<P extends Pointer>` and the associated `get(Class<P> ...)` getters, as well as `String` getters and setters\r\n * Passing a `Class` object as first argument to a native method that returns a `Pointer` now determines the runtime type of that returned object\r\n * Generalized somewhat more the compiler options used inside `linux-arm.properties` (issue javacv:418)\r\n * Unified the function pointer type of native deallocators to `void (*)(void*)`\r\n * Removed dependency on (efficient) `AllocObject()` and `CallNonvirtualVoidMethodA()` JNI functions, which are not supported by Avian\r\n * Cleaned up and optimized `Generator` a bit, also fixing a crash that could occur when `FindClass()` returns `NULL`\r\n\r\n### January 6, 2014 version 0.7\r\n * Tweaked a few things to support RoboVM and target iOS, but `JNI_OnLoad()` does not appear to get called...\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r9c\r\n * Made `Loader.load()` work, within reason, even when all annotations and resources have been removed, for example, by ProGuard\r\n * Fixed compile error when using a `FunctionPointer` as parameter from outside its top-level enclosing class\r\n * Added new `Pointer.deallocate(false)` call to disable garbage collection on a per object basis, allowing users to deal with memory leaks in other ways\r\n * Changed the default compiler option `-mfpu=vfpv` for ARM to `-mfpu=vfpv3-d16`, because the former is not supported by Tegra 2 (issue javacv:366)\r\n * Removed call to `Arrays.copyOf()` in `Loader.findLibrary()`, which would prevent it from working on Android 2.2 (issue #39)\r\n * Fixed invalid code generated for `FunctionPointer` parameters annotated with `@Const @ByRef`\r\n * Fixed `NullPointerException` in `Loader.load()` when no `@Platform` annotation is provided (issue #38)\r\n * Parsing for anonymous `struct` or `union` and for `typedef void` (mapped to `@Opaque Pointer`) now outputs something\r\n * The `Parser` now expands preprocessor macros, filters tokens appropriately, and outputs all unprocessed directives as comments\r\n * Improved the C++ support of the `Parser` for namespaces, derived classes, access specifiers, custom constructors, vector types, macros, templates, overloaded operators, etc\r\n * Fixed `typedef` of function pointers and a few code formatting issues with `Parser`\r\n * Supplied checks to prevent `Loader.load()` from throwing `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Can't overwrite cause`\r\n\r\n### September 15, 2013 version 0.6\r\n * Added new very preliminary `Parser` to produce Java interface files almost automatically from C/C++ header files; please refer to the new JavaCPP Presets subproject for details\r\n * When catching a C++ exception, the first class declared after `throws` now gets thrown (issue #36) instead of `RuntimeException`, which is still used by default\r\n * Fixed Java resource leak after catching a C++ exception\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r9\r\n * Added new `Builder` option \"-copylibs\" that copies into the build directory any dependent shared libraries listed in the `@Platform(link={...}, preload={...})` annotation\r\n * `Loader.getPlatformName()` can now be overridden by setting the `com.googlecode.javacpp.platform.name` system property\r\n * Refactored the loading code for `@Properties()` into a neat `Loader.ClassProperties` class, among a few other small changes in `Loader`, `Builder`, `Generator`, and the properties\r\n * Included often used directories such as `/usr/local/include/` and `/usr/local/lib/` to `compiler.includepath` and `compiler.linkpath` default properties\r\n * New `@Properties(inherit={Class})` value lets users specify properties in common on a similarly annotated shared config class of sorts\r\n * Fixed callbacks when used with custom class loaders such as with Web containers or frameworks like Tomcat and Play\r\n * Fixed using `@StdString` (or other `@Adapter` with `@Cast` annotations) on callbacks (issue #34), incidentally allowing them to return a `String`\r\n * By default, `Builder` now links to the `jvm` library only when required, when using the `-header` command line option (issue #33)\r\n * Incorporated missing explicit cast on return values when using the `@Cast` annotation\r\n * Fixed duplicate code getting generated when both specifying the output filename with `-o <name>` and using wildcards on packages containing nested classes \r\n * Let `Buffer` or arrays of primitive values be valid return and callback arguments, mostly useful when used along with the `@StdVector` annotation, or some other custom adapter\r\n\r\n### April 7, 2013 version 0.5\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r8e\r\n * Arguments of `Pointer` type now get handled as `char*` in cases when the `position` can be used for arithmetic\r\n * Worked around bug of `InputStream.available()` always returning 0 with the `http` protocol in `Loader.extractResource(URL)`\r\n\r\n### March 3, 2013 version 0.4\r\n * Fixed potential problem with methods of `FunctionPointer` annotated with `@Cast(\"const...\")`\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r8d\r\n * Fixed callbacks not working on Android anymore (issue #30)\r\n * Added some Javadoc to most of the code\r\n * To help diagnose `UnsatisfiedLinkError` thrown by `Loader.load()`, they have been augmented with a potential cause originating from the \"preloading\" of libraries, whose premature deletion has also been fixed\r\n * Provided new `@Platform(library=\"...\")` annotation value to let users specify the name of the native library used by both `Builder` and `Loader`, where different classes with the same name get built together, which also works on nested classes (issue #29)\r\n * Added the ability to change the name of the class of function objects created when defining a `FunctionPointer` with the `@Name` annotation\r\n * `Builder` would go on a compile spree when all classes specified on the command line could not be loaded\r\n * Exported `Loader.isLoadLibraries()`, which always returns true, except when the `Builder` loads the classes\r\n * Made it possible to specify a nested class (with a '$' character in the name) on the command line\r\n * When `Pointer.limit == 0`, the methods `put()`, `zero()`, and `asBuffer()` now assume a size of 1\r\n * Fixed compiler error on 32-bit Mac OS X\r\n\r\n### November 4, 2012 version 0.3\r\n * Added `Pointer.withDeallocator(Pointer)` method to attach easily a custom `Deallocator` created out of a `static void deallocate(Pointer)` method in the subclass, including native ones such as `@Namespace @Name(\"delete\") static native void deallocate(Pointer)`\r\n * A name starting with \"::\", for example `@Name(\"::std::string\")` or `@Namespace(\"::std\")`, now drops the remaining enclosing scope\r\n * Removed confusing `cast` value of `@Adapter` instead relying on new `String[]` value of `@Cast` to order multiple casts\r\n * Renamed various variables in `Generator` to make the generated code more readable\r\n * Fixed memory corruption when using an adapter or `@ByRef` on a function that returns by value an `std::vector<>` or `std::string` (issue #26)\r\n * Added `Pointer.zero()` method that calls `memset(0)` on the range\r\n * For easier memory management, more than one `Pointer` now allowed to share the `deallocator` when \"casting\" them\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r8b\r\n * Fixed `JavaCPP_log()` not printing correctly (issue #27)\r\n * Added functionality to access easily `FunctionPointer` callbacks by their names from C/C++: We can annotate them with `@Name` and build with the new `-header` option to get their declarations in a header file, while the `Builder` links with the `jvm` library by default\r\n * `Loader` now displays an informative error message when trying to use an undefined `compiler.options` with `@Platform(options=\"\")` (issue #24)\r\n * `Pointer.deallocator()` would needlessly enqueue `Deallocator` objects pointing to the native `NULL` address\r\n * Added support for C++ \"functors\" based on the `operator()`, which gets used when annotating a `FunctionPointer` method parameter with `@ByRef` or `@ByVal`\r\n * For convenience in Scala, added `apply()` as an acceptable caller method name within a `FunctionPointer`, in addition to `call()`\r\n * Fixed `@Cast` not working along parameters with an `@Adapter` or when attempting to `return` the argument\r\n * `Generator` would ignore `Pointer.position()` in the case of `@ByPtrPtr` and `@ByPtrRef` parameters\r\n * Replaced hack to create a `Pointer` from a `Buffer` object with something more standard\r\n * Fixed `Loader.sizeof(Pointer.class)` to return the `sizeof(void*)`\r\n * In addition to methods and parameters, we may now apply `@Adapter` to annotation types as well, allowing us to shorten expressions like `@Adapter(\"VectorAdapter<int>\") int[]` to just `@StdVector int[]`, for `std::vector<int>` support, and similarly for `@StdString` and `std::string`\r\n * Fixed callback parameter casting of primitive and `String` types\r\n * An empty `@Namespace` can now be used to let `Generator` know of entities that are not part of any scope, such as macros and operators\r\n * Turned `FunctionPointer` into an `abstract class` with `protected` constructors, but if users still try to use it as function parameters, `Generator` now logs a warning indicating that a subclass should be used (issue #23)\r\n * Removed the `out` value of the `@Adapter` annotation: All adapters are now \"out\" by default, unless `@Const` also appears on the same element\r\n * Fixed `Pointer.equals(null)` throwing `NullPointerException` (issue #22)\r\n * `@NoOffset` would erroneously prevent `sizeof()` operations from getting generated\r\n\r\n### July 21, 2012 version 0.2\r\n * Fixed problems when trying to map `java.lang.String` to other native types than `char*`, such as `unsigned char*`\r\n * JavaCPP now uses the `new (std::nothrow)` operator for allocation, which guarantees that allocation of primitive native arrays won't throw exceptions, making it possible to build C++ exception free JNI libraries\r\n * Added new `Pointer.limit` property, mainly useful to get the `size` of an output parameter, as returned by an adapter specified with the `@Adapter` annotation\r\n * Renamed the `capacity` field of an adapter to `size` as it now maps to both `Pointer.limit` and `Pointer.capacity` (the latter only for new allocations)\r\n * Added `Pointer.put(Pointer)` method, the counterpart of `Buffer.put(Buffer)`, to call the native `memcpy()` function on two `Pointer` objects\r\n * New `@NoException` annotation to reduce the size of generated code and optimize runtime performance of functions that are guaranteed not to throw exceptions, or for cases when we do not mind that the JVM may crash and burn\r\n * Trying to generate code for non-static native methods inside a class not extending `Pointer` now generates proper warning (issue #19)\r\n * Fixed regression where the `@Adapter` notation generates incorrect code for types other than `Pointer` (issue #20)\r\n\r\n### May 27, 2012 version 0.1\r\n * Started using version numbers, friendly to tools like Maven, and placing packages in a sort of [Maven repository](http://maven2.javacpp.googlecode.com/git/) (issue #10)\r\n * Before loading a JNI library, the `Loader` now also tries to extract and load libraries listed in the `@Platform(link={...}, preload={...})` annotation values, and to support library names with version numbers, each value has to follow the format \"libname@version\" (or \"libname@@version\" to have `Builder` use it for the compiler as well), where \"version\" is the version number found in the filename as required by the native dynamic linker, usually a short sequence of digits and dots, but it can be anything (e.g.: \"mylib@.4.2\" would map to \"libmylib.so.4.2\", \"libmylib.4.2.dylib\", and \"mylib.4.2.dll\" under Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows respectively)\r\n * All files now get extracted into a temporary subdirectory, and with the appropriate platform-dependent linker options, or with libraries patched up after the fact with tools such as `install_name_tool` of Mac OS X, most native dynamic linkers can load dependent libraries from there\r\n * Stopped using `java.net.URL` as hash key in `Loader` (very bad idea)\r\n * Changed the default value of the `@Index` annotation from 0 to 1, and fixed the `Generator` when it is used with member getters and setters\r\n * Renamed `mingw-*.properties` to `windows-*-mingw.properties` for consistency\r\n * Made the `Generator` allocate native heap memory for callback arguments passed `@ByVal` (in addition to `FunctionPointer`), rendering their behavior consistent with return `@ByVal` in the case of function calls (issue #16)\r\n * `Generator` now uses `std::runtime_error(std::string&)` instead of assuming that some nonstandard `std::exception(std::string&)` constructor exists (issue #17)\r\n * Fixed `Generator` producing incorrect code when applying invalid annotations such as `@ByVal` on a method that returns something else than a `Pointer` object (issue #18)\r\n\r\n### May 12, 2012\r\n * Added `pom.xml` file and `BuildMojo` plugin class for Maven support and changed the directory structure of the source code to match Maven's standard directory layout (issue #10) Many thanks to Adam Waldenberg and Arnaud Nauwynck for their ongoing support with that!\r\n * Moved the source code repository to Git\r\n * Created a new `@Raw` annotation to use Java object as raw `jobject` in C++, also passing `JNIEnv` and the enclosing `jclass` or the `jobject` corresponding to `this`, as the first two arguments of the function, when the `Generator` encounters any `@Raw(withEnv=true)` (issue #13)\r\n * The `Builder` now handles more cases when some prefix or suffix property starts or ends with a space (issue #14)\r\n * Fixed syntax error in `VectorAdapter`, which GCC and Visual C++ would still happily compile\r\n * Added new `source.suffix` property to have the names of generated source files end with something else than `.cpp` and support frameworks like CUDA that require filenames with a `.cu` extension to compile properly, such as used by the new `*-cuda.properties`, and also changed the \"-cpp\" command line option to \"-nocompile\"\r\n * New `Loader.loadLibrary()` method similar to `System.loadLibrary()`, but before searching the library path, it tries to extract and load the library from Java resources\r\n * `Generator` now accepts `@Const` on `FunctionPointer` class declarations\r\n * Added new `@Adapter.cast()` value to cast explicitly the output of a C++ adapter object\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r8\r\n * Included new command line option \"-Xcompiler\" to pass options such as \"-Wl,-static\" directly to the compiler\r\n * Made other various minor changes and enhancements\r\n\r\n### March 29, 2012\r\n * Added new `compiler.framework` property and corresponding `@Platform.framework()` value to allow easier binding with Mac OS X frameworks\r\n * Changed most `Builder` errors into warnings, letting the building process complete successfully more often\r\n * We may now use the `@NoDeallocator` annotation on a class to disable deallocation for all allocation methods\r\n\r\n### March 03, 2012\r\n * Added new `@NoDeallocator` annotation to prevent `allocate()` and `allocateArray()` methods from registering a native deallocator to `Pointer` objects (issue #1)\r\n * `Generator` now properly skips as unsupported array parameters that do not have a primitive component type, and logs a warning (issue #7)\r\n * `Generator` and `Builder` would append the same include files, libraries, or options multiple times when not required: Fixed in `Loader.appendProperty()` (issue #8)\r\n * Moved the placement of the class-level @Index annotation to the getter and setter methods themselves\r\n * To process all classes in a package, we may now specify as argument to the `Builder` its name followed by \".*\", in a similar fashion to the `import` statement of the Java language, or by \".**\" to process recursively all packages, while omitting to specify any class or package results in JavaCPP processing all classes found under the directories or JAR files specified with the \"-classpath\" option (issue #12)\r\n * Equipped the `*Pointer` classes with new bulk `get()` and `put()` methods taking an array as argument, to compensate for direct NIO buffers lacking in performance on Android (issue #11)\r\n\r\n### February 18, 2012\r\n * Cleaned up a few minor `Exception` blocks\r\n * New `Pointer.deallocateReferences()` static method to force immediate deallocation of all native memory allocated by `Pointer` objects that since have been garbage collected\r\n * Updated `android-arm.properties` to reflect the fact that, starting from Android NDK r7, `libstdc++.a` has been surreptitiously renamed to `libgnustl_static.a`, such that JavaCPP was instead linking to a new bogus `libstdc++.so` library, causing runtime linking errors\r\n * Included new `android-x86.properties` to compile binaries for that platform as well\r\n * Added new `compiler.sysroot.prefix` and `compiler.sysroot` platform properties to pass options such as `--sysroot` to satisfy new rituals of the Android NDK starting from r7b\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r7b\r\n\r\n### January 8, 2012\r\n * Added new `compiler.linkpath.prefix2` platform property to pass options such as `-Wl,-rpath,` to linkers that support them\r\n * Fixed `Loader.load()` on Android 4.0, where `SecurityManager.getClassContext()` returns `null`\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r7\r\n\r\n### October 29, 2011\r\n * Changed the following to make MinGW work: `Generator` now maps `jlong` to the more standard `long long` instead of `__int64` type and also includes `stdint.h`, and added `-D_JNI_IMPLEMENTATION_ -Wl,--kill-at` to the compiler options, as recommended by MinGW's documentation for building DLLs compatible with JNI \r\n * Added hack for `AttachCurrentThread()`, whose signature differs under Android, and `DetachCurrentThread()` now gets called as appropriate after returning from a callback function, to prevent memory leaks (and also crashes on platforms such as Android) (issue #3)\r\n * `Generator` now generates correct code for the annotation pairs `@Const @ByRef` and `@Const @ByVal` (issue #4)\r\n * Worked around callback functions crashing on Android, which is unable to load user classes from native threads (issue #5)\r\n * Fixed a few potential pitfalls inside `Generator` and `Loader`\r\n * Removed compiler warnings due to the type of the `capacity` member variable of `VectorAdapter`\r\n * Callback `FunctionPointer` objects may now return `@ByVal` or `@ByRef`\r\n * On Android, changed the output of runtime error messages from `stderr` (equivalent to `/dev/null` on Android) to the log\r\n\r\n### October 1, 2011\r\n * Changed default option flag \"/MT\" to \"/MD\" (and a few others that Visual Studio uses by default) inside `windows-x86.properties` and `windows-x86_64.properties` because `std::vector`, `VectorAdapter` and C++ memory allocation in general does not work well with static runtime libraries across DLLs under Windows Vista and Windows 7 for some reason, and because Microsoft fixed the manifest file insanity starting with Visual C++ 2010\r\n * `Builder` now searches for `jni.h` and `jni_md.h` inside `/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Headers/` if not found inside `java.home`, as with Mac OS X Lion (issue #2)\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r6b\r\n * Fixed a few potential pitfalls inside `Generator`\r\n * Added hack to let `*Pointer` classes with a corresponding `*Buffer` class have constructors for them\r\n\r\n### July 5, 2011\r\n * `Generator` now lets `get()/put()` (or the `ValueGetter/ValueSetter` annotated) methods use non-integer indices for the `Index` annotation\r\n * Removed calls to `Arrays.copyOf()` inside `getString*()` methods so they may work on Android as well\r\n * Fixed race condition that could occur in the deallocation code of `Pointer` due to incorrect synchronization\r\n * `platform.root` now defaults to the current directory\r\n\r\n### June 10, 2011\r\n * New `Adapter` annotation that uses C++ classes such as `VectorAdapter`, which can let us use Java arrays or `Pointer` objects in place of C++ vector objects by mapping types such as `vector<int>` to `@Adapter(\"VectorAdapter<int>\") int[]` or `@Adapter(\"VectorAdapter<int>\") IntPointer`\r\n * Added new `Pointer.capacity` field to keep track of allocated size for arrays, needed by the `Adapter` annotation\r\n * Removed the `capacity` parameter from the `Pointer.asByteBuffer()` and `Pointer.asBuffer()` methods, which now rely instead on the value of the new `capacity` field\r\n * `ValueGetter` and `ValueSetter`, defaulting to the `get()` and `put()` methods, now accept indices as arguments, and `*Pointer` classes have been updated accordingly\r\n * New `Index` annotation to indicate that a C++ class, such as `vector<T>` implements the `operator[]` that can be mapped to the `ValueGetter` and `ValueSetter` as well as to arbitrary function calls, taking the first n arguments as indices, where n is the value placed in the annotation\r\n * The `Name` annotation now accepts as value a `String` array to indicate names before and after these indices\r\n * New `Const` annotation for convenience\r\n * Fixed scoping of static members inside namespaces and classes\r\n * Added new `BoolPointer` class\r\n * Improved support of function pointers to generate more standard C++ and to make it work with things like member function pointers\r\n * Inserted hack to call `std::string.c_str()` when returned as `@ByRef java.lang.String`\r\n * Multiplied checks for invalid `NULL` pointers\r\n * Upgraded references of the Android NDK to version r5c, which now also works on Android 2.1 or older ([android issue #16008](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=16008))\r\n * `Loader.load()` no longer requires a JVM that supports annotations to function properly\r\n\r\n### April 22, 2011\r\n * `Generator` now outputs `#include <stdio.h>`, the lack of which prevents Android NDK under Windows from compiling\r\n\r\n### April 7, 2011\r\n * Replaced arrays from constructors with variable-length argument lists for convenience\r\n * Fixed a few small potential pitfalls previously overlooked\r\n\r\n### March 1, 2011\r\n * Fixed directory search for `jni_md.h`, which did not search deep enough in some cases\r\n * Added new `path.separator` property to set the path separator of the target platform, regardless of the build platform\r\n * Added hack to make sure the temporarily extracted library files get properly deleted under Windows\r\n * Now loads classes more lazily\r\n * Changed the paths for libstdc++ inside `android-arm.properties` to the non \"v7a\" versions\r\n * Added new `platform.root` property to let users specify the path to their toolchains more easily\r\n\r\n### February 18, 2011\r\nInitial release\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n---------------\r\nThis project was

Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\r\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\r\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\r\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\r\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\r\n      identification within third-party archives.\r\n\r\n   Copyright [yyyy] [name of copyright owner]\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n===============================================================================\r\n\r\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n\t\t       Version 2, June 1991\r\n\r\n Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\r\n 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\r\n Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\r\n of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\r\n\r\n\t\t\t    Preamble\r\n\r\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\r\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\r\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\r\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\r\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\r\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\r\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\r\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\r\nyour programs, too.\r\n\r\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\r\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\r\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\r\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\r\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\r\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\r\n\r\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\r\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\r\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\r\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\r\n\r\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\r\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\r\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\r\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\r\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\r\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\r\n\r\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\r\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\r\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\r\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\r\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\r\nauthors' reputations.\r\n\r\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\r\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\r\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\r\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\r\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\r\n\r\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\r\nmodification follow.\r\n\r\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\r\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\r\n\r\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\r\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\r\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\r\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\r\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\r\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\r\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\r\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\r\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\r\n\r\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\r\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\r\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\r\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\r\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\r\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\r\n\r\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\r\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\r\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\r\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\r\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\r\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\r\nalong with the Program.\r\n\r\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\r\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\r\n\r\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\r\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\r\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\r\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\r\n\r\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\r\n\r\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\r\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\r\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\r\n    parties under the terms of this License.\r\n\r\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\r\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\r\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\r\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\r\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\r\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\r\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\r\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\r\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\r\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\r\n\r\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\r\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\r\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\r\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\r\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\r\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\r\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\r\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\r\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\r\n\r\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\r\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\r\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\r\ncollective works based on the Program.\r\n\r\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\r\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\r\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\r\nthe scope of this License.\r\n\r\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\r\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\r\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\r\n\r\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\r\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\r\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\r\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\r\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\r\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\r\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\r\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\r\n\r\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\r\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\r\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\r\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\r\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\r\n\r\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\r\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\r\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\r\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\r\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\r\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\r\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\r\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\r\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\r\nitself accompanies the executable.\r\n\r\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\r\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\r\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\r\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\r\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\r\n\r\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\r\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\r\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\r\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\r\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\r\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\r\nparties remain in full compliance.\r\n\r\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\r\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\r\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\r\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\r\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\r\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\r\nthe Program or works based on it.\r\n\r\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\r\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\r\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\r\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\r\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\r\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\r\nthis License.\r\n\r\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\r\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\r\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\r\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\r\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\r\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\r\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\r\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\r\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\r\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\r\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\r\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\r\n\r\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\r\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\r\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\r\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\r\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\r\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\r\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\r\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\r\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\r\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\r\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\r\nimpose that choice.\r\n\r\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\r\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\r\n\r\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\r\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\r\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\r\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\r\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\r\ncountries not thus excluded.

No need to invent new languages such as with [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/), [SIP](http://riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/), [C++/CLI](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-372.htm), [Cython](http://www.cython.org/), or [RPython](https://rpython.readthedocs.io/). Instead, similar to what [cppyy](https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/) strives to do for Python, it exploits the syntactic and semantic similarities between Java and C++. Under the hood, it uses JNI, so it works with all implementations of Java SE, in addition to [Android](http://www.android.com/), [Avian](https://readytalk.github.io/avian/), and [RoboVM](http://robovm.mobidevelop.com/) ([instructions](#instructions-for-android-avian-and-robovm)).\r\n\r\nMore specifically, when compared to the approaches above or elsewhere ([CableSwig](https://github.com/gccxml/CableSwig), [JNIGeneratorApp](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/jnigen.php), [cxxwrap](http://cxxwrap.sourceforge.net/), [JNIWrapper](http://www.teamdev.com/jniwrapper/), [Platform Invoke](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke), [GlueGen](http://jogamp.org/gluegen/www/), [LWJGL Generator](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3-wiki/wiki/4.3.-The-Generator), [JNIDirect](http://web.archive.org/web/20050329122501/http://homepage.mac.com/pcbeard/JNIDirect/), [ctypes](http://docs.python.org/library/ctypes.html), [JNA](https://github.com/java-native-access/jna), [JNIEasy](https://github.com/jmarranz/jnieasy), [JniMarshall](http://flinflon.brandonu.ca/Dueck/SystemsProgramming/JniMarshall/), [JNative](http://jnative.free.fr/), [J/Invoke](http://web.archive.org/web/20110727133817/http://www.jinvoke.com/), [HawtJNI](http://fusesource.github.io/hawtjni/), [JNR](https://github.com/jnr/), [BridJ](http://code.google.com/p/bridj/), [CFFI](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/), [fficxx](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/fficxx), [CppSharp](https://github.com/mono/CppSharp), [cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/), [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/), [rust-bindgen](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/), [Panama Native](http://jdk.java.net/panama/), etc.), it maps naturally and efficiently many common features afforded by the C++ language and often considered problematic, including overloaded operators, class and function templates, callbacks through function pointers, function objects (aka functors), virtual functions and member function pointers, nested struct definitions, variable length arguments, nested namespaces, large data structures containing arbitrary cycles, virtual and multiple inheritance, passing/returning by value/reference/string/vector, anonymous unions, bit fields, exceptions, destructors and shared or unique pointers (via either try-with-resources or garbage collection), and documentation comments. Obviously, neatly supporting the whole of C++ would require more work (although one could argue about the intrinsic neatness of C++), but we are releasing it here as a proof of concept.\r\n\r\nAs a case in point, we have already used it to produce complete interfaces to OpenCV, FFmpeg, libdc1394, PGR FlyCapture, OpenKinect, videoInput, ARToolKitPlus, Leptonica, Tesseract, GSL, LLVM, HDF5, MKL, CUDA, Caffe, MXNet, TensorFlow, System APIs, and others as part of the [JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) subproject, also demonstrating early parsing capabilities of C/C++ header files that show promising and useful results.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to ask questions on [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/javacpp-project) or [the discussion forum](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/discussions) if you encounter any problems with the software! I am sure it is far from perfect...\r\n\r\n\r\nDownloads\r\n---------\r\nArchives containing JAR files are available as [releases](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/releases).\r\n\r\nWe can also have everything downloaded and installed automatically with:\r\n\r\n * Maven (inside the `pom.xml` file)\r\n```xml\r\n  <dependency>\r\n    <groupId>org.bytedeco</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>javacpp</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.5.11</version>\r\n  </dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n * Gradle (inside the `build.gradle.kts` or `build.gradle` file)\r\n```groovy\r\n  dependencies {\r\n    implementation(\"org.bytedeco:javacpp:1.5.11\")\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n * Leiningen (inside the `project.clj` file)\r\n```clojure\r\n  :dependencies [\r\n    [org.bytedeco/javacpp \"1.5.11\"]\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\n * sbt (inside the `build.sbt` file)\r\n```scala\r\n  libraryDependencies += \"org.bytedeco\" % \"javacpp\" % \"1.5.11\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother option available to Gradle users is [Gradle JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/gradle-javacpp), and similarly for Scala users there is [SBT-JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/sbt-javacpp).\r\n\r\n\r\nRequired Software\r\n-----------------\r\nTo use JavaCPP, you will need to download and install the following software:\r\n\r\n * An implementation of Java SE 7 or newer:\r\n   * OpenJDK  http://openjdk.java.net/install/  or\r\n   * Oracle JDK  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/  or\r\n   * IBM JDK  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/\r\n * A C++ compiler, out of which these have been tested:\r\n   * GNU C/C++ Compiler (Linux, etc.)  http://gcc.gnu.org/\r\n     * For Windows x86 and x64  http://mingw-w64.org/\r\n   * LLVM Clang (Mac OS X, etc.)  http://clang.llvm.org/\r\n   * Microsoft C/C++ Compiler, part of Visual Studio  https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/\r\n     * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/walkthrough-compiling-a-native-cpp-program-on-the-command-line\r\n\r\nTo produce binary files for Android 4.0 or newer, you will also have to install:\r\n\r\n * Android NDK r7 or newer  http://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/\r\n\r\nAnd similarly to target iOS, you will need to install either:\r\n\r\n * Gluon VM  http://gluonhq.com/products/mobile/vm/  or\r\n * RoboVM 1.x or newer  http://robovm.mobidevelop.com/downloads/\r\n\r\nTo modify the source code, please note that the project files were created for:\r\n\r\n * Maven 3.x  http://maven.apache.org/download.html\r\n\r\nFinally, because we are dealing with native code, bugs can easily crash the virtual machine. Luckily, the HotSpot VM provides some tools to help us debug under those circumstances:\r\n\r\n * Troubleshooting Guide for Java SE with HotSpot VM\r\n   * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/webnotes/tsg/TSG-VM/html/\r\n   * http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/troubleshoot/\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting Started\r\n---------------\r\nTo understand how JavaCPP is meant to be used, one should first take a look at the [Mapping Recipes for C/C++ Libraries](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/wiki/Mapping-Recipes), but a high-level overview of the [Basic Architecture](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/wiki/Basic-Architecture) is also available to understand the bigger picture. The repository of the [JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) further provides complex examples that we can use as templates, but it also includes a wiki page on how to [Create New Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/wiki/Create-New-Presets) that explains their structure in detail along with a small but complete sample project from which one can start experimenting with.\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Use Cases\r\n-------------\r\nTo implement `native` methods, JavaCPP generates appropriate code for JNI, and passes it to the C++ compiler to build a native library. At no point do we need to get our hands dirty with JNI, makefiles, or other native tools. The important thing to realize here is that, while we do all customization inside the Java language using annotations, JavaCPP produces code that has *zero overhead* compared to manually coded JNI functions (verify the generated .cpp files to convince yourself). Moreover, at runtime, the `Loader.load()` method automatically loads the native libraries from Java resources, which were placed in the right directory by the building process. They can even be archived in a JAR file, it changes nothing. Users simply do not need to figure out how to make the system load the files. These characteristics make JavaCPP suitable for either\r\n\r\n * [accessing native APIs](#accessing-native-apis),\r\n * [using complex C++ types](#using-complex-c-types),\r\n * [optimizing code performance](#optimizing-code-performance), or\r\n * [creating callback functions](#creating-callback-functions).\r\n\r\nIn addition to the few examples provided below, to learn more about how to use the features of this tool, please refer to the [Mapping Recipes for C/C++ Libraries](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/wiki/Mapping-Recipes) as well as [the source code of the JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) for examples. For more information about the API itself, one may refer to [the documentation generated by Javadoc](http://bytedeco.org/javacpp/apidocs/).\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, this all works with the Scala language as well, but to make the process even smoother, it should not be too hard to add support for \"native properties\", such that declarations like `@native var` could generate native getter and setter methods...\r\n\r\n\r\n### Accessing Native APIs\r\nThe most common use case involves accessing some native library written for C++, for example, inside a file named `NativeLibrary.h` containing this C++ class:\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <string>\r\n\r\nnamespace NativeLibrary {\r\n    class NativeClass {\r\n        public:\r\n            const std::string& get_property() { return property; }\r\n            void set_property(const std::string& property) { this->property = property; }\r\n            std::string property;\r\n    };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo get the job done with JavaCPP, we can easily define a Java class such as this one--although one could use the `Parser` to produce it from the header file as demonstrated by the [JavaCPP Presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets) subproject, following the principles outlined in the [Mapping Recipes for C/C++ Libraries](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp/wiki/Mapping-Recipes):\r\n```java\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.*;\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.annotation.*;\r\n\r\n@Platform(include=\"NativeLibrary.h\")\r\n@Namespace(\"NativeLibrary\")\r\npublic class NativeLibrary {\r\n    public static class NativeClass extends Pointer {\r\n        static { Loader.load(); }\r\n        public NativeClass() { allocate(); }\r\n        private native void allocate();\r\n\r\n        // to call the getter and setter functions \r\n        public native @StdString String get_property(); public native void set_property(String property);\r\n\r\n        // to access the member variable directly\r\n        public native @StdString String property();     public native void property(String property);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        // Pointer objects allocated in Java get deallocated once they become unreachable,\r\n        // but C++ destructors can still be called in a timely fashion with Pointer.deallocate()\r\n        NativeClass l = new NativeClass();\r\n        l.set_property(\"Hello World!\");\r\n        System.out.println(l.property());\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter compiling the Java source code in the usual way, we also need to build using JavaCPP before executing it, or we can let it do everything as follows:\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar javacpp.jar NativeLibrary.java -exec\r\nHello World!\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Using Complex C++ Types\r\nTo demonstrate its relative ease of use even in the face of complex data types, imagine we had a C++ function that took a `vector<vector<void*> >` as argument. To support that type, we could define a bare-bones class like this:\r\n```java\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.*;\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.annotation.*;\r\n\r\n@Platform(include=\"<vector>\")\r\npublic class VectorTest {\r\n\r\n    @Name(\"std::vector<std::vector<void*> >\")\r\n    public static class PointerVectorVector extends Pointer {\r\n        static { Loader.load(); }\r\n        public PointerVectorVector()       { allocate();  }\r\n        public PointerVectorVector(long n) { allocate(n); }\r\n        public PointerVectorVector(Pointer p) { super(p); } // this = (vector<vector<void*> >*)p\r\n        private native void allocate();                  // this = new vector<vector<void*> >()\r\n        private native void allocate(long n);            // this = new vector<vector<void*> >(n)\r\n        @Name(\"operator=\")\r\n        public native @ByRef PointerVectorVector put(@ByRef PointerVectorVector x);\r\n\r\n        @Name(\"operator[]\")\r\n        public native @StdVector PointerPointer get(long n);\r\n        public native @StdVector PointerPointer at(long n);\r\n\r\n        public native long size();\r\n        public native @Cast(\"bool\") boolean empty();\r\n        public native void resize(long n);\r\n        public native @Index long size(long i);                   // return (*this)[i].size()\r\n        public native @Index @Cast(\"bool\") boolean empty(long i); // return (*this)[i].empty()\r\n        public native @Index void resize(long i, long n);         // (*this)[i].resize(n)\r\n\r\n        public native @Index Pointer get(long i, long j);  // return (*this)[i][j]\r\n        public native void put(long i, long j, Pointer p); // (*this)[i][j] = p\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        PointerVectorVector v = new PointerVectorVector(13);\r\n        v.resize(0, 42); // v[0].resize(42)\r\n        Pointer p = new Pointer() { { address = 0xDEADBEEFL; } };\r\n        v.put(0, 0, p);  // v[0][0] = p\r\n\r\n        PointerVectorVector v2 = new PointerVectorVector().put(v);\r\n        Pointer p2 = v2.get(0).get(); // p2 = *(&v[0][0])\r\n        System.out.println(v2.size() + \" \" + v2.size(0) + \"  \" + p2);\r\n\r\n        v2.at(42);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nExecuting that program using this command produces the following output:\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar javacpp.jar VectorTest.java -exec\r\n13 42  org.bytedeco.javacpp.Pointer[address=0xdeadbeef,position=0,limit=0,capacity=0,deallocator=null]\r\nException in thread \"main\" java.lang.RuntimeException: vector::_M_range_check: __n (which is 42) >= this->size() (which is 13)\r\n\tat VectorTest$PointerVectorVector.at(Native Method)\r\n\tat VectorTest.main(VectorTest.java:44)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Optimizing Code Performance\r\nOther times, we may wish to code in C++ (including CUDA) for performance reasons. Suppose our profiler had identified that a method named `Processor.process()` took 90% of the program's execution time:\r\n```java\r\npublic class Processor {\r\n    public static void process(java.nio.Buffer buffer, int size) {\r\n        System.out.println(\"Processing in Java...\");\r\n        // ...\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        process(null, 0);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter many days of hard work and sweat, the engineers figured out some hacks and managed to make that ratio drop to 80%, but you know, the managers were still not satisfied. So, we could try to rewrite it in C++ (or even assembly language for that matter via the inline assembler) and place the resulting function in a file named say `Processor.h`:\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n\r\nstatic inline void process(void *buffer, int size) {\r\n    std::cout << \"Processing in C++...\" << std::endl;\r\n    // ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter adjusting the Java source code to something like this:\r\n```java\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.*;\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.annotation.*;\r\n\r\n@Platform(include=\"Processor.h\")\r\npublic class Processor {\r\n    static { Loader.load(); }\r\n\r\n    public static native void process(java.nio.Buffer buffer, int size);\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        process(null, 0);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would then compile and execute like this:\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar javacpp.jar Processor.java -exec\r\nProcessing in C++...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Creating Callback Functions\r\nSome applications also require a way to call back into the JVM from C/C++, so JavaCPP provides a simple way to define custom callbacks, either as function pointers, function objects, or virtual functions. Although there exist frameworks, which are arguably harder to use, such as [Jace](https://github.com/cowwoc/jace/), [JunC++ion](http://codemesh.com/products/junction/), [JCC](http://lucene.apache.org/pylucene/jcc/), [jni.hpp](https://github.com/mapbox/jni.hpp), or [Scapix](https://www.scapix.com/) that can map complete Java APIs to C++, since invoking a Java method from native code takes at least an order of magnitude more time than the other way around, it does not make much sense in my opinion to export as is an API that was designed to be used in Java. Nevertheless, suppose we want to perform some operations in Java, planning to wrap that into a function named `foo()` that calls some method inside class `Foo`, we can write the following code in a file named `foo.cpp`, taking care to initialize the JVM if necessary with either `JavaCPP_init()` or by any other means:\r\n\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <iostream>\r\n#include \"jniFoo.h\"\r\n\r\nint main() {\r\n    JavaCPP_init(0, NULL);\r\n    try {\r\n        foo(6, 7);\r\n    } catch (std::exception &e) {\r\n        std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;\r\n    }\r\n    JavaCPP_uninit();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe may then declare that function to a `call()` or `apply()` method defined in a `FunctionPointer` as follows:\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.*;\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.annotation.*;\r\n\r\n@Platform(include=\"<algorithm>\")\r\n@Namespace(\"std\")\r\npublic class Foo {\r\n    static { Loader.load(); }\r\n\r\n    public static class Callback extends FunctionPointer {\r\n        // Loader.load() and allocate() are required only when explicitly creating an instance\r\n        static { Loader.load(); }\r\n        protected Callback() { allocate(); }\r\n        private native void allocate();\r\n\r\n        public @Name(\"foo\") boolean call(int a, int b) throws Exception { \r\n            throw new Exception(\"bar \" + a * b);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // We can also pass (or get) a FunctionPointer as argument to (or return value from) other functions\r\n    public static native void stable_sort(IntPointer first, IntPointer last, Callback compare);\r\n\r\n    // And to pass (or get) it as a C++ function object, annotate with @ByVal or @ByRef\r\n    public static native void sort(IntPointer first, IntPointer last, @ByVal Callback compare);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince functions also have pointers, we can use `FunctionPointer` instances accordingly, in ways similar to the [`FunPtr` type of Haskell FFI](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/base/4.6.0.0/doc/html/Foreign-Ptr.html#g:2), but where any `java.lang.Throwable` object thrown gets translated to `std::exception`. Building and running this sample code with these commands under Linux x86_64 produces the expected output:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar javacpp.jar Foo.java -header\r\n$ g++ -I/usr/lib/jvm/java/include/ -I/usr/lib/jvm/java/include/linux/ foo.cpp linux-x86_64/libjniFoo.so -o foo\r\n$ ./foo\r\njava.lang.Exception: bar 42\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this example, the `FunctionPointer` object gets created implicitly, but to call a native function pointer, we could define one that instead contains a `native call()/apply()` method, and create an instance explicitly. Such a class can also be extended in Java to create callbacks, and like any other normal `Pointer` object, must be allocated with a `native void allocate()` method, **so please remember to hang on to references in Java**, as those will get garbage collected. As a bonus, `FunctionPointer.call()/apply()` maps in fact to an overloaded `operator()` of a C++ function object that we can pass to other functions by annotating parameters with `@ByVal` or `@ByRef`, as with the `sort()` function in the example above.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible to do the same thing with virtual functions, whether \"pure\" or not. Consider the following C++ class defined in a file named `Foo.h`:\r\n```cpp\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n\r\nclass Foo {\r\npublic:\r\n    int n;\r\n    Foo(int n) : n(n) { }\r\n    virtual ~Foo() { }\r\n    virtual void bar() {\r\n        printf(\"Callback in C++ (n == %d)\\n\", n);\r\n    }\r\n};\r\n\r\nvoid callback(Foo *foo) {\r\n    foo->bar();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe function `Foo::bar()` can be overridden in Java if we declare the method in the peer class either as `native` or `abstract` and annotate it with `@Virtual`, for example:\r\n```java\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.*;\r\nimport org.bytedeco.javacpp.annotation.*;\r\n\r\n@Platform(include=\"Foo.h\")\r\npublic class VirtualFoo {\r\n    static { Loader.load(); }\r\n\r\n    public static class Foo extends Pointer {\r\n        static { Loader.load(); }\r\n        public Foo(int n) { allocate(n); }\r\n        private native void allocate(int n);\r\n\r\n        @NoOffset public native int n(); public native Foo n(int n);\r\n        @Virtual  public native void bar();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static native void callback(Foo foo);\r\n\r\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\r\n        Foo foo = new Foo(13);\r\n        Foo foo2 = new Foo(42) {\r\n            public void bar() {\r\n                System.out.println(\"Callback in Java (n == \" + n() + \")\");\r\n            }\r\n        };\r\n        foo.bar();\r\n        foo2.bar();\r\n        callback(foo);\r\n        callback(foo2);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich outputs what one would naturally assume:\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar javacpp.jar VirtualFoo.java -exec\r\nCallback in C++ (n == 13)\r\nCallback in Java (n == 42)\r\nCallback in C++ (n == 13)\r\nCallback in Java (n == 42)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions for Android, Avian, and RoboVM\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\nThe easiest one to get working is Avian compiled with OpenJDK class libraries, so let's start with that. After creating and building a program as described above, without any further modifications, we can directly execute it with this command:\r\n```bash\r\n$ /path/to/avian-dynamic -Xbootclasspath/a:javacpp.jar <MainClass>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, in the case of Android, we need to do a bit more work. For the command line build system based on Ant, inside the directory of the project:\r\n\r\n 1. Copy the `javacpp.jar` file into the `libs/` subdirectory, and\r\n 2. Run this command to produce the `*.so` library files in `libs/armeabi/`:\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar libs/javacpp.jar -classpath bin/ -classpath bin/classes/ \\\r\n> -properties <android-arm|android-x86> -Dplatform.root=/path/to/android-ndk/ \\\r\n> -Dplatform.compiler=/path/to/<arm-linux-androideabi-g++|i686-linux-android-g++> -d libs/<armeabi|x86>/\r\n```\r\nTo make everything automatic, we may also insert that command into the `build.xml` file. Alternatively, for integration with Android Studio, we can use [Gradle JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/gradle-javacpp).\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly for RoboVM, assuming that the compiled classes are in the `classes` subdirectory:\r\n\r\n 1. Copy the `javacpp.jar` file into the project directory, and\r\n 2. Run the following commands to produce the native binary file:\r\n```bash\r\n$ java -jar javacpp.jar -cp classes/ -properties <ios-arm|ios-x86> -o lib\r\n$ /path/to/robovm -arch <thumbv7|x86> -os ios -cp javacpp.jar:classes/ -libs classes/<ios-arm|ios-x86>/lib.o <MainClass>\r\n```\r\nAnd instead of `Loader.load()`, the library should be loaded with `System.load(\"lib.o\")`, in this case, and might not be required at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nProject lead: Samuel Audet [samuel.audet `at` gmail.com](mailto:samuel.audet&nbsp;at&nbsp;gmail.com)  \r\nDeveloper site: https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp  \r\nDiscussion group: http://groups.google.com/group/javacpp-project\r\n"
