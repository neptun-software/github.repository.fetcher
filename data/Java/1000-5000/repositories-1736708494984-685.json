Gradle Plugin模块\n\n该模块主要具备两个作用：\n\n1. 支持AOP编程，方便ArgusAPM能够在编译期织入一些性能采集的代码；\n\n2. 通过Gradle插件来管理依赖库，使用户接入ArgusAPM更简单。\n\n   ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/Gradle_APM.png)\n\n最终，我们在接入ArgusAPM的时候，只需要简单的应用插件即可，而不需要再单独的去依赖各个aar文件。\n\n**如何使用**\n\n如果您想快速的接入ArgusAPM，请参考[《三分钟快速接入ArgusAPM》](https://github.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/wiki/%E4%B8%89%E5%88%86%E9%92%9F%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%9F%E6%8E%A5%E5%85%A5)，依照文章指引，快速接入；\n\n如果您想了解更多的ArgusAPM的使用技巧，请参考[《详细接入教程》](https://github.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/wiki/%E7%A7%BB%E5%8A%A8%E6%80%A7%E8%83%BD%E7%9B%91%E6%8E%A7-SDK-%E8%AF%A6%E7%BB%86%E9%9B%86%E6%88%90%E6%96%87%E6%A1%A3)；\n\n如果您想参查看官方的Sample，进而了解具体的用法，请点击这里查看[《Sample》](https://github.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/tree/master/argus-apm/argus-apm-sample);\n\n如果您在接入ArgusAPM的过程中遇到问题，请点击这里阅读[《FAQ》](https://github.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/wiki/FAQ)，也可加入我们官方的QQ群，进行咨询。\n\n**使用现状**\n\n| ![手机卫士](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/mobilesafe.png) | ![清理大师](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/clean.png) | ![手机助手](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/appstore.png) | ![影视大全](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/movie.png) | ![花椒相机](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/camera.png) | ![360手游大厅](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/201736165776251_meitu_1.jpg) |\n| :---------------------------------: | :---------------------------------: | :----------------------------: | :----------------------------: | :---------------------: | :--------------------------------------: |\n|              手机卫士               |            清理大师            |            手机助手            |            影视大全            |        花椒相机         |                 游戏大厅                 |\n\n**未来规划**\n\n- 支持更多的性能指标\n- 提升用户体验\n\n**官方QQ群**\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n  <img alt=\"ArgusAPM Logo\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/qrcode_1542008553175.jpg\" width=\"300\"/>\n</p>\n\n**360移动技术微信公众号“奇卓社”**\n<p align=\"left\">\n  <img alt=\"ArgusAPM Logo\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qihoo360/ArgusAPM/master/doc/img/readme/qizhuoshe_344.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\"/>\n  \n## License\n\nArgusAPM is [Apache v2.0 licensed](./LICENSE).\n"
