There are a\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nContributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor License\nAgreement. This is not a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives Google\npermission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.\n\nWhen submitting a pull request, if you have not already signed the\n[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][CLA], then a bot will remind you.\nCode cannot even be evaluated without this step.\n\n## Submitting a patch\n\n1.  It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or\n    feature you're intending to fix. Even if you think it's relatively minor,\n    it's helpful to know what people are working on. Mention in the initial\n    issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can be\n    assigned to you.\n\n2.  Follow the normal process of [forking] the project, and setup a new branch\n    to work in. It's important that each group of changes be done in separate\n    branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the commits\n    related to that bug or feature.\n\n3.  Any significant changes should almost always be accompanied by tests. The\n    project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing\n    tests if you're unsure how to go about it.\n\n4.  All contributions must be licensed Apache 2.0 and all files must have a copy\n    of the boilerplate licence comment (can be copied from an existing file).\n    Files should be formatted according to Google's [java style guide].\n\n5.  Do your best to have [well-formed commit messages] for each change. This\n    provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit\n    messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.\n\n6.  Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request].\n\n[CLA]: https://cla.developers.google.com\n[forking]: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\n[java style guide]: https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html\n[well-formed commit messages]: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\n[pull request]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request\n"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.
