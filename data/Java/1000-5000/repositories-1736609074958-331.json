The big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Níma -- a ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads. With Helidon 4 you get the high throughput of a reactive server with the simplicity of thread-per-request style programming.\n\nThe Helidon SE API in 4.0.0 has changed significantly from Helidon 3. The use of virtual threads have enabled these APIs to change from asynchronous to blocking. This results in much simpler code that is easier to write, maintain, debug and understand. Existing Helidon SE code will require modification to run on these new APIs. For more information see the [Helidon SE Upgrade Guide](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/#/se/guides/upgrade_4x).\n\nHelidon 4 supports MicroProfile 6. This means your existing Helidon MP 3.x applications will run on Helidon 4 with only minor modifications. And since Helidon’s MicroProfile server is based on the new Níma WebServer you get all the benefits of running on virtual threads. For more information see the [Helidon MP Upgrade Guide](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/#/mp/guides/upgrade_4x).\n\nNew to Helidon? Then jump in and [get started](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/#/about/prerequisites).\n\nJava 21 is required to use Helidon 4.0.0.\n\n### CHANGES\n\n- DBClient: Fix DbClient JSON mapping [7844](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7844)\n- DBClient: UriQueryEmpty + NoSuchElementException [7869](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7869)\n- Http: Remove commented-out code [7868](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7868)\n- Metrics: Restore percentile and bucket data to JSON metrics output [7849](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7849)\n- Build: remove Jenkinsfile [7839](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7839)\n- Dependencies: Update build-tools to 4.0.0 [7872](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7872)\n- Dependencies: Upgrade kafka-clients to 3.6.0 [7833](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7833)\n- Docs: AOT update, remove aot site, update guides for native image [7859](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7859)\n- Docs: Config documentation update [7814](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7814)\n- Docs: Final updates intros [7864](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7864)\n- Docs: Health doc updates [7828](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7828)\n- Docs: JWT Auth configuration properties updated [7816](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7816)\n- Docs: Messaging doc update [7837](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7837)\n- Docs: Metrics doc update [7851](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7851)\n- Docs: Migration guides [7715](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7715)\n- Docs: Observability endpoints documentation [7768](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7768)\n- Docs: Refreshes persistence.adoc for Helidon 4.x [7834](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7834)\n- Docs: Tracing documentation [7813](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7813)\n- Docs: Update dbclient docs [7874](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7874)\n- Docs: Update Helidon Webclient Guide documentation [7847](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7847)\n- Docs: Update to WebServer documentation for Helidon 4 [7817](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7817)\n- Docs: Update to gRPC documentation for Helidon 4 [7809](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7809)\n- Docs: Update webclient documentation [7812](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7812)\n- Docs: Updated OpenAPI and OpenAPI UI doc for 4.0 [7823](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7823)\n- Docs: Updates for MP upgrade guide [7863](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7863)\n- Docs: fix github links, microprofile version, SE upgrade guide [7871](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7871)\n- Docs: json metadata fix [7858](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7858)\n- Docs: webclient doc part2 4.x [7845](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7845)\n- Examples: Archetype fix application yaml test and some unused import [7860](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7860)\n- Examples: Fix Archetype native-image.properties path [7846](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7846)\n- Examples: Fix MP quickstart native image build [7826](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7826)\n- Examples: Fix java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: io.helidon.logging.jul.HelidonConsoleHandler[7866](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7866)\n- Examples: Update archetypes and dbclient examples [7873](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7873)\n- Tests: Removes two disabled tests in tests/integration/security/path-params per direction [7832](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7832)\n\n## [4.0.0-RC2]\n\nThis is the second RC build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only.

Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental.\n\nThe big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads. With Helidon 4 you get the high throughput of a reactive server with the simplicity of thread-per-request style programming.\n\nJava 21 is required to use Helidon 4.0.0-M2.\n\nAny easy way to get started with Helidon 4.0.0-M2 is using the helidon CLI\n\nhelidon init --version 4.0.0-M2\n\nNotable Changes\n\n* Java 21 is required for 4.0.0-M2\n* Finish integration of Níma WebServer into Helidon 4. This means that the `nima` Java package has been assimilated into the base Helidon packages. \n* Numerous enhancements to WebServer and WebClient to achieve feature parity with Helidon 3\n\nThe above is work-in-progress. There are still some gaps, and APIs are subject to change. \n\n### CHANGES\n\n- WebSocket: Added support for WS endpoints in application scope [7340](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7340)\n- WebServer: Support Http.Header.X_HELIDON_CN [7345](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7345)\n- WebServer: Resource limits [7302](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7302)\n- WebServer: Media Context and streaming [7396](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7396)\n- WebServer: Http2Connection should ignore a max concurrent streams setting of zero from the client [7346](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7346)\n- WebServer: Additional HTTP status codes.

Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental and not fully tested.\n\nThe big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a [ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads](https://medium.com/helidon/helidon-n%C3%ADma-helidon-on-virtual-threads-130bb2ea2088). \n\nJava 20 is required to use Heldon 4.0.0-M1.\n\nAny easy way to get started with Helidon 4.0.0-M1 is using the [helidon CLI](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon#helidon-cli)\n\n```\nhelidon init --version 4.0.0-M1\n```\n\n### Notable Changes\n\n- Removed the Helidon Reactive WebServer and WebClient that were based on Netty as we fully commit to new implementations based on virtual threads that have a blocking style API (Project Níma).\n- Converted other modules with reactive APIs to blocking style APIs. The `io.helidon.common.reactive` APIs will stay as general purpose reactive utilities and operators\n- Introduced Helidon Injection, a deterministic, source-code-first, compile time injection framework\n- Upgraded MicroProfile support to MicroProfile 6 and Jakarta 10 Core Profile running on the Níma WebServer\n- Started adoption of Helidon Builders, a builder code generation framework\n\nThe above is work-in-progress. There are still missing features, and APIs are undergoing change. For example\nthe Grpc implementation is limited and MicroProfile Grpc support is temporarily absent.\n\n\n### CHANGES\n\n- Config: Config with injection [7080](https://github.com/helidon-io/helidon/pull/7080)\n- Config: Generate config metadata fix.

Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental and not fully tested.\n\nThe big news in Helidon 4.0.0 is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a [ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom virtual threads](https://medium.com/helidon/helidon-n%C3%ADma-helidon-on-virtual-threads-130bb2ea2088).

This is the first Alpha build of Helidon 4.0.0 and is intended as a preview release only. Do not use this release in production. It is suitable only for experimentation. APIs are subject to change. Documentation is incomplete. And some functionality is experimental and not fully tested.\n\nThe big news in this build is the introduction of Helidon Nima -- a ground up webserver implementation based on JDK Project Loom. More information to come.\n\nHelidon 4.0.0 is a major release that includes significant new features and fixes. As a major release it also includes some backward incompatible API changes.\n\n### Notable Changes\n\n- Java 19 early access (with Loom support) as the minimal Java version\n- Using System.Logger instead of java util logging (incremental change)\n- `HelidonServiceLoader` is now part of `helidon-common` module\n- Introduction of `@Weight`, `Weighted` and `Weights` instead of `@Priority` and `Prioritized`, to base ordering on a double (allows to fit a component between any other two components), all modules using priority are refactored (except for MicroProfile where required by specifications).\n  - higher weight means a component is more important \n  - moved priority related types to MP config (as that is the lowest level MP module)\n  - replaces all instances in SE that use priority with weight (no dependency on Jakarta, predictible and easy to understand behavior)\n- Introduction of `MediaType` as the abstraction of any media type, as used by Config, static content and HTTP in general. See `MediaType` and `MediaTypes`\n- `MapperManager` now supports mapping qualifiers\n- new `helidon-common-parameters` module contains an abstraction of a container that has named values (one or more); this is used in path parameters, query parameters, form parameters etc.\n- new `helidon-common-uri` module contains URI abstraction (path with possible parameters, query, and fragment)\n- Header processing now uses `HeaderName` and `HeaderValue` types. This allows you to prepare constants with custom names and values that\n  are often reused. It also allows us to improve parsing speed of HTTP requests. \n\n### CHANGES\n\n- Nima: [4748](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4748)\n- Nima: a few optimizations [4809](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4809)\n- Nima: Config and name [4802](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/pull/4802)\n- Nima: Use a single SocketHttpClient.

          "content": "Development Guidelines\n------------\n\nThis document provides a list of rules and best practices followed by project Helidon.\nPlease follow these rules when contributing to the project, when refactoring existing code and when\nreviewing changes done by others.\n\nSome of these rules are enforced by checkstyle, some are checked during code reviews.\n\n**Exceptions to these rules should be documented clearly.**\n\n# General coding rules\n1. Use unchecked Throwables - descendants of RuntimeException in API\n    1. Never use RuntimeException directly - always create a descendant appropriate for your module, or\n       use an existing exception declared in the module\n    2. Our APIs should never throw a checked exception unless enforced by implemented/extended interface - e.g. when\n       we implement a java.io.Closeable, we must declare the checked exception.\n    3. In some cases we may use existing runtime exceptions if they fit the problem (`NoSuchElementException`, `IllegalStateException`)\n2. Usage of `null` is discouraged and should not exist in any public APIs of Helidon\n    1. If a method accepts a `null`, refactor it to a different approach\n        - a setter: create a method to remove the field value rather than setting a `null` value \n            (such as `host(String)` to set a host, and `unsetHost()` to revert to default value)\n        - other methods:\n            - if there is a low number of combinations (up to 2), create another method without the parameter\n            - otherwise create a parameter object that uses a builder to configure optional parameters\n        - never use `java.util.Optional` as a parameter type\n    2. If a method would return `null`, return `java.util.Optional` instead\n\n\n# Package and module structure\n1. We use flat package structure\n    1. Each module (maven and jigsaw) has a single implementation package\n        1. Each maven jar packaging module used outside of testing is also a jigsaw module \n    2. Module may have an additional package \"spi\" for classes related to service provider interface (extensibility)\n    3. Unit testing is enabled through package local access (not public!)\n    4. Be aware that any public class and its public methods are part of Helidon API and will require careful maintenance\n    5. Do not rely on java module system (JPMS/Jigsaw) to enforce visibility\n    6. If a set of classes seems to require a separate package, it is a good candidate for a separate module\n        1. Example: _there could be a package for each \"abac\" module in \"abac\" security provider. Even though these modules \n            are mostly very small, these were extracted to standalone modules, not to break the rule of flat package \n            structure. In general this helps enforce the rule of separation of concerns - if you feel you need a new package, \n            in most cases you are putting together different concerns in a single module._\n2. Naming conventions of maven modules, maven module directories and package names are connected:\n    1. Directories: name of the directory is module name (referred to as ${module_name} further in this document)\n        1. For pom packaging, the module is a \"project module\" (considering modules that serve as aggregators for sub-modules \n            into a common reactor)\n    2. Maven coordinates:\n        1. Group id: io.helidon.${project_module}* - such as io.helidon.reactive.webserver; io.helidon.microprofile.config\n        2. Artifact id: helidon-${module_name}(-project)? - such as \"helidon-security\", \"helicon-security-project\", \n            where project modules use the suffix \"-project\"\n        3. Version: always inherited\n    3. Package names:\n        1. io.helidon.${project_module}*.${module_name} - e.g. io.helidon.security, io.helidon.security.providers.common\n\n# Configuration and programmatic API\n1. **Everything that can be done using config, must be possible using programmatic approach through builders**\n    1. Exceptions:\n        1. CDI components configured from a CDI Extension\n2. Everything that can be done using builders should be possible also using configuration, \n        except for cases that would mandate usage of reflection \n        (such an exception may be configuration of Routing in WebServer - nevertheless we still may support \n            it (emphasis on \"may\" rather than \"should\"), or configuration of security for Jersey resources)\n3. When accepting config as a parameter, we should expect the config is located on the node that contains our configuration\n    (such as in ServerConfiguration in WebServer)\n4. Config keys:\n    1. Use lower case words separated by dashes \n        (e.g. \"token-endpoint-uri\", NOT \"tokenEndpointUri\")\n    2. May be nested in a tree structure (e.g. outbound-token.name, outbound-token.algorithm)\n    3. The following properties may be used by a component:\n        1. Required: component will fail to build when such a configuration property is missing\n        2. Default: component has a well defined and documented default value for such a property\n        3. Optional: component behaves in a well defined and documented manner if such a property is not \n            configured (e.g. a component may expect tracing endpoint - if not defined, tracing may be disabled)         \n5. We have introduced `helidon-builder` module, see [Builders](#Builders)\n\n# Getters and Setters\n1. We do not use the verb, e.g. when a property \"port\" exists, the following methods are used:  \n    1. port(int newPort)\n    2. int port()\n2. Boolean depends on how well understood the method is\n    1. Default is without a verb (e.g. authenticate(boolean atn), boolean authenticate())\n    2. If this would be ambiguous, we can use verb to clear the meaning (e.g. isAuthenticated() or shouldAuthenticate())      \n\nExample: [io.helidon.security.providers.oidc.common.OidcConfig](security/providers/oidc-common/src/main/java/io/helidon/security/providers/oidc/common/OidcConfig.java) \n\n# Fluent API\n1. We use fluent API where applicable\n    1. In builders (see builders section below)\n    2. When using control methods (such as Server server = Server.create().start())\n    \n# Builders\nWe have introduced code generation for builders that enforces the rules mentioned below.\n\nSee [helidon-builder](builder/README.md) for more details about modules, and [helidon-builder-api](builder/api/README.md) for explanation of APIs and naming rules. The `Blueprint` approach should be used for all builders (and the API of the prototype). Exceptions must be consulted with project architect (this may result in either changing the processor to support the required feature, or in removing such feature and redesigning the problem, or in an exception (documented) to the rule).\n\n\n1. We use builders to create instances that need any parameters for construction\n    1. **This implies that there are no public API classes that would use public constructors**\n    2. Allowed exceptions to this rule:\n        1. Integration APIs that follow rules of integrated solution, e.g. Jersey SecurityFeature\n        2. APIs that must be capable of reflection instantiation by tools that only support \n            public constructors\n        3. Exceptions with constructors for string, and string and a throwable\n2. Class or interface using a builder (let's call ours \"FooBar\" for the purpose of this document)\n    1. Must have:   \n        1. Hidden constructor (private or protected) - this is to allow us to switch to interface if needed\n        2. method _public static Builder builder()_             \n        3. all fields obtained from builder declared as final (immutable)\n    2. May have:\n        1. method _public static Builder builder(?)_ - builder with mandatory or very commonly used parameters\n            - there should be a very small number of \"builder(*)\" methods - up to two per class\n        2. Factory method _public static FooBar create()_ that is implemented as \"return builder().build()\"\n        3. Factory method _public static create(io.helidon.config.Config config)_ that is implemented as \n            \"return builder().config(config).build()\"\n        4. Other factory methods that build specific (predefined) instances, such as \"fail(String cause)\", \n            \"success(Subject subject)\" etc. - **these methods MUST use builder to build the instance internally**\n        5. An internal class named \"Builder\" that is building instances of the containing class\n            1. it is allowed to have the builder as a top level class, in such a case the name must reflect the class it is \n                building (e.g. FooBarBuilder)\n        \nExample: [io.helidon.faulttolerance.RetryConfigBlueprint](nima/fault-tolerance/fault-tolerance/src/main/java/io/helidon/nima/faulttolerance/RetryConfigBlueprint.java)\n\n# JPMS\n1. Each java module that is released has a `module-info.java`\n2. Provided services of released modules are declared ONLY in `module-info.java`, `META-INF/services` is generated  \n        automatically by a Maven plugin. `META-INF/services` in sources of released modules will fail the build\n3. Javadoc is using modules, so do not forget to add javadoc to `module-info.java`\n4. Provided and used services should be always using fully qualified class names\n    \n# Testing\n\nWe use JUnit 5 with Hamcrest assertions.\n\nThe Hamcrest assertion API differs a lot from JUnit assertion API and when both are used,\n the tests are hard to read.\n \nWe have chosen the Hamcrest approach:\n- assertThat(actualValue, assertion(expectedValue))\n\nMain import: `import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;` - the main method to be used\n\nMost commonly used assertions are available in `org.hamcrest.CoreMatchers`:\n1. is() - assertion of equality: `assertThat(value, is(true)))`\n2. notNullValue() - assertion of a non-null value: `assertThat(value, notNullValue())`\n3. nullValue() - assertion of null value: `assertThat(value, nullValue())`\n4. startsWith(String) - assertion that string is prefixed: `assertThat(value, startWith(\"a\"))`\n5. endsWith(String) - assertion that string is suffixed: `assertThat(value, endsWith(\"b\"))`\n\nFor other nice assertions see the CoreMatchers class or google ;)\n\nThe following assertions may be used from JUnit 5:\n1. `import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertAll;` - doing multiple assertions at once (more than one may fail)\n2. `import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;` - asserting that an expression throws an exception\n\n\n**Example of why we have this rule:**\n\nOriginal assertion:\n```java\nassertTrue(ex.getMessage().contains(\"'\" + config.key() + \"'\"));\n```\nThe output of the test was:\n`Expected: true, actual: false`\n\nRefactored assertion:\n```java\nassertThat(ex.getMessage(), containsString(\"'\" + config.key() + \"'\"));\n```\n\nNew output:\n```\nExpected: a string containing \"'list-1'\"\nbut: was \"Requested value for configuration key 'list-1.1' is not present in the configuration.\"\n```\n\n# Maven\n1. All third party versions are managed\n    1. Plugins\n    2. Dependencies (`dependencies/pom.xml`)\n2. Adding a new third party dependency (or upgrading to a newer version) requires an \n    internal process to be carried out. In such cases a delay is to be expected when merging.\n3. There is no need to use a version when referencing other modules, as all modules are managed in bom/pom.xml, and that is\n    part of the maven tree\n4. In pom.xml of a module, always define a \"name\" tag and follow naming conventions already used\n    1. For project module: Helidon ${module_name} Project\n    2. For java module: Helidon ${module_name}\n    3. The name should be \"reactor\" friendly - it should not overflow\n    4. The name is a name, not a sentence - it does not have to be grammatically correct \n5. All java modules that are expected to be used by our users MUST be defined in our [bom pom](bom/pom.xml)\n6. Bundles may be created, though we still must give our users the freedom to pick and choose modules directly\n    1. Avoid bundling third party dependencies that may bring unexpected libraries in (e.g. Google Login provider)\n    2. $root/bundles - SE bundles (groupId: io.helidon.bundles)\n    3. microprofile/bundles - MP bundles\n    4. Bundles are for end users, not for internal use\n7. Java EE components and Microprofile specifications should be in \"provided\" scope unless you are implementing\n    the spec itself\n    1. Analyze the dependencies of your module and choose the correct maven scope and module-info.java dependency declaration\n    2. Mapping to module-info.java\n        1. compile -> requires\n        2. optional -> requires static\n        3. provided -> requires\n        4. runtime -> \"requires\" or \"requires static\" depending on requirements\n                    note that \"requires static\" only works if the module is required by any other module used, otherwise\n                    it does not end up on module path even if it is on the class path \n    3. Use transitive in module-info.java for your dependencies that are part of public API of the module\n8. Carefully choose scope for dependencies on other helidon modules (e.g. microprofile extensions should have\n    helidon microprofile in \"provided\" scope)"

With Helidon 4 you get the high throughput of a reactive server with the simplicity of thread-per-request style programming.\n\nThe Helidon SE API in Helidon 4 has changed significantly from Helidon 3. The use of virtual threads has enabled these APIs to change from asynchronous to blocking. This results in much simpler code that is easier to write, maintain, debug and understand. Earlier Helidon SE code will require modification to run on these new APIs. For more information see the [Helidon SE Upgrade Guide](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/#/se/guides/upgrade_4x).\n\nHelidon 4 supports MicroProfile 6. This means your existing Helidon MP 3.x applications will run on Helidon 4 with only minor modifications. And since Helidon’s MicroProfile server is based on the new Níma WebServer you get all the benefits of running on virtual threads. For more information see the [Helidon MP Upgrade Guide](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/#/mp/guides/upgrade_4x).\n\nNew to Helidon? Then jump in and [get started](https://helidon.io/docs/v4/#/about/prerequisites).\n\nJava 21 is required to use Helidon 4.\n\n\n## License\n\nHelidon is available under Apache License 2.0.\n\n## Documentation\n\nLatest documentation and javadocs are available at <https://helidon.io/docs/latest>.\n\nHelidon White Paper is available [here](https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/technical-brief--helidon-report.pdf).\n\n## Get Started\n\nSee Getting Started at <https://helidon.io>.\n\n## Downloads / Accessing Binaries\n\nThere are no Helidon downloads. Just use our Maven releases (GroupID `io.helidon`).\nSee Getting Started at <https://helidon.io>. \n\n## Helidon CLI\n\nmacOS:\n```bash\ncurl -O https://helidon.io/cli/latest/darwin/helidon\nchmod +x ./helidon\nsudo mv ./helidon /usr/local/bin/\n```\n\nLinux:\n```bash\ncurl -O https://helidon.io/cli/latest/linux/helidon\nchmod +x ./helidon\nsudo mv ./helidon /usr/local/bin/\n```\n\nWindows:\n```bat\nPowerShell -Command Invoke-WebRequest -Uri \"https://helidon.io/cli/latest/windows/helidon.exe\" -OutFile \"C:\\Windows\\system32\\helidon.exe\"\n```\n\nSee this [document](HELIDON-CLI.md) for more info.\n\n## Build\n\nYou need JDK 21 to build Helidon 4.\n\nYou also need Maven. We recommend 3.8.0 or newer.\n\n**Full build**\n```bash\n$ mvn install\n```\n\n**Checkstyle**\n```bash\n# cd to the component you want to check\n$ mvn validate  -Pcheckstyle\n```\n\n**Copyright**\n\n```bash\n# cd to the component you want to check\n$ mvn validate  -Pcopyright\n```\n\n**Spotbugs**\n\n```bash\n# cd to the component you want to check\n$ mvn verify  -Pspotbugs\n```\n\n**Documentation**\n\n```bash\n# At the root of the project\n$ mvn site\n```\n\n**Build Scripts**\n\nBuild scripts are located in `etc/scripts`. These are primarily used by our pipeline,\nbut a couple are handy to use on your desktop to verify your changes. \n\n* `copyright.sh`: Run a full copyright check\n* `checkstyle.sh`: Run a full style check\n\n## Get Help\n\n* See the [Helidon FAQ](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/wiki/FAQ)\n* Ask questions on Stack Overflow using the [helidon tag](https://stackoverflow.com/tags/helidon)\n* Join us on Slack: [#helidon-users](http://slack.helidon.io)\n\n## Contributing\n\n* Learn how to [contribute](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* See [issues](https://github.com/oracle/helidon/issues) for issues you can help with\n\n## Stay Informed\n\n* Twitter: [@helidon_project](https://twitter.com/helidon_project)\n* Blog: [Helidon on Medium](https://medium.com/helidon)\n"

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\n--------------------------------------------\nFourth Party Dependencies\n--------------------------------------------\n\"Hibernate Commons Annotations\" (org.hibernate.common:hibernate-commons-annotations)\n  Copyright (c) 2001-2022 Red Hat, Inc.

The Initial Developer Grant.\n     The Initial Developer hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,\n     non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property\n     claims:\n          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n          trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce,\n          modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original\n          Code (or portions thereof) with or without Modifications, and/or\n          as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n          (b) under Patents Claims infringed by the making, using or\n          selling of Original Code, to make, have made, use, practice,\n          sell, and offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the\n          Original Code (or portions thereof).\n\n          (c) the licenses granted in this Section 2.1(a) and (b) are\n          effective on the date Initial Developer first distributes\n          Original Code under the terms of this License.\n\n          (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\n          granted: 1) for code that You delete from the Original Code; 2)\n          separate from the Original Code;  or 3) for infringements caused\n          by: i) the modification of the Original Code or ii) the\n          combination of the Original Code with other software or devices.\n\n     2.2. Contributor Grant.\n     Subject to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor\n     hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license\n\n          (a)  under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n          trademark) Licensable by Contributor, to use, reproduce, modify,\n          display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\n          created by such Contributor (or portions thereof) either on an\n          unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Code\n          and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n          (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or\n          selling of  Modifications made by that Contributor either alone\n          and/or in combination with its Contributor Version (or portions\n          of such combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have\n          made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 1) Modifications made by that\n          Contributor (or portions thereof); and 2) the combination of\n          Modifications made by that Contributor with its Contributor\n          Version (or portions of such combination).\n\n          (c) the licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are\n          effective on the date Contributor first makes Commercial Use of\n          the Covered Code.\n\n          (d)    Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n          granted: 1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n          Contributor Version; 2)  separate from the Contributor Version;\n          3)  for infringements caused by: i) third party modifications of\n          Contributor Version or ii)  the combination of Modifications made\n          by that Contributor with other software  (except as part of the\n          Contributor Version) or other devices; or 4) under Patent Claims\n          infringed by Covered Code in the absence of Modifications made by\n          that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n     3.1. Application of License.\n     The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are\n     governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation\n     Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be\n     distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version\n     of this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a\n     copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You\n     distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code\n     version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this\n     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include\n     an additional document offering the additional rights described in\n     Section 3.5.\n\n     3.2. Availability of Source Code.\n     Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be\n     made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License\n     either on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an\n     Executable version available; and if made available via Electronic\n     Distribution Mechanism, must remain available for at least twelve (12)\n     months after the date it initially became available, or at least six\n     (6) months after a subsequent version of that particular Modification\n     has been made available to such recipients. You are responsible for\n     ensuring that the Source Code version remains available even if the\n     Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by a third party.\n\n     3.3. Description of Modifications.\n     You must cause all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain a\n     file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and\n     the date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that\n     the Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original\n     Code provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the\n     Initial Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an\n     Executable version or related documentation in which You describe the\n     origin or ownership of the Covered Code.\n\n     3.4. Intellectual Property Matters\n          (a) Third Party Claims.\n          If Contributor has knowledge that a license under a third party's\n          intellectual property rights is required to exercise the rights\n          granted by such Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2,\n          Contributor must include a text file with the Source Code\n          distribution titled \"LEGAL\" which describes the claim and the\n          party making the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will\n          know whom to contact. If Contributor obtains such knowledge after\n          the Modification is made available as described in Section 3.2,\n          Contributor shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies\n          Contributor makes available thereafter and shall take other steps\n          (such as notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)\n          reasonably calculated to inform those who received the Covered\n          Code that new knowledge has been obtained.\n\n          (b) Contributor APIs.\n          If Contributor's Modifications include an application programming\n          interface and Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which\n          are reasonably necessary to implement that API, Contributor must\n          also include this information in the LEGAL file.\n\n               (c)    Representations.\n          Contributor represents that, except as disclosed pursuant to\n          Section 3.4(a) above, Contributor believes that Contributor's\n          Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s) and/or\n          Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by\n          this License.\n\n     3.5. Required Notices.\n     You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source\n     Code.  If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source\n     Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a\n     location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely\n     to look for such a notice.  If You created one or more Modification(s)\n     You may add your name as a Contributor to the notice described in\n     Exhibit A.  You must also duplicate this License in any documentation\n     for the Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership\n     rights relating to Covered Code.  You may choose to offer, and to\n     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability\n     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You\n     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than\n     any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is\n     offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial\n     Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the\n     Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty,\n     support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n     3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n     You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the\n     requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered Code,\n     and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of\n     the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License,\n     including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the\n     obligations of Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included\n     in any notice in an Executable version, related documentation or\n     collateral in which You describe recipients' rights relating to the\n     Covered Code. You may distribute the Executable version of Covered\n     Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which may\n     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in\n     compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the\n     Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's\n     rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this\n     License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different\n     license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ\n     from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial\n     Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the\n     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by\n     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such\n     terms You offer.\n\n     3.7. Larger Works.\n     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other code\n     not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\n     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the\n     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.\n\n     If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\n     License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to\n     statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\n     the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\n     describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description\n     must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must\n     be included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the\n     extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be\n     sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to\n     understand it.\n\n5. Application of this License.\n\n     This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has\n     attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Covered Code.\n\n6. Versions of the License.\n\n     6.1. New Versions.\n     Netscape Communications Corporation (\"Netscape\") may publish revised\n     and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version\n     will be given a distinguishing version number.\n\n     6.2. Effect of New Versions.\n     Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the\n     License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that\n     version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms\n     of any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one\n     other than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to\n     Covered Code created under this License.\n\n     6.3. Derivative Works.\n     If You create or use a modified version of this License (which you may\n     only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered Code\n     governed by this License), You must (a) rename Your license so that\n     the phrases \"Mozilla\", \"MOZILLAPL\", \"MOZPL\", \"Netscape\",\n     \"MPL\", \"NPL\" or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your\n     license (except to note that your license differs from this License)\n     and (b) otherwise make it clear that Your version of the license\n     contains terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and\n     Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial\n     Developer, Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in\n     Exhibit A shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of\n     this License.)\n\n7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n     COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,\n     WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF\n     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.\n     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE\n     IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,\n     YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE\n     COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER\n     OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF\n     ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n8. TERMINATION.\n\n     8.1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure\n     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All\n     sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall\n     survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their\n     nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License\n     shall survive.\n\n     8.2.  If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement\n     claim (excluding declatory judgment actions) against Initial Developer\n     or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom\n     You file such action is referred to as \"Participant\")  alleging that:\n\n     (a)  such Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly\n     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted by such\n     Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License\n     shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively,\n     unless if within 60 days after receipt of notice You either: (i)\n     agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable reasonable\n     royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such\n     Participant, or (ii) withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to\n     the Contributor Version against such Participant.  If within 60 days\n     of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not\n     mutually agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim\n     is not withdrawn, the rights granted by Participant to You under\n     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of\n     the 60 day notice period specified above.\n\n     (b)  any software, hardware, or device, other than such Participant's\n     Contributor Version, directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then\n     any rights granted to You by such Participant under Sections 2.1(b)\n     and 2.2(b) are revoked effective as of the date You first made, used,\n     sold, distributed, or had made, Modifications made by that\n     Participant.\n\n     8.3.  If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n     alleging that such Participant's Contributor Version directly or\n     indirectly infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as\n     by license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n     license.\n\n     8.4.  In the event of termination under Sections 8.1 or 8.2 above,\n     all end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers)\n     which have been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder\n     prior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL\n     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE,\n     OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR\n     ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY\n     CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,\n     WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER\n     COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN\n     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF\n     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY\n     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW\n     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE\n     EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO\n     THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n     The Covered Code is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined in\n     48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n     software\" and \"commercial computer software documentation,\" as such\n     terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48\n     C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995),\n     all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those\n     rights set forth herein.\n\n11. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n     California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if\n     any, provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.\n     With respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of,\n     or an entity chartered or registered to do business in the United\n     States of America, any litigation relating to this License shall be\n     subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern\n     District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,\n     California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including\n     without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and\n     expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on\n     Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.\n     Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract\n     shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to this\n     License.\n\n12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n13. MULTIPLE-LICENSED CODE.\n\n     Initial Developer may designate portions of the Covered Code as\n     \"Multiple-Licensed\".  \"Multiple-Licensed\" means that the Initial\n     Developer permits you to utilize portions of the Covered Code under\n     Your choice of the MPL or the alternative licenses, if any, specified\n     by the Initial Developer in the file described in Exhibit A.\n\nEXHIBIT A -Mozilla Public License.\n\n     ``The contents of this file are subject to the Mozilla Public License\n     Version 1.1 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in\n     compliance with the License.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\n\tLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n\tsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n\tGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n\tFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n\tusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n\tthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n\tyour programs, too.\n\n\t  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n\tprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n\thave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n\tthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n\tif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n\tin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n\t  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n\tanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n\tThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n\tdistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n\t  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n\tgratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n\tyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n\tsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n\trights.\n\n\t  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n\t(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n\tdistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n\t  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n\tthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n\tsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n\twant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n\tthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n\tauthors' reputations.\n\n\t  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n\tpatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n\tprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n\tprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n\tpatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n\t  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n\tmodification follow.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\t   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n\t  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n\ta notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n\tunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n\trefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n\tmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n\tthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n\teither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n\tlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n\tthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n\tActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n\tcovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n\trunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n\tis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n\tProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n\tWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n\t  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n\tsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n\tconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n\tcopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n\tnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n\tand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n\talong with the Program.\n\n\tYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n\tyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n\t  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n\tof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n\tdistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n\tabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n\t\ta) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n\t\tstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n\t\tb) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n\t\twhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n\t\tpart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n\t\tparties under the terms of this License.\n\n\t\tc) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n\t\twhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n\t\tinteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n\t\tannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n\t\tnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n\t\ta warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n\t\tthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n\t\tLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n\t\tdoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n\t\tthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\n\tThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\n\tidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\n\tand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\n\tthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\n\tsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\n\tdistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\n\ton the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\n\tthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\n\tentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\n\tThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\n\tyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\n\texercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\n\tcollective works based on the Program.\n\n\tIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\n\twith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\n\ta storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\n\tthe scope of this License.\n\n\t  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\n\tunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\n\tSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n\t\ta) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n\t\tsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n\t\t1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n\t\tb) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n\t\tyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n\t\tcost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n\t\tmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n\t\tdistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n\t\tcustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n\t\tc) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n\t\tto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n\t\tallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n\t\treceived the program in object code or executable form with such\n\t\tan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\n\tThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n\tmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\n\tcode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\n\tassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\n\tcontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\n\tspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\n\tanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\n\tform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\n\toperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\n\titself accompanies the executable.\n\n\tIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\n\taccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\n\taccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\n\tdistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\n\tcompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n\t  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\n\texcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\n\totherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\n\tvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\n\tHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\n\tthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\n\tparties remain in full compliance.\n\n\t  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n\tsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n\tdistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\n\tprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n\tmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\n\tProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n\tall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n\tthe Program or works based on it.\n\n\t  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\n\tProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n\toriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\n\tthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n\trestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n\tYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\n\tthis License.\n\n\t  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n\tinfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n\tconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n\totherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n\texcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n\tdistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n\tLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n\tmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\n\tlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\n\tall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n\tthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n\trefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\n\tIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\n\tany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\n\tapply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\n\tcircumstances.\n\n\tIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n\tpatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n\tsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n\tintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\n\timplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n\tgenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n\tthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n\tsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n\tto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n\timpose that choice.\n\n\tThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n\tbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n\t  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\n\tcertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n\toriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\n\tmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\n\tthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\n\tcountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\n\tthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n\t  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\n\tof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\n\tbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\n\taddress new problems or concerns.\n\n\tEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\n\tspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\n\tlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\n\teither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\n\tSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\n\tthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\n\tFoundation.\n\n\t  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\n\tprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\n\tto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\n\tSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\n\tmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\n\tof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\n\tof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNO WARRANTY\n\n\t  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\n\tFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\n\tOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\n\tPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\n\tOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\n\tMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\n\tTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\n\tPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\n\tREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n\t  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\n\tWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\n\tREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\n\tINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\n\tOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\n\tTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\n\tYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\n\tPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\n\tPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n\t\t\t\tHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n\t  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\n\tpossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\n\tfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n\t  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\n\tto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n\tconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n\tthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\t\t<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n\t\tCopyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n\t\tThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n\t\tit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n\t\tthe Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n\t\t(at your option) any later version.\n\n\t\tThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n\t\tbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n\t\tMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n\t\tGNU General Public License for more details.\n\n\t\tYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n\t\twith this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n\t\t51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\n\tAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n\tIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\n\twhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n\t\tGnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n\t\tGnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n\t\tThis is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n\t\tunder certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\n\tThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\n\tparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\n\tbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\n\tmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\n\tYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\n\tschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\n\tnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n\t  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n\t  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n\t  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n\t  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\n\tThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\n\tproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\n\tconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\n\tlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\n\tPublic License instead of this License.\n===========================================================================================================\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nlog4j-jpl  The Apache Software Foundation\nApache 2.0\nUsed by: [helidon-logging-log4j]\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nApache Log4j JDK Platform Logging Adapter (org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-jpl)\n--------------------------------------------\nCopyright 1999-2021 Apache Software Foundation\n\nThis product includes software developed at\nThe Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).\n--------------------------------------------\nSee full text at the bottom of this document for license: Apache-2.0\n--------------------------------------------\nFourth Party Dependencies\n--------------------------------------------\n\"Apache Log4j API\" (org.apache.logging.log4j:log4j-api)\nCopyright 1999-2021 Apache Software Foundation\nApache License 2.0\n\nThis product includes software developed at\nThe Apache Software Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).\n--------------------------------------------\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nmetrics-core  Dropwizard Team\nApache 2.0\nUsed by: [helidon-dbclient-metrics-hikari]\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nMetrics Core (io.dropwizard.metrics:metrics-core)\n    Copyright (c) 2010-2013 Coda Hale, Yammer.com, 2014-2021 Dropwizard Team\n    Published under Apache Software License 2.0, see LICENSE\n--------------------------------------------\nSee full text at the bottom of this document for license: Apache-2.0\n--------------------------------------------\nFourth Party Dependencies\n--------------------------------------------\n\"SLF4J API Module\" (org.slf4j:slf4j-api)\n  Copyright (c) 2004-2011 QOS.ch\n\nThe MIT License SPDX short identifier: MIT\n\nFurther resources on the MIT License Copyright <YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDER>\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\nOF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n     documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n     i) changes to the Program, and\n     ii) additions to the Program;\n     where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate\n     from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A\n     Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added\n     to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting\n     on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include\n     additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of\n     software distributed in conjunction with the Program under\n     their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works\n     of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the\nProgram.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\nalone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with\nthis Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n     grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n     license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\n     publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of\n     such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code\n     and object code form.\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement,\n     each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n     royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use,\n     sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution\n     of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\n     This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution\n     and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\n     Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination\n     to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not\n     apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No\n     hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n  c) Recipient understands\n     that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions\n     set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor\n     that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\n     property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any\n     liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based\n     on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a\n     condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder,\n     each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any\n     other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if\n     a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\n     distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire\n     that license before distributing the Program.\n  d) Each Contributor\n     represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights\n     in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set\n     forth in this Agreement.\n\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code\nform under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n  a)  it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n  b)  its license agreement:\n  i)  effectively disclaims on behalf of all\n      Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied,\n      including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement,\n      and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n      for a particular purpose;\n  ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all\n      Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect,\n      special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n  iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement\n      are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party;\n      and\n  iv) states that source code for the Program is available from\n      such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n      reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\n      software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy\n  of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\nwithin the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\nContribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\nRecipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While\nthis license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the\nProgram, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering should do so in a manner which does not create\npotential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any\nlosses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from\nclaims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\nacts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with\nits distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering.\nThe obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.\nIn order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly\nnotify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b)\nallow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the\nCommercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any\nsuch claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have\nto defend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\nANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited\nto the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT\nNOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT,\nINDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES\n(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON\nANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR\nTORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF\nTHE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\nof the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to\nthe minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\nenforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging\nthat the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with\nother software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s),\nthen such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall\nterminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of\nthis Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period\nof time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease\nuse and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any\nlicenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\nand survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted\nand may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement\nSteward reserves the right to publish new versions (including\nrevisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than\nthe Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The\nEclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse\nFoundation may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement\nSteward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\nAgreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\n(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the\nversion of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition,\nafter a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may\nelect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under\nthe new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and\n2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\nintellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\nwhether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights\nin the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are\nreserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\nthe intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No\nparty to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement\nmore than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party\nwaives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nEPL-2.0-plus-GPLv2-CPE\nEclipse Public License - v 2.0\n\n    THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE\n    PUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\").

This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise.

REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time.

The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\nCLASSPATH EXCEPTION\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\nmaking a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\nconditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\ncombination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\nmodules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\nterms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\nindependent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\nmodule.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\nbased on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\nexception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\ndo so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\nfrom your version.\n\n=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=\nLGPL-2.1-only\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2.1, February 1999\n\nCopyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\n[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts\nas the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\nthe version number 2.1.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode. If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License. It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs. These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries. However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\nGNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\na) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\nb) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\nc) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\ncharge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\nd) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\ntable of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\nthe facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\nis invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\nin the event an application does not supply such function or\ntable, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\nits purpose remains meaningful.\n\n(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\na purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\napplication. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\napplication-supplied function or table used by this function must\nbe optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\nroot function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\". The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\na) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\nmachine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\nchanges were used in the work (which must be distributed under\nSections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\nwith the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\nuses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\nexecutable containing the modified Library. (It is understood\nthat the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\nLibrary will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\nto use the modified definitions.)\n\nb) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\nLibrary. A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\ncopy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\nrather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\nwill operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\nthe user installs one, as long as the modified version is\ninterface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\nc) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\nleast three years, to give the same user the materials\nspecified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\nthan the cost of performing this distribution.\n\nd) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\nspecified materials from the same place.\n\ne) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\nmaterials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\na) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\nbased on the Library, uncombined with any other library\nfacilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the\nSections above.\n\nb) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\nthat part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\nwhere to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License. However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices. Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission. For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is\nsafest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n\nCopyright (C) \n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\nLesser General Public License for more details.\n\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\nFoundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if\nnecessary.
