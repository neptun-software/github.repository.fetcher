Great!\n\nThe easiest way to contribute is to provide test images for the [image database](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-images/wiki).\n\nCheck the [issues list](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-dotnet/issues)\nfor tasks that need attention. If you have something else in mind, that's great too.\nIf you want to have your pull request merged, it's probably best to discuss the idea on\nthe mailing list first.\n\nThere are a few simple but important guidelines for pull requests. Code not meeting\nthese guidelines will need to be amended before being accepted.\n\n* **Keep your commits short and sweet.** Only change one thing at a time, and clearly\n  identify the change in the commit message. See the recent project history for an\n  idea of what this means.\n\n* **Keep your PRs short and sweet.** If you have several features you wish to contribute,\n  split them out into separate PRs.\n\n* **Match the existing code style.** This include things like brace placement, indentation\n  (spaces not tabs), and so on.\n  \n* **No 'churn'.** If your IDE changes lots of code automatically, turn that feature off or\n  use a more friendly IDE. If you think a wide-sweeping change should be applied to\n  the codebase, please discuss that on the mailing list and, if agreed, it will be\n  made in a single commit to all code.\n\n* **Run the regression tests.** The process is [described here](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/wiki/Working-with-test-images).\n\nThe goal of these guidelines is to make your contribution clearer to read and review for\nall, both now and in the future.\n\nIf you're new to GitHub's pull request model, [this article](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)\nmight be helpful.\n"

is a Java library for reading metadata from media files.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe easiest way is to install the library via its [Maven package](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.drewnoakes%22%20AND%20a%3A%22metadata-extractor%22).\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.drewnoakes</groupId>\n  <artifactId>metadata-extractor</artifactId>\n  <version>2.19.0</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nAlternatively, download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/releases).\n\n## Usage\n\n```java\nMetadata metadata = ImageMetadataReader.readMetadata(imagePath);\n```\n\nWith that `Metadata` instance, you can [iterate or query](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/wiki/Getting-Started-(Java)#2-query-tags) the\n[various tag values](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/wiki/SampleOutput) that were read from the image.\n\n## Features\n\nThe library understands several formats of metadata, many of which may be present in a single image:\n\n* [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchangeable_image_file_format)\n* [IPTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPTC)\n*

library.\n\n## Questions & Feedback\n\nThe quickest way to have your questions answered is via [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/metadata-extractor).\nCheck whether your question has already been asked, and if not, ask a new one tagged with both `metadata-extractor` and `java`.\n\nBugs and feature requests should be provided via the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/issues).\nPlease attach sample images where possible as most issues cannot be investigated without an image.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you want to get your hands dirty, making a pull request is a great way to enhance the library.\nIn general it's best to create an issue first that captures the problem you want to address.\nYou can discuss your proposed solution in that issue.\nThis gives others a chance to provide feedback before you spend your valuable time working on it.\n\nAn easier way to help is to contribute to the [sample image file library](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-images/wiki) used for research and testing.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis library is developed by [Drew Noakes](https://drewnoakes.com/code/exif/).\n\nThanks are due to the many [users](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor/wiki/UsedBy) who sent in suggestions, bug reports,\n[sample images](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-images/wiki) from their cameras as well as encouragement.\nWherever possible, they have been credited in the source code and commit logs.\n\n## Other languages\n\n- .NET  [metadata-extractor-dotnet](https://github.com/drewnoakes/metadata-extractor-dotnet) is a complete port to C#, maintained alongside this library\n- PHP [php-metadata-extractor](https://github.com/gomoob/php-metadata-extractor) wraps this Java project, making it available to users of PHP\n- Clojure [exif-processor](https://github.com/joshuamiller/exif-processor) wraps this Java project, returning a subset of data\n\n---\n\nMore information about this project is available at:\n\n*
