The person\nmaking you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what they are doing - politely bringing their\nbehavior to their attention is encouraged.\nIf you are uncomfortable speaking up, or feel that your concerns are not being duly considered, you\ncan email the Data Transfer Project mailing list to request involvement from a community manager. All concerns shared\nwith community managers will be kept confidential. While all reports will be taken seriously, the\nData Transfer Project community managers may not act on complaints that they feel are not violations of this code\nof conduct.\n\n## Enforcement\nConsequences for failing to comply with this policy may include, at the sole discretion of the\nData Transfer Project community managers:\n* a request for an apology;\n* a private or public warning or reprimand;\n* a temporary ban from the mailing list, blog, Data Transfer Project repository or organization, or other\nData Transfer Project-supported communication group, including loss of committer status;\n* a permanent ban from any of the above, or from all current and future Data Transfer Project-supported or\nGoogle-supported communities, including loss of committer status.\nParticipants warned to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately; failure to do\nso will result in an escalation of consequences.\nThe decisions of the Data Transfer Project community managers may be appealed via Data Transfer Project\nmailing list.\n\n## Acknowledgements\nThis Code of Conduct is based on Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,\navailable [here](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4)\n\n## License\nThis Code of Conduct is available for reuse under the Creative Commons Zero (CC0) license.\n"

You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,\nthis simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as\npart of the project. Head over to <https://cla-assistant.io/dtinit/data-transfer-project> to see\nyour current agreements on file or to sign a new one.\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one\n(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\nIf a CLA isn't signed within a couple weeks of submitting a PR, that PR might be\nclosed (though if a contributor is able to later sign the CLA and re-open the PR,\nthat's welcome).\n\n## Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose.\n\n### PR Titles\n\nTo automate releases we require that PRs are titled according to\n[conventional commits](https://conventionalcommits.org); i.e. that they\nare tagged like `fix: handle exception XYZ correctly`, or\n`feat: implement new video exporter`.

We provide a common framework and ecosystem to accept contributions from service providers to enable seamless transfer of data into and out of their service.\n\n## Who We Are\nData Transfer Project (DTP) is a collaboration of organizations committed to building a common framework with open-source code that can connect any two online service providers, enabling a seamless, direct transfer of data.\n\nWe want all individuals across the web to be in control of their data.\n\n## More info\n\n* [Repository master branch](https://github.com/dtinit/data-transfer-project)\n* [Developer documentation](Documentation/Developer.md)\n* [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n* [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)\n\n## Current State\nData Transfer Project is in its early stages, and we are actively looking for partner organizations and individuals to contribute to the project. We are continuing to define the architecture and implementation.  Since the code is in active development, please do thorough testing and verification before implementing.\n\n## Contact Info\nPlease contact [dtp-discuss@googlegroups.com](mailto:dtp-discuss@googlegroups.com)\nwith any questions or comments.\n\n## About Us\nThe Data Transfer Project was formed in 2017 to create an open-source, service-to-service portability platform so that all individuals across the web could easily move their data between online service providers.\n\nThe partners in the Data Transfer Project believe portability and interoperability are central to innovation. Making it easier for individuals to choose among services facilitates competition, empowers individuals to try new services and enables them to choose the offering that best suits their needs.\n\nWe anticipate the Data Transfer Project solution will make a particularly big impact in global markets where downloading or uploading data is expensive and/or slow. The Data Transfer Project eliminates the need to download data at all. Instead, data is transferred directly between service providers.\n\n\n#### DTP is early-stage open source code that is built and maintained entirely by DTP community members.\n"
