NUTCH-305 - Update crawl and url filter lists to exclude\n    jpeg|JPEG|bmp|BMP, suffix-urlfilter.txt (contributed by Stefan\n    Neufeind) is also updated (siren)\n    \n30. NUTCH-406 - Metadata tries to write null values (mattmann)\n\n31. NUTCH-415 - Generator should mark selected records in CrawlDb. \n    Due to increased resource consumption this step is optional. \n    Application-level locking has been added to prevent concurrent\n    modification of databases. (ab)\n\n32. NUTCH-416 - CrawlDatum status and CrawlDbReducer refactoring. It is\n    now possible to correctly update CrawlDb from multiple segments.\n    Introduce new status codes for temporary and permanent\n    redirection. (ab)\n\n33. NUTCH-322 - Fix Fetcher to store redirected pages and to store\n    protocol-level status. This also should fix NUTCH-273. (ab)\n\n34. Change default Fetcher behavior not to follow redirects immediately.\n    Instead Fetcher will record redirects as new pages to be added to CrawlDb.\n    This also partially addresses NUTCH-273. (ab)\n\n35. Detect and report when Generator creates 0-sized segments. (ab)\n\n36. Fix Injector to preserve already existing CrawlDatum if the seed list\n    being injected also contains such URL.

NUTCH-317 - Clarify what the queryLanguage argument of\n    Query.parse(...) means (jerome)\n\n70. Added alternative experimental web gui in contrib containing\n    extensions like subcollection, keymatch, user preferences,\n    caching, implemented mainly using tiles and jstl (siren)\n\n71. NUTCH-320 DmozParser does not output list of urls to stdout\n    but to a log file instead. Original functionality restored.\n\n72. NUTCH-271 - Add ability to limit crawling to the set of initially\n    injected hosts (db.ignore.external.links) (Philippe Eugene,\n    Stefan Neufeind via ab)\n\n73. NUTCH-293 - Support for Crawl-Delay (Stefan Groschupf via ab)\n\n74. NUTCH-327 - Fixed logging directory on cygwin (siren)\n\nRelease 0.7 - 2005-08-17\n\n 1. Added support for \"type:\" in queries. Search results are limited/qualified\n    by mimetype or its primary type or sub type. For example,\n    (1) searching with \"type:application/pdf\" restricts results\n    to pages which were identified to be of mimetype \"application/pdf\".\n    (2) with \"type:application\", nutch will return pages of\n    primary type \"application\".\n    (3) with \"type:pdf\", only pages of sub type \"pdf\" will be listed.\n    (John Xing, 20050120)\n\n 2. Added support for \"date:\" in queries. Last-Modified is indexed.\n    Search results are restricted by lower and upper date (inclusive)\n    as date:yyyymmdd-yyyymmdd. For example, date:20040101-20041231\n    only returns pages with Last-Modified in year 2004.\n    (John Xing, 20050122)\n\n 3. Add URLFilter plugin interface and convert existing url filters into\n    plugins. (John Xing, 20050206)\n\n 4. Add UpdateSegmentsFromDb tool, which updates the scores and\n    anchors of existing segments with the current values in the web\n    db.  This is used by CrawlTool, so that pages are now only fetched\n    once per crawl.  (Doug Cutting, 20050221)\n\n 5. Moved code into org.apache.nutch sub-packages.  Changed license to\n    Apache 2.0.  Removed jar files whose licenses do not permit\n    redistribution by Apache.  Disabled compilation of plugins which\n    require these libraries.  (Doug Cutting 20050301)\n\n 6. Index host and title in separate fields.  Host was indexed\n    previously only as a part of the URL.  Title was indexed as an\n    anchor.  Now boosts for matching these fields may be adjusted\n    separately from boosts for matching anchors and url.  Also: move\n    site indexing to index-basic plugin to minimize the number of\n    times the URL needs to be parsed; and, stop using anchor analyzer\n    for anything but anchors.  (Piotr Kosiorowski via Doug Cutting\n    20050323)\n\n 7. Add servlet Cached.java that serves cached Content of any mime type.\n    Slightly modified are web.xml and cached.jsp.\n    (John Xing, 20050401)\n\n 8. Add skipCompressedByteArray() to WritableUtils.java.\n    (John Xing, 20050402)\n\n 9. Fixes to jsp and static web pages.  These now use relative links,\n    so that the Nutch webapp file can be used in places other than at\n    the root.  Also fixed links to the about and help pages.  Bug #32.\n    (Jerome Charron via cutting, 20050404)\n\n10. Added some features to DistributedSearch: new segments can be added\n    to searchservers without restarting the frontend, defective search\n    servers are not queried until tey come back online, watchdog keeps\n    an eye for your searchservers and writes simple statistics.\n    (Sami Siren, 20050407)\n    \n11. Fix for bug #4 - Unbalanced quote in query eats all resources.\n\t(Piotr Kosiorowski, Sami Siren, 20050407)\n\n12. Close Issue #33 - MIME content type detector (using magic char sequences).\n    (Jerome Charron and Hari Kodungallur via John Xing, 20050416)\n\n13. Add a servlet that implements A9's OpenSearch RSS web service.\n    (cutting, 20050418)\n\n14. Remove references to link analysis from tutorial, and enable\n    scoring by link count when generating fetchlists and searching.\n    (cutting, 20040419)\n\n15. Make query boosts for host, title, anchor and phrase matches\n    configurable.  (Piotr Kosiorowski via cutting, 20050419)\n\n16. Add support for sorting search results and search-time deduping by\n    fields other than site.\n\n17. Automatically convert range queries into cached range filters.\n    This improves the performance and scalability of, e.g., date range\n    searching.\n\n18. Several methods have been renamed due to misspellings.  The old\n    methods have been deprecated and will be removed before the 1.0\n    release.\n\n\nRelease 0.6\n\n 1. Added clustering-carrot2 plugin, together with introduction of clustering\n    api and modification to search jsp. (Dawid Weiss via John Xing, 20040809)\n\n 2. Make a number of changes to NDFS (Nutch Distributed File System)\n    to fix bugs, add admin tools, etc.\n\n    Also, modify all command line tools so you can indicate whether to\n    use NDFS or the local filesystem.  If you indicate nothing, then\n    it defaults to the local fs.\n\n    I've used this to do a 35m page crawl via NDFS, distributed over a\n    dozen machines.  (Mike Cafarella)\n\n 3. Add support for BASE tags in HTML.  Outlinks are now correctly\n    extracted when a BASE tag is present.  (cutting)\n\n 4. Fix two bugs in result pagination.  When the last hit on a page\n    was the last hit overall, the \"next\" button was sometimes shown\n    when the \"show all\" button should be shown instead.  Also, in\n    certain cases, the \"show all\" button would be shown when the\n    \"next\" button should have been shown.  (cutting)\n\n 5. Add config parameter \"indexer.max.tokens\" that determines the\n    maximum number of tokens indexed per field.  (Andy Hedges via cutting)\n\n 6. Add parser for mp3 files.  (Andy Hedges via cutting)\n\n 7. Add RegexUrlNormalizer.  This is useful for things like stripping\n    out session IDs from URLs.  To use it, add values for\n    urlnormalizer.class and urlnormalizer.regex.file to your\n    nutch-site.xml.  The RegexUrlNormalizer class extends the\n    BasicUrlNormalizer, and does basic normalization as well.\n    (Luke Baker via cutting)\n\n 8. Added Swedish translation (Stefan Verzel via Sami Siren, 20040910)\n\n 9. Added Polish translation (Andrzej Bialecki, 20040911)\n \n10. Added 3 more language profiles to language identifier (ru,hu,pl).\n\tOther changes to language identifier: Porfiles converted to utf8,\n\tadded some test cases, changed the similarity calculation.\n\t(Sami Siren, 20040925)\n\n11. Added plugin parse-rtf (Andy Hedges via John Xing, 20040929)\n\n12. Added plugin index-more and more.jsp (John Xing, 20041003)\n\n13. Added \"View as Plain Text\" feature. A new op OP_PARSETEXT is introduced\n    in DistributedSearch.java. text.jsp is added. (John Xing, 20041006)\n\n14. Fixed a bug that fails cached.jsp, explain.jsp, anchors.jsp and text.jsp\n    (but not search.jsp) with NullPointerException in distributed search.\n    It seems that this bug appears after \"hits per site\" stuff is added.\n    The fix is done in Hit.java, making sure String site is never null.\n    Hope this fix not have bad effetct on \"hits per site\" code.\n    (John Xing, 20041006)\n\n15. Fixed a bug that fails fullyDelete() in FileUtil.java for\n    LocalFileSystem.java. This bug also exposes possible incompleteness\n    of NDFSFile.java, where a few methods are not supported, including\n    delete(). Nothing changed in NDFSFile.java though. Leave it for future\n    improvement (John Xing, 20041022).\n\n16. Introduced option -noParsing to Fetcher.java and added ParseSegment.java.\n    A new status code CANT_PARSE is added to FetcherOutput.java.\n    Without option -noParsing , no change in fetcher behavior. With\n    option -noParsing, fetcher does crawls only, no parsing is carried out.\n    Then, ParseSegment.java should be used to parse in separate pass.\n    (John Xing, 20041025)\n\n17. Added ontology plugin. Currently it is used for query refinement, as\n    examplified in refine-query-init.jsp and refine-query.jsp. By default,\n    query refinement is disabled in search.jsp. Please check\n    ./src/plugin/ontology/README.txt for further description.\n    Ontology plugin certainly can be used for many other things.\n    (Michael J. Pan via John Xing, 20041129)\n \n18. Changed fetcher.server.delay to be a float, so that sub-second\n    delays can be specified.  (cutting)\n\n19. Added plugin.includes config parameter that determines which\n    plugins are included.  By default now only http, html and basic\n    indexing and search plugins are enabled, rather than all plugins.\n    This should make default performance more predictable and reliable\n    going forward. (cutting)\n\n20. Cleaned up some filesystem code, including:\n\n    - Replaced BufferedRandomAccessFile with two simpler utilties,\n      NFSDataInputStream and NFSDataOutputStream.\n\n    - Fixed the bug where SequenceFiles were no longer flushed when\n      created, so that, when fetches crashed, segments were\n      unreadable.  Now segments are always readable after crashes.\n      Only the contents of the last buffer is lost.\n\n    - Simplified the FSOutputStream API to not include seek().  We\n      should never need that functionality.\n\n    - Simplified LocalFileSystem's implementations of FSInputStream\n      and FSOutputStream and optimized FSInputStream.seek().\n\n    (cutting)\n\n21. Fixed BasicUrlNormalizer to better handle relative urls.  The file\n    part of a URL is normalized in the following manner:\n\n      1. \"/aa/../\" will be replaced by \"/\" This is done step by step until\n\t the url doesnÂ´t change anymore. So we ensure, that\n\t \"/aa/bb/../../\" will be replaced by \"/\", too\n\n      2. leading \"/../\" will be replaced by \"/\"\n\n    (Sven Wende via cutting)\n\n22. Fix Page constructors so that next fetch date is less likely to be\n    misconstrued as a float.  This patches a problem in WebDBInjector,\n    where new pages were added to the db with nextScore set to the\n    intended nextFetch date.  This, in turn, confused link analysis.\n\n23. In ndfs code, replace addLocalFile(), putToLocalFile() with\n    copyFromLocalFile(), moveFromLocalFile(), copyToLocalFile() and\n    moveToLocalFile(). (John Xing, 20041217)\n\n24. Added new config parameter fetcher.threads.per.host.  This is used\n    by the Http protocol.  When this is one behavior is as before.\n    When this is greater than one then multiple threads are permitted\n    to access a host at once.  Note that fetcher.server.delay is no\n    longer consistently observed when this is greater than one.\n    (Luke Baker via Doug Cutting)\n\nRelease 0.5\n\n 1. Changed plugin directory to be a list of directories.\n\n 2. Permit Plugin to be the default plugin implementation.\n\n 3. Added pluggable interface for network protocols in new package\n    net.nutch.protocol.  Moved http code from core into a plugin.\n\n 4. Added pluggable interface for content parsing in new package\n    net.nutch.parse.  Moved html parsing code from core into a\n    plugin.\n\n 5. Fixed a bug in NutchAnalysis where 16-bit characters were not\n    processed correctly.\n\n 6. Fixed bug #971731: random summaries on result page.\n    (Daniel Naber via cutting)\n\n 7. Made Nutch logo transparent. (Daniel Naber via cutting)\n\n 8. Added file protocol plugin.  (John Xing via cutting)\n\n 9. Added ftp protocol plugin.  (John Xing via cutting)\n\n10. Added pdf and msword parser plugins.  (John Xing via cutting)\n\n11. Added pluggable indexing interface.  By default, url, content,\n    anchors and title are indexed, as before, but now one can easily\n    alter this to, e.g., index metadata.  A demonstration is provided\n    which extracts and indexes Creative Commons license urls. (cutting)\n\n12. Add language identification plugin. \n\n    The process of identification is as follows:\n\n    1. html (html only, HTML 4.0 \"lang\" attribute)\n    2. meta tags (html only, http-equiv, dc.language)\n    3. http header (Content-Language)\n    4. if all above fail \"statistical analysis\"\n\n    1 & 2 are run during the fetching phase and 3 & 4 are run on\n    indexing phase.\n\n    Currently supported languages (in \"statistical analysis\") are\n    da,de,el,en,es,fi,fr,it,nl,sv and pt. The corpus used was grabbed\n    from http://www.isi.edu/~koehn/europarl/ and the profiles were\n    build with tool supplied in patch.\n\n    After indexing the language can be found from field named \"lang\"\n\n    It's not 100% accurate but it's a start.\n    (Sami Siren)\n\n13. Added SegmentMergeTool and \"mergesegs\" command, to remove\n    duplicated or otherwise not used content from several segments and\n    joining them together into a single new segment.  The tool also\n    optionally performs several other steps required for proper\n    operation of Nutch - such as indexing segments, deleting\n    duplicates, merging indices, and indexing the new single segment.\n    (Andrzej Bialecki)\n\n14. Add the ability to retrieve ParseData of a search hit. ParseData\n    contains many valuable properties of a search hit.\n\n    This is required (among others) to properly display the cached\n    content because it's not possible to determine the character\n    encoding from the output of the getContent() method (which returns\n    byte[]). The symptoms are that for HTML pages using non-latin1 or\n    non-UTF8 encodings the cached preview will almost certainly look\n    broken. Using the attached patch it is possible to determine the\n    character encoding from the ParseData (for HTTP: Content-Type\n    metadata), and encode the content accordingly. (Andrzej Bialecki)\n\n15. Add a pluggable query interface.  By default, the content, anchor\n    and url fields are searched as before.  A sample plugin indexes\n    the host name and adds a \"site:\" keyword to query parsing.\n\n16. Added support for \"lang:\" in queries.  For example, searching with\n    \"lang:en\" restricts results to pages which were identified to\n    be in English.\n\n17. Automatically optimize field queries to use cached Lucene filters.\n    This makes, for example, searches restricted by languages or sites\n    that are very common much faster.\n\n18. Improved charset handling in jsp pages.  (jshin by cutting)\n\n19. Permit topic filtering when injecting DMOZ pages.  (jshin by cutting)\n\n20. When parsing crawled pages, interpret charset specifications in\n    html meta tags.  (jshin by cutting)\n\n21. Added support for \"cc:licensed\" in queries, which searches for documents\n    released under Creative Commons licenses.  Attributes of the\n    license may also be queried, with, e.g., \"cc:by\" for\n    attribution-required licenses, \"cc:nc\" for non-commercial\n    licenses, etc.\n\n22. Relative paths named in plugin.folders are now searched for on the\n    classpath.  This makes, e.g., deployment in a war file much simpler.\n\n23. Modifications to Fetcher.java.\n\n    1. Make sure it works properly with regard to creation and initialization\n    of plugin instances. The problem was that multiple threads race to\n    startUp() or shutDown() plugin instances. It was solved by synchronizing\n    certain codes in PluginRepository.java and Extension.java.\n    (Stefan Groschupf via John Xing)\n\n    2. Added code to explictly shutDown() plugins. Otherwise FetcherThreads\n    may never return (quit) if there are still data or other structures\n    (e.g., persistent socket connections) associated with plugins. (John Xing)\n    \n    3. Fixed one type of Fetcher \"hang\" problems by monitoring named\n    FetcherThreads. If all FetcherThreads are gone (finished),\n    Fetcher.java is considered done. The problem was: there could be\n    runaway threads started by external libs via FetcherThreads.\n    Those threads never return, thus keep Fetcher from exiting normally.\n    (John Xing)\n\n24. Eliminate excessive hits from sites.  This is done efficiently by\n    adding the site name to Hit instances, and, when needed,\n    re-querying with too-frequent sites prohibited in the query.\n\n\nRelease 0.4\n\n 1. Http class refactored.  (Kevin Smith via Tom Pierce)\n\n 2. Add Finnish translation. (Sampo Syreeni via Doug Cutting)\n\n 3. Added Japanese translation. (Yukio Andoh via Doug Cutting)\n\n 4. Updated Dutch translation. (Ype Kingma via Doug Cutting)\n\n 5. Initial version of Distributed DB code.  (Mike Cafarella)\n\n 6. Make things more tolerant of crashed fetcher output files.\n    (Doug Cutting)\n\n 7. New skin for website. (Frank Henze via Doug Cutting)\n\n 8. Added Spanish translation. (Diego Basch via Doug Cutting)\n\n 9. Add FTP support to fetcher.  (John Xing via Doug Cutting)\n\n10. Added Thai translation. (Pichai Ongvasith via Doug Cutting)\n\n11. Added Robots.txt & throttling support to Fetcher.java.  (Mike\n    Cafarella)\n\n12. Added nightly build. (Doug Cutting)\n\n13. Default all link scores to 1.0. (Doug Cutting)\n\n14. Permit one to keep internal links. (Doug Cutting)\n\n15. Fixed dedup to select shortest URL. (Doug Cutting)\n\n16. Changed index merger so that merged index is written to named\n    directory, rather than to a generated name in that directory.\n    (Doug Cutting)\n\n17. Disable coordination weighting of query clauses and other minor\n    scoring improvements. (Doug Cutting)\n\n18. Added a new command, crawl, that constructs a database, injects a\n    url file and performs a few rounds of generate/fetch/updatedb.\n    This simplifies use for intranet sites.  Changed some defaults to\n    be more intranet friendly.  (Doug Cutting)\n\n19. Fixed a bug where Fetcher.java didn't construct correct relative\n    links when a page was redirected.  (Doug Cutting)\n\n20. Fixed a query parser problem with lookahead over plusses and minuses.\n    (Doug Cutting)\n\n21. Add support for HTTP proxy servers.  (Sami Siren via Doug Cutting)\n\n22. Permit searching while fetching and/or indexing.\n    (Sami Siren via Doug Cutting)\n\n23. Fix a bug when throttling is disabled.  (Sami Siren via Doug Cutting)\n\n24. Updated Bahasa Malaysia translation.  (Michael Lim via Doug Cutting)\n\n25. Added Catalan translation.  (Xavier Guardiola via Doug Cutting)\n\n26. Added brazilian portuguese translation.\n    (A. Moreir via Doug Cutting)\n\n27. Added a french translation.  (Julien Nioche via Doug Cutting)\n\n28. Updated to Lucene 1.4RC3.  (Doug Cutting)\n\n29. Add capability to boost by link count & use it in crawl tool.\n    (Doug Cutting)\n\n30. Added plugin system.  (Stefan Groschupf via Doug Cutting)\n\n31. Add this change log file, for recording significant changes to\n    Nutch.  Populate it with changes from the last few months.\n"

A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program. \n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder. \n\n      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement. \n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n      b) its license agreement:\n\n      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; \n\n      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits; \n\n      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \n\n      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. IBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.\n\n\nlib/xerces-2_6_2-apis.jar\n\nxml-commons/java/external/LICENSE.sax.txt $Id: LICENSE.sax.txt,v 1.1 2002/01/31 23:26:48 curcuru Exp $\n\n\nThis license came from: http://www.megginson.com/SAX/copying.html\n  However please note future versions of SAX may be covered \n  under http://saxproject.org/?selected=pd\n\n\nThis page is now out of date -- see the new SAX site at \nhttp://www.saxproject.org/ for more up-to-date\nreleases and other information.

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\n    i) changes to the Program, and\n\n    ii) additions to the Program;\n\n    where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement, including all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its own license agreement, provided that:\n\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n    b) its license agreement:\n\n    i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;\n\n    ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Cntributors all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n    iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n    iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program. \n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the Program.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

          "content": "# nutch-anth\nAnthelion is a Nutch plugin for focused crawling of semantic data.\nThe project is an open-source project released under the Apache License 2.0.\n\nNote: This project contains the complete Nutch 1.6 distribution. The plugin itself can be found in /src/plugin/parse-anth\n\nTable of Contents\n-----------------\n* [Nutch-Anthelion Plugin](#nutch-anthelion plugin)\n  * [Plugin Overview] (#plugin-overview)\n  * [Usage and Development] (#usage-and-development)\n  * [Some Results] (#some-results)\n  * [3rd Party Libraries] (#3rd-party-libraries)\n* [Anthelion](#anthelion) \n* [References](#references)\n\nNutch-Anthelion Plugin\n---------\nThe plugin uses an online learning approach to predict data-rich web pages based on the context of the page as well as using feedback from the extraction of metadata from previously seen pages [1].\n\n### Plugin Overview\n\nTo perform the focused crawling the plugin implements three extensions:\n\n1. **AnthelionScoringFilter** (implements the ScoringFilter interface): wraps around the Anthelion online classifier to classify newly discovered outlinks, as relevant or not. This extension gives score to each outlink, which is then used in the Generate stage, i.e., the URLs for the next fetch cycle are selected based on the score. This extension also pushes feedback to the classifier for the already parsed web pages. The online classifier can be configured and tuned (see [Usage and Development](#usage and development)).\n\n2. **WdcParser** (implements the Parser interface): This extension parses the web page content and tries to extract semantic data. The parser is adaptation of an already existing Nutch parser plugin implemented in [2]. The parser is based on the [any23 library](https://any23.apache.org/) and is able to extract Microdata, Microformats and RDFa annotation from HTML. The extracted triples are stored in the *Content* field.\n\n3. **TripleExtractor** (implements the IndexingFilter interface): This extension stores new fields to the index that can be later used for querying.\n\nAn overview of the complete crawling process using the Anthelion plugin is given in the following figure.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <img src=\"https://github.com/yahoo/anthelion/blob/master/documentation/architecture.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Anthelion Architecture\"/>\n</p>\n\n\n### Usage and Development\n\nAs mentioned in the beginning of the document this project contains the complete Nutch 1.6 code, including the plugin. If you download the complete project, there is no need for any changes and settings. If you want to download only the plugin, please download only the nutch-anth.zip from the root of the folder and go to step 2 of the configuration. If you want to contribute to the plugin and/or want to use the sources with another version of Nutch, please follow the following instructions:\n\n1. Download and copy the /src/plugin/parse-anth folder into your Nutch's plugins directory.\n\n2. Enable the plugin in conf/nutch-site.xml by adding *parse-anth* in the *plugin.includes* property.\n\n3. Copy the properties from nutch-anth.xml to conf/nutch-site.xml.\n\n\t3.1. Download the baseline.properties file and set the property *anth.scoring.classifier.PropsFilePath* conf/nutch-site.xml to point to the file. This file contains all configurations for the online classifier.\n\n4. In order for ant to compile and deploy the plugin you need to edit the src/plugin/build.xml, by adding the following line in the *deploy* target:\n\t```xml\n\t<ant dir=\"parse-anth\" target=\"deploy\"/>\n\t```\n5. Add the following lines in conf/parse-plugins.xml:\n\t```xml\n\t<mimeType name=\"text/html\">\n\t\t\t<plugin id=\"parse-anth\" />\n\t\t</mimeType>\n\t\n\t        <mimeType name=\"application/xhtml+xml\">\n\t\t\t<plugin id=\"parse-anth\" />\n\t\t</mimeType>\n\t```\n6. Add the following line in the *alias* property in conf/parse-plugins.xml:\n\t\n\t```xml\n\t<alias name=\"parse-anth\" extension-id=\"com.yahoo.research.parsing.WdcParser\" />\n\t```\n7. Copy the *lib* folder into the root of the Nutch distribution.\n\n8. Run `mvn package` inside the *anthelion* folder. This will create the jar \"Anthelion-1.0.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar\". Copy the jar to src/plugin/parse-anth/lib.\n\n9. Add the following field in conf/schema.xml (also add it to the Solr schema.xml, if you are using Solr):\n\t```xml\n\t<field name=\"containsSem\" type=\"text_general\" stored=\"true\" indexed=\"true\"/>\n\t```\n10. Run ant in the root of your folder.\n\n### Some Results\n\nIn order to evaluate the focused crawler we measure the precision of the crawled pages, i.e., the ratio of the number of crawled web pages that contain semantic data and the total number of crawled web pages.\nSo far, we have evaluated using three different seeds sample, and several different configurations. An overview is given in the following table.\n\n<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=532 style='border-collapse:\n collapse;table-layout:fixed;width:532pt'>\n <col width=65
