Robotium makes it easy to write powerful and robust automatic black-box UI tests for Android applications. With the support of Robotium, test case developers can write function, system and user acceptance test scenarios, spanning multiple Android activities.\n\n\nSee [Questions & Answers](https://github.com/RobotiumTech/robotium/wiki/Questions-&-Answers) for common Robotium questions and answers. \n<br>\n\nSee [Getting Started](https://github.com/RobotiumTech/robotium/wiki/Getting-Started) for instructions and examples on how to create your first Robotium tests. \n<br>\n\nJoin the discussions in the [Robotium Developers Group](http://groups.google.com/group/robotium-developers). \n\n----\n### NEWS: Robotium 5.6.3 is released!\n[Robotium 5.6.3](https://github.com/RobotiumTech/robotium/wiki/Downloads) is the fastest, most accurate and stable version of Robotium yet.\n\nNew functionality includes: clickInRecyclerView(int itemIndex, int recyclerViewIndex, int id) and Config.sleepDuration, Config.sleepMiniDuration (to adjust the execution speed, lower means faster) and more. See the [Javadoc](http://recorder.robotium.com/javadoc/) for more information.\n\n----\n\n#### Robotium provides the following benefits:\n  * Test Android apps, both native and hybrid.\n  * Requires minimal knowledge of the application under test.\n  * The framework handles multiple Android activities automatically.\n  * Minimal time needed to write solid test cases.\n  * Readability of test cases is greatly improved, compared to standard instrumentation tests.\n  * Test cases are more robust due to the run-time binding to UI components.\n  * Fast test case execution.\n  * Integrates smoothly with Maven, Gradle or Ant to run tests as part of continuous integration.\n\n\n#### Robotium Recorder ####\n  * Check out [Robotium Recorder](http://Robotium.com) that will allow you to record Robotium test cases in minutes. Now also available for Android Studio! \n"
