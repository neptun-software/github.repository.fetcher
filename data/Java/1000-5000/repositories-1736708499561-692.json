          "content": "Release 4.0.0-BETA1 - ???\n  BREAKING CHANGES\n\n   * Headers are no longer injected into the body/content of MSG files (TIKA-4345). Please open\n     a ticket if you need this behavior across email formats.\n\n\nRelease 3.1.0 - ??\n\n   * Allow users to turn off the injection of some headers into the content stream of MSG\n     files (TIKA-4345).\n\n   * Add a wrapper for Google's magika detector (TIKA-4344).\n\n   * Add support for MachO via Alexey Pelykh (TIKA-4309).\n\n   * Add logic to inject spaces in XPS files based on font widths via Ruairidh Williamson (TIKA-4315).\n\n   * Mime type \"application/json\" is now a sub class of \"text/javascript\" not \"application/javascript\" (TIKA-4336)\n\n   * Remove tagsoup from the project entirely. Note that\n     some of the tags produced by the SourceCodeParser are slightly different (TIKA-4338)\n\nRelease 3.0.0 - 10/15/2024\n\n   * Fix regression in TextAndCSVParser (TIKA-4278).\n\nRelease 3.0.0-BETA2 - 07/09/2024\n\n   BREAKING CHANGES\n\n   * Updated PST parser to use standard Message metadata keys and improved\n     handling of embedded files (TIKA-4248).\n\n   * Convenience methods for XML readers were moved from ParseContext to\n     XMLReaderUtils (TIKA-4259).\n\n   Other Changes\n\n   * Add GRPC server (TIKA-4181).\n\n   * Improved configurability in tika-pipes (TIKA-4243).\n\n   * Add optional PST parser based on libpst/readpst (TIKA-4250).\n\nRelease 3.0.0-BETA - 12/01/2023\n\n   BREAKING CHANGES\n\n   * Require Java 11 (TIKA-4128).\n\n   * The boilerpipe handler has been moved to the tika-handler-boiler-pipe\n     package (TIKA-4138).\n\n   * We've migrated HTML parsing to the JSoup parser instead of TagSoup. If\n     you have a custom configuration on the HTMLParser, you'll need to change\n     that to o.a.t.p.html.JSoupParser (TIKA-1599).\n\n   * Removed xerces2 as a dependency (TIKA-4135).\n\n   * tika-core now has a scope of \"provided\" in most non-app modules (TIKA-4191).\n\n   * Tika will look for \"custom-mimetypes.xml\" directly on the classpath, NOT\n     under \"/org/apache/tika/mime/\". (TIKA-4147).\n\n   * Return media type \"text/javascript\" instead of \"application/javascript\"\n     to follow RFC-9239.

To achieve\n     the SKIP or CONCATENATE attachment strategy, modify the\n     parseMode in the pipesiterators or in the FetchEmitTuple (TIKA-3494).\n\nRelease 2.0.0 - 07/07/2021\n\n   * Cleanup of fetcher integration with tika-server.\n\n   * Update dependencies.\n\nRelease 2.0.0-BETA - 05/19/2021\n   \n   * Refactor pipes module for resilience\n\n   * Add transcribe capability (TIKA-94).\n\nRelease 2.0.0-ALPHA - 01/13/2021\n\n   BREAKING CHANGES in 2.0.0\n   * General\n     * OCR is now triggered automatically for PDFs if tesseract\n       is on the user's path see (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TIKA/TikaOCR#TikaOCR-disable-ocr)\n       for how to disable OCR.\n     * We upgraded from log4j to log4j2 in tika-app, tika-server and anywhere else\n       we used to use log4j.\n     * By default, when rendering a page for OCR, the PDFParser does not render glyphs/text.\n     * Removed deprecated Metadata keys/properties (TIKA-1974).\n     * Removed deprecated PDFPreflightParser (TIKA-3437).\n     * Removed dangerous calls to read an inputstream or convert to bytes\n       without specifying a charset\n     * Parsers can be configured via tika-config.xml on instantiation.\n       We have moved away from configuration via .properties files because\n       of confusion among users.  This affects the PDFParser, TesseractOCRParser\n       and the StringsParser.\n     * Changed namespaces of translator implementations (o.a.t.language.translate.impl) to avoid\n       split-package with tika-core\n\n   * tika-parsers\n     * The parser modules have been broken into three main modules:\n        tika-parsers-standard, tika-parsers-extended and tika-parsers-ml.\n        Users may now need to add tika-parsers-extended's\n        tika-parser-scientific-module or tika-parser-sqlite3-module to tika-app and\n        tika-server to include parsers that used to be included by default\n        (for example: envi, gdal, grib, isatab, netcdf, sqlite3).\n     * PDFParser -- a) see above on OCR. b) This parser no longer warns if the jpeg2000\n       dependency is not included. Tika now relies on PDFBox to log an error if a jpeg2000\n       image should be processed but can't because the required external dependency is\n       not available.  See https://pdfbox.apache.org/2.0/dependencies.html#jai-image-io\n       for the non-ASF-2.0-compatible jpeg2000 library.\n     * CompressorParser -- users must add the com.github.luben:zstd-jni dependency to\n       the classpath to process zstd files.  This is an optional library that is no longer bundled\n       in tika-parsers-standard-package because it contains native libs.\n     * ChmParser was moved to org.apache.tika.parser.microsoft.chm\n     * RTFParser was moved to org.apache.tika.parser.microsoft.rtf\n     * We are now using non-shaded versions of xmpcore with namespaces com.adobe.internal.*\n       vs com.adobe.*.\n\n   * tika-app\n     * See above on default inclusion of only tika-parsers-standard.\n\n   * tika-server\n     * tika-server now by default forks a process to isolate the parsing\n       in the forked process (this was called the -spawnChild option\n       in tika-1.x).  Clients must now expect that tika-server\n       will restart on OOM, timeouts, crashes or after parsing a\n       large number of files.  When this happens tika-server will restand and not\n       receive connections for brief periods.  The less robust, legacy behavior\n       of not forking a process is available with \"-noFork\"=\n     * Most of tika-server's legacy configuration via the commandline has been moved\n       into configuration via a tika-config.xml file.\n     * tika-server's \"enableFileUrl\" has been removed in favor of a FileSystemFetcher.\n     * tika-server's /metadata endpoint requires tika-server-standard to write XMP/rdf output.\n       This output is not available in tika-server-core.\n     * In tika-server, for those parsers that can be configured per parse via a config object\n       passed in through the ParseContext, the config object will only update those fields\n       that the user has modified.  The config object will no longer\n       fully reset all settings to the default settings per parse.\n       This has a more intuitive \"update the base/configured settings\" with\n       what has been changed in the config object.\n\n  * tika-eval\n    * tika-eval's default profile and comparison reports no longer include tag reports.\n      Users can get the report configs that include tags (*-tags.xml):\n      https://github.com/apache/tika/tree/main/tika-eval/tika-eval-app/src/main/resources\n\nRelease 1.27 - 06/30/2021\n\n   * Migrate MP4 parsing to Drew Noakes' metadata-extractor (TIKA-3459).\n     To revert to legacy parser turn off NoakesMP4Parser and turn on MP4Parser\n     via tika-config.xml.\n\n   * Prevent rare infinite loop in tika-server's -spawnChild mode\n     when restart fails because of failure to bind to the port (TIKA-3441).\n\n   * Improve likelihood that tesseract will not be orphaned on\n     jvm restart in tika-server (TIKA-3441).\n\n   * Deprecate experimental PDFPreflightParser (TIKA-3437).\n\n   * Apply encoding detection to zip entry names via Ryan421 (TIKA-3374).\n\n   * Add json output for /tika endpoint in tika-server (TIKA-3352).\n\n   * Tika's PDFParser should use the underlying file if one is passed in\n     via a TikaInputStream (TIKA-3350)\n\nRelease 1.26 - 03/24/2021\n\n   * Fix thread safety bug in OpenOffice parser (TIKA-3334).\n\n   * The \"writeLimit\" header now pertains to the combined characters\n     written per container document (and embedded documents) in the /rmeta\n     endpoint in tika-server (TIKA-3325); it no longer functions only\n     per container or embedded document.\n\n   * Extract more embedded files in PDFs by recursively processing the\n     embedded file tree (TIKA-3332).\n\n   * Allow for case insensitive headers for configuration of the PDFParser\n     and the TesseractOCRParser in tika-server via Subhajit Das (TIKA-3320).\n\n   * Improve detection and parsing of XPS files (TIKA-3316).\n\n   * General dependency upgrades (TIKA-3244).\n\n   * Great optimization in ForkParser (TIKA-3237).\n\n   * Fix parsing of emails attached to other emails in PST files (TIKA-3004).\n\n   * MP3 parser should output the xmpDM:duration metadata as seconds not\n     milliseconds, consistent with the other Audio and Video parsers (TIKA-3318).\n\n   * MP4 parser check if any of the Compatible Brands match when identifying\n     the subtype (TIKA-3310).\n\nRelease 1.25 - 11/25/2020\n\n   * Fix inconsistent license in xmpcore (TIKA-3204).\n\n   * General upgrades including some dependencies with\n     recently found security vulnerabilities (TIKA-3119).\n\n   * Add detection and a parser for flat ODF files (TIKA-3159).\n\n   * Add extraction of macros from ODF files  (TIKA-3161).\n\n   * Add mime detection for hprof and hprof text files (TIKA-3144).\n\n   * Add TextSignature and TextProfileSignature to tika-eval (TIKA-3145 and TIKA-3146)\n\n   * Create a metadata filter to trigger tika-eval stats post parsing (TIKA-3140)\n\n   * Add a configurable metadata-filter for the RecursiveParserWrapper (TIKA-3137)\n\n   * Parameterize writeLimit and maxEmbeddedResources for RecursiveParserWrapper\n     in tika-server (TIKA-3133)\n\n   * Add status endpoint to tika-server (TIKA-3129).\n\n   * Remove whitelist/blacklist terminology (TIKA-3120)\n\n   * Add detection for parquet files (TIKA-3115).\n\n   * Add detection and parsing for bplist (TIKA-3104).\n\n   * Enable metadata value filtering for RecursiveParserWrapper (TIKA-3137)\n\n   * Add a basic parser for plist files based on com.googlecode.plist:dd-plist (TIKA-3104).\n\n   * Read hyperlinked images from ODT files (TIKA-3156).\n\n   * Updated GrobidRESTParser to use new API location (TIKA-3191).\n\n   * Add FileProfiler to tika-eval (TIKA-3216).\n\n   * Add status endpoint to tika-server (TIKA-3129).\n\n   * Improved handling of zip files with STORED entries with\n     data descriptor (TIKA-3196).\n\n   * Add parsers for XLZ, IDML and MIF (TIKA-2976, TIKA-3188 and TIKA-3189).\n\n   * Add the beginnings of a format-aware fuzzing module (TIKA-3083).\n\n   * Add wrapper for Linux 'file' command for mime detection (TIKA-3215).\n\n   * Added ability to skip parsing of embedded files in Tika Server (TIKA-3227).\n\nRelease 1.24.1 - 4/17/2020\n\n   * Allow gzip compression of input and output streams for tika-server (TIKA-3073).\n\nRelease 1.24 - 3/11/2019\n\n   * Add scripts to run tika-server as a service via Eric Pugh,\n    and add these scripts and jar as a new artifact in the release (TIKA-3010).\n\n   * Upgrade Drew Noakes' metadata-extractor (TIKA-2952).\n\n   * Enable optional extraction of structural tags in PDFs (alpha-grade) (TIKA-3026).\n\n   * Tika app's --extract mode now outputs to STDOUT (TIKA-3035).\n\n   * Add an optional Preflight parser for PDFs (TIKA-3055).\n\n   * Improve detection of some zip-based formats (TIKA-3057).\n\n   * Upgrade metadata-extractor to 2.13.0 (TIKA-2952).\n\n   * Upgrade to POI 4.1.2 (TIKA-3047).\n\n   * Extract XMP from PSD files (TIKA-3050).\n\n   * Added XMLProfiler as an optional parser to profile XFA and XMP\n     in PDFs (TIKA-3045).\n\n   * Extract inline images that rely on the DCT filter from PDFs (TIKA-3041).\n\n   * Upgrade to PDFBox 2.0.19 (TIKA-3033).\n\n   * Fix bug in ASM parser configuration (TIKA-2992).\n   \n   * Upgrade to java-libpst 0.9.3 (TIKA-2546).\n\n   * Fixed XLIFF12Parser failures with ToXMLHandler (TIKA-3014).\n\nRelease 1.23 - 12/02/2019\n\n   * NOTE: The PDFParser now relies on OCRDPI to render page images when\n     users configure OCR on rendered page images. This will have the effect\n     of increasing rendered image size (TIKA-2624).\n\n   * NOTE: tika-server no longer returns 415 for file types for which there\n     is no parser.\n\n   * Fix bug in AUTO OCR strategy in the PDFParser (TIKA-3002).\n\n   * Fix incorrect height and width metadata extraction from JPEG images (TIKA-2630).\n\n   * Upgrade to POI 4.1.1 (TIKA-2851).\n\n   * Upgrade to PDFBox 2.0.17 (TIKA-2951).\n\n   * Ensure that the PDFParser respects custom configuration of Tesseract\n     from tika-config.xml via Eric Pugh (TIKA-2970).\n\n   * Add parser for XLIFF v1.2 files (TIKA-2975).\n\n   * Add mime type detection support for WebAssembly (TIKA-2894),\n     HEIF / HEIC images (TIKA-2942), Digilite FDF (TIKA-2988);\n     and xml-root detection for XFDF (TIKA-2990) and XDP (TIKA-2989).\n\n   * Add an XLZ Parser (TIKA-2976).\n   \n   * Fix deadlock with ForkParser when InputStream throws IOException (TIKA-2892).\n\nRelease 1.22 - 07/29/2019\n\n   * NOTE: tika-server no longer hard-codes the HtmlParser to handle\n     XML files (TIKA-2910).  Users must now configure that behavior\n     via a tika-config.xml file.\n\n   * NOTE: Known regression: PDFBOX-4587 -- PDF passwords with codepoints\n     between 0xF000 and 0XF0000 will cause an exception.\n\n   * Add parser for HWP v5 files via SooMyung Lee (soomyung) and\n     JinSup Kim (ddoleye) (TIKA-2909).\n\n   * Fix order of closing streams to avoid \"Failed to close temporary resource\"\n     exception in TesseractOCRParser (TIKA-2908).\n\n   * Improve AutoDetectReader performance by caching encoding\n     detector (TIKA-1568).\n\n   * Prevent RTFParser from outputting illegal tag combinations (TIKA-2889).\n\n   * Fix RereadableInputStream to release all resources (TIKA-2903).\n\n   * Implement custom language identifier in the tika-eval module based on\n     OpenNLP's language detector; add 18 languages and add common words\n     lists for all 121 languages (TIKA-2790).\n\n   * Fix NPE in MimeTypesReader.releaseParser() via Eamonn Saunders (TIKA-2896).\n\n   * Fix RTFParser to extract more content (TIKA-2883).\n\n   * Add clientSubmitTime to the metadata extracted from PST files (TIKA-2898).\n\n   * Improve StreamingZipContainerDetector for xltx, xltm and\n     several other file formats (TIKA-2886).\n\nRelease 1.21 - 05/14/2019\n\n   * Add optional AUTO mode to OCR'ing of PDFs.  If tesseract is installed\n     and on the path, and this option is selected programmatically\n     or via TikaConfig(), the PDFParser will use heuristics to decide\n     whether or not to run OCR per page on PDFs. (TIKA-2749)\n\n   * The ZipContainerDetector's default behavior was changed to run\n     streaming detection up to its markLimit.  Users can get the\n     legacy behavior (spool-to-file/rely-on-underlying-file-in-TikaInputStream)\n     by setting markLimit=-1. The POIFSContainerDetector requires an underlying file;\n     it will try to spool the file to disk; if the file's length is > markLimit,\n     it will not attempt detection; set markLimit to -1 for legacy behavior (TIKA-2849).\n\n   * Upgrade PDFBox to 2.0.14 (TIKA-2834).\n\n   * Add CSV detection and replace TXTParser with TextAndCSVParser;\n     users can turn off CSV detection by excluding the TextAndCSVParser\n     and adding back the TXTParser via tika-config (TIKA-2833).\n\n   * Add a CSVParser.

This is used to generate the list\n    on the formats page (TIKA-411).\n\nRelease 1.5 - 02/04/2014\n\n  * Fixed bug in handling of embedded file processing in PDFs (TIKA-1228).\n\n  * Added SourceCodeParser to support java, Groovy, C++ files (TIKA-1224).\n  \n  * Updated Tika Server to support multipart/form-data payloads (TIKA-1198).\n\n  * Updated Tika Server to CXF 2.7.8 (TIKA-1197).\n\n  * Updated Tika Server to accept requests over wildcard addresses (TIKA-1196).\n\n  * Added option to use alternate NonSequentialPDFParser (TIKA-1201).\n\n  * Content from PDF AcroForms is now extracted (TIKA-973).\n\n  * Fixed invalid asterisks from master slide in PPT (TIKA-1171).\n\n  * Added test cases to confirm handling of auto-date in PPT and PPTX (TIKA-817).\n \n  * Text from tables in PPT files is once again extracted correctly (TIKA-1076).\n  \n  * Text is extracted from text boxes in XLSX (TIKA-1100).\n\n  * Tika no longer hangs when processing Excel files with custom fraction format (TIKA-1132).\n\n  * Disconcerting stacktrace from missing beans no longer printed for some DOCX files (TIKA-792).\n\n  * Upgraded POI to 3.10-beta2 (TIKA-1173).\n\n  * Upgraded PDFBox to 1.8.4 (TIKA-1230).\n\n  * Made HtmlEncodingDetector more flexible in finding meta \n    header charset (TIKA-1001).\n\n  * Added sanitized test HTML file for local file test (TIKA-1139).\n\n  * Fixed bug that prevented attachments within a PDF from being processed\n    if the PDF itself was an attachment (TIKA-1124).\n\n  * Text from paragraph-level structured document tags in DOCX files is now extracted (TIKA-1130).\n\n  * RTF: Fixed ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException when parsing list override (TIKA-1192).\n\n  * CLI: TikaCLI now escapes invalid filename characters as hex\n    characters (TIKA-1078).\n\nRelease 1.4 - 06/15/2013\n\n  * Removed a test HTML file with a poorly chosen GPL text in it (TIKA-1129).\n\n  * Improvements to tika-server to allow it to produce text/html and\n    text/xml content (TIKA-1126, TIKA-1127).\n\n  * Improvements were made to the Compressor Parser to handle g'zipped files\n    that require the decompressConcatenated option set to true (TIKA-1096).\n\n  * Addressed a typographic error that was preventing from detection of \n    awk files (TIKA-1081).\n\n  * Added a new end-point to Tika's JAX-RS REST server that only detects\n    the media-type based on a small portion of the document submitted\n   (TIKA-1047).\n\n  * RTF: Ordered and unordered lists are now extracted (TIKA-1062).\n\n  * MP3: Audio duration is now extracted (TIKA-991)\n\n  * Java .class files: upgraded from ASM 3.1 to ASM 4.1 for parsing\n    the Java bytecodes (TIKA-1053).\n\n  * Mime Types: Definitions extended to optionally include Link (URL) and\n    UTI, along with details for several common formats (TIKA-1012 / TIKA-1083)\n\n  * Exceptions when parsing OLE10 embedded documents, when parsing\n    summary information from Office documents, and when saving\n    embedded documennts in TikaCLI are now logged instead\n    of aborting extraction (TIKA-1074)\n\n  * MS Word: line tabular character is now replaced with newline\n    (TIKA-1128)\n\n  * XML: ElementMetadataHandlers can now optionally accept duplicate\n    and empty values (TIKA-1133)\n\nRelease 1.3 - 01/19/2013\n\n  * Mimetype definitions added for more common programming languages,\n    including common extensions, but not magic patterns. (TIKA-1055)\n\n  * MS Word: When a Word (.doc) document contains embedded files or\n    links to external documents, Tika now places a <div\n    class=\"embedded\" id=\"_XXX\"/> placeholder into the XHTML so you can\n    see where in the main text the embedded document occurred\n    (TIKA-956, TIKA-1019).  Embedded Wordpad/RTF documents are now\n    recognized (TIKA-982).\n\n  * PDF: Text from pop-up annotations is now extracted (TIKA-981).\n    Text from bookmarks is now extracted (TIKA-1035).\n\n  * PKCS7: Detached signatures no longer through NullPointerException\n    (TIKA-986).\n\n  * iWork: The chart name for charts embedded in numbers documents is\n    now extracted (TIKA-918).\n\n  * CLI: TikaCLI -m now handles multi-valued metadata keys correctly\n    (previously it only printed the first value).  (TIKA-920)\n\n  * MS Word (.docx): When a Word (.docx) document contains embedded\n    files, Tika now places a <div class=\"embedded\" id=\"XXX\"/> into the\n    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document\n    occurred.  The id (rId) is included in the Metadata of each\n    embedded document as the new Metadata.EMBEDDED_RELATIONSHIP_ID\n    key, and TikaCLI prepends the rId (if present) onto the filename\n    it extracts (TIKA-989).  Fixed NullPointerException when style is\n    null (TIKA-1006).  Text inside text boxes is now extracted\n    (TIKA-1005).\n\n  * RTF: Page, word, character count and creation date metadata are\n    now extracted for RTF documents (TIKA-999).\n\n  * MS PowerPoint (.pptx): When a PowerPoint (.pptx) document contains\n    embedded files, Tika now places a <div class=\"embedded\" id=\"XXX\"/> into the\n    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document\n    occurred.  The id (rId) is included in the Metadata of each\n    embedded document as the new Metadata.EMBEDDED_RELATIONSHIP_ID\n    key, and TikaCLI prepends the rId (if present) onto the filename\n    it extracts (TIKA-997, TIKA-1032).\n\n  * MS PowerPoint (.ppt): When a PowerPoint (.ppt) document contains\n    embedded files, Tika now places a <div class=\"embedded\" id=\"XXX\"/> into the\n    XHTML so you can see where in the main text the embedded document\n    occurred (TIKA-1025).  Text from the master slide is now extracted\n    (TIKA-712).\n\n  * MHTML: fixed Null charset name exception when a mime part has an\n    unrecognized charset (TIKA-1011).\n\n  * MP3: if an ID3 tag was encoded in UTF-16 with only the BOM then on\n    certain JVMs this would incorrectly extract the BOM as the tag's\n    value (TIKA-1024).\n\n  * ZIP: placeholders (<div class=\"embedded\" id=\"<entry name>\"/>) are\n    now left in the XHTML so you can see where each archive member\n    appears (TIKA-1036). TikaCLI would hit FileNotFoundException when\n    extracting files that were under sub-directories from a ZIP\n    archive, because it failed to create the parent directories first\n    (TIKA-1031).\n\n  * XML: a space character is now added before each element\n    (TIKA-1048)\n\nRelease 1.2 - 07/10/2012\n---------------------------------\n\n  * Tika's JAX-RS based Network server now is based on Apache CXF,\n    which is available in Maven Central and now allows the server\n    module to be packaged and included in our release\n    (TIKA-593, TIKA-901).\n\n  * Tika: parseToString now lets you specify the max string length\n    per-call, in addition to per-Tika-instance. (TIKA-870)\n\n  * Tika now has the ability to detect FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) \n    files (TIKA-874).\n\n  * Images: Fixed file handle leak in ImageParser. (TIKA-875)\n\n  * iWork: Comments in Pages files are now extracted (TIKA-907).\n    Headers, footers and footnotes in Pages files are now extracted\n    (TIKA-906).  Don't throw NullPointerException on passsword\n    protected iWork files, even though we can't parse their contents\n    yet (TIKA-903).  Text extracted from Keynote text boxes and bullet\n    points no longer runs together (TIKA-910). Also extract text for\n    Pages documents created in layout mode (TIKA-904).  Table names\n    are now extracted in Numbers documents (TIKA-924).  Content added\n    to master slides is also extracted (TIKA-923).\n\n  * Archive and compression formats: The Commons Compress dependency was\n    upgraded from 1.3 to 1.4.1. With this change Tika can now parse also\n    Unix dump archives and documents compressed using the XZ and Pack200\n    compression formats. (TIKA-932)\n\n  * KML: Tika now has basic support for Keyhole Markup Language documents\n    (KML and KMZ) used by tools like Google Earth. See also\n    http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/kml/. (TIKA-941)\n\n  * CLI: You can now use the TIKA_PASSWORD environment variable or the\n    --password=X command line option to specify the password that Tika CLI\n    should use for opening encrypted documents (TIKA-943).\n\n  * Character encodings: Tika's character encoding detection mechanism was\n    improved by adding integration to the juniversalchardet library that\n    implements Mozilla's universal charset detection algorithm. The slower\n    ICU4J algorithms are still used as a fallback thanks to their wider\n    coverage of custom character encodings. (TIKA-322, TIKA-471)\n\n  * Charset parameter: Related to the character encoding improvements\n    mentioned above, Tika now returns the detected character encoding as\n    a \"charset\" parameter of the content type metadata field for text/plain\n    and text/html documents. For example, instead of just \"text/plain\", the\n    returned content type will be something like \"text/plain; charset=UTF-8\"\n    for a UTF-8 encoded text document. Character encoding information is still\n    present also in the content encoding metadata field for backwards\n    compatibility, but that field should be considered deprecated. (TIKA-431)\n\n  * Extraction of embedded resources from OLE2 Office Documents, where\n    the resource isn't another office document, has been fixed (TIKA-948)\n\nRelease 1.1 - 3/7/2012\n---------------------------------\n\n * Link Extraction: The rel attribute is now extracted from \n   links per the LinkConteHandler. (TIKA-824)\n\n * MP3: Fixed handling of UTF-16 (two byte) ID3v2 tags (previously\n   the last character in a UTF-16 tag could be corrupted) (TIKA-793)\n\n * Performance: Loading of the default media type registry is now\n   significantly faster. (TIKA-780)\n\n * PDF: Allow controlling whether overlapping duplicated text should\n   be removed.  Disabling this (the default) can give big\n   speedups to text extraction and may workaround cases where\n   non-duplicated characters were incorrectly removed (TIKA-767).\n   Allow controlling whether text tokens should be sorted by their x/y\n   position before extracting text (TIKA-612); this is necessary for\n   certain PDFs.  Fixed cases where too many </p> tags appear in the\n   XHTML output, causing NPE when opening some PDFs with the GUI\n   (TIKA-778).\n\n * RTF: Fixed case where a font change would result in processing\n   bytes in the wrong font's charset, producing bogus text output\n   (TIKA-777).  Don't output whitespace in ignored group states,\n   avoiding excessive whitespace output (TIKA-781).  Binary embedded\n   content (using \\bin control word) is now skipped correctly;\n   previously it could cause the parser to incorrectly extract binary\n   content as text (TIKA-782).\n\n * CLI: New TikaCLI option \"--list-detectors\", which displays the\n   mimetype detectors that are available, similar to the existing\n   \"--list-parsers\" option for parsers. (TIKA-785).\n\n * Detectors: The order of detectors, as supplied via the service\n   registry loader, is now controlled. User supplied detectors are\n   prefered, then Tika detectors (such as the container aware ones),\n   and finally the core Tika MimeTypes is used as a backup. This\n   allows for specific, detailed detectors to take preference over\n   the default mime magic + filename detector. (TIKA-786)\n\n * Microsoft Project (MPP): Filetype detection has been fixed,\n   and basic metadata (but no text) is now extracted. (TIKA-789)\n\n * Outlook: fixed NullPointerException in TikaGUI when messages with\n   embedded RTF or HTML content were filtered (TIKA-801).\n\n * Ogg Vorbis and FLAC: Parser added for Ogg Vorbis and FLAC audio\n   files, which extract audio metadata and tags (TIKA-747)\n\n * MP4: Improved mime magic detection for MP4 based formats (including\n   QuickTime, MP4 Video and Audio, and 3GPP) (TIKA-851)\n\n * MP4: Basic metadata extracting parser for MP4 files added, which includes\n   limited audio and video metadata, along with the iTunes media metadata\n   (such as Artist and Title) (TIKA-852)\n\n * Document Passwords: A new ParseContext object, PasswordProvider,\n   has been added. This provides a way to supply the password for \n   a document during processing. Currently, only password protected\n   PDFs and Microsoft OOXML Files are supported. (TIKA-850)\n\nRelease 1.0 - 11/4/2011\n---------------------------------\n\nThe most notable changes in Tika 1.0 over previous releases are:\n\n * API: All methods, classes and interfaces that were marked as\n   deprecated in Tika 0.10 have been removed to clean up the API\n   (TIKA-703). You may need to adjust and recompile client code\n   accordingly. The declared OSGi package versions are now 1.0, and\n   will thus not resolve for client bundles that still refer to 0.x\n   versions (TIKA-565).\n\n * Configuration: The context class loader of the current thread is\n   no longer used as the default for loading configured parser and\n   detector classes. You can still pass an explicit class loader\n   to the configuration mechanism to get the previous behaviour.\n   (TIKA-565)\n\n * OSGi: The tika-core bundle will now automatically pick up and use\n   any available Parser and Detector services when deployed to an OSGi\n   environment. The tika-parsers bundle provides such services based on\n   for all the supported file formats for which the upstream parser library\n   is available. If you don't want to track all the parser libraries as\n   separate OSGi bundles, you can use the tika-bundle bundle that packages\n   tika-parsers together with all its upstream dependencies. (TIKA-565)\n\n * RTF: Hyperlinks in RTF documents are now extracted as an <a\n   href=...>...</a> element (TIKA-632). The RTF parser is also now\n   more robust when encountering too many closing {'s vs. opening {'s\n   (TIKA-733).\n\n * MS Word: From Word (.doc) documents we now extract optional hyphen\n   as Unicode zero-width space (U+200B), and non-breaking hyphen as\n   Unicode non-breaking hyphen (U+2011). (TIKA-711)\n\n * Outlook: Tika can now process also attachments in Outlook messages.\n   (TIKA-396)\n\n * MS Office: Performance of extracting embedded office docs was improved.\n   (TIKA-753)\n\n * PDF: The PDF parser now extracts paragraphs within each page \n   (TIKA-742) and  can now optionally extract text from PDF \n   annotations (TIKA-738). There's also an option to enable (the \n   default) or disable auto-space insertion (TIKA-724). \n\n * Language detection: Tika can now detect Belarusian, Catalan,\n   Esperanto, Galician, Lithuanian (TIKA-582), Romanian, Slovak,\n   Slovenian, and Ukrainian (TIKA-681).\n\n * Java: Tika no longer ships retrotranslated Java 1.4 binaries along\n   with the normal ones that work with Java 5 and higher. (TIKA-744)\n\n * OpenOffice documents: header/footer text is now extracted for text,\n   presentation and spreadsheet documents (TIKA-736)\n\nTika 1.0 relies on the following set of major dependencies (generated using\nmvn dependency:tree from tika-parsers):\n\n   org.apache.tika:tika-parsers:bundle:1.0\n   +- org.apache.tika:tika-core:jar:1.0:compile\n   +- edu.ucar:netcdf:jar:4.2-min:compile\n   |  \\- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.5.6:compile\n   +- org.apache.james:apache-mime4j-core:jar:0.7:compile\n   +- org.apache.james:apache-mime4j-dom:jar:0.7:compile\n   +- org.apache.commons:commons-compress:jar:1.3:compile\n   +- commons-codec:commons-codec:jar:1.5:compile\n   +- org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:jar:1.6.0:compile\n   |  +- org.apache.pdfbox:fontbox:jar:1.6.0:compile\n   |  +- org.apache.pdfbox:jempbox:jar:1.6.0:compile\n   |  \\- commons-logging:commons-logging:jar:1.1.1:compile\n   +- org.bouncycastle:bcmail-jdk15:jar:1.45:compile\n   +- org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15:jar:1.45:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi:jar:3.8-beta4:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi-scratchpad:jar:3.8-beta4:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml:jar:3.8-beta4:compile\n   |  +- org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml-schemas:jar:3.8-beta4:compile\n   |  |  \\- org.apache.xmlbeans:xmlbeans:jar:2.3.0:compile\n   |  \\- dom4j:dom4j:jar:1.6.1:compile\n   +- org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-stax-api_1.0_spec:jar:1.0.1:compile\n   +- org.ccil.cowan.tagsoup:tagsoup:jar:1.2.1:compile\n   +- asm:asm:jar:3.1:compile\n   +- com.drewnoakes:metadata-extractor:jar:2.4.0-beta-1:compile\n   +- de.l3s.boilerpipe:boilerpipe:jar:1.1.0:compile\n   +- rome:rome:jar:0.9:compile\n      \\- jdom:jdom:jar:1.0:compile\n\nThe following people have contributed to Tika 1.0 by submitting or commenting\non the issues resolved in this release:\n\nAndrzej Bialecki\nAntoni Mylka\nBenson Margulies\nChris A.

(TIKA-245)\n\n * TIKA-698: Invalid characters are now replaced with the Unicode\n   replacement character (U+FFFD), whereas before such characters were\n   replaced with spaces, so you may need to change your processing of\n   Tika's output to now handle U+FFFD.\n\n * The RTF parser was rewritten to perform its own direct shallow\n   parse of the RTF content, instead of using RTFEditorKit from\n   javax.swing.  This fixes several issues in the old parser,\n   including doubling of Unicode characters in certain cases\n   (TIKA-683), exceptions on mal-formed RTF docs (TIKA-666), and\n   missing text from some elements (header/footer, hyperlinks,\n   footnotes, text inside pictures).\n\n * Handling of temporary files within Tika was much improved\n   (TIKA-701, TIKA-654, TIKA-645, TIKA-153)\n\n * The Tika GUI got a facelift and some extra features (TIKA-635)\n\n * The apache-mime4j dependency of the email message parser was upgraded\n   from version 0.6 to 0.7 (TIKA-716). The parser also now accepts a\n   MimeConfig object in the ParseContext as configuration (TIKA-640).\n\nTika 0.10 relies on the following set of major dependencies (generated using\nmvn dependency:tree from tika-parsers):\n\n   org.apache.tika:tika-parsers:bundle:0.10\n   +- org.apache.tika:tika-core:jar:0.10:compile\n   +- edu.ucar:netcdf:jar:4.2-min:compile\n   |  \\- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.5.6:compile\n   +- org.apache.james:apache-mime4j-core:jar:0.7:compile\n   +- org.apache.james:apache-mime4j-dom:jar:0.7:compile\n   +- org.apache.commons:commons-compress:jar:1.1:compile\n   +- commons-codec:commons-codec:jar:1.4:compile\n   +- org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:jar:1.6.0:compile\n   |  +- org.apache.pdfbox:fontbox:jar:1.6.0:compile\n   |  +- org.apache.pdfbox:jempbox:jar:1.6.0:compile\n   |  \\- commons-logging:commons-logging:jar:1.1.1:compile\n   +- org.bouncycastle:bcmail-jdk15:jar:1.45:compile\n   +- org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15:jar:1.45:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi:jar:3.8-beta4:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi-scratchpad:jar:3.8-beta4:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml:jar:3.8-beta4:compile\n   |  +- org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml-schemas:jar:3.8-beta4:compile\n   |  |  \\- org.apache.xmlbeans:xmlbeans:jar:2.3.0:compile\n   |  \\- dom4j:dom4j:jar:1.6.1:compile\n   +- org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-stax-api_1.0_spec:jar:1.0.1:compile\n   +- org.ccil.cowan.tagsoup:tagsoup:jar:1.2.1:compile\n   +- asm:asm:jar:3.1:compile\n   +- com.drewnoakes:metadata-extractor:jar:2.4.0-beta-1:compile\n   +- de.l3s.boilerpipe:boilerpipe:jar:1.1.0:compile\n   +- rome:rome:jar:0.9:compile\n      \\- jdom:jdom:jar:1.0:compile\n\nThe following people have contributed to Tika 0.10 by submitting or commenting\non the issues resolved in this release:\n\n   Alain Viret\n   Alex Ott\n   Alexander Chow\n   Andreas Kemkes\n   Andrew Khoury\n   Babak Farhang\n   Benjamin Douglas\n   Benson Margulies\n   Chris A.

(TIKA-596)\n   \n * The 0.8 version of Tika included a NetCDF jar file that pulled \n   in tremendous amounts of redundant dependencies. This has \n   been addressed in Tika 0.9 by republishing a minimal NetCDF \n   jar and changing Tika to depend on that. (TIKA-556)\n   \n * MIME detection for iWork, and OpenXML documents has been \n   improved. (TIKA-533, TIKA-562, TIKA-588)\n   \n * A critical backwards incompatible bug in PDF parsing that \n   was introduced in Tika 0.8 has been fixed. (TIKA-548)\n   \n * Support for forked parsing in separate processes was added. \n   (TIKA-416)\n \n * Tika's language identifier now supports the Lithuanian \n   language. (TIKA-582)\n\nTika 0.9 relies on the following set of major dependencies (generated using\nmvn dependency:tree from tika-parsers):\n\n   org.apache.tika:tika-parsers:bundle:0.9\n   +- org.apache.tika:tika-core:jar:0.9:compile\n   +- edu.ucar:netcdf:jar:4.2-min:compile\n   |  \\- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.5.6:compile\n   +- commons-httpclient:commons-httpclient:jar:3.1:compile\n   |  +- commons-logging:commons-logging:jar:1.1.1:compile (version managed from 1.0.4)\n   |  \\- commons-codec:commons-codec:jar:1.2:compile\n   +- org.apache.james:apache-mime4j:jar:0.6:compile\n   +- org.apache.commons:commons-compress:jar:1.1:compile\n   +- org.apache.pdfbox:pdfbox:jar:1.4.0:compile\n   |  +- org.apache.pdfbox:fontbox:jar:1.4.0:compile\n   |  \\- org.apache.pdfbox:jempbox:jar:1.4.0:compile\n   +- org.bouncycastle:bcmail-jdk15:jar:1.45:compile\n   +- org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15:jar:1.45:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi:jar:3.7:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi-scratchpad:jar:3.7:compile\n   +- org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml:jar:3.7:compile\n   |  +- org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml-schemas:jar:3.7:compile\n   |  |  \\- org.apache.xmlbeans:xmlbeans:jar:2.3.0:compile\n   |  \\- dom4j:dom4j:jar:1.6.1:compile\n   +- org.apache.geronimo.specs:geronimo-stax-api_1.0_spec:jar:1.0.1:compile\n   +- org.ccil.cowan.tagsoup:tagsoup:jar:1.2:compile\n   +- asm:asm:jar:3.1:compile\n   +- com.drewnoakes:metadata-extractor:jar:2.4.0-beta-1:compile\n   +- de.l3s.boilerpipe:boilerpipe:jar:1.1.0:compile\n   +- rome:rome:jar:0.9:compile\n      \\- jdom:jdom:jar:1.0:compile\n\nThe following people have contributed to Tika 0.9 by submitting or commenting\non the issues resolved in this release:\n\n   Alex Skochin\n   Alexander Chow\n   Antoine L.\n   Antoni Mylka\n   Benjamin Douglas\n   Benson Margulies\n   Chris A.

(TIKA-490)\n\n * Tika now supports parsing Feeds by wrapping the underlying\n   Rome library. (TIKA-466)\n\n * A quick-start guide for Tika parsing was contributed. (TIKA-464)\n\n * An approach for plumbing through XHTML attributes was added. (TIKA-379)\n\n * Media type hierarchy information is now taken into account when\n   selecting the best parser for a given input document. (TIKA-298)\n\n * Support for parsing common scientific data formats including netCDF\n   and HDF4/5 was added (TIKA-400 and TIKA-399).\n\n * Unit tests for Windows have been fixed, allowing TestParsers\n   to complete.

Further, audio\n   parsing mime detection was also improved for the MIDI format. (TIKA-199)\n\n * Tika no longer relies on X11 for its RTF parsing functionality. (TIKA-386)\n\n * A Thread-safe bug in the AutoDetectParser was discovered and \n   addressed. (TIKA-374)\n\n * Upgrade to PDFBox 1.0.0. The new PDFBox version improves PDF parsing\n   performance and fixes a number of text extraction issues. (TIKA-380)\n\nThe following people have contributed to Tika 0.7 by submitting or commenting\non the issues resolved in this release:\n\n   Adam Rauch\n   Benson Margulies\n   Brett S.\n   Chris A.

(TIKA-327, TIKA-357, TIKA-366, TIKA-367)\n\n * Tika now has an additional OSGi bundle packaging that includes all the\n   required parser libraries. This bundle package makes it easy to use all\n   Tika features in an OSGi environment. (TIKA-340, TIKA-342)\n\n * The Apache POI dependency used for parsing Microsoft Office file formats\n   has been upgraded to version 3.6. The most visible improvement in this\n   version is the notably reduced ooxml jar file size. The tika-app jar size\n   is now down to 15MB from the 25MB in Tika 0.5. (TIKA-353)\n\n * Handling of character encoding information in input metadata and HTML\n   <meta> tags has been improved. When no applicable encoding information is\n   available, the encoding is detected by looking at the input data.\n   (TIKA-332, TIKA-334, TIKA-335, TIKA-341) \n\n * Some document types like Excel spreadsheets contain content like\n   numbers or formulas whose exact text format depends on the current locale.\n   So far Tika has used the platform default locale in such cases, but\n   clients can now explicitly specify the locale by passing a Locale instance\n   in the parse context. (TIKA-125)\n\n * The default text output encoding of the tika-app jar is now UTF-8\n   when running on Mac OS X. This is because the default encoding used\n   by Java is not compatible with the console application in Mac OS X.\n   On all other platforms the text output from tika-app still uses\n   the platform default encoding. (TIKA-324)\n\n * A flash video (video/x-flv) parser has been added. (TIKA-328)\n \n * The handling of Number and Date cell formatting within the Microsoft Excel\n   documents has been added. This include currencies, percentages and\n   scientific formats. (TIKA-103)\n   \nThe following people have contributed to Tika 0.6 by submitting or commenting\non the issues resolved in this release:\n\n   Andrzej Bialecki\n   Bertrand Delacretaz\n   Chris A. Mattmann\n   Dave Meikle\n   Erik Hetzner\n   Felix Meschberger\n   Jukka Zitting\n   Julien Nioche\n   Ken Krugler\n   Luke Nezda\n   Maxim Valyanskiy\n   Niall Pemberton\n   Peter Wolanin\n   Piotr B.\n   Sami Siren\n   Yuan-Fang Li\n\nSee http://tinyurl.com/yc3dk67 for more details on these contributions.\n\n\nRelease 0.5 - 11/14/2009\n------------------------\n\nThe most notable changes in Tika 0.5 over the previous release are:\n\n * Improved RDF/OWL mime detection using both MIME magic as well as\n   pattern matching (TIKA-309)\n\n * An org.apache.tika.Tika facade class has been added to simplify common\n   text extraction and type detection use cases. (TIKA-269)\n\n * A new parse context argument was added to the Parser.parse() method.\n   This context map can be used to pass things like a delegate parser or\n   other settings to the parsing process. The previous parse() method\n   signature has been deprecated and will be removed in Tika 1.0. (TIKA-275)\n\n * A simple ngram-based language detection mechanism has been added along\n   with predefined language profiles for 18 languages. (TIKA-209)\n\n * The media type registry in Tika was synchronized with the MIME type\n   configuration in the Apache HTTP Server. Tika now knows about 1274\n   different media types and can detect 672 of those using 927 file\n   extension and 280 magic byte patterns. (TIKA-285)\n\n * Tika now uses the Apache PDFBox version 0.8.0-incubating for parsing PDF\n   documents. This version is notably better than the 0.7.3 release used\n   earlier. (TIKA-158)\n\nThe following people have contributed to Tika 0.5 by submitting or commenting\non the issues resolved in this release:\n\n   Alex Baranov\n   Bart Hanssens\n   Benson Margulies\n   Chris A.

The tika-core component contains the key interfaces and\n    core functionality of Tika, tika-parsers contains all the adapters\n    to external parser libraries, and tika-app bundles everything together\n    in a single executable jar file. (TIKA-219)\n\n  * All the three Tika components are packaged as OSGi bundles. (TIKA-228)\n\n  * Tika now uses the new Commons Compress library for improved support\n    of compression and packaging formats like gzip, bzip2, tar, cpio,\n    ar, zip and jar. (TIKA-204)\n\n  * The memory use of parsing Excel sheets with lots of numbers\n    has been considerably reduced. (TIKA-211)\n\n  * The AutoDetectParser now has basic protection against \"zip bomb\"\n    attacks, where a specially crafted input document can expand to\n    practically infinite amount of output text. (TIKA-216)\n\n  * The ParsingReader class can now use a thread pool or a more complex\n    execution model (java.util.concurrent.Executor) for the background\n    parsing task. (TIKA-215)\n\n  * Automatic type detection of text- and XML-based documents has been\n    improved. (TIKA-225)\n\n  * Charset detection functionality from the ICU4J library was inlined\n    in Tika to avoid the dependency to the large ICU4J jar. (TIKA-229)\n\n  * Composite parsers like the AutoDetectParser now make sure that any\n    RuntimeExceptions, IOExceptions or SAXExceptions unrelated to the given\n    document stream or content handler are converted to TikaExceptions\n    before being passed to the client. (TIKA-198, TIKA-237)\n    \nThe following people have contributed to Tika 0.4 by submitting or commenting\non the issues resolved in this release:\n\n   Chris A. Mattmann\n   Daan de Wit\n   Dave Meikle\n   David Weekly\n   Jeremias Maerki\n   Jonathan Koren\n   Jukka Zitting\n   Karl Heinz Marbaise\n   Keith R.

See:\n\n     http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html\n\n   for more information. (TIKA-194)\n\n * Tika now supports the Office Open XML format used by\n   Microsoft Office 2007. (TIKA-152)\n\n * All the metadata keys for Microsoft Office document properties are now\n   included as constants in the MSOffice interface. Clients should use\n   these constants instead of the raw string values to refer to specific\n   metadata items. (TIKA-186)\n\n * Automatic detection of document types in Tika has been improved.\n   For example Tika can now detect plain text just by looking at the first\n   few bytes of the document. (TIKA-154)\n\n * Tika now disables the loading of all external entities in XML files\n   that it parses as input documents. This improves security and avoids\n   problems with potentially broken references. (TIKA-185)\n\n * Tika now replaces all invalid XML characters in the extracted text\n   content with spaces. This prevents problems when output from Tika\n   is processed with XML tools. (TIKA-180)\n\n * The Tika CLI now correctly flushes its buffers when invoked with the\n   --text argument. This prevents the end of the text output from being\n   lost. (TIKA-179)\n\n * Embedded text in MIDI files is now extracted. For example many karaoke\n   files contain song lyrics embedded as MIDI text.\n\n * The text content of Microsoft Outlook message files no longer appears as\n   multiple copies in the extracted text. (TIKA-197)\n\n * The ParsingReader class now makes most document metadata available\n   already before any of the extracted text is consumed. This makes it\n   easier for example to construct Lucene Document instances that contain\n   both extracted text and metadata.

Effect of New Versions.\n\n  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n  Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n  License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If\n  the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software\n  prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available\n  under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n  make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version\n  of the License under which You originally received the Covered\n  Software.

Modified Versions.\n\n  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new\n  license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a\n  modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and\n  remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to\n  note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise\n  make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this\n  License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n  COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n  INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE\n  IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n  NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\n  THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\n  DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n  OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n  REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n  ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS\n  AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\n  Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n  termination of this License shall survive.\n\n  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n  declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\n  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\n  assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that the\n  Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the\n  Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the\n  Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n  infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n  indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n  Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n  Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice\n  from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the\n  expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60\n  day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n  Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to\n  a written agreement with Participant.\n\n  6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n  alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly\n  infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by\n  license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n  infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n  into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n  license.\n\n  6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,\n  all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\n  distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\n  granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n  INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n  COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE\n  TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n  LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n  FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n  LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\n  POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\n  APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\n  PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n  LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION\n  AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n  The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\n  in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n  software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §\n  252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software documentation\"\n  as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\n  with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\n  (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software\n  with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\n  clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other\n  clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer\n  software under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n  This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n  necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n  the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within\n  the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\n  provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law\n  provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject\n  to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and\n  venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,\n  with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n  limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\n  The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\n  the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n  regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\n  construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You\n  agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n  States export administration regulations (and the export control\n  laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute\n  or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n  As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n  responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n  out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n  work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n  responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n  shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)\n\nThe code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the\nState of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any\nlitigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction\nof the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the\nstate courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara\nCounty, California.\n\nThe GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\nBoston, MA 02110-1335\nUSA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\nshare and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\nLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\nto any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\nSoftware Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\nservice if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\nYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\nbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\nto any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\neither the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\nto say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\nverbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\nthe Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\nthat you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n    under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n    is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\ncan be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\nthe Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\nstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\nscope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n    accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\nmeans all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\nexception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\nto copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\nthe source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\ncode, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\nalong with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\nnot have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\nfull compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\nits terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\nso as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\nany other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\ndistribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\nnot permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\nreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\nby public license practices. Many people have made generous\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\nsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\nthe author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\na consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\nadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\nFree Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\nYOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\nOTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n    General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\n    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\nyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\ncould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\n    James Hacker.\n\n    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\nwith the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\nGeneral Public License instead of this License.\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its\naffiliates are subject to the following clarification and special\nexception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its\nClasspath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only\nwhere Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's\nheader the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to\nthe \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file\nthat accompanied this code.\"\n\nYou should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent\nprograms in this software package. Some of those programs are provided\nunder licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software\nFoundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs\nlicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are\nlicensed to you under their original licenses.\n\nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding\nthe Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which\npermits you to use that code in combination with other independent\nmodules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would\nnot permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with\nOracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such\ncode into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then\ndistributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the\nClasspath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and\ndistribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or\nall of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and\nsince the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\nincluded in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\nException could therefore effectively compromise your ability to\nfurther distribute the package.\n\nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a\nlawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath\nException or making modifications to this package which may\nsubsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party\nsoftware.\n\nCLASSPATH EXCEPTION\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\nmaking a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\nconditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\ncombination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\nmodules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\nterms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\nindependent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\nmodule.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\nbased on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\nexception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\ndo so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\nfrom your version.\n\n\n-------------------------------\nFor compatibility with Java > 8\ncom.sun.activation:javax.activation\n\nLicense: CDDL 1.1, GPL2 w/ CPE\n\nCOMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL) Version 1.1\n\n1.

The Initial Developer Grant.\n\n    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject\n    to third party intellectual property claims, the Initial Developer\n    hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n\n    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n    trademark) Licensable by Initial Developer, to use, reproduce,\n    modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Original\n    Software (or portions thereof), with or without Modifications,\n    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using or selling of\n    Original Software, to make, have made, use, practice, sell, and\n    offer for sale, and/or otherwise dispose of the Original Software\n    (or portions thereof).\n\n    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.1(a) and (b) are effective on\n    the date Initial Developer first distributes or otherwise makes the\n    Original Software available to a third party under the terms of this\n    License.\n\n    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is\n    granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original Software, or\n    (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the modification of the\n    Original Software, or (ii) the combination of the Original Software\n    with other software or devices.\n\n    2.2. Contributor Grant.\n\n    Conditioned upon Your compliance with Section 3.1 below and subject\n    to third party intellectual property claims, each Contributor hereby\n    grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license:\n\n    (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or\n    trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, modify,\n    display, perform, sublicense and distribute the Modifications\n    created by such Contributor (or portions thereof), either on an\n    unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as Covered Software\n    and/or as part of a Larger Work; and\n\n    (b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, or selling\n    of Modifications made by that Contributor either alone and/or in\n    combination with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n    combination), to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or\n    otherwise dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or\n    portions thereof); and (2) the combination of Modifications made by\n    that Contributor with its Contributor Version (or portions of such\n    combination).\n\n    (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are effective\n    on the date Contributor first distributes or otherwise makes the\n    Modifications available to a third party.\n\n    (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is\n    granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the\n    Contributor Version; (2) for infringements caused by: (i) third\n    party modifications of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination\n    of Modifications made by that Contributor with other software\n    (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or (3)\n    under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    Modifications made by that Contributor.\n\n3. Distribution Obligations.\n\n    3.1. Availability of Source Code.\n\n    Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available\n    in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form\n    and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every\n    copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute\n    or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such\n    Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such\n    Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or\n    through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\n    3.2. Modifications.\n\n    The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are\n    governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You\n    believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You\n    have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.\n\n    3.3. Required Notices.\n\n    You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that\n    identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not\n    remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained\n    within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any\n    descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the\n    Initial Developer.\n\n    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.\n\n    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in\n    Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of\n    this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to\n    offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.\n    However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of\n    the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it\n    absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or\n    liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree\n    to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any\n    liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a\n    result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.\n\n    3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.\n\n    You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under\n    the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your\n    choice, which may contain terms different from this License,\n    provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License\n    and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to\n    limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from\n    the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered\n    Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make\n    it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License\n    are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or\n    Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and\n    every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial\n    Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.\n\n    3.6. Larger Works.\n\n    You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with\n    other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute\n    the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make\n    sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered\n    Software.\n\n4. Versions of the License.\n\n    4.1. New Versions.\n\n    Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or\n    new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be\n    given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section\n    4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify\n    this License.\n\n    4.2. Effect of New Versions.\n\n    You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the\n    Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the\n    License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If\n    the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software\n    prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available\n    under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and\n    make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version\n    of the License under which You originally received the Covered\n    Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or\n    otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any\n    subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.\n\n    4.3. Modified Versions.\n\n    When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new\n    license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a\n    modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and\n    remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to\n    note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise\n    make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this\n    License.\n\n5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.\n\n    COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\n    INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE\n    IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR\n    NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF\n    THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE\n    DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY\n    OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,\n    REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN\n    ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS\n    AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.\n\n6. TERMINATION.\n\n    6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to\n    cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.\n    Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the\n    termination of this License shall survive.\n\n    6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding\n    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a\n    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You\n    assert such claim is referred to as \"Participant\") alleging that the\n    Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the\n    Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the\n    Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or\n    indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the\n    Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under\n    Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice\n    from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the\n    expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60\n    day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant\n    Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to\n    a written agreement with Participant.\n\n    6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant\n    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly\n    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by\n    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent\n    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses\n    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken\n    into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or\n    license.\n\n    6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,\n    all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any\n    distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses\n    granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.\n\n7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.\n\n    UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT\n    (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE\n    INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF\n    COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE\n    TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR\n    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n    LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER\n    FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR\n    LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE\n    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT\n    APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH\n    PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH\n    LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR\n    LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION\n    AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.\n\n    The Covered Software is a \"commercial item,\" as that term is defined\n    in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of \"commercial computer\n    software\" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §\n    252.227-7014(a)(1)) and \"commercial computer software documentation\"\n    as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent\n    with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4\n    (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software\n    with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights\n    clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other\n    clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer\n    software under this License.\n\n9. MISCELLANEOUS.\n\n    This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject\n    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\n    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\n    necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by\n    the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within\n    the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,\n    provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law\n    provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject\n    to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and\n    venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,\n    with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without\n    limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.\n    The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for\n    the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or\n    regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be\n    construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You\n    agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United\n    States export administration regulations (and the export control\n    laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute\n    or otherwise make available any Covered Software.\n\n10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.\n\n    As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is\n    responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,\n    out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to\n    work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such\n    responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or\n    shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\nLICENSE (CDDL)\n\nThe code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of the\nState of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any\nlitigation relating to this License shall be subject to the jurisdiction\nof the Federal Courts of the Northern District of California and the\nstate courts of the State of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara\nCounty, California.\n\n\n\n  The GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor\nBoston, MA 02110-1335\nUSA\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies\nof this license document, but changing it is not allowed.\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\nshare and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to\nmake sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public\nLicense applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and\nto any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free\nSoftware Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.\nOur General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the\nfreedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this\nservice if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone\nto deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.\nYou must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.\nAnd you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nWe wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program\nproprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must\nbe licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under\nthe terms of this General Public License. The \"Program\", below, refers\nto any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means\neither the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is\nto say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either\nverbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running\nthe Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program\n(independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that\nis true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source\ncode as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice\nand disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to\nthis License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other\nrecipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of\nit, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute\nsuch modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided\nthat you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part\n    thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties\n    under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice\n    that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a\n    warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these\n    conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.\n    (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not\n    normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program\n    is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and\ncan be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on\nthe Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this\nLicense, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a\nstorage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the\nscope of this License.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost\n    of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed\n    only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the\n    program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in\n    accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code\nmeans all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special\nexception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the\nexecutable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access\nto copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy\nthe source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source\ncode, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\nalong with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise\nto copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will\nautomatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will\nnot have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in\nfull compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all\nits terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the\nProgram or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions\non the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute\nso as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and\nany other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not\ndistribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would\nnot permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who\nreceive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you\ncould satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from\ndistribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented\nby public license practices. Many people have made generous\ncontributions to the wide range of software distributed through that\nsystem in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to\nthe author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute\nsoftware through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be\na consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License may\nadd an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those\ncountries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries\nnot thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the\nlimitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version\nnumber of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the\nFree Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE\nENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH\nYOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL\nNECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR\nDAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL\nDAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM\n(INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED\nINACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF\nTHE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR\nOTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to\nattach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey\nthe exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n    WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU\n    General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1335 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type\n    `show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute\n    it under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course, the commands\nyou use may be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they\ncould even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n    program `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by\n    James Hacker.\n\n    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications\nwith the library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library\nGeneral Public License instead of this License.\n\n#\n\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America, Inc. and/or its\naffiliates are subject to the following clarification and special\nexception to the GPLv2, based on the GNU Project exception for its\nClasspath libraries, known as the GNU Classpath Exception, but only\nwhere Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's\nheader the words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to\nthe \"Classpath\" exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file\nthat accompanied this code.\"\n\nYou should also note that Oracle includes multiple, independent\nprograms in this software package. Some of those programs are provided\nunder licenses deemed incompatible with the GPLv2 by the Free Software\nFoundation and others.  For example, the package includes programs\nlicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.  Such programs are\nlicensed to you under their original licenses.\n\nOracle facilitates your further distribution of this package by adding\nthe Classpath Exception to the necessary parts of its GPLv2 code, which\npermits you to use that code in combination with other independent\nmodules not licensed under the GPLv2.  However, note that this would\nnot permit you to commingle code under an incompatible license with\nOracle's GPLv2 licensed code by, for example, cutting and pasting such\ncode into a file also containing Oracle's GPLv2 licensed code and then\ndistributing the result.  Additionally, if you were to remove the\nClasspath Exception from any of the files to which it applies and\ndistribute the result, you would likely be required to license some or\nall of the other code in that distribution under the GPLv2 as well, and\nsince the GPLv2 is incompatible with the license terms of some items\nincluded in the distribution by Oracle, removing the Classpath\nException could therefore effectively compromise your ability to\nfurther distribute the package.\n\nProceed with caution and we recommend that you obtain the advice of a\nlawyer skilled in open source matters before removing the Classpath\nException or making modifications to this package which may\nsubsequently be redistributed and/or involve the use of third party\nsoftware.\n\nCLASSPATH EXCEPTION\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is\nmaking a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and\nconditions of the GNU General Public License version 2 cover the whole\ncombination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent\nmodules, and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under\nterms of your choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked\nindependent module, the terms and conditions of the license of that\nmodule.  An independent module is a module which is not derived from or\nbased on this library.  If you modify this library, you may extend this\nexception to your version of the library, but you are not obligated to\ndo so.  If you do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement\nfrom your version.\n\n--------------------\nThe Fakeload library\n\nMIT License\n\nCopyright (c) 2017 Marten Sigwart\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person\nobtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files\n(the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Pre-built binaries of all the\nTika jars can be fetched from Maven Central or your favourite Maven mirror.\n\n**Tika 2.X and support for Java 8 is planned to reach End of Life (EOL) in April, 2025. \nSee [Tika Roadmap 2.x, 3.x and beyond](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/TIKA/Tika+Roadmap+--+2.x%2C+3.x+and+Beyond).** \n\nTika is based on **Java 17** and uses the [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org) build system. \n**N.B.** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/personal) is used for tests in tika-integration-tests.\nAs of Tika 2.5.1, if Docker is not installed, those tests are skipped.  Docker is required for a successful\nbuild on earlier 2.x versions.\n\nTo build Tika from source, use the following command in the main directory:\n\n    mvn clean install\n\n\nThe build consists of a number of components, including a standalone runnable jar that you can use to try out Tika features. You can run it like this:\n\n    java -jar tika-app/target/tika-app-*.jar --help\n\n\nTo build a specific project (for example, tika-server-standard):\n\n    mvn clean install -am -pl :tika-server-standard\n\nIf the ossindex-maven-plugin is causing the build to fail because a dependency\nhas now been discovered to have a vulnerability:\n\n    mvn clean install -Dossindex.skip\n\n\nMaven Dependencies\n==================\n\nApache Tika provides *Bill of Material* (BOM) artifact to align Tika module versions and simplify version management. \nTo avoid convergence errors in your own project, import this\nbom or Tika's parent pom.xml in your dependency management section.\n\nIf you use Apache Maven:\n\n```xml\n<project>\n  <dependencyManagement>\n    <dependencies>\n      <dependency>\n       <groupId>org.apache.tika</groupId>\n       <artifactId>tika-bom</artifactId>\n       <version>4.x.y</version>\n       <type>pom</type>\n       <scope>import</scope>\n      </dependency>\n    </dependencies>\n  </dependencyManagement>\n\n  <dependencies>\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>org.apache.tika</groupId>\n      <artifactId>tika-parsers-standard-package</artifactId>\n      <!-- version not required since BOM included -->\n    </dependency>\n  </dependencies>\n</project>\n```\n\nFor Gradle:\n\n```kotlin\ndependencies {\n  implementation(platform(\"org.apache.tika:tika-bom:4.x.y\"))\n\n  // version not required since bom (platform in Gradle terms)\n  implementation(\"org.apache.tika:tika-parsers-standard-package\")\n}\n```\n\nMigrating to 4.x\n================\nTBD\n\nContributing via Github\n=======================\nSee the [pull request template](https://github.com/apache/tika/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md).\n\n**NOTE:** Please open pull requests against the `main` branch.  We locked `master` in September 2020 and no longer use it.\n\n## Thanks to all the people who have contributed\n\n[![contributors](https://contributors-img.web.app/image?repo=apache/tika)](https://github.com/apache/tika/graphs/contributors)\n\nBuilding from a Specific Tag\n============================\nLet's assume that you want to build the 3.0.1 tag:\n```\n0. Download and install hub.github.com\n1. git clone https://github.com/apache/tika.git \n2. cd tika\n3. git checkout 3.0.1\n4. mvn clean install\n```\n\nIf a new vulnerability has been discovered between the date of the \ntag and the date you are building the tag, you may need to build with:\n\n```\n4. mvn clean install -Dossindex.skip\n```\n\nIf a local test is not working in your environment, please notify\n the project at dev@tika.apache.org. As an immediate workaround, \n you can turn off individual tests with e.g.: \n\n```\n4. mvn clean install -Dossindex.skip -Dtest=\\!UnpackerResourceTest#testPDFImages\n```\n\nLicense (see also LICENSE.txt)\n==============================\n\nCollective work: Copyright 2011 The Apache Software Foundation.\n\nLicensed to the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) under one or more contributor license agreements.
