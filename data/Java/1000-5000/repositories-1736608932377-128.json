Contributing\ncode is a great way to give something back to the open source community. Before\nyou dig right into the code, there are a few guidelines that we need\ncontributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of\nthings.\n\nSome of the ideas are documented in the [Maven Wiki][maven-wiki]\nwhich might be interesting to read and for further discussion.\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\n+ Make sure you have a [JIRA account](https://issues.apache.org/jira/).\n+ Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).\n+ If you're planning to implement a new feature, it makes sense to discuss your changes\n  on the [dev list](https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html) first.\n  This way you can make sure you're not wasting your time on something that isn't\n  considered to be in Apache Maven's scope.\n+ Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.\n  + Clearly describe the issue, including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.\n  + Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.\n+ Fork the repository on GitHub.\n\nMaking and Submitting Changes\n--------------\n\nWe accept Pull Requests via GitHub. The [developer mailing list][dev-ml-list] is the\nmain channel of communication for contributors.  \nThere are some guidelines which will make applying PRs easier for us:\n+ Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (this is usually the master branch).\n  Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n+ Make commits of logical units.\n+ Respect the original code style: by using the same [codestyle][code-style],\n  patches should only highlight the actual difference, not being disturbed by any formatting issues:\n  + Only use spaces for indentation.\n  + Create minimal diffs - disable on save actions like reformat source code or organize imports.\n    If you feel the source code should be reformatted, create a separate PR for this change.\n  + Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.\n+ Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format. Your commit message should contain the key of the JIRA issue.\n```\n[MNG-XXX] - Subject of the JIRA Ticket\n Optional supplemental description.\n```\n+ Make sure you have added the necessary tests (JUnit/[Core IT tests][core-it]) for your changes.\n+ Run all the tests with `mvn -Prun-its verify` to assure nothing else was accidentally broken.\n+ Submit a pull request to the repository in the Apache organization.\n+ Update your JIRA ticket and include a link to the pull request in the ticket.\n\nIf you plan to contribute on a regular basis, please consider filing a [contributor license agreement][cla].\n\nMaking Trivial Changes\n----------------------\n\nFor changes of a trivial nature to comments and documentation, it is not always\nnecessary to create a new ticket in JIRA.  In this case, it is appropriate to\nstart the first line of a commit with '(doc)' instead of a ticket number.\n\nAdditional Resources\n--------------------\n\n+ [Contributing patches](https://maven.apache.org/guides/development/guide-maven-development.html#Creating_and_submitting_a_patch)\n+ [Apache Maven JIRA project page](https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/MNG/)\n+ [Contributor License Agreement][cla]\n+ [General GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/)\n+ [GitHub pull request documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)\n+ [Apache Maven Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/ASFMavenProject)\n+ #Maven IRC channel on freenode.org\n\n[dev-ml-list]: https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html\n[code-style]: https://maven.apache.org/developers/conventions/code.html\n[cla]: https://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas\n[maven-wiki]: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MAVEN/Index\n[core-it]: https://maven.apache.org/core-its/core-it-suite/\n"
