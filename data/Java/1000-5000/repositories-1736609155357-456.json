(/cycler)\n- Added //paste [-ao] syntax to paste without air and at origin.\n- Added support for //stack [-a] to not stack air.\n- Added the ability to configure the schematic and CraftScript directories.\n- Added better support for cake, added some more block/item aliases.\n- Added support for rotation block orientation with the rotate and flip\n    commands (now stairs, torches, etc. will rotate correctly).\n- Added distance to //size.\n- Added more brush shapes (hollow sphere, cylinder, hollow cylinder,\n    and clipboard) for the brush tools.\n- Added in a valid block ID check.\n- Added debugging information for when no snapshots could be found.\n- Added pattern support to //overlay (i.e. //overlay 3%torch,97%air).\n- Added a clipboard pattern (//set #clipboard) -- useful for repeating\n    patterns over an area.\n- Changed the arm swing tools to also work on right click.\n- Improved block drop list (thanks to Gunther De Wachter).\n- Fixed scripting.timeout setting taking no effect.\n- Fixed group checking with Permissions.\n- Moved commands around in the code and added hierarchical permissions\n    support in the process. All permission systems supported by WorldEdit\n    (and utilizing plugins) support hierarchy, regardless if they really\n    do or not. WorldEdit will simulate hierarchy as required.\n\n2.15.2:\n- Minor additions for ease of integration.\n\n2.15.1:\n- Fixed /script.js shortcut not stripping forward slashes.\n- Changed some internal working directory handling code to better support\n    single player modifications.\n\n2.15:\n- Added roof.js by Bentech. It makes a roof over your selection.\n- Added wool as an alias for cloth.\n- Added support for specifying color names instead of data values for cloth.\n- For the brush tools and the compass, you now have to SWING with your arm.\n- Right click with the compass now toggles between /thru and /jumpto.\n- The algorithm for /thru was improved.\n- Fixed quickshot.js not reading notes correctly.\n- Fixed /butcher. (I also added necessary methods to Bukkit so you now\n    have to update that too.)\n- draw.js now supports orientation and choses white wool for white pixels\n    instead of pink! (Thanks to Dean Ward.)\n- Improved /info tool to handle more block data.\n- Changed /s to /.s to avoid conflicts.\n- Now you can use /script.js directly as a command.\n- Improved /info tool to handle more block data.\n\n2.14.2:\n- Fixed array out of bounds error with snapshots.\n\n2.14.1:\n- Improved some error messages.\n- Fixed snapshots not supporting all block types.\n- Fixed forest generator.\n\n2.14:\n- Added full block data support (furnaces, note blocks, etc.) for Bukkit.\n- Added /s to repeat last script.\n\n2.13:\n- Scripting support is back!\n- Colored cloth blocks should now work.\n- Fixed issue where the command's arguments were printed to chat when\n    you also did not have permissions.\n\n2.12:\n- Added new flat file permissions resolver, added * support for\n    ConfigurationPermissionsResolver.\n- Added support for Niji's permission system.\n- Fixed bad list to array conversion in ConfigurationPermissionsResolver.\n- Fixed default permissions with the built-in permission resolvers.\n- Fixed issue with BlockWorldVector causing java.lang.VerifyError due to\n    how Bukkit loads plugins.\n- Ops now have all permissions.\n- Changed /reload WorldEdit to /reloadwe.\n- Moved WorldEdit to use Bukkit's command registration. Let's hope\n    this didn't break things.\n\n2.11:\n- Ported over toi's ray tracing code so that it's now included in\n    WorldEdit. This will make porting WorldEdit to single player\n    and other platforms easier.\n- Fixed NullPointerExceptions that appeared while saving a chest.\n- Fixed NullPointerExceptions in some super pickaxe modes, made arm swing\n    handler get called on item usage. This means that you can use\n    /brush and /rbrush now but you right click in the air instead of\n    swinging your arm.\n- Made super pickaxe arm swing and right click modes mutually exclusive.\n- Added the navigation wand. Normally a swing of your navigation wand\n    would call /jumpto, but in the mean time you have to right click.\n\n2.10:\n- Inventory support now works for Bukkit.\n- Now /jumpto and /thru works.\n- Now prints an error message if permission is not available.\n- Added support for cloth color with the super pickaxe drops.\n- Updated GroupUsers support to use GroupUsers' new API. GroupUsers\n    must be updated as well.\n- Added wand-item to default config.yml.\n\n2.9:\n- Added pine tree tool.\n- Bukkit: Added support for GroupUsers. If GroupUsers is not present,\n    WorldEdit will fall back to its own permissions system.\n- Bukkit: Added sign support for Bukkit.\n\n2.8.1:\n- Added some extra functions to Vector for WorldGuard.\n- Made setup easier and less confusing.\n\n2.8:\n- Improved Bukkit support.\n\n2.7.2:\n- Fixed permissions checking for individual commands.\n- /butcher should now kill animals again.\n- /thru should now treat torches and such as pass-through blocks.\n\n2.7.1:\n- Added tree and item drop support for the Bukkit version.\n\n2.7:\n- Added sphere brush tool. Use /sphere <id> [radius] [noReplace?] to\n    enable it and /none to disable it (note: /none also disables the\n    right click super pickaxe tool). The brush tool builds a sphere at the\n    location that you are looking at. For the last argument, put \"true\"\n    or \"yes\" to prevent the brush from replacing non-air blocks.\n- Changed water to be considered a pass-through block. This means that\n    /thru, /jumpto, and such commands will ignore water.\n- /tree now makes regular tree and /bigtree makes big trees. /forestgen\n    will still make big tree forests.\n- The block replacer tool should now support inventory.\n- Fixed the NullPointerException with /jumpto and similar commands.\n- Made handling of non-right angles in getDirection() return more\n    relevant errors. Now //stack and similar commands won't give you the\n    cryptic error of \"Unknown direction: me\".\n- Updated sample worldedit.properties file.\n\n2.6:\n- Removed 'air' prefix from commands. Now //pasteair is just //paste,\n    //moveair is just //move, etc.\n- Made /worldeditselect permission more encompassing, now including //chunk,\n    //expand, and //contract.\n- Added syntax for //expand <amt> <reverse-amt> <direction> which allows\n    you to expand in two directions at once. This also works for //contract.\n- Added //expand vert|vertical to expand the selection from top to bottom.\n- Added /thaw to reverse /snow.\n- Fixed WorldEdit not handling ice removal well.\n- Fixed some inaccuracy problems regarding player positions caused by a\n    recent update.\n- Fixed the tree generator.\n- Code reorganized a little more.\n\n2.5.1:\n- Fixed the WorldEdit bridge used by CraftBook and other plugins.\n- Fixed issues with permissions where the only reliable permission was\n    /worldedit.\n\n2.5:\n- Fixed issues with permissions not being read correctly.\n- WorldEdit is now world-aware (not that the Minecraft server is).\n- Abstracted super pickaxe mode/tools and changed commands to /tree, /info,\n    /none, /single, /area, and /recur.\n- New /repl super pickaxe tool.\n- Now bundling JNBT.\n- Add a very rudimentary command line program that will check the integrity\n    (a very basic integrity check) of a world.\n\n2.4:\n- Added the ability to use (require) inventory with operations, preventing\n    people from setting blocks that they don't have.\n- Simplified the max blocks change limit to be binary (either you have it or\n    not). Also separated the 'max' limit and the 'default' limit in terms\n    of configuration. This means that the WorldEdit restrictions file is\n    no longer used.\n- A large part of the code was moved around (again) to make porting\n    WorldEdit to other modding APIs easier, but this means that something\n    may have broken.\n- Chest handling was rewritten for Minecraft beta, so it should be\n    reliable now and not cause exceptions.\n- Item damage is now managed by WorldEdit's chest handling APIs.\n- Worked around an issue with the java.util.zip implementation that\n    caused ZIP files containing backslashes to not work correctly.\n- Changed the TrueZip support to use the API for java.util.zip, meaning\n    some bugs should be fixed.\n- Made all commands support double forward slashes as the command prefix.\n\n2.3.4:\n- Fixed issues with chests.\n- Added configuration option that disables the \"//\" prefix and lets you use\n    single forward slashes too.\n\n2.3.3\n- Updated for beta.\n- Fixed error caused by not specifying a mob spawner type when using mob\n    spawner blocks.\n- Improved version detection to be more reliable.\n- Fixed incorrect item drops for the super pickaxe.\n\n2.3.2:\n- Fixed the history/queue array lists being iterated in the wrong direction.\n    //move should be fixed as a result.\n\n2.3.1:\n- Updated for b129+ and v0.2.6_02.\n\n2.3:\n- Blocks should now be set and removed correctly so that they don't\n    drop items.\n- /fixwater and /fixlava should no longer cross solely diagonally connected\n    pools.\n- Fixed //smooth lifting water upwards.\n- Added //shift to move the selection.\n- Added //flip to flip the clipboard.\n- ; instead of | can be used when specifying extra tile entity data\n    for blocks that support them.\n- Items are now dropped by the super pickaxe (configurable).\n- The info tool is governed by the permission /infotool and the tree tool\n    is now goverened by the /treetool permission.\n- New info tool (//tool info) that tells you information about the block\n    that you right click with a pickaxe on, including the type of mob\n    spawned by a mob spawner.\n- Mob spawners are now supported for all operations. To specify a mob type,\n    use syntax like //set mobspawner;Pig or //set mobspawner|Pig\n- Added a catch for the IOException now thrown by recent versions of hMod.\n\n2.2.1:\n- Fixed compatibility with server v0.2.5.\n\n2.2:\n- Added Grum's //smooth command to smooth terrain. Select the entire area\n    and use //smooth on it, perhaps specifying a number of iterations,\n    with a larger number of iterations meaning a smoother terrain. Trees and\n    other blocks like fences currently do not drop.\n- Fixed output messages for //pos2 and //hpos2 when used.\n- Updated for server version 0.2.5.\n\n2.1:\n- Switched usage of HashMaps to double ArrayLists in the history function,\n    increasing the speed of everything by up to 20x.\n- The data values of blocks that use them won't be set anymore, decreasing\n    the packet spam generated.\n- Added //fillr that recursively fills (it's //fill except it will\n    fill nooks and crannies).\n- Fixed /unstuck lifting you when you weren't stuck.\n- Added a filename character whitelist to schematic saving/loading\n    routines. (regex: ^[A-Za-z0-9_\\- \\./\\\\'\\$@~!%\\^\\*\\(\\)\\[\\]\\+\\{\\},\\?]+$)\n- Expanded the character whitelist for snapshot names (to the same as the\n    one for schematic saving/loading).\n- .schematics now save original copy offset.\n- Added //count that counts the number of blocks in a region.\n- Added //distr that prints the distribution of blocks in a region.\n- Added /butcher to kill all/nearby mobs.\n- Added mob killing to the super pickaxe.\n\n2.0.2:\n- Fixed issues with /listsnapshot and //restore not working.\n- Fixed help for //expand and //contract.\n- /jumpto should work reliably again.\n\n2.0.1:\n- Fixed the issue with the super pickaxe not working with bedrock.\n- Fixed an issue with the recursive super pickaxe not working properly.\n- Added an argument to /listsnapshots to show more snapshots.\n- Added an argument to //restore that lets you select a snapshot for\n    restoring without //use.\n\n2.0:\n- Added help message to //load telling users about //paste.\n- Added Notch tree planting tool mode with the right click of the pickaxe.\n    (Undo is supported!)\n- Added recursive super pickaxe mode that destroys blocks adjacent,\n    destroying only blocks of the same type as the block that you clicked on\n- Added area super pickaxe mode that destroys a cuboid area on use,\n    destroying only blocks of the same type as the block that you clicked on.\n- Added pasting at origin and saving origin to .schematics.\n- Added /chunk to select all the blocks inside the chunk that you are in.\n- Shortcut /replacenear lets you replace nearby blocks.\n    Example: /replacenear 50 rock glass\n- /ascend, /descend, and /unstuck now detect pass-through blocks better.\n- Added /up to go up some distance.\n- Added /snow command to overlay snowfall and freeze lakes in the area.\n- Both /pinegen and /forestgen (now) have a density argument. Values\n    between 0 and 100 are accepted.\n- Changed old forest generator command to /pinegen.\n- Changed /forestgen to generate forests using Notch's tree algorithm\n    (fully undoable).\n- Improved speed of commands that iterated over cuboids by 5-40%.\n- Support for setting random block content with //set.\n    Example: //set 5%diamondore,95%glass\n    Numbers don't have to add up to any particular number.\n- Block IDs are now resolved with hMod as well, should it fail to resolve\n    with WorldEdit.\n- Added support for replacing a list of blocks with //replace.\n- Added register-help configuration to prevent WorldEdit commands from\n    showing up in help.\n- /ascend, /descend, and /unstuck now clamp Y to >= 0.\n- Added /worldeditselect permission that will give users access to all\n    commands and functions that let you define selections.\n- Point selection functions now emit the coordinates.\n- //size now displays coordinate information.\n- Added per-group block change limit restrictions support.\n- Possibly added .tar.bz2/tar.gz support. Untested and highly\n    unrecommended.\n- Added command logging setting and logging to file.\n- Added max-radius configuration to clamp radii and sizes.\n- Added /fixlava.\n- New /ex area fire extinguisher command (shortcut to /removenear fire 40).\n- Added class to access WorldEdit selections from other plugins.\n- //contract and //expand argument orders swapped to go with the other\n    direction commands like //stack.\n- Super pickaxe now ignores TNT. (Before it caused ignition on client-side\n    only).\n- Y coordinates are now clamped between 0 and 127 when blocks are set\n    by WorldEdit. This fixes some exceptions.\n- Expanded the priority block list significantly to handle more block types.\n- .schematic load/save error messages are now more descriptive.\n- Fixed iron pick axe not working as a super pickaxe.\n- Plugin .jar renamed from SMWorldEdit to WorldEdit as it was confusing.\n- WorldEdit version is now printed on load.\n\n0.13.2:\n- Added support for the new block types from the Halloween update.\n\n0.13.1:\n- Updated for b123.\n- New /pumpkins command. Happy Halloween!\n- //fill now uses its own stack so that it doesn't cause stack overflow\n    errors for overly large regions.\n- For commands that look for a block ID (//replace, /removenear), it will\n    no longer check against the WorldEdit block restriction list.\n\n0.12\n- Added /listchunks\n- Added /delchunks (creates a shell script).\n\n0.11:\n- New TrueZIP support.\n- Fixed the issue with certain blocks dropping items (torches, etc.).\n- Chests are partially supported. Double width chests don't paste too well yet.\n- //expand and //contract are now bounded on the Y-axis.\n- Cactus was removed from the list of allowed blocks.\n\n0.10:\n- Issues with the permissions regarding the super pick axe mode and\n    the edit wand have been resolved.\n- For the super pick axe to destroy bedrock, permission must be given for\n    /worldeditbedrock.\n- Added /chunkinfo to tell you information about the chunk that you are in.\n- Added support for restoring regions from a backup. /listsnapshots, //use,\n    and //restore have been added.\n- Added //hpos1 and //hpos2 to set the corners of the cuboid to the block\n    that you are looking at.\n- Added /jumpto to go to the spot that you are looking at.\n- Added /thru to go through the wall in front of you.\n- Added /ceil to get to the ceiling of a room.\n\n0.9:\n- Giving permission to just /worldedit is now enough to have access to all\n    WorldEdit commands.\n- The super pickaxe toggle command has been changed to //, but the old \"/,\"\n    command will continue to work. When assigning permissions, give access to //\n- Added //move and //moveair to move the selection.\n- Fixed the help for //wand.\n- Fixed a bug that caused commands to be case sensitive.\n- Permissions for the non-air command (i.e. //stack vs //stackair) now\n    extend to the air command.\n- Added /removenear to remove nearby blocks of a type.\n- Fixed the incorrect help for some commands.\n- Added //cyl and //hcyl to generate filled and hollow circles and cylinders.\n- Added //sphere and //hsphere to generate filled and hollow spheres.\n- Added //walls to generate the sides of a cuboid region.\n\n0.8.3:\n- //rotate fixed.\n- Fixed some floating point inaccurracy errors.\n- Exceptions are now caught when handling commands so that they can be\n    reported to the current user.\n\n0.8.2:\n- Signs that are not in a loaded chunk will no longer cause an exception.\n- /unstuck, /ascend, and /descend are more accurate now. /descend also\n    won't drop you from 20 feet up and it won't drop you into the void anymore.\n\n0.8.1:\n- Added a workaround for the onBlockDestroy hook returning (0, 0, 0).\n\n0.8:\n- All operations now implicitly support working with block data, including\n    sign text. This applies to .schematic loading and saving.\n- Scripting support has been removed.

We appreciate your \neffort, but to make sure that the inclusion of your patch is a smooth process, we\nask that you make note of the following guidelines.\n\n* **Target Java 21 for source and compilation.** Make sure to mark methods with\n  ` @Override` that override methods of parent classes, or that implement\n  methods of interfaces.\n* **Use only spaces for indentation.** Our indents are 4-spaces long, and tabs\n  are unacceptable.\n* **Wrap code to a 120 column limit.** We do this to make side by side diffs\n  and other such tasks easier. Ignore this guideline if it makes the code\n  too unreadable.\n* **Write complete Javadocs.** Do so only for public methods, and make sure\n  that your `@param` and `@return` fields are not just blank.\n* **Don't tag classes with @author.** Some legacy classes may have this tag,\n  but we are phasing it out.\n* **Make sure the code is efficient.** One way you can achieve this is to spend\n  around ten minutes to think about what the code is doing and whether it\n  seems awfully roundabout. If you had to copy the same large piece of\n  code in several places, that's bad.\n* **Keep commit summaries under 70 characters.** For more details, place two\n  new lines after the summary line and write away!\n* **Test your code.** We're not interested in broken code, for the obvious reasons.\n* **Write unit tests.** While this is strictly optional, we recommend it for\n  complicated algorithms.\n\n\nAdditional Notes\n----------------\nIf you're submitting a feature, base your code on `master` and PR against the\n`master` branch. If you're submitting a bugfix, base your code on the newest\n`version/*` branch, and PR against that same branch.\n\n\nChecklist\n---------\n\nReady to submit? Perform the checklist below:\n\n1. Have all tabs been replaced into four spaces? Are indentations 4-space wide?\n2. Have I written proper Javadocs for my public methods? Are the @param and\n   @return fields actually filled out?\n3. Have I `git rebase`d my pull request to the latest commit of the target\n   branch?\n4. Have I combined my commits into a reasonably small number (if not one)\n   commit using `git rebase`?\n5. Have I made my pull request too large? Pull requests should introduce\n   small sets of changes at a time. Major changes should be discussed with\n   the team prior to starting work.\n6. Are my commit messages descriptive?\n\nYou should be aware of [`git rebase`](https://docs.github.com/github/getting-started-with-github/about-git-rebase).\nIt allows you to modify existing commit messages, and combine, break apart, or\nadjust past changes.\n\nExample\n-------\n\nThis is **GOOD:**\n\n    if (var.func(param1, param2)) {\n        // do things\n    }\n\nThis is **EXTREMELY BAD:**\n\n    if(var.func( param1, param2 ))\n    {\n        // do things\n    }\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.

          "content": "<h1>\n    <img src=\"worldedit-logo.svg\" alt=\"WorldEdit\" width=\"400\" /> \n</h1>\n\n**A Minecraft Map Editor... that runs in-game!**\n\n* With selections, schematics, copy and paste, brushes, and scripting!\n* Use it in creative, survival in single player or on your server.\n* Use it on your Minecraft server to fix griefing and mistakes.\n\nJava Edition required. WorldEdit is compatible with Forge, Fabric, Bukkit, Spigot, Paper, and Sponge.\n\n## Download WorldEdit\n\nThis place contains the Java code for WorldEdit, but if you want to just use WorldEdit, get the mod or plugin from Modrinth:\n\nhttps://modrinth.com/plugin/worldedit/versions\n\nEdit the Code\n---------\n\nWant to add new features to WorldEdit or fix bugs yourself? You can get the game running, with WorldEdit, from the code here, without any additional outside steps, by doing the following *four* things:\n\n1. Download WorldEdit's source code and put it somewhere. We recommend you use something called Git if you already know how to use it, but [you can also just download a .zip file](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEdit/archive/master.zip). (If you plan on contributing the changes, you will need to figure out Git.)\n2. Install any version of Java greater than or equal to 21.\n   * Note that if you do _not_ install JDK 21 exactly, Gradle will download it for you on first run. However, it is still required to have some form of Java installed for Gradle to start at all.\n3. Open terminal / command prompt / bash and navigate to the directory where you put the source code.\n4. Run **one** of these following commands:\n   * Mac OS X / Linux: `./gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`\n   * Windows - Command Prompt: `gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`\n   * Windows - PowerShell: `.\\gradlew :worldedit-fabric:runClient`\n\n🎉 That's it. 🎉 It takes a long time to actually transform WorldEdit into a mod. If it succeeds, **the Minecraft game will open and you can create a single player world with WorldEdit**.\n\nWhen you make changes to the code, you have to restart the game by re-running the command for your changes to take effect. If there are errors in your Java syntax, the command will fail.\n\nFor additional information about compiling WorldEdit, see [COMPILING.md](COMPILING.md).\n\n### Using a Java IDE\n\nTo edit WorldEdit in a Java IDE, follow these steps:\n\n1. Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).\n2. In the IDE, open the folder that you saved WorldEdit's code in. This creates a new project in IDEA.\n\nThat's pretty much it.\n\nIf you want to be able to run the game also, follow these instructions:\n\n1. Go to Run -> Edit Configurations.\n2. Add a Gradle task:\n   1. Choose `worldedit-fabric` for the project.\n   2. For the tasks, type in `runClient`\n3. Click OK\n4. Under the Run menu again, go to \"Debug [your new task]\".\n\n### Speeding up the Edit-Test-Edit-Test Cycle\n\nIt's a little annoying have to restart the game to test your changes. The best way to reduce the time is to run the server instead (using `runServer` instead of `runClient`) and then reconnect to the server after restarting it.\n\nSubmitting Your Changes\n------------\n\nWorldEdit is open source (specifically licensed under GPL v3), so note that your contributions will also be open source. The best way to submit a change is to create a fork on GitHub, put your changes there, and then create a \"pull request\" on our WorldEdit repository.\n\nPlease read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for important guidelines to follow.\n\nLinks\n-----\n\n* [Visit our website](https://enginehub.org/)\n* [Discord](https://discord.gg/enginehub)\n* [Issue tracker](https://github.com/EngineHub/WorldEdit/issues)\n* [Continuous integration](https://builds.enginehub.org) [![Build Status](https://ci.enginehub.org/app/rest/builds/buildType:bt10,branch:master/statusIcon.svg)](https://ci.enginehub.org/viewType.html?buildTypeId=bt10&guest=1)\n* [End-user documentation](https://worldedit.enginehub.org/en/latest/)\n\nSupporters\n----------\n\n[![YourKit Logo](https://www.yourkit.com/images/yklogo.png)](https://www.yourkit.com/)\n\nYourKit supports open source projects with innovative and intelligent tools for monitoring and profiling Java and .NET applications.\nYourKit is the creator of [YourKit Java Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/java/profiler/),\n[YourKit .NET Profiler](https://www.yourkit.com/.net/profiler/),\nand [YourKit YouMonitor](https://www.yourkit.com/youmonitor/).\n"
