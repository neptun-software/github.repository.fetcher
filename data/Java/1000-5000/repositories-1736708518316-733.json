More details are [in this blog post](http://blog.persistent.info/2014/05/per-package-method-counts-for-androids.html).\n\nTo run it with Ant:\n\n    $ ant jar\n    $ ./dex-method-counts path/to/App.apk # or .zip or .dex or directory\n\nor with Gradle:\n\n    $ ./gradlew assemble\n    $ ./dex-method-counts path/to/App.apk # or .zip or .dex or directory\n\non Windows:\n\n    $ gradlew assemble\n    $ dex-method-counts.bat path\\to\\App.apk\n\nYou'll see output of the form:\n\n    Read in 65490 method IDs.\n    <root>: 65490\n        : 3\n        android: 6837\n            accessibilityservice: 6\n            bluetooth: 2\n            content: 248\n                pm: 22\n                res: 45\n            ...\n        com: 53881\n            adjust: 283\n                sdk: 283\n            codebutler: 65\n                android_websockets: 65\n            ...\n        Overall method count: 65490\n\nSupported options are:\n\n* `--count-fields`: Provide the field count instead of the method count.\n* `--include-classes`: Treat classes as packages and provide per-class method counts. One use-case is for protocol buffers where all generated code in a package ends up in a single class.\n* `--package-filter=...`: Only consider methods whose fully qualified name starts with this prefix.\n* `--max-depth=...`: Limit how far into package paths (or inner classes, with `--include-classes`) counts should be reported for.\n* `--filter=[all|defined_only|referenced_only]`: Whether to count all methods (the default), just those defined in the input file, or just those that are referenced in it. Note that referenced methods count against the 64K method limit too.\n* `--output-style=[flat|tree]`: Print the output as a list or as an indented tree.\n\nThe DEX file parsing is based on the `dexdeps` tool from\n[the Android source tree](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/dalvik.git/+/master/tools/dexdeps/).\n"
