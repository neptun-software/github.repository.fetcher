This document is a guide to help you through the process of contributing to esProc development and maintenance.\n\n# 1 Copyright notice\n\nOnce you submit your code and documents to the esProc open-source project, you grant the recipient of the esProc software a perpetual, global, non-exclusive, free, copyright-free and irrevocable copyright license to use, copy, modify, sublicense and distribute your contributions and their derivative works. The use of your content will not cause harm to any person or entity, and you shall compensate for any damages caused by your content. The esProc project will not be responsible for any content provided by you or any third party.\n\n# 2 Becoming a contributor\n\nFirst you need to register a GitHub account and then follow these required steps. If you are already familiar with the GitHub registering process, just ignore this section.\n\n## 2.1 Download code to the local\n\n### (1)Fork repository\n\nOpen<a href=\"https://github.com/SPLWare/esProc\" target=\"_blank\"> SPLWare/esProc </a>GitHub homepage, click Fork button to create a repository copy under your username, such as <https://github.com/USERNAME/esProc>\n\n### (2)Clone the remote repository to local\n\n`git clone git@github.com:/USERNAME/esProc.git`\n\n## 2.2 Compile on your local machine\n\nYou can use the common Java development tools to import esProc as a Maven project. Take Eclipse as an example, we import it to an existing Maven project.\n\n![comimg001](https://img.raqsoft.com.cn/file/2024/06/a194059662b640f69e608fefb8d4b741_conimg001.png)\n\nNext, select the directory where the esProc project is stored.\n\n![comimg002](https://img.raqsoft.com.cn/file/2024/06/25c2a1c96e7f42a598a817b5453fa833_conimg002.png)\n\nClick “Finish” button and wait for the project to load and compile automatically.\n\n![comimg003](https://img.raqsoft.com.cn/file/2024/06/38632f82dd4a417c978e8249112b2541_conimg003.png)\n\n## 2.3 Commit code\n\n### (1)Keep a repository updated locally\n\nBefore creating a Pull Request to merge code into the original esProc repository (<https://github.com/SPLWare/esProc>), you need to synchronize the latest code from the original repository.\n\nThe remote repository named “origin” is the esProc repository that you forked to your own username. Next, you need to create a remote host of the original esProc repository and name it “upstream”.\n\n`git remote add upstream git@github.com:SPLWare/esProc.git`\n\nGet the latest code in the original esProc repository.\n\n`git pull upstream master`\n\n### (2)Commit changes locally\n\nBefore executing git commit, use git add \\<file> to add the modified or newly added files. If you want to undo the changes to a file, use `git checkout -- <file>.`\n\nEach git commit requires a commit comment to help others understand what changes were made in each commit. This can be done with `git commit -m \"My comment\"`\n\n### (3)Push commits to a remote repository\n\nPush your local changes to GitHub, that is, <https://github.com/USERNAME/esProc>.\n\n`git push origin master`\n\n### (4)Merge a Pull Request (PR) to the full commits\n\nOpen the page <https://github.com/USERNAME/esProc>, switch to Pull requests, and click “New pull request” button.\n![comimg004](https://img.raqsoft.com.cn/file/2024/06/eb6f852e039847359c4076969039a052_conimg004.png)\nAdd the necessary comments and click “Create pull request” button.\n\n## 2.4 Reply Code Review and revise changes\n\nPlease reply a comment by starting a review, rather than replying directly in the PR comment box. The latter will result in one email each time you reply.\n\n# 3.Learning, communicating and sharing feedback\n\nIf you have new feature requirements or find bugs, you can create an issue on GitHub to give feedback. If you need more information, go to <https://www.scudata.com/>, where you can find a large amount of documentation as well as initiating or participating in various discussions on the forum.\n\nDue to time zone differences, you may not get an immediate response, so please be patient.\n\n# 4. Specifications and references\n\n## 4.1 Coding style guide\n\nRefer to the source code that comes with JDK, and there are no other requirements.\n\n## 4.2 Error message specification\n\nDescribe input and errors directly, including full exception stack trace (if any);\n\nProvide a complete comparison of expectations and actual performance;\n\nIf you have any suggestions for changes, add it to the description.\n"

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\r\n    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\r\n\r\n    1. DEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n    \"Contribution\" means:\r\n\r\n    a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\r\n       documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\r\n\r\n    b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\r\n\r\n       i)  changes to the Program, and\r\n\r\n       ii) additions to the Program;\r\n\r\n       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\r\n       and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\r\n       'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\r\n       such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\r\n       Contributions do not include additions to the Program which: (i) are\r\n       separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with the\r\n       Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not derivative\r\n       works of the Program.\r\n\r\n    \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\r\n\r\n    \"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\r\n    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\r\n    or when combined with the Program.\r\n\r\n    \"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this\r\n    Agreement.\r\n\r\n    \"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\r\n    including all Contributors.\r\n\r\n    2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\r\n\r\n    a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\r\n       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license\r\n       to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly\r\n       perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\r\n       Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\r\n       object code form.\r\n\r\n    b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\r\n       Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\r\n       Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and\r\n       otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in\r\n       source code and object code form. This patent license shall apply to\r\n       the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at the time\r\n       the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the\r\n       Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed\r\n       Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\r\n       which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed\r\n       hereunder.\r\n\r\n    c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\r\n       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\r\n       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\r\n       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\r\n       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\r\n       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\r\n       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights\r\n       and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\r\n       responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\r\n       needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is\r\n       required to allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is\r\n       Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license before\r\n       distributing the Program.\r\n\r\n    d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\r\n       copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\r\n       license set forth in this Agreement.\r\n\r\n    3. REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\n    A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\r\n    under its own license agreement, provided that:\r\n\r\n    a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\r\n\r\n    b) its license agreement:\r\n\r\n       i)   effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\r\n            and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\r\n            conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties\r\n            or conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular\r\n            purpose;\r\n\r\n       ii)  effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\r\n            for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\r\n            consequential damages, such as lost profits;\r\n\r\n       iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\r\n            offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\r\n\r\n       iv)  states that source code for the Program is available from such\r\n            Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\r\n            reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for\r\n            software exchange.\r\n\r\n    When the Program is made available in source code form:\r\n\r\n    a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\r\n\r\n    b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\r\n       the Program.\r\n\r\n    Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\r\n    within the Program.\r\n\r\n    Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\r\n    Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\r\n    Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.\r\n\r\n    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\r\n    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\r\n    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\r\n    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product offering\r\n    should do so in a manner which does not create potential liability for\r\n    other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes the Program\r\n    in a commercial product offering, such Contributor (\"Commercial\r\n    Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every other\r\n    Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\r\n    and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and\r\n    other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\r\n    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\r\n    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the\r\n    Program in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this\r\n    section do not apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual\r\n    or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify,\r\n    an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\r\n    Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial\r\n    Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor\r\n    in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified\r\n    Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own expense.\r\n\r\n    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\r\n    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\r\n    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\r\n    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\r\n    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\r\n    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\r\n    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those\r\n    performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\r\n    Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\r\n    must pay those damages.\r\n\r\n    5.

Each Recipient is solely responsible for\r\n    determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program\r\n    and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this\r\n    Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program\r\n    errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\r\n    programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\r\n\r\n    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\r\n\r\n    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\r\n    ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\r\n    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\r\n    WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\r\n    LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\r\n    NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\r\n    DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\r\n    HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\r\n\r\n    7. GENERAL\r\n\r\n    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\r\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\r\n    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\r\n    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\r\n    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\r\n\r\n    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\r\n    respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\r\n    counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\r\n    Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of\r\n    the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes\r\n    patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or\r\n    counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program itself (excluding\r\n    combinations of the Program with other software or hardware) infringes\r\n    such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\r\n    Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails\r\n    to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement\r\n    and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after\r\n    becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under\r\n    this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution\r\n    of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's\r\n    obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by Recipient\r\n    relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\r\n\r\n    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\r\n    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may\r\n    only be modified in the following manner.

IBM may\r\n    assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable\r\n    separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a\r\n    distinguishing version number. The Program (including Contributions) may\r\n    always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which\r\n    it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is\r\n    published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including\r\n    its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in\r\n    Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses\r\n    to the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement,\r\n    whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

Currently, SPL is available only in  esProc, so we often use 'SPL' or the full term 'esProc SPL' interchangeably to refer to the same product, 'esProc'.\n \n### [esProc Analytics](https://www.scudata.com/langding-page-spl-data-analysis/)\nSPL adopts a unique grid programming approach, where code is written in cells and the results of each calculation step can be viewed in real-time through the cells. It has the same strong interactivity as Excel and can also be embedded into Excel to work, making it very suitable for exploratory data analysis.  \nSPL provides a rich computing library, particularly adept at set and order-related operations, enabling complex calculations without the need for multiple layers of nesting and lengthy code, making it simpler than SQL and Python. It supports simple parallel computing at the same time, fully ensuring the computational performance during big data analysis.\n \n### [esProc Reporting](https://www.scudata.com/esproc-for-Reporting/)\nSPL is developed in Java and can be seamlessly embedded into Java reporting tools. The interpreted executed code supports hot swap, making it very suitable for the ever-changing reporting businesses.  \nSPL has lightweight multi-source computing capabilities, without the need for a logical data warehouse, and can directly perform mixed computing based on multi-source data such as text, databases, NoSQL, and cloud data, naturally supporting real-time hot data reporting.  \nSPL syntax is more concise, which can greatly simplify the difficulty of complex SQL coding in reports and quickly implement report development. Specifically, SPL also provides the ability to migrate SQL across databases for existing SQL reports.\n \n### [esProc BigData](https://www.scudata.com/esproc-spl/)\nSPL does not adopt the relational algebra-based SQL syntax. It invents an algebraic system called discrete data set instead to solve the problems of hard-to-code complex SQL. SPL makes it convenient to achieve high-performance algorithms and thus obtains much higher computing performance than the traditional relational data warehouse. It can make the most use of the hardware resources by using creative algorithms. According to many practical instances, esProc can achieve, even exceed, the performance that the distributed databases have on a single machine.  \nRunning as a data warehouse, esProc abandons the concept of “house” , breaks the closedness featured by the conventional databases and creates an open computing system, making it qualified to replace most MPP data warehouses at lower resource-cost and with lighter framework.\n\n\n##\tTo Learn esProc SPL\n\nThis book: [SPL Programming](http://c.scudata.com/article/1634722432114) is a good start for learning SPL syntax. The book intends for beginners who do not have any programming experiences. Look it through quickly if you are a veteran, but the object understanding explained in section 4.4 is worth a study. Chapter 5 is important, too. It explains SPL’s set-oriented way of thinking, which is quite different from the other languages. But once you understand and master SPL, you can write elegant code. Chapters 8-10 are staple of SPL learning. It regards the structured data computations in a different perspective from SQL. This is significant even for the professional programmers! From the SPL point of view, SQL is a little simple in understanding the structured data as the world is complex. **The knowledges you obtained in various database courses are not broad and profound enough! You need a review and brush-up！**\n\nFind basic SPL concepts in this post: [SPL concepts for beginners](https://blog.scudata.com/spl-concepts-for-beginners/). For beginners, you can find characteristic basic computations of SPL in [SPL Operations for Beginners](https://blog.scudata.com/spl-operations-for-beginners/). Experienced programmers can quickly understand the differences between SPL and SQL. A software architect can understand the differences between SPL and traditional databases after reading  [Q&A of esProc Architecture](https://blog.scudata.com/qa-of-esproc-architecture/).\n\nFind comprehensive SPL documentation in  [SPL Learning materials](https://blog.scudata.com/spl-learning-materials/). Generally, an application programmer can get started in handling basic operations from database connection:  [SPL: Connecting to Databases](https://blog.scudata.com/spl-connecting-to-databases/) and database read/write  [SPL: Reading and Writing Database Data](https://blog.scudata.com/spl-reading-and-writing-database-data/) or file access and computation  [SPL: Reading and Writing Structured Text Files](https://blog.scudata.com/spl-reading-and-writing-structured-text-files/). Then you can learn how to integrate SPL in a Java application [How to Call an SPL Script in Java](https://blog.scudata.com/how-to-call-an-spl-script-in-java/). Those make a simple learning loop.\n\nHigh-performance computations are relatively difficult, but there is a systematic book on algorithms: [Performance Optimization](https://c.scudata.com/article/1641367696194). Performance optimization algorithms are not unique to SPL. You can implement high-performance computations using another programming language (except for SQL) after you learn these algorithms. The key lies in algorithm instead of syntax. Yet, you need to grasp SPL concept and syntax well in order to better understand the algorithms.\n\nThe SPL learning posts above also contain applications of the performance optimization algorithms.\n\nStorage forms the cornerstone of high-performance computing. The following post introduces the proprietary storage schema commonly used in SPL for beginners: [How to use SPL storage for beginners](https://blog.scudata.com/how-to-use-spl-storage-for-beginners/). Usually, the first step of performance optimization is designing an appropriate storage schema.\n\nYou are welcome to post your troubles and problems when trying to achieve high performance computing and discuss with us to find a solution: [Wanted!
