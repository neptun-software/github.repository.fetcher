As result, we now use anonymous aggregate user \nanalytics to help us understand how Allure Report is being used.\n\n### When/Where?\n\nAllure's analytics are sent throughout Allure report's plugins to Google Analytics over HTTPS.\n\n### How?\n    \nThe code is viewable in [GaPlugin.java](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2/blob/main/allure-generator/src/main/java/io/qameta/allure/ga/GaPlugin.java)\n\n### Opting out\n\nAllure analytics helps us maintainers and leaving it on is appreciated.
