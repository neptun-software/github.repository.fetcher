There are\njust a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n\n## Contributor License Agreement ##\n\nContributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor\nLicense Agreement.  This is not a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives\nGoogle permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the\nproject.\n\n  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you\n    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual\n    CLA][].\n\n  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,\n    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][].\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted\none (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n[individual CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual\n[corporate CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate\n\nOnce your CLA is submitted (or if you already submitted one for\nanother Google project), make a commit adding yourself to the\n[CONTRIBUTORS][] file. This commit can be part of your first [pull request][].\n\n[CONTRIBUTORS]: CONTRIBUTORS\n\n\n## Submitting a patch ##\n\n  1. It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or\n     feature you're intending to fix.  Even if you think it's relatively minor,\n     it's helpful to know what people are working on.  Mention in the initial\n     issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can\n     be assigned to you.\n\n  2. Follow the normal process of [forking][] the project, and setup a new\n     branch to work in.  It's important that each group of changes be done in\n     separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the\n     commits related to that bug or feature.\n\n  3. Do your best to have [well-formed commit messages][] for each change.\n     This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit\n     messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools. If you \n     are contributing to the codebase, make sure your code adheres to the \n     appropriate [style guide][].\n\n  4. Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request][].\n\n[forking]: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\n[well-formed commit messages]: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\n[style guide]: https://github.com/google/physical-web/wiki/Coding-Style-Guides\n[pull request]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request\n"

Our premise is that you should be able to walk up to any “smart” physical object (e.g. a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car) and interact with it without first downloading an app. The user experience of smart objects should be much like links in a web browser, just tap and use.\n\nAt its base, the Physical Web is a discovery service: a smart object broadcasts relevant URLs that any nearby device can receive. This simple capability can unlock exciting new ways to interact with the Web.\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/1yaLPRgtlR0\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/1yaLPRgtlR0/0.jpg\" alt=\"Introduction to the Physical Web\" width=\"240\" height=\"180\" border=\"10\" /></a>\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/physical-web.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/physical-web)\n\n## Why URLs?\n\nThe URL is the fundamental building block of the web, giving remarkable flexibility of expression. It can be:\n\n* a web page with just a tiny paragraph of info\n* a fully interactive web page\n* a deep link into a native application\n\n## Why We're Doing This\nThe number of smart objects is going to explode, both in our homes and in public spaces. Much like the web, there is going to be a long tail of interactivity for smart objects. But the overhead of installing an app for each one just doesn’t  scale. We need a system that lets you walk up and use a device with just a tap. The Physical Web isn’t about replacing native apps; it’s about allowing interaction for the times when native apps just aren’t practical.\n\n## Open Design\nThe Physical Web must be an open standard that everyone can use. This can’t be a product that is locked down by a single company. Like many web specifications, this is an open source design that is being released early so everyone can experiment and comment on it. There is much to discuss and add to this specification.\n\n## Contents\n* [Introduction/FAQ](http://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/introduction.md) - Most common questions\n* [Getting started guide](http://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/getting_started.md) - How you can try it out\n* [Technical overview](https://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/technical_overview.md)\n* [Eddystone](https://github.com/google/eddystone) - Repo with the specification for the beacons themselves\n* [mDNS support](https://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/mDNS_Support.md) - How to use mDNS instead of Bluetooth to broadcast public URLs and local data\n* [Wi-Fi Direct support](https://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/WiFi_Direct_Support.md) - How to use Wi-Fi Direct instead of Bluetooth to broadcast local data\n* [SSDP support](https://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/ssdp_support.md) - How to use SSDP instead of Bluetooth to broadcast URLs\n* [Branding guidelines](https://github.com/google/physical-web/blob/master/documentation/branding_guidelines.md)\n* Different Physical Web clients\n    * [Android](android)  \n    * [IOS](ios)  \n    * [Node](nodejs)  This is a minimal client meant for building utilities\n"
