If you need to customize the localKey, you can use the sha512 tool to generate the key based on plaintext and update the `shenyu.local.sha512Key` property.\n\n```\ncurl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:9195/shenyu/plugin/selectorAndRules' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n--header 'localKey: 123456' \\\n--data-raw '{\n    \"pluginName\": \"divide\",\n    \"selectorHandler\": \"[{\\\"upstreamUrl\\\":\\\"127.0.0.1:8080\\\"}]\",\n    \"conditionDataList\": [{\n        \"paramType\": \"uri\",\n        \"operator\": \"match\",\n        \"paramValue\": \"/**\"\n    }],\n    \"ruleDataList\": [{\n        \"ruleHandler\": \"{\\\"loadBalance\\\":\\\"random\\\"}\",\n        \"conditionDataList\": [{\n            \"paramType\": \"uri\",\n            \"operator\": \"match\",\n            \"paramValue\": \"/**\"\n        }]\n    }]\n}'\n```\n\n* Proxy request ：http://localhost:9195/helloworld \n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\" : \"Shenyu\",\n  \"data\" : \"hello world\"\n}\n```\n---\n\n# Plugin\n\n Whenever a request comes in, Apache ShenYu will execute it by all enabled plugins through the chain of responsibility.\n \n As the heart of Apache ShenYu, plugins are extensible and hot-pluggable.\n \n Different plugins do different things.\n \n Of course, users can also customize plugins to meet their own needs.\n \n If you want to customize, see [custom-plugin](https://shenyu.apache.org/docs/developer/custom-plugin/) .\n \n---  \n \n# Selector & Rule \n\n  According to your HTTP request headers, selectors and rules are used to route your requests.\n  \n  Selector is your first route, It is coarser grained, for example, at the module level.\n  \n  Rule is your second route and what do you think your request should do. For example a method level in a module.\n  \n  The selector and the rule match only once, and the match is returned. So the coarsest granularity should be sorted last.\n \n---  \n   \n# Data Caching & Data Sync\n \n  Since all data have been cached using ConcurrentHashMap in the JVM, it's very fast.\n  \n  Apache ShenYu dynamically updates the cache by listening to the ZooKeeper node (or WebSocket push, HTTP long polling) when the user changes configuration information in the background management.\n  \n  ![](https://shenyu.apache.org/img/shenyu/dataSync/shenyu-config-processor-en.png)\n  \n  ![](https://shenyu.apache.org/img/shenyu/dataSync/config-strategy-processor-en.png)\n\n---    \n\n# Prerequisite\n \n   * JDK 17+\n   \n--- \n        \n# Stargazers over time\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/apache/shenyu.svg)](https://starchart.cc/apache/shenyu.svg)\n\n---  \n\n# Contributor and Support\n\n* [How to Contribute](https://shenyu.apache.org/community/contributor-guide)\n* [Mailing Lists](mailto:dev@shenyu.apache.org)\n\n---  \n\n# Known Users\n\nIn order of registration, More access companies are welcome to register at [https://github.com/apache/shenyu/issues/68](https://github.com/apache/shenyu/issues/68) (For open source users only) .\n\nAll Users : [Known Users](https://shenyu.apache.org/community/user-registration)\n"
