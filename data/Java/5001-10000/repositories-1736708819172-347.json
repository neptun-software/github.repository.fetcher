          "content": "# Changelog\n\n## 2.2.2\n\n- Fixed IllegalArgumentException being incorrectly thrown in `GravitySnapRecyclerView` when Gravity.CENTER is used.\n\n## 2.2.1\n\n- Fixed `GravitySnapHelper` not dispatching snap events for edge items sometimes on `SnapListener`\n\n## 2.2.0\n\n### New features\n- Added Gravity.CENTER support ([#21](https://github.com/rubensousa/GravitySnapHelper/issue/21))\n- Added setMaxFlingDistance and setMaxFlingSizeFraction to change the max fling distance allowed ([#29](https://github.com/rubensousa/GravitySnapHelper/issue/29))\n- Added setSnapToPadding to allow snapping to the padding set in the RecyclerView. Defaults to false ([#58](https://github.com/rubensousa/GravitySnapHelper/issue/58))\n- Added GravitySnapRecyclerView that uses GravitySnapHelper by default\n- Added setGravity to change the gravity of GravitySnapHelper\n- Added setScrollMsPerInch to change the scroll speed\n- Added setSnapListener to allow changing the SnapListener that was set or clearing it\n- GravityPagerSnapHelper is now deprecated. Use GravitySnapHelper together with setMaxFlingSizeFraction() to achieve the same behavior\n- Added updateSnap to update the snap position if for some reason snapping was stopped\n\n### Improvements\n\n- Improved behavior when smoothScrollToPosition is called. Now the smooth scroller is used\n- Added getters to all relevant properties\n- getCurrentSnappedPosition now searches for the correct snap view instead of returning the last position that we snapped to\n- Added missing NonNull and Nullable annotations\n\n## 2.1.0\n\n- OrientationAwareRecyclerView now doesn't depend on LinearLayoutManager directly\n- Fixed SnapListener not being called for the first position sometimes (#57)\n- Added getCurrentSnappedPosition to GravitySnapHelper and GravityPagerSnapHelper\n\n## 2.0\n\n### New features:\n- Migrated to AndroidX.\n- Added smoothScrollToPosition and scrollToPosition methods that'll snap to a certain position.\n- Added OrientationAwareRecyclerView that only handles scroll events according to its orientation.\n\n### Bug fixes:\n- Fixed snapping not working correctly for RecyclerViews with padding (#49)\n- Fixed snapping not considering GridLayoutManager.SpanSizeLookup (#52)\n\n## 1.5\n\n- Fixed reverse layout causing scrolling issues (#40)\n\n## 1.4\n\n- Added Nullable and NonNull annotations\n- Updated support library\n\n## 1.3\n\n- Fixed IllegalStateException being thrown when SnapHelper is attached twice to a RecyclerView (#23)\n- Bumped min sdk to 14\n\n## 1.2\n\n- Added support for GridLayoutManager\n\n## 1.1\n\n- Added GravityPagerSnapHelper\n- Updated support library\n\n## 1.0\n\n- GravitySnapHelper extends from LinearSnapHelper again\n- Added SnapListener to listen for snap events\n\n\n## 0.3\n\n- Extend from SnapHelper until https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=223649 gets fixed.\n\n## 0.2\n\n- Added RTL support\n- Fixed GravitySnapHelper scrolling too far sometimes (#2)\n- Added support to snap last items via enableLastItemSnap(boolean enable)\n\n\n## 0.1\n\n- Initial release\n"

RTL support out of the box\n\n## Nested RecyclerViews\n\nTake a look at these blog posts if you're using nested RecyclerViews\n\n1.
