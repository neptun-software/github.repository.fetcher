          "content": "# [Hyperledger Code of Conduct](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/hyperledger-project-code-of-conduct)\n\nHyperledger is a collaborative project at The Linux Foundation. It is an open-source and open\ncommunity project where participants choose to work together, and in that process experience\ndifferences in language, location, nationality, and experience. In such a diverse environment,\nmisunderstandings and disagreements happen, which in most cases can be resolved informally. In rare\ncases, however, behavior can intimidate, harass, or otherwise disrupt one or more people in the\ncommunity, which Hyperledger will not tolerate.\n\nA **Code of Conduct** is useful to define accepted and acceptable behaviors and to promote high\nstandards of professional practice. It also provides a benchmark for self evaluation and acts as a\nvehicle for better identity of the organization.\n\nThis code (**CoC**) applies to any member of the Hyperledger community – developers, participants in\nmeetings, teleconferences, mailing lists, conferences or functions, etc. Note that this code\ncomplements rather than replaces legal rights and obligations pertaining to any particular\nsituation.\n\n## Statement of Intent\n\nHyperledger is committed to maintain a **positive** [work environment](#work-environment). This\ncommitment calls for a workplace where [participants](#participant) at all levels behave according\nto the rules of the following code. A foundational concept of this code is that we all share\nresponsibility for our work environment.\n\n## Code\n\n1. Treat each other with [respect](#respect), professionalism, fairness, and sensitivity to our many\n   differences and strengths, including in situations of high pressure and urgency.\n\n2. Never [harass](#harassment) or [bully](#workplace-bullying) anyone verbally, physically or\n   [sexually](#sexual-harassment).\n\n3. Never [discriminate](#discrimination) on the basis of personal characteristics or group\n   membership.\n\n4. Communicate constructively and avoid [demeaning](#demeaning-behavior) or\n   [insulting](#insulting-behavior) behavior or language.\n\n5. Seek, accept, and offer objective work criticism, and [acknowledge](#acknowledgement) properly\n   the contributions of others.\n\n6. Be honest about your own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts\n   of interest.\n\n7. Respect the privacy of others and the confidentiality of data you access.\n\n8. With respect to cultural differences, be conservative in what you do and liberal in what you\n   accept from others, but not to the point of accepting disrespectful, unprofessional or unfair or\n   [unwelcome behavior](#unwelcome-behavior) or [advances](#unwelcome-sexual-advance).\n\n9. Promote the rules of this Code and take action (especially if you are in a\n   [leadership position](#leadership-position)) to bring the discussion back to a more civil level\n   whenever inappropriate behaviors are observed.\n\n10. Stay on topic: Make sure that you are posting to the correct channel and avoid off-topic\n    discussions. Remember when you update an issue or respond to an email you are potentially\n    sending to a large number of people.\n\n11. Step down considerately: Members of every project come and go, and the Hyperledger is no\n    different. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, we ask that you do\n    so in a way that minimizes disruption to the project. This means you should tell people you are\n    leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you left off.\n\n## Glossary\n\n### Demeaning Behavior\n\nis acting in a way that reduces another person's dignity, sense of self-worth or respect within the\ncommunity.\n\n### Discrimination\n\nis the prejudicial treatment of an individual based on criteria such as: physical appearance, race,\nethnic origin, genetic differences, national or social origin, name, religion, gender, sexual\norientation, family or health situation, pregnancy, disability, age, education, wealth, domicile,\npolitical view, morals, employment, or union activity.\n\n### Insulting Behavior\n\nis treating another person with scorn or disrespect.\n\n### Acknowledgement\n\nis a record of the origin(s) and author(s) of a contribution.\n\n### Harassment\n\nis any conduct, verbal or physical, that has the intent or effect of interfering with an individual,\nor that creates an intimidating, hostile, or offensive environment.\n\n### Leadership Position\n\nincludes group Chairs, project maintainers, staff members, and Board members.\n\n### Participant\n\nincludes the following persons:\n\n- Developers\n- Member representatives\n- Staff members\n- Anyone from the Public partaking in the Hyperledger work environment (e.g. contribute code,\n  comment on our code or specs, email us, attend our conferences, functions, etc)\n\n### Respect\n\nis the genuine consideration you have for someone (if only because of their status as participant in\nHyperledger, like yourself), and that you show by treating them in a polite and kind way.\n\n### Sexual Harassment\n\nincludes visual displays of degrading sexual images, sexually suggestive conduct, offensive remarks\nof a sexual nature, requests for sexual favors, unwelcome physical contact, and sexual assault.\n\n### Unwelcome Behavior\n\nHard to define? Some questions to ask yourself are:\n\n- how would I feel if I were in the position of the recipient?\n- would my spouse, parent, child, sibling or friend like to be treated this way?\n- would I like an account of my behavior published in the organization's newsletter?\n- could my behavior offend or hurt other members of the work group?\n- could someone misinterpret my behavior as intentionally harmful or harassing?\n- would I treat my boss or a person I admire at work like that ?\n- Summary: if you are unsure whether something might be welcome or unwelcome, don't do it.\n\n### Unwelcome Sexual Advance\n\nincludes requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, where:\n\n- submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an\n  individual's employment,\n- submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment\n  decisions affecting the individual,\n- such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work\n  performance or creating an intimidating hostile or offensive working environment.\n\n### Workplace Bullying\n\nis a tendency of individuals or groups to use persistent aggressive or unreasonable behavior (e.g.\nverbal or written abuse, offensive conduct or any interference which undermines or impedes work)\nagainst a co-worker or any professional relations.\n\n### Work Environment\n\nis the set of all available means of collaboration, including, but not limited to messages to\nmailing lists, private correspondence, Web pages, chat channels, phone and video teleconferences,\nand any kind of face-to-face meetings or discussions.\n\n## Incident Procedure\n\nTo report incidents or to appeal reports of incidents, send email to Mike Dolan\n(mdolan@linuxfoundation.org) or Angela Brown (angela@linuxfoundation.org). Please include any\navailable relevant information, including links to any publicly accessible material relating to the\nmatter. Every effort will be taken to ensure a safe and collegial environment in which to\ncollaborate on matters relating to the Project. In order to protect the community, the Project\nreserves the right to take appropriate action, potentially including the removal of an individual\nfrom any and all participation in the project. The Project will work towards an equitable resolution\nin the event of a misunderstanding.\n\n## Credits\n\nThis code is based on the\n[W3C’s Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc) with some\nadditions from the [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/)‘s Code of Conduct.\n"

(see [proposal PR template](#proposal-pr-template).)\n    - The proposed maintainer accepts the nomination and expresses a willingness\n      to be a long-term (more than 6 month) committer by adding a comment in the proposal PR.\n    - The PR will be communicated in all appropriate communication channels\n      including at least [web3j-contributors channel on Hyperledger Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperledger),\n      the [mailing list](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/web3j)\n      and any maintainer/community call.\n- Approval by at least 2 current maintainers within two weeks of the proposal or\n  an absolute majority (half the total + 1) of current maintainers.\n    - Maintainers will vote by approving the proposal PR.\n- No veto raised by another maintainer within the voting timeframe.\n    - All vetoes must be accompanied by a public explanation as a comment in the\n      proposal PR.\n    - A veto can be retracted, in that case the voting timeframe is reset and all approvals are removed.\n    - It is bad form to veto, retract, and veto again.\n\nThe proposed maintainer becomes a maintainer either:\n\n- when two weeks have passed without veto since the third approval of the proposal PR,\n- or an absolute majority of maintainers approved the proposal PR.\n\nIn either case, no maintainer raised and stood by a veto.\n\n## Removing Maintainers\n\nBeing a maintainer is not a status symbol or a title to be maintained indefinitely.\n\nIt will occasionally be necessary and appropriate to move a maintainer to emeritus status.\n\nThis can occur in the following situations:\n\n- Resignation of a maintainer.\n- Violation of the Code of Conduct warranting removal.\n- Inactivity.\n    - A general measure of inactivity will be no commits or code review comments\n      for two reporting quarters, although this will not be strictly enforced if\n      the maintainer expresses a reasonable intent to continue contributing.\n    - Reasonable exceptions to inactivity will be granted for known long term\n      leave such as parental leave and medical leave.\n- Other unspecified circumstances.\n\nAs for adding a maintainer, the record and governance process for moving a\nmaintainer to emeritus status is recorded using review approval in the PR making that change.\n\nReturning to active status from emeritus status uses the same steps as adding a\nnew maintainer.\n\nNote that the emeritus maintainer always already has the required significant contributions.\nThere is no contribution prescription delay.\n\n## Proposal PR template\n\n```markdown\nI propose to add [maintainer github handle] as a Web3J project maintainer.\n\n[maintainer github handle] contributed with many high quality commits:\n\n- [list significant achievements]\n\nHere are [their past contributions on Web3J project](https://github.com/hyperledger/web3j/commits?author=[user github handle]).\n\nVoting ends two weeks from today.\n\nFor more information on this process see the Becoming a Maintainer section in the MAINTAINERS.md file.\n```"

Get involved!\n--------\nSince Web3J moved under Hyperledger we started to do Web3J Contributors calls every 2 weeks!\nSubscribe to our community page and to see check our call schedule.\nYour contribution matters!\n- [Community Link](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/web3j) - Check our last updates! \n- [Calendar Invite](https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/web3j/ics/invite.ics?repeatid=57401) - Add the contributor call to your calendar!\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n-   Complete implementation of Ethereum's\n    [JSON-RPC](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC) client\n    API over HTTP and IPC\n-   Ethereum wallet support\n-   Auto-generation of Java smart contract wrappers to create, deploy,\n    transact with and call smart contracts from native Java code\n    ([Solidity](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#using-the-commandline-compiler)\n    and\n    [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle-contract-schema)\n    definition formats supported)\n-   Reactive-functional API for working with filters\n-   [Ethereum Name Service (ENS)](https://ens.domains/) support\n-   Support for Parity's\n    [Personal](https://github.com/paritytech/parity/wiki/JSONRPC-personal-module),\n    and Geth's\n    [Personal](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/wiki/Management-APIs#personal)\n    client APIs\n-   Support for [Alchemy](https://docs.alchemyapi.io/alchemy/guides/getting-started#web-3-j) and [Infura](https://infura.io/), so you don't have to run\n    an Ethereum client yourself\n-   Comprehensive integration tests demonstrating a number of the above\n    scenarios\n-   Command line tools\n-   Android compatible\n-   Support for JP Morgan's Quorum via\n    [web3j-quorum](https://github.com/web3j/quorum)\n-   Support for [EEA Privacy features as described in EEA\n    documentation](https://entethalliance.org/technical-documents/) and\n    implemented in [Hyperledger\n    Besu](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#eea-methods).\n\nIt has five runtime dependencies:\n\n-   [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) for its\n    reactive-functional API\n-   [OKHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp/)\n    for HTTP connections\n-   [Jackson Core](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-core) for fast\n    JSON serialisation/deserialization\n-   [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) for\n    crypto\n-   [Jnr-unixsocket](https://github.com/jnr/jnr-unixsocket) for \\*nix\n    IPC (not available on Android)\n-   [Java-WebSocket](https://github.com/TooTallNate/Java-WebSocket)\n\nIt also uses [JavaPoet](https://github.com/square/javapoet) for\ngenerating smart contract wrappers.\n\nQuickStart\n---------\nThe simplest way to start your journey with Web3j is to create a project.\nWe provide this functionality using the [Web3j CLI](http://docs.web3j.io/latest/command_line_tools/). This latter can be installed as follows:\n\nFor Unix:\n\n```shell script\ncurl -L get.web3j.io | sh && source ~/.web3j/source.sh\n```\n\nFor Windows, in Powershell:\n\n```shell script\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/web3j-installer/main/installer.ps1'))\n```\n\nCreate a new project by running:\n\n```shell script\n$ web3j new \n```\n\nOr use our [Maven](https://github.com/web3j/web3j-maven-plugin) or \n[Gradle](https://github.com/web3j/web3j-gradle-plugin) plugins to \ngenerate java files from Solidity contracts.\n\n\n#### Please head to the [Web3j Documentation](https://docs.web3j.io) for further instructions on using Web3j.\n\nMaven\n-----\n\nJava:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>org.web3j</groupId>\n  <artifactId>core</artifactId>\n  <version>4.12.2</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n**Note:** The Web3j Java binaries are compiled using Java 17. Java 17 or a more recent version is required to use Web3j\n as a dependency.\n\nAndroid:\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>org.web3j</groupId>\n  <artifactId>core</artifactId>\n  <version>4.8.9-android</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nGradle\n------\n\nJava:\n\n```groovy\nimplementation ('org.web3j:core:4.12.2')\n```\n\nAndroid:\n\n```groovy\nimplementation ('org.web3j:core:4.8.9-android')\n```\n\nBuild instructions\n------------------\n\nWeb3j includes integration tests for running against a live Ethereum\nclient. If you do not have a client running, you can exclude their\nexecution as per the below instructions.\n\nTo run a full build (excluding integration tests):\n\n``` {.sourceCode .bash}\n$ ./gradlew check\n```\n\nTo run the integration tests, you will need to set up these variables in order to pull the Docker \nimages from the Docker Hub registry:\n\n- `registry.username`\n- `registry.password`\n\nThen run the following command:\n\n``` {.sourceCode .bash}\n$ ./gradlew -Pintegration-tests=true :integration-tests:test\n```\n\nIf you do not want the integration test to run:\n\n``` {.sourceCode .bash}\n$ ./gradlew -Pintegration-tests=false :test\n```\n\nCheck the [Docker client API](https://github.com/docker-java/docker-java/blob/master/docs/getting_started.md#instantiating-a-dockerclientconfig)\nfor more information on configuration options.\n\n\nProjects using Web3j\n------------------\n\n<a href=\"https://alphawallet.com/\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/alphawallet-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Alphawallet logo\" src=\"static-imgs/alphawallet-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://linea.build\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/linea-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Linea logo\" src=\"static-imgs/linea-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://consensys.io/\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/consensys-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"ConsenSys logo\" src=\"static-imgs/consensys-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://ens.domains\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/ens-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"ENS logo\" src=\"static-imgs/ens-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/hyperledger/besu\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/hyperledger-besu-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Hyperledger Besu logo\" src=\"static-imgs/hyperledger-besu-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://web3auth.io\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/web3auth_dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Web3Auth logo\" src=\"static-imgs/web3auth_light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://hedera.com\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/hedera-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Hedera logo\" src=\"static-imgs/hedera-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://celo.org\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/celo-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Celo logo\" src=\"static-imgs/celo-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://explorer.walletconnect.com/\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/walletconnect-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"WalletConnect logo\" src=\"static-imgs/walletconnect-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://argent.xyz\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/argent-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Argent logo\" src=\"static-imgs/argent-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://unstoppabledomains.com\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/unstoppable_domains-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Unstoppable Domains logo\" src=\"static-imgs/unstoppable_domains-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.fnality.org/home\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/fnality-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"Fnality logo\" src=\"static-imgs/fnality-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://zksync.io/\">\n  <picture>\n    <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"static-imgs/zksync-dark.svg\">\n    <img alt=\"zksync logo\" src=\"static-imgs/zksync-light.svg\" width=\"auto\" height=\"50\">\n  </picture>\n</a>\n\nCommercial support and training\n-------------------------------\n\nCommercial support and training is available from\n[web3labs.com](https://www.web3labs.com/web3j-sdk).\n\nLicense\n------\nApache 2.0\n"
