下载试用\n\n[ZBLibraryDemoApp.apk(ZBLibrary)](http://files.cnblogs.com/files/tommylemon/ZBLibraryDemoApp.apk)\n\n[APIJSONApp.apk(APIJSON+ZBLibrary)](http://files.cnblogs.com/files/tommylemon/APIJSONApp.apk)\n\n### 感谢开源\n[Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)\nGoogle 官方推荐的一个强大易用的图片加载库。\n\n[OKHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp)\n很火很强大的 HTTP/HTTPS 传输框架。ZBLibrary 中的 HttpManager 对它做了封装（支持自签名Https），Demo 中的 HttpRequest 是使用示例。\n注：okio.jar 是 OKHttp 的一部分，不能删除。删除后不会在代码中报错，但运行会出错。\n\n[FastJson](https://github.com/alibaba/fastjson)\n阿里巴巴的 JSON 封装和解析库。ZBLibrary 中的 JSON 是对 fastjson 的简单封装，防止解析异常。\n\n[SmartRefreshLayout](https://github.com/scwang90/SmartRefreshLayout)\n下拉刷新、上拉加载的组件库，已在 [BaseHttpRecyclerActivity](https://github.com/TommyLemon/Android-ZBLibrary/blob/master/ZBLibrary/src/main/java/zuo/biao/library/base/BaseHttpRecyclerActivity.java) 等类内置支持。\n\n[SystemBarTint](https://github.com/jgilfelt/SystemBarTint)\n系统栏管理器，我把它用在 ZBLibrary 的 BaseActivity 中实现了状态栏沉浸。\n\n[ZXingLib](https://github.com/xuyisheng/ZXingLib)\n这是该作者对官方 ZXing 二维码库的精简版。我做了修改，作为 ZBLibrary 的 QRCodeLibrary。\n\n\n### 初始化\n\n假设你工程中的 Application 为 zblibrary.demo.application.DemoApplication，并且已在 AndroidManifest.xml 中注册\n```\n    <application\n        android:name=\"zblibrary.demo.application.DemoApplication\"\n        ...\n        >\n    </application>\n```\n\n可以用 DemoApplication 继承 BaseApplication\n```\npublic class DemoApplication extends BaseApplication {\n...\n}\n```\n或 在 DemoApplication 的 onCreate 函数 中调用 BaseApplication.init(this);\n```\npublic class DemoApplication extends Application {\n\n\t@Override\n\tpublic void onCreate() {\n\t\tsuper.onCreate();\n\t\t\n\t\tBaseApplication.init(this);\n\t}\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n注册 权限和 Activity 等代码可复制 ZBLibrary 中 AndroidManifest.xml 里的 \\<uses-permission/>, \\<activity/> 等相关代码。\n\n### 生成代码\n可使用 APIAuto 自动化接口管理工具来生成接口相关代码：\n* 自动生成封装请求 JSON 的代码\n* 自动生成解析结果 JSON 的代码\n* 自动生成 Modle/JavaBean\n\n[https://github.com/TommyLemon/APIAuto](https://github.com/TommyLemon/APIAuto)\n\n### 编程思想\n* 能复制就复制，节约时间避免出错\n* 保留原本结构，简单上手容易调试\n* 增加必要注释，说明功能和使用方法\n* 说明随手可得，不用上网或打开文档\n* 命名必须规范，容易查找一看就懂\n* 重载尽量转发，减少代码容易修改\n* 最先校验参数，任意调用不会崩溃\n* 代码模块分区，方便浏览容易查找\n* 封装常用代码，方便使用降低耦合\n* 回收多余占用，优化内存提高性能\n* 分包结构合理，模块清晰浏览方便\n* 多用工具和快捷键，增删改查快捷高效\n\n###
