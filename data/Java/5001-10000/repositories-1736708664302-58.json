          "content": "# Contributing\n\nWe want this community to be friendly and respectful to each other. Please follow it in all your interactions with the project.\n\n## Development workflow\n\nTo get started with the project, run `yarn` in the root directory to install the required dependencies for each package:\n\n```sh\nyarn\n```\n\n> While it's possible to use [`npm`](https://github.com/npm/cli), the tooling is built around [`yarn`](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/), so you'll have an easier time if you use `yarn` for development.\n\nWhile developing, you can run the [example app](/example/) to test your changes. Any changes you make in your library's JavaScript code will be reflected in the example app without a rebuild. If you change any native code, then you'll need to rebuild the example app.\n\nTo start the packager:\n\n```sh\nyarn example start\n```\n\nTo run the example app on Android:\n\n```sh\nyarn example android\n```\n\nTo run the example app on iOS:\n\n```sh\nyarn example ios\n```\n\n\nMake sure your code passes TypeScript. Run the following to verify:\n\n```sh\nyarn prepare\n```\n\n### Commit message convention\n\nWe follow the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en) for our commit messages:\n\n- `fix`: bug fixes, e.g. fix crash due to deprecated method.\n- `feat`: new features, e.g. add new method to the module.\n- `refactor`: code refactor, e.g. migrate from class components to hooks.\n- `docs`: changes into documentation, e.g. add usage example for the module..\n- `test`: adding or updating tests, e.g. add integration tests using detox.\n- `chore`: tooling changes, e.g. change CI config.\n\n### Linting and tests\n\n[ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)\n\nWe use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting the code.\n\n### Publishing to npm\n\nWe use [Semantic Release](http://semantic-release.org) to automatically release new versions of the library when changes are merged into main. Using the commit message convention described above, it will detect if we need to release a patch, minor, or major version of the library.\n\n### Scripts\n\nThe `package.json` file contains various scripts for common tasks:\n\n- `yarn example start`: start the Metro server for the example app.\n- `yarn example android`: run the example app on Android.\n- `yarn example ios`: run the example app on iOS.\n\n### Sending a pull request\n\n> **Working on your first pull request?** You can learn how from this _free_ series: [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://app.egghead.io/playlists/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\n\nWhen you're sending a pull request:\n\n- Prefer small pull requests focused on one change.\n- Verify that linters and tests are passing.\n- Review the documentation to make sure it looks good.\n- Follow the pull request template when opening a pull request.\n- For pull requests that change the API or implementation, discuss with maintainers first by opening an issue.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\n### Our Pledge\n\nWe as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\nWe pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.\n\n### Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:\n\n- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people\n- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences\n- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback\n- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience\n- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include:\n\n- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or\n  advances of any kind\n- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n- Public or private harassment\n- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email\n  address, without their explicit permission\n- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a\n  professional setting\n\n### Enforcement Responsibilities\n\nCommunity leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\nCommunity leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.\n\n### Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.\n\n### Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.\n\nAll community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.\n\n### Enforcement Guidelines\n\nCommunity leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:\n\n#### 1. Correction\n\n**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.\n\n**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.\n\n#### 2. Warning\n\n**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.\n\n**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.\n\n#### 3. Temporary Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.\n\n**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.\n\n#### 4. Permanent Ban\n\n**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.\n\n**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.\n\n### Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 2.0,\navailable at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html.\n\nCommunity Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).\n\n[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org\n\nFor answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see the FAQ at\nhttps://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.

For reference, you can check the example app's configuration in `example/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` and `example/android/app/build.gradle`.\n\nFor more details, consult the Android documentation on AndroidX Photo Picker: [https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/photopicker)\n\n## API Reference\n\n## Methods\n\n```js\nimport {launchCamera, launchImageLibrary} from 'react-native-image-picker';\n```\n\n### `launchCamera()`\n\nLaunch camera to take photo or video.\n\n```js\nlaunchCamera(options?, callback);\n\n// You can also use as a promise without 'callback':\nconst result = await launchCamera(options?);\n```\n\nSee [Options](#options) for further information on `options`.\n\nThe `callback` will be called with a response object, refer to [The Response Object](#the-response-object).\n\n### `launchImageLibrary`\n\nLaunch gallery to pick image or video.\n\n```js\nlaunchImageLibrary(options?, callback)\n\n// You can also use as a promise without 'callback':\nconst result = await launchImageLibrary(options?);\n```\n\nSee [Options](#options) for further information on `options`.\n\nThe `callback` will be called with a response object, refer to [The Response Object](#the-response-object).\n\n## Options\n\n| Option                  | iOS | Android | Web | Description                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| ----------------------- | --- | ------- | --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| mediaType               | OK  | OK      | OK  | `photo` or `video` or `mixed`(`launchCamera` on Android does not support 'mixed').
