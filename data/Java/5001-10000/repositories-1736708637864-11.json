[Working with issues](#working-with-issues)\n1. [Authoring code](#authoring-code)\n1. [Disclaimers](#disclaimers)\n\n---\n\n## Working with issues\n\nWe use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/features/issues) to organize all significant work. Any external contributions will\nfirst take the form of issues.\n\n### Existing issues\nBriefly review [all open issues](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues) for the following reasons:\n* Search for contribution opportunities\n* Verify that your contribution idea is not already in progress\n\n### Create an issue (~5 min)\nTo create a new issue, use the following two (2) templates:\n* [Bug report](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fbug&template=bug.yaml&title=%5BBug%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E)\n* [Feature request](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fenhancement&template=enhancement.yaml&title=%5BEnhancement%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E)\n\nAll contributions that are not bug fixes must be pre-approved by the maintainers.\n\n### Close an issue\nAt any time, you can close issues that you create yourself. \n\n---\n\n## Authoring code\nFollow these steps when you are ready to begin writing code:\n1. [Fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n2. Modify your fork using the CLI or [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).\n3. When your fork contains your finished and tested code, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/).\n\n#### Exception for minor bug fixes\nFor single-line bug fixes, you can optionally [edit the file directly on the Github website](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files/editing-files)\nwithout needing to create a fork.\n\n## Best practices for coding\n1. Follow [coding best practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_best_practices) such \nas [DRY](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-dry-development) and [SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) where possible.\n2. Carefully read the pull request template and follow it closely.\n3. Don't include AWS account identifiers or secret keys in your examples.\n\n---\n\n## Disclaimers\nReview the following important disclaimers before contributing to this project.\n\n### Conduct disclaimer\nThis project abides by the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct). For additional help, contact [opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com](mailto:opensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com).\n\n### Security disclaimer\nIf you discover a potential security issue, please notify AWS Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/). Please do **not** create a public issue on GitHub.\n\n### Licensing disclaimer\nSee the [LICENSE](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/LICENSE) file for this project's licensing.\n\n"

For more information about creating an account, see [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).\n\nYou must also have AWS credentials configured. For steps on using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) to configure credentials, see [CLI Configuration basics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)\n\n## ⚠️ Usage disclaimer\n\nThese code examples interact with services that may incur charges to your AWS account. For more information, see [AWS Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/pricing/).\n\nAdditionally, example code might theoretically modify or delete existing AWS resources. As a matter of due diligence, do the following:\n\n- Be aware of the resources that these examples create or delete.\n- Be aware of the costs that might be charged to your account as a result.\n- Back up your important data.\n\n# Contributing\n\nThis repository thrives on your contributions! ❤️ To get involved, see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). 🙏\n\n# Requests\n\nRequests for examples can be made via [Issue tracker](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=type%2Fenhancement&projects=&template=enhancement.yaml&title=%5BEnhancement%5D%3A+%3CDESCRIPTIVE+TITLE+HERE%3E).\n\n## How we prioritize contributions and requests\nOur team reviews all requests, evaluating them for the following:\n- Clarity\n- Relevance\n- Feasibility\n\n**All examples requests should be made as early as possible. For larger examples, this should be at least two months in advance of the required date.**\n\nBased on the evaluation, we determine the priority of each request and allocate resources accordingly. We prioritize requests that are clear, relevant, and can be completed in a reasonable amount of time. An accompanying high quality PR increases the chance we can address the request.\n\nPlease note that some requests, such as bug fixes and security issues, take priority over new code examples. Additionally, we have finite resources and our own priorities that guide the development of code examples. If you have any questions or would like to contribute, please refer to our [contribution guide](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n\n## Tributaries\n\nThe AWS Documentation includes source code examples from several additional sources. These sources are called tributaries, flowing into the \"river\" of AWS Documentation.\n\n* [awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples)\n* [aws-samples/serverless-snippets](https://github.com/aws-samples/serverless-snippets)\n* [aws/aws-tools-for-powershell](https://github.com/aws/aws-tools-for-powershell)\n\n# Copyright and license\n\nAll content in this repository, unless otherwise stated, is\nCopyright © Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.
