Functions that have the suffix `Int` take a `@ColorInt`.\n\n*Tip: When targeting a Toolbar item, be careful with Proguard and ensure you're keeping certain fields. See [#180](https://github.com/KeepSafe/TapTargetView/issues/180)*\n\n### Sequences\n\nYou can easily create a sequence of tap targets with `TapTargetSequence`:\n\n```java\nnew TapTargetSequence(this)\n    .targets(\n        TapTarget.forView(findViewById(R.id.never), \"Gonna\"),\n        TapTarget.forView(findViewById(R.id.give), \"You\", \"Up\")\n                .dimColor(android.R.color.never)\n                .outerCircleColor(R.color.gonna)\n                .targetCircleColor(R.color.let)\n                .textColor(android.R.color.you),\n        TapTarget.forBounds(rickTarget, \"Down\", \":^)\")\n                .cancelable(false)\n                .icon(rick))\n    .listener(new TapTargetSequence.Listener() {\n        // This listener will tell us when interesting(tm) events happen in regards\n        // to the sequence\n        @Override\n        public void onSequenceFinish() {\n            // Yay\n        }\n        \n        @Override\n        public void onSequenceStep(TapTarget lastTarget, boolean targetClicked) {\n            // Perform action for the current target\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void onSequenceCanceled(TapTarget lastTarget) {\n            // Boo\n        }\n    });\n```\n\nA sequence is started via a call to `start()` on the `TapTargetSequence` instance\n\nFor more examples of usage, please look at the included sample app.\n\n### Tutorials\n- [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/5194-taptargetview-for-android-tutorial)\n\n## Third Party Bindings\n\n### React Native\nThanks to @prscX, you may now use this library with [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/react-native) via the module [here](https://github.com/prscX/react-native-taptargetview)\n\n### NativeScript\nThanks to @hamdiwanis, you may now use this library with [NativeScript](https://nativescript.org) via the plugin [here](https://github.com/hamdiwanis/nativescript-app-tour)\n\n### Xamarin\nThanks to @btripp, you may now use this library via a Xamarin Binding located [here](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xamarin.TapTargetView).\n\n## License\n\n    Copyright 2016 Keepsafe Software Inc.\n\n    Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n    you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n    You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n    Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n    distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n    See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n    limitations under the License.\n"

          "content": "How To Release\n==============\n\nDue to Maven Central's very particular requirements, the release process is a bit\nelaborate and requires a good deal of local configuration. This guide should walk\nyou through it. It won't do anyone outside of KeepSafe any good, but the workflow\nis representative of just about any project deploying via Sonatype.\n\nWe currently deploy to Maven Central (via Sonatype's OSS Nexus instance).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n1. A *published* GPG code-signing key\n1. A Sonatype Nexus OSS account with permission to publish in com.getkeepsafe\n1. Permission to push directly to https://github.com/KeepSafe/TapTargetView\n\n### Setup\n\n1. Add your GPG key to your github profile - this is required\n   for github to know that your commits and tags are \"verified\".\n1. Configure your code-signing key in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties:\n   ```gradle\n   signing.keyId=<key ID of your GPG signing key>\n   signing.password=<your key's passphrase>\n   signing.secretKeyRingFile=/path/to/your/secring.gpg\n   ```\n1. Create a token for your Sonatype credentials. [Source](https://community.sonatype.com/t/401-content-access-is-protected-by-token-authentication-failure-while-performing-maven-release/12741/4)\n   ```\n   1. Go to https://oss.sonatype.org/ and login\n   2. Go to profile\n   3. Change the pulldown from “Summary” to “User Token”\n   4. Click on “Access User Token”\n   ```\n1. Configure your Sonatype credentials in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties:\n   ```gradle\n   mavenCentralUsername=<nexus username>\n   mavenCentralPassword=<nexus password>\n   SONATYPE_STAGING_PROFILE=com.getkeepsafe\n   ```\n1. Configure git with your codesigning key; make sure it's the same as the one\n   you use to sign binaries (i.e. it's the same one you added to gradle.properties):\n   ```bash\n   # Do this for the TapTargetView repo only\n   git config user.email \"your@email.com\"\n   git config user.signingKey \"your-key-id\"\n   ```\n1. Add your GPG key to `~/.gnupg`\n\n### Pushing a build\n\n1. Edit gradle.properties, update the VERSION property for the new version release\n1. Edit changelog, add relevant changes, note the date and new version (follow the existing pattern)\n1. Add new `## [Unreleased]` header for next release\n1. Verify that the everything works:\n   ```bash\n   ./gradlew clean check\n   ```\n1. Make a *signed* commit:\n   ```bash\n   git commit -S -m \"Release version X.Y.Z\"\n   ```\n1. Make a *signed* tag:\n   ```bash\n   git tag -s -a X.Y.Z\n   ```\n1. Publish to Release:\n   ```bash\n   ./gradlew :taptargetview:publishAndReleaseToMavenCentral --no-configuration-cache\n   ```\n1. Wait until that's done. It takes a while to publish and be available in [MavenCentral](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/getkeepsafe/). Monitor until the latest published version is visible.\n1. Hooray, we're in Maven Central now!\n1. Push all of our work to Github to make it official. Check previous [releases](https://github.com/KeepSafe/TapTargetView/releases) and edit tag release changes:\n   ```bash\n   git push --tags origin master\n   ```\n"
