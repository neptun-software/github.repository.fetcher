If you ask me, which version is the most stability, I will tell you it's not the version of 1.0.0 or 2.0.0, the most stability version must be the latest version because it is developed with github-flow, not production-flow. So please follow the latest release version and show me your PR. Here is [the changelog for each version](https://github.com/lingochamp/okdownload/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), it may help you.\n\n## I. WHY CHOOSE\n\nIn fact OkDownload is FileDownloader2, which extends all benefits from FileDownloader and beyond. More detail please move to [here](https://github.com/lingochamp/okdownload/wiki/Why-Choose-OkDownload)\n\n## II. HOW TO IMPORT\n\nWe publish okdownload on [jcenter](http://jcenter.bintray.com/), [mavenCentral](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/) and [Sonatype's snapshots repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/), more detail about import OkDownload please move to [here](https://github.com/lingochamp/okdownload/wiki)\n\n## III. HOW TO USE\n\n- The simple use case such as start and cancel, download queue or get state or task info, please more to [here](https://github.com/lingochamp/okdownload/wiki/Simple-Use-Guideline)\n- The advanced use case such as set max parallel running count, set remit database delay milliseconds or injection components, please move to [here](https://github.com/lingochamp/okdownload/wiki/Advanced-Use-Guideline)\n\n## IV.
