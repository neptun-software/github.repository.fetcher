Prebuilds when enabled builds a project\n## like a CI server so you can start coding right away - no more waiting for\n## dependencies to download and builds to finish when reviewing pull-requests\n## or hacking on something new.\n##\n## With Gitpod you can develop software from any device (even iPads) via \n## desktop or browser based versions of VS Code or any JetBrains IDE and\n## customise it to your individual needs - from themes to extensions, you\n## have full control.\n##\n## The easiest way to try out Gitpod is install the browser extenion:\n## 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension' or by prefixing\n## 'https://gitpod.io#' to the source control URL of any project.\n##\n## For example: 'https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod'\n\n\n## The 'image' section defines which Docker image Gitpod should use. \n## By default, Gitpod uses a standard Docker Image called 'workspace-full'\n## which can be found at 'https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images'\n##\n## Workspaces started based on this default image come pre-installed with\n## Docker, Go, Java, Node.js, C/C++, Python, Ruby, Rust, PHP as well as\n## tools such as Homebrew, Tailscale, Nginx and several more.\n##\n## If this image does not include the tools needed for your project then\n## a public Docker image or your own Docker file can be configured.\n## \n## Learn more about images at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-docker'\n\n#image: node:buster                        # use 'https://hub.docker.com/_/node'\n#\n#image:                                    # leave image undefined if using a Dockerfile\n#  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile                # relative path to the Dockerfile from the\n#                                          # root of the project\n\n## The 'tasks' section defines how Gitpod prepares and builds this project\n## or how Gitpod can start development servers. With Gitpod, there are three\n## types of tasks:\n##\n## - before: Use this for tasks that need to run before init and before command. \n## - init: Use this to configure prebuilds of heavy-lifting tasks such as\n##         downloading dependencies or compiling source code.\n## - command: Use this to start your database or application when the workspace starts.\n##\n## Learn more about these tasks at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-start-tasks'\n\n#tasks:\n#  - before: |\n#      # commands to execute...\n#\n#  - init: |\n#      # sudo apt-get install python3     # can be used to install operating system \n#                                         # dependencies but these are not kept after the\n#                                         # prebuild completes thus Gitpod recommends moving\n#                                         # operating system dependency installation steps\n#                                         # to a custom Dockerfile to make prebuilds faster\n#                                         # and to keep your codebase DRY.  \n#                                         # 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-docker'\n#\n#      # pip install -r requirements.txt  # install codebase dependencies\n#      # cmake                            # precompile codebase\n#\n#  - name: Web Server\n#    openMode: split-left\n#    env:\n#      WEBSERVER_PORT: 8080\n#    command: |\n#     python3 -m http.server $WEBSERVER_PORT\n#\n#  - name: Web Browser\n#    openMode: split-right\n#    env:\n#      WEBSERVER_PORT: 8080\n#    command: |\n#     gp await-port $WEBSERVER_PORT\n#     lynx `gp url`\n\ntasks:\n  - init: ./mvnw package -DskipTests\n\n## The 'ports' section defines various ports your may listen on are \n## configured in Gitpod on an authenticated URL.

OpenVSX\n## is an open alternative to the proprietary Visual Studio Code Marketplace\n## and extensions can be added by sending a pull-request with the extension\n## identifier to https://github.com/open-vsx/publish-extensions\n##\n## The identifier of an extension is always ${publisher}.${name}.\n##\n## For example: 'vscodevim.vim'\n##\n## Learn more at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/ides-and-editors/vscode'\n\nvscode:\n  extensions:\n    - redhat.java\n    - vscjava.vscode-java-pack\n    - lextudio.restructuredtext\n\n## The 'github' section defines configuration of continuous prebuilds\n## for GitHub repositories when the GitHub application\n## 'https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io' is installed in GitHub and granted\n## permissions to access the repository.\n##\n## Learn more at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/prebuilds'\n\ngithub: \n  prebuilds:\n    # enable for the default branch\n    master: true\n    # enable for all branches in this repo\n    branches: true\n    # enable for pull requests coming from this repo\n    pullRequests: true\n    # enable for pull requests coming from forks\n    pullRequestsFromForks: true\n    # add a check to pull requests\n    addCheck: true\n    # add a \"Review in Gitpod\" button as a comment to pull requests\n    addComment: true\n    # add a \"Review in Gitpod\" button to the pull request's description\n    addBadge: false\n"
