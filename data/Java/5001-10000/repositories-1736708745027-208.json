There are\na just a few small guidelines you need to follow.\n\n\n## Contributor License Agreement ##\n\nContributions to any Google project must be accompanied by a Contributor\nLicense Agreement.  This is not a copyright **assignment**, it simply gives\nGoogle permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the\nproject.\n\n  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you\n    own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual\n    CLA][].\n\n  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work,\n    then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA][].\n\nYou generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted\none (even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it\nagain.\n\n[individual CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual\n[corporate CLA]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate\n\n\n## Submitting a patch ##\n\n  1. It's generally best to start by opening a new issue describing the bug or\n     feature you're intending to fix.  Even if you think it's relatively minor,\n     it's helpful to know what people are working on.  Mention in the initial\n     issue that you are planning to work on that bug or feature so that it can\n     be assigned to you.\n\n  1. Follow the normal process of [forking][] the project, and setup a new\n     branch to work in.  It's important that each group of changes be done in\n     separate branches in order to ensure that a pull request only includes the\n     commits related to that bug or feature.\n\n  1. Any significant changes should almost always be accompanied by tests.  The\n     project already has good test coverage, so look at some of the existing\n     tests if you're unsure how to go about it.\n\n  1. Do your best to have [well-formed commit messages][] for each change.\n     This provides consistency throughout the project, and ensures that commit\n     messages are able to be formatted properly by various git tools.\n\n  1. Finally, push the commits to your fork and submit a [pull request][].\n\n[forking]: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo\n[well-formed commit messages]: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html\n[pull request]: https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request\n"

This builds the translator, JRE emulation and JUnit\nlibraries, and creates a \"dist/\" directory with commands, libraries\nand include files.\n\nRunning \"make\" in each project directory will build just that project.\nThe J2ObjC translator is the main project, so running just \"make\" in\nit will only build the translator.  While this is useful for developing\nthe translator, \"make dist\" is recommended for developers who just want\nto use the tool.  Apache Maven is used to copy the translator's\ndependent jars from the Maven Repository.\n\nRunning \"make clean\" removes all files created by the build, including\nthe \"dist/\" directory.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to\nguarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the\nsoftware is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to\nmost of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose\nauthors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is\ncovered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to\ndistribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),\nthat you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change\nthe software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you\ncan do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny\nyou these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions\ntranslate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the\nsoftware, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for\na fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must\nshow them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)\noffer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the\nsoftware is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced\nby others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We\nwish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.\nTo prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for\neveryone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis General Public License.  The \"Program\", below, refers to any such program\nor work, and a \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any\nderivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the\nProgram or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or\ntranslated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included\nwithout limitation in the term \"modification\".) Each licensee is addressed as\n\"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by\nthis License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is\nnot restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by\nrunning the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as\nyou receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License\nand to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the\nProgram a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus\nforming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications\nor work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of\nthese conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating\n    that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or\n    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be\n    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of\n    this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,\n    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the\n    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an\n    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or\n    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute\n    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy\n    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does\n    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is\n    not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and\nits terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate\nworks.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a\nwork based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms\nof this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire\nwhole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the\nProgram (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under\nSection 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and\n2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source\n    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above\n    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to\n    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically\n    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the\n    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1\n    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to\n    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only\n    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in\n    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with\n    Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all\nthe source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code\ndistributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either\nsource or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)\nof the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source\ncode from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though\nthird parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as\nexpressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,\nsublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate\nyour rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or\nrights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so\nlong as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program\nor its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not\naccept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or\nany work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to\ndo so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),\nthe recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to\ncopy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the\nrights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties to this License.\n\n7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions\nare imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that\ncontradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the\nconditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy\nsimultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent\nobligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.\nFor example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution\nof the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through\nyou, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or\nother property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this\nsection has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software\ndistribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many\npeople have made generous contributions to the wide range of software\ndistributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to\ndistribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that\nchoice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a\nconsequence of the rest of this License.\n\n8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit\ngeographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In\nsuch case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body\nof this License.\n\n9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the\nGeneral Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in\nspirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems\nor concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\nversion\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.\nIf the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may\nchoose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs\nwhose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for\npermission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,\nwrite to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.\nOur decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of\nall derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of\nsoftware generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nPROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND\nPERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,\nYOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL\nANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR\nINABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA\nBEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER\nOR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\nHow to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\nIf you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible\nuse to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software\nwhich everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\nTo do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach\nthem to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion\nof warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a\npointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.\n\n    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\n    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free\n    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)\n    any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\n    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or\n    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for\n    more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59\n    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it\nstarts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes\n    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free\n    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;\n    type 'show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be\ncalled something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.  Here\nis a sample; alter the names:\n\n    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n\n    Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public\nLicense instead of this License.\n\n\n\"CLASSPATH\" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL\n\nCertain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are\nsubject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but\nonly where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header\nthe words \"Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the \"Classpath\"\nexception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code.\"\n\n    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\n    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of\n    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n\n    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\n    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\n    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\n    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\n    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\n    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent\n    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If\n    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\n    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do\n    so, delete this exception statement from your version.\n\nAPPLE PUBLIC SOURCE LICENSE Version 2.0 -  August 6, 2003\n\nPlease read this License carefully before downloading this software.

This License applies to any program or other work\nwhich Apple Inc. (\"Apple\") makes publicly available and which contains a notice\nplaced by Apple identifying such program or work as \"Original Code\" and stating\nthat it is subject to the terms of this Apple Public Source License version 2.0\n(\"License\").  As used in this License:\n\n1.1\t \"Applicable Patent Rights\" mean:  (a) in the case where Apple is the\ngrantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter acquired,\nowned by or assigned to Apple and (ii) that cover subject matter contained in\nthe Original Code, but only to the extent necessary to use, reproduce and/or\ndistribute the Original Code without infringement; and (b) in the case where You\nare the grantor of rights, (i) claims of patents that are now or hereafter\nacquired, owned by or assigned to You and (ii) that cover subject matter in Your\nModifications, taken alone or in combination with Original Code.\n\n1.2\t\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that creates or contributes to the\ncreation of Modifications.\n\n1.3\t \"Covered Code\" means the Original Code, Modifications, the combination of\nOriginal Code and any Modifications, and/or any respective portions thereof.\n\n1.4\t\"Externally Deploy\" means: (a) to sublicense, distribute or otherwise make\nCovered Code available, directly or indirectly, to anyone other than You; and/or\n(b) to use Covered Code, alone or as part of a Larger Work, in any way to\nprovide a service, including but not limited to delivery of content, through\nelectronic communication with a client other than You.\n\n1.5\t\"Larger Work\" means a work which combines Covered Code or portions thereof\nwith code not governed by the terms of this License.\n\n1.6\t\"Modifications\" mean any addition to, deletion from, and/or change to, the\nsubstance and/or structure of the Original Code, any previous Modifications, the\ncombination of Original Code and any previous Modifications, and/or any\nrespective portions thereof.  When code is released as a series of files, a\nModification is:  (a) any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file\ncontaining Covered Code; and/or (b) any new file or other representation of\ncomputer program statements that contains any part of Covered Code.\n\n1.7\t\"Original Code\" means (a) the Source Code of a program or other work as\noriginally made available by Apple under this License, including the Source Code\nof any updates or upgrades to such programs or works made available by Apple\nunder this License, and that has been expressly identified by Apple as such in\nthe header file(s) of such work; and (b) the object code compiled from such\nSource Code and originally made available by Apple under this License\n\n1.8\t\"Source Code\" means the human readable form of a program or other work that\nis suitable for making modifications to it, including all modules it contains,\nplus any associated interface definition files, scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of an executable (object code).\n\n1.9\t\"You\" or \"Your\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\nunder this License.  For legal entities, \"You\" or \"Your\" includes any entity\nwhich controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, You, where\n\"control\" means (a) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or\nmanagement of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (b) ownership of\nfifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or beneficial ownership of\nsuch entity.\n\n2.\tPermitted Uses; Conditions & Restrictions.   Subject to the terms and\nconditions of this License, Apple hereby grants You, effective on the date You\naccept this License and download the Original Code, a world-wide, royalty-free,\nnon-exclusive license, to the extent of Apple's Applicable Patent Rights and\ncopyrights covering the Original Code, to do the following:\n\n2.1\tUnmodified Code.  You may use, reproduce, display, perform, internally\ndistribute within Your organization, and Externally Deploy verbatim, unmodified\ncopies of the Original Code, for commercial or non-commercial purposes, provided\nthat in each instance:\n\n(a)\tYou must retain and reproduce in all copies of Original Code the copyright\nand other proprietary notices and disclaimers of Apple as they appear in the\nOriginal Code, and keep intact all notices in the Original Code that refer to\nthis License; and\n\n(b) \tYou must include a copy of this License with every copy of Source Code of\nCovered Code and documentation You distribute or Externally Deploy, and You may\nnot offer or impose any terms on such Source Code that alter or restrict this\nLicense or the recipients' rights hereunder, except as permitted under Section\n6.\n\n2.2\tModified Code.

Source Code\nof Your Externally Deployed Modifications must be released under the terms set\nforth in this License, including the license grants set forth in Section 3\nbelow, for as long as you Externally Deploy the Covered Code or twelve (12)\nmonths from the date of initial External Deployment, whichever is longer. You\nshould preferably distribute the Source Code of Your Externally Deployed\nModifications electronically (e.g. download from a web site).\n\n2.3\tDistribution of Executable Versions.  In addition, if You Externally Deploy\nCovered Code (Original Code and/or Modifications) in object code, executable\nform only, You must include a prominent notice, in the code itself as well as in\nrelated documentation, stating that Source Code of the Covered Code is available\nunder the terms of this License with information on how and where to obtain such\nSource Code.\n\n2.4\tThird Party Rights.  You expressly acknowledge and agree that although\nApple and each Contributor grants the licenses to their respective portions of\nthe Covered Code set forth herein, no assurances are provided by Apple or any\nContributor that the Covered Code does not infringe the patent or other\nintellectual property rights of any other entity. Apple and each Contributor\ndisclaim any liability to You for claims brought by any other entity based on\ninfringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\nexercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, You hereby assume sole\nresponsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\nFor example, if a third party patent license is required to allow You to\ndistribute the Covered Code, it is Your responsibility to acquire that license\nbefore distributing the Covered Code.\n\n3.\tYour Grants.  In consideration of, and as a condition to, the licenses\ngranted to You under this License, You hereby grant to any person or entity\nreceiving or distributing Covered Code under this License a non-exclusive,\nroyalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license, under Your Applicable Patent\nRights and other intellectual property rights (other than patent) owned or\ncontrolled by You, to use, reproduce, display, perform, modify, sublicense,\ndistribute and Externally Deploy Your Modifications of the same scope and extent\nas Apple's licenses under Sections 2.1 and 2.2 above.\n\n4.\tLarger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with\nother code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger\nWork as a single product.  In each such instance, You must make sure the\nrequirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code or any portion\nthereof.\n\n5.\tLimitations on Patent License.   Except as expressly stated in Section 2, no\nother patent rights, express or implied, are granted by Apple herein. \nModifications and/or Larger Works may require additional patent licenses from\nApple which Apple may grant in its sole discretion.\n\n6.\tAdditional Terms.  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for,\nwarranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations and/or other rights\nconsistent with the scope of the license granted herein (\"Additional Terms\") to\none or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own\nbehalf and as Your sole responsibility, and not on behalf of Apple or any\nContributor. You must obtain the recipient's agreement that any such Additional\nTerms are offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and\nhold Apple and every Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by or\nclaims asserted against Apple or such Contributor by reason of any such\nAdditional Terms.\n\n7.\tVersions of the License.  Apple may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthis License from time to time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing\nversion number.  Once Original Code has been published under a particular\nversion of this License, You may continue to use it under the terms of that\nversion. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms of any\nsubsequent version of this License published by Apple.  No one other than Apple\nhas the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this\nLicense.\n\n8.\tNO WARRANTY OR SUPPORT.  The Covered Code may contain in whole or in part\npre-release, untested, or not fully tested works.

The ownership of the TZ database\nis explained in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone\nDatabase section 7.\n\n # 7.  Database Ownership\n #\n #    The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution or an IETF\n #    document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly updated work\n #    that is in the public domain, and is intended to remain in the\n #    public domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 [RFC3979] do\n #    not apply to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals make\n #    to it.  Should any claims be made and substantiated against the TZ\n #    Database, the organization that is providing the IANA\n #    Considerations defined in this RFC, under the memorandum of\n #    understanding with the IETF, currently ICANN, may act in accordance\n #    with all competent court orders.  No ownership claims will be made\n #    by ICANN or the IETF Trust on the database or the code.  Any person\n #    making a contribution to the database or code waives all rights to\n #    future claims in that contribution or in the TZ Database.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\nthe following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and distribute this\nsoftware is freely granted, provided that this notice\nis preserved.\n\nCommon Public License - Version 1.0\n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS COMMON PUBLIC\nLICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM\nCONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n      a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and\n         documentation distributed under this Agreement, and\n      b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n\n      i) changes to the Program, and\n\n      ii) additions to the Program;\n\n      where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are\ndistributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a\nContributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\nacting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\nthe Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\nconjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are\nnot derivative works of the Program. \n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\nreproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\ndistribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and\nsuch derivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\n      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under\nLicensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise\ntransfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and\nobject code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the\nContribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the\nContributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be\ncovered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any\nother combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\nlicensed hereunder. \n\n      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by\nany Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other\nintellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims\nany liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on\ninfringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to\nexercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\nassumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights\nneeded, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to\nallow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to\nacquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\n      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\ncopyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license\nset forth in this Agreement. \n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under\nits own license agreement, provided that:\n\n      a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\n      b) its license agreement:\n\n      i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\nconditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title\nand non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability\nand fitness for a particular purpose; \n\n      ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\ndamages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\ndamages, such as lost profits; \n\n      iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\noffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\n      iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\nContributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on\nor through a medium customarily used for software exchange. \n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\n      a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \n\n      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the\nProgram. \n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\nProgram.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\nany, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\noriginator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\na Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\nand costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\nactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\nextent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\nconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\noffering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\nto qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor\nto control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and\nany related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\nCommercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\nrelated to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\nCommercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\nrequires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\nContributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using\nand distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise\nof rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and\ncosts of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of\ndata, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY\nWAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\nterms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\nprovision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\nprovision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\na patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\nlawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such\nRecipient under this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation\nis filed. In addition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any\nentity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights\ngranted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is\nfiled.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue\nand survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\norder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\npublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\nNo one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\nIBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to\nserve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version\nof the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program\n(including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of\nthe Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of\nthe Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program\n(including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated\nin Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to\nthe intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\nexpressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\nexpressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial\nin any resulting litigation. \n"

This tool\nenables Java source to be part of an iOS application's build, as no editing\nof the generated files is necessary. The goal is to write an app's non-UI\ncode (such as application logic and data models) in Java, which is then\nshared by web apps (using [GWT](http://www.gwtproject.org/)), Android apps,\nand iOS apps.\n\nJ2ObjC supports most Java language and runtime features required by\nclient-side application developers, including exceptions, inner and\nanonymous classes, generic types, threads and reflection. JUnit test\ntranslation and execution is also supported.\n\nJ2ObjC is currently beta quality. Several Google projects rely on it, but\nwhen new projects first start working with it, they usually find new bugs\nto be fixed. If you run into issues with your project, please report them!\n\n### What J2ObjC isn't ###\nJ2ObjC does not provide any sort of platform-independent UI toolkit, nor are\nthere any plans to do so in the future. We believe that iOS UI code needs to\nbe written in Objective-C, Objective-C++ or Swift using Apple's iOS SDK (Android\nUIs using Android's API, web app UIs using GWT, etc.).\n\nJ2ObjC cannot convert Android binary applications. Developers must have source\ncode for their Android app, which they either own or are licensed to use.\n\n## Requirements ##\n\n* JDK 11\n* Mac workstation or laptop\n* OS X 10.12 or higher\n* Xcode 8 or higher\n\n## License ##\n\nThis library is distributed under the Apache 2.0 license found in the\n[LICENSE](https://github.com/google/j2objc/blob/master/LICENSE) file.\nThe protocol buffers library is distributed under the same BSD license as\nGoogle's protocol buffers. See its\n[README](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/README.md) and\n[LICENSE](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## Running on GNU/Linux ##\n\nTo build and run on GNU/Linux, install [the Darling project](http://www.darlinghq.org/), then following [its Compile and Run a Program example](https://wiki.darlinghq.org/what_to_try#compile_and_run_a_program).
