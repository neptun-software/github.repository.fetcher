The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

          "content": "## About the Book\n\n_The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development_ is a book covering Android application development, from basics\nthrough advanced capabilities. It is updated several times a year and is available through\n[the Warescription](https://commonsware.com/warescription) program. Subscribers also have access to office\nhours chats and other benefits.\n\nThis repository contains the source code for the hundreds of sample apps profiled in the book. These \nsamples are updated as the book is, with `git` tags applied to tie sample code versions to book\nversions.\n\nThe book, and the samples, were written by Mark Murphy. You may also have run into him through\nStack Overflow:\n\n<a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/115145/commonsware\">\n<img src=\"http://stackoverflow.com/users/flair/115145.png\" width=\"208\" height=\"58\" alt=\"profile for CommonsWare at Stack Overflow, Q&amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers\" title=\"profile for CommonsWare at Stack Overflow, Q&amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers\">\n</a>\n\n## About the Code\n\nAll of the source code in this archive is licensed under the\nApache 2.0 license except as noted.\n\nThe names of the top-level directories roughly correspond to a\nshortened form of the chapter titles. Since chapter numbers\nchange with every release, and since some samples are used by\nmultiple chapters, I am loathe to put chapter numbers in the\nactual directory names.\n\n## Using in Android Studio\n\nAll of the projects should have a `build.gradle` file suitable for\nimporting the project into Android Studio. Note, though, that you\nmay need to adjust the `compileSdkVersion` in `build.gradle` if it\nrequests an SDK that you have not downloaded and do not wish to\ndownload. Similarly, you may need to adjust the `buildToolsVersion`\nvalue to refer to a version of the build tools that you have downloaded\nfrom the SDK Manager.\n\nThe samples also have stub Gradle wrapper files, enough to allow for\neasy import into Android Studio. However,\n**always check the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file before importing anything into Android Studio**,\nas there is always the chance that somebody has published material linking you to a hacked Gradle installation.\n\n## Using with Command-Line Gradle\n\nRight now, you will need your own local installation of Gradle 3.3\nin order to build the projects from the command line, as the repository\ndoes not contain `gradlew` or its corresponding JAR for security reasons.\n\n## List of Samples\n\n- `ACRA/`\n  -
