SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later OR CC-BY-SA-4.0\n\n====================\nBuilding App Manager\n====================\n\nRequirements\n============\n\n* **Hardware:** Any computer with 8 GB RAM and 20 GB storage\n* **Operating system:** Linux/macOS (no support for Windows)\n* **Software:** Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle, Latex, pandoc, JDK 17+\n* **Active network connection:** Depending on your development environment,\n  you may need at least 20 GB data package.\n\nmacOS\n=====\n\nThe following steps are required only if you want to build APKS:\n\n- Install Homebrew::\n\n    /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n- Install bundletool::\n\n    brew install bundletool\n\nLinux|GNU\n=========\n\n- Install the development tools.\n\n  * For Debian/Ubuntu::\n\n      sudo apt-get install build-essential\n\n  * For Fedora/CentOS/RHEL::\n\n      sudo yum groupinstall \"Development Tools\"\n\n  * For Arch/Artix/Manjaro::\n\n      sudo pacman -S base-devel\n\n- Install `bundletool-all.jar`_ if you want to build APKS, and make sure it is\n  available as ``bundletool`` command.  A quick way would be to create a file\n  ``bundletool`` in ``/usr/local/bin`` directory with the following content::\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env bash\n    exec java -jar \"/path/to/bundletool-all.jar\" \"$@\"\n\n  Make sure to replace ``/path/to/bundletool-all.jar`` with the actual path for\n  **bundletool-all.jar**.  Also, make the file executable::\n\n    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/bundletool\n\n\nClone and Build App Manager\n===========================\n\n1. Clone the repo along with submodules::\n\n     git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/AppManager.git\n\n   You can use the `--depth 1` argument if you don't want to clone past\n   commits.\n2. Open the project **AppManager** using Android Studio/IntelliJ IDEA.  The IDE\n   should start syncing automatically.  It will also download all the necessary\n   dependencies automatically provided you have a working network connection.\n3. Build debug version of App Manager from *Menu* > *Build* > *Make Project*,\n   or, from the terminal::\n\n     ./gradlew packageDebugUniversalApk\n\n   The command will generate a universal APK instead of a bundled app.\n\nCreate Bundled App\n==================\n\nTo create a bundled app in APKS format, run the following command::\n\n  ./scripts/aab_to_apks.sh type\n\nReplace ``type`` with ``release`` or ``debug`` based on your requirements.\nIt will ask for KeyStore credentials interactively.\n\nThe script above will also generate a universal APK.\n\n.. _bundletool-all.jar: https://github.com/google/bundletool\n\n\nBuild documentation\n===================\nSee  `docs/raw/en/README.md <docs/raw/en/README.md>`_\n"

This doesn't mean that you need\ncoding skills.  You can contribute to App Manager by creating helpful issues,\nattending discussions, improving documentations and translations, making icon\nfor icon packs, adding unrecognised libraries or ad/tracking signatures,\nreviewing the source code, as well as reporting security vulnerabilities.\n\nRules\n=====\n\n- If you are going to implement or work on any specific feature, please inform\n  us before doing so. Due to the complex nature of the project, integrating a\n  new feature could be challenging.\n- Your contributions are licensed under ``GPL-3.0-or-later`` by default.\n  Please see related `Linux documentations`_ to see how to add license headers\n  to a file, and remember the following:\n\n  * If the files your are contributing to do not have ``GPL-3.0-or-later``, add\n    it to the existing ``SPDX-License-Identifier`` using ``AND``, e.g.  ::\n\n        SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0 AND GPL-3.0-or-later\n\n  * If the entire file or Java class is copied from another person or project,\n    you have to add a copyright statement adding the person who wrote it first\n    like this::\n\n        // Copyright 2004 Linus Torvalds\n\n    You can also add other contributors but they are not mandatory.  You do not\n    need to include your name because it can already be available via the\n    version control system.\n  * Do not add the **@author** tag as it is considered a bad practice.\n\n- You have to sign-off your work.  You can do that using the ``--signoff``\n  argument.  If you are not using command line or a software that does not\n  support it, you can add the following line at the end of your commit\n  message::\n\n    Signed-off-by: My Name <my.name@example.com>\n\n  We also support most of the `commit message conventions`_ from Linux.\n\n  App Manager is a legal software and its contributions are protected by\n  copyright laws. Consider using real credentials ie. real name and email as\n  we may be required to delete your valuable contributions in the event of\n  introducing new license or adding exceptions to the existing license.\n\n**Note:** Repositories located in sites other than GitHub are currently\nconsidered mirrors and any pull or merge requests submitted there will not be\naccepted.  Instead, you can submit patches (as ``.patch`` files) via email\nattachment.  My email address is muntashirakon [at] riseup [dot] net.  Beware\nthat such emails may be publicly accessible in future.  GitHub pull requests\nwill be merged manually using the corresponding patches.  As a result, GitHub\nmay falsely mark them *closed* instead of *merged*.\n\n**Warning.** Every commit made by other users are thoroughly examined with the\nexception of commits made through Weblate.  So, if it is found that you are\nabusing the Weblate platform, you will be blocked on Weblate without a warning,\nand ALL your contributions to this project shall be removed.  This is a hobby\nproject, and like any hobby, I want to make things neat and clean.  Existing\ncontributors are also encouraged to report any abuse.  Your identity shall be\nkept secret.\n\n.. _Linux documentations: https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/license-rules.rst\n.. _commit message conventions: https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/CommitMessageConventions"

If your /bin/sh is\n#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or\n#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole\n#       command line, like:\n#\n#           ksh Gradle\n#\n#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script\n#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:\n#         * functions;\n#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,\n#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;\n#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;\n#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».\n#\n#   Important for patching:\n#\n#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided\n#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.\n#\n#       The \"traditional\" practice of packing multiple parameters into a\n#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security\n#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating\n#       options in \"$@\", and eventually passing that to Java.\n#\n#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,\n#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;\n#       see the in-line comments for details.\n#\n#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,\n#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.\n#\n#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template\n#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/platforms/jvm/plugins-application/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt\n#       within the Gradle project.\n#\n#       You can find Gradle at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/.\n#\n##############################################################################\n\n# Attempt to set APP_HOME\n\n# Resolve links: $0 may be a link\napp_path=$0\n\n# Need this for daisy-chained symlinks.\nwhile\n    APP_HOME=${app_path%\"${app_path##*/}\"}  # leaves a trailing /; empty if no leading path\n    [ -h \"$app_path\" ]\ndo\n    ls=$( ls -ld \"$app_path\" )\n    link=${ls#*' -> '}\n    case $link in             #(\n      /*)   app_path=$link ;; #(\n      *)    app_path=$APP_HOME$link ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n# This is normally unused\n# shellcheck disable=SC2034\nAPP_BASE_NAME=${0##*/}\n# Discard cd standard output in case $CDPATH is set (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25036)\nAPP_HOME=$( cd -P \"${APP_HOME:-./}\" > /dev/null && printf '%s\n' \"$PWD\" ) || exit\n\n# Use the maximum available, or set MAX_FD != -1 to use that value.\nMAX_FD=maximum\n\nwarn () {\n    echo \"$*\"\n} >&2\n\ndie () {\n    echo\n    echo \"$*\"\n    echo\n    exit 1\n} >&2\n\n# OS specific support (must be 'true' or 'false').\ncygwin=false\nmsys=false\ndarwin=false\nnonstop=false\ncase \"$( uname )\" in                #(\n  CYGWIN* )         cygwin=true  ;; #(\n  Darwin* )         darwin=true  ;; #(\n  MSYS* | MINGW* )  msys=true    ;; #(\n  NONSTOP* )        nonstop=true ;;\nesac\n\nCLASSPATH=$APP_HOME/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar\n\n\n# Determine the Java command to use to start the JVM.\nif [ -n \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n    if [ -x \"$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\" ] ; then\n        # IBM's JDK on AIX uses strange locations for the executables\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\n    else\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\n    fi\n    if [ ! -x \"$JAVACMD\" ] ; then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory: $JAVA_HOME\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nelse\n    JAVACMD=java\n    if ! command -v java >/dev/null 2>&1\n    then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# Increase the maximum file descriptors if we can.\nif ! \"$cygwin\" && ! \"$darwin\" && ! \"$nonstop\" ; then\n    case $MAX_FD in #(\n      max*)\n        # In POSIX sh, ulimit -H is undefined.
