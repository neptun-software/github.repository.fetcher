You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5.

Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

[立即查看](https://novel.xxyopen.com/service.htm)\n\n## 问题\n\n### 为什么有 novel/novel-cloud 学习版？\n\n最开始是没有学习版的，只有一个爬虫/原创小说项目（最终发展成为 [novel-plus](https://github.com/201206030/novel-plus)\n项目），用户群体大部分是对小说有兴趣，想自建一个干净无广告的小说网站的个人和站长。\n\n后面随着使用人数逐渐增加，想通过这个项目来学习 Java 技术的人数也多了起来，对这部分用户来说，之前的项目用来学习很困难，具体原因如下：\n\n1. novel-plus 功能模块比较多，重复性的增删改查占了大部分，而用户时间是有限的，很难在有限的时间内筛选出对自己有帮助的功能模块来学习。\n2. novel-plus 追求的是系统稳定，用户很难在其中学习到最新的技术。\n3. novel-plus 代码规范性不够，受限于开发时间限制，代码开发时没有选择一个标准化的规范去参考。\n4. novel-plus 文档缺失，由于功能比较多，整个系统的教程编写需要花费大量时间，即使教程最终上线成功，用户也不可能有那么多时间也没有意义去学习所有的功能。\n\n最终，novel（单体架构） 和 novel-cloud（微服务架构）诞生了，这两个项目在保证核心流程完整的同时，从 novel-plus\n中选用了一些有代表性的功能，使用最新技术栈（不间断地更新和集成新技术），在[保姆级教程](https://docs.xxyopen.com/course/novel)的帮助下，尽量保证每一个功能都能让你学到不重复的技术。\n\n所以这两个项目我的重点是去堆技术而不是去堆功能，功能只是其中的辅助，堆太多的重复性增删改查功能没有意义，对学习的帮助也不大。\n\n### 谁适合使用 novel/novel-cloud 学习版项目？\n\n如果对下面任何一个问题你能回答 \"是\"：\n\n1. 你没有项目经验，想学习如何从零开始开发上线一个生产级别的 Java 项目?\n2. 你有项目经验，但是公司技术栈太落后，想学习最新的主流开发技术？\n\n那么，本项目正是你需要的。\n\n### 谁暂时还不适合使用 novel/novel-cloud 学习版项目？\n\n如果对下面任何一个问题你能回答 \"是\"：\n\n1. 你不懂 Java ？\n2. 你只是想搭建一个小说网站使用？\n3. 你想找一个完整的 Java 商用项目，有时间也有耐心去学习项目中的方方面面？\n\n那么，太遗憾了，本项目暂时不适合你，请使用 [novel-plus](https://github.com/201206030/novel-plus)。\n"
