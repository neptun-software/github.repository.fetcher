Otherwise you may get errors like `Invalid index name [sql], must not start with '']; \",\"status\":400}`.\n\n## Basic Usage\n\nOn elasticsearch 1.x / 2.x, visit the elasticsearch-sql web front-end:\n\n````\nhttp://localhost:9200/_plugin/sql/\n````\n\nOn elasticsearch 5.x/6.x, use [elasticsearch sql site chrome extension](https://github.com/shi-yuan/elasticsearch-sql-site-chrome) (make sure to enable cors on elasticsearch.yml).
