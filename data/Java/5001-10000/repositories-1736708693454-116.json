Distributed computing resource could be utilized in MapReduce mode, try the magic out [here](https://www.yuque.com/powerjob/en/za1d96#9YOnV)!\n\n- **Workflow(DAG) Support:** Both job dependency management and data communications between jobs are supported.\n\n- **Extensive Processor Support:** Developers can write their processors in Java, Shell, Python, and will subsequently support multilingual scheduling via HTTP.\n\n- **Powerful Disaster Tolerance:** As long as there are enough computing nodes, configurable retry policies make it possible for your task to be executed and finished successfully.\n\n- **High Availability & High Performance:**  PowerJob supports unlimited horizontal expansion. It's easy to achieve high availability and performance by deploying as many PowerJob server and worker nodes.\n\n### Applicable scenes\n\n- Timed tasks, for example, allocating e-coupons on 9 AM every morning.\n- Broadcast tasks, for example, broadcasting to the cluster to clear logs.\n- MapReduce tasks, for example, speeding up certain job like updating large amounts of data.\n- Delayed tasks, for example, processing overdue orders.\n- Customized tasks, triggered with [OpenAPI](https://www.yuque.com/powerjob/en/openapi).\n\n### Online trial\n- Address: [try.powerjob.tech](http://try.powerjob.tech/#/welcome?appName=powerjob-agent-test&password=123)\n- Recommend reading the documentation first: [here](https://www.yuque.com/powerjob/en/trial)\n\n# Documents\n**[Docs](https://www.yuque.com/powerjob/en/introduce)**\n\n**[中文文档](https://www.yuque.com/powerjob/guidence/intro)**\n\n# Known Users\n[Click to register as PowerJob user!](https://github.com/PowerJob/PowerJob/issues/6)  \nღ( ´・ᴗ・\\` )ღ Many thanks to the following registered users. ღ( ´・ᴗ・\\` )ღ\n<p style=\"text-align: center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KFCFans/PowerJob/master/others/images/user.png\" alt=\"PowerJob User\" title=\"PowerJob User\"/>\n</p>\n\n# Stargazers over time\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/PowerJob/PowerJob.svg)](https://starchart.cc/PowerJob/PowerJob)\n\n# License\n\nPowerJob is released under Apache License 2.0.
