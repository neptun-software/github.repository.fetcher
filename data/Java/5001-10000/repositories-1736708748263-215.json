Remove explicit dependencies on `springfox-swagger2`\n2. Remove any `@EnableSwagger2...` annotations\n3. Add the `springfox-boot-starter` dependency\n4. Springfox 3.x removes dependencies on guava and other 3rd party libraries (not zero dep yet! depends on spring plugin\nand open api libraries for annotations and models) so if you used guava predicates/functions those will need to \ntransition to java 8 function interfaces.\n\n#### Migrating from existing 2.x version\n#### Spring Boot Applications\nNOTE: Would love feedback to make this better\n1.

If you are using WebMvc but you don't use the [`@EnableWebMvc`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/config/annotation/EnableWebMvc.html) annotation yet, add this annotation.\n\n#### Regular spring mvc  \nNOTE: Would love feedback to make this experience better\n1. Remove explicit dependencies on `springfox-swagger2`\n2. Add `@EnableOpenApi` for open API (and `@EnableSwagger2WebMvc` or `@EnableSwagger2WebFlux` for older versions)  \n3. Added the `springfox-oas` library \n4.
