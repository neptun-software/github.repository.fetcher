This will avoid significant amounts of coding time spent on changes that ultimately get rejected.\n* Try to avoid reformats of files that change the indentation, tabs to spaces etc., as this makes reviewing diffs much\nmore difficult.\n* Abide by [the Architecture Rules](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/tree/master/src/test/java/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock/archunit) enforced by ArchUnit.\n\n### Before opening a PR\n\nWhen proposing new features or enhancements, we strongly recommend opening an issue first so that the problem being solved\nand the implementation design can be discussed. This helps to avoid time being invested in code that is never eventually\nmerged, and also promotes better designs by involving the community more widely.\n\nFor straightforward bug fixes where the issue is clear and can be illustrated via a failing unit or acceptance test, please\njust open a PR.\n\n### Code style\n\nWireMock uses the [Google Java style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html) and this is enforced in\nthe build via the Gradle [Spotless plugin](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless).\n\nWhen running pre-commit checks, if there are any formatting failures the Spotless plugin can fix them for you:\n\n```bash\n./gradlew spotlessApply\n```\n\nIf you use IntelliJ, you can also use the run configuration called **Run Spotless**,\nor there's also an [IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format) for the same purpose.\n\n## Testing\n\nWireMock has a fairly comprehensive test suite which ensures it remains robust and correct as the codebase evolves.\n\nIn particular, there are acceptance tests for almost all features, where a full WireMock server is started up and tested\nvia its public APIs.\n\nNew features should by default come with acceptance tests covering the major positive and negative cases. Unit tests\nshould also be used judiciously where non-trivial logic would benefit from finer-grained checking.\n\nWhen making performance enhancements a representative benchmark test should be developed using an appropriate tool, and\nthe results before and after applying the change attached to the associated PR.\n\n## Writing documentation\n\nIt is expected that all new features and enhancements are documented properly,\nin most cases before the patches are merged.\n\nMost of WireMock's documentation is published on `wiremock.org`,\nwhich is a static website built using Jekyll.\nThe website sources are located here: [wiremock/wiremock.org](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock.org).\nAll the documentation is located under the `_docs` directory as Markdown files,\nand it can be edited with all modern text editors and IDEs.\nSee the repository's contributor guide for more information.\n\n## Merge process\n\nMerges to this repository can be performed by the WireMock maintainer ([Tom Akehurst](https://github.com/tomakehurst))\nand by _co-maintainers_ assigned by him.\nThis is a [community role](https://github.com/wiremock/community/blob/main/governance/README.md)\ndesigned for WireMock itself and other key repositories,\nspecifically to improve velocity of reviews and changes.\n\n- The maintainers are responsible to verify the pull request readiness\n  in accordance with contributing guidelines (e.g. code quality, test automation, documentation, etc.).\n  The pull request can only be approved if these requirements are met\n- In the beginning, a review by one co-maintainer is required for the merge,\n  unless there are negative reviews and unaddressed comments by other contributors\n- After the approval, it is generally recommended to give at least 24 hours for reviews before merging\n\n### What can be merged by co-maintainers\n\nFor WireMock 3.x and beyond, co-maintainers can merge the following pull requests:\n\n- Minor features and improvements that do not impact the WireMock architecture\n- Refactorings, including the major ones, e.g. Guava replacement\n- Test Automation\n- Non-production repository changes: documentation (including Javadoc), GitHub Actions, bots and automation\n- Dependency updates for shaded dependencies, patch/minor versions for projects following the Semantic Versioning notation\n\nFor the WireMock 2.x branch, a decision of BDFL is is needed for any patch. \n\n### What CANNOT be merged by co-maintainers without BDFL’s approval\n\nThe following changes need a review by Tom Akehurst before being merged.\n\n- Any compatibility breaking changes, including binary API and REST API,\n  unless pre-approved by the BDFL in the associated GitHub issue\n- New request matchers (patterns)\n- Substantial changes to WireMock Architecture and API.\n  Examples: New REST API end-points, major features like GraphQL fetching\n- Inclusion of new libraries, even if shaded\n- Major version Dependency updates, e.g. Jetty 11 => 12\n- Changes in the deliverable artefacts, e.g. new modules\n"

Neither the thin nor standalone JAR depends on or embeds log4j, so\nyou can continue to use WireMock 2.32.0 and above without any risk of exposure to the recently discovered vulnerability.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWireMock exists and continues to thrive due to the efforts of contributors.\nRegardless of your expertise and time you could dedicate,\nthere're opportunities to participate and help the project!\n\nSee the [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information.\n"

Do this either via\n\n```\n./gradlew bump-minor-version\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n./gradlew bump-patch-version\n```\n\nCommit and push the changes made by this command.\n\n## Release\nManually trigger the [Release](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/actions/workflows/release.yml) workflow from the master branch.\n\n## Publish the release note\nRelease drafter should have created a draft release note called \"next\". Check it for sanity and edit it to add any additional information and then set the tag\nto the version you've just released and publish it.\n\n## Update the version on wiremock.org\nhttps://github.com/wiremock/wiremock.org\n\nPublish the changes by merging to the `live-publish` branch and manually triggering the \"Deploy Jekyll site to Pages\" workflow.\n\n## Release the Docker image\n\n1. Wait for the JAR version you just published to be synced to Maven Central. You can check [here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wiremock/wiremock/)\n2. Run the [Release workflow](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-docker/actions/workflows/release.yml), with the following parameters:\n    - Branch: `main`\n    - Image version (single-digit suffix like 2.35.0-1): Usually `1` \n    - Bundled WireMock version: The JAR version just published. You can check [here](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/wiremock/wiremock/)\n3. Update the README manually on Docker Hub (until we get around to automating it).\n\n## Post an announcement on the WireMock Community Slack\nAnnounce in the #announcments channel then link to the message from #general.\n\n## Shout about it on as many social media platforms as possible\nYou know the drill."

If your /bin/sh is\n#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or\n#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole\n#       command line, like:\n#\n#           ksh Gradle\n#\n#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script\n#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:\n#         * functions;\n#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,\n#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;\n#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;\n#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».\n#\n#   Important for patching:\n#\n#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided\n#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.\n#\n#       The \"traditional\" practice of packing multiple parameters into a\n#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security\n#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating\n#       options in \"$@\", and eventually passing that to Java.\n#\n#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,\n#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;\n#       see the in-line comments for details.\n#\n#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,\n#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.\n#\n#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template\n#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt\n#       within the Gradle project.\n#\n#       You can find Gradle at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/.\n#\n##############################################################################\n\n# Attempt to set APP_HOME\n\n# Resolve links: $0 may be a link\napp_path=$0\n\n# Need this for daisy-chained symlinks.\nwhile\n    APP_HOME=${app_path%\"${app_path##*/}\"}  # leaves a trailing /; empty if no leading path\n    [ -h \"$app_path\" ]\ndo\n    ls=$( ls -ld \"$app_path\" )\n    link=${ls#*' -> '}\n    case $link in             #(\n      /*)   app_path=$link ;; #(\n      *)    app_path=$APP_HOME$link ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n# This is normally unused\n# shellcheck disable=SC2034\nAPP_BASE_NAME=${0##*/}\nAPP_HOME=$( cd \"${APP_HOME:-./}\" && pwd -P ) || exit\n\n# Add default JVM options here.
