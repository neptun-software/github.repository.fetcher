More specifically, [this one.](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/625)\n\n### 2.1.0\n\n* Fixed a bug in the Badge positioning, causing the Badges to clip when there was many tabs.\n* Fixed a bug where the lower portion of unselected titles were clipped off in fixed mode.\n* Made changes to Badge restoration logic to fix [445](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/445). Credit goes to [@Kevinrob](https://github.com/Kevinrob) for reporting and helping to reproduce the issue.\n* Fixed [#448](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/448), [#471](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/471), [#436](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/436) and [#591](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/591)\n* Fixed a faulty behavior where the tabs' widths were calculated according to phone screen width, but should've been calculated according to the parent view's width by merging [#504](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/504) \n* Optimized the tab resizing calculations; now the tabs aren't needlessly removed and readded, only the layout params get changed.\n* Merged [#468](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/468) and [#457](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/457)\n* Fixed [#554](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/554) by merging [#512](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/512).\n* Made most of the BottomBarTab methods public.\n\n### 2.0.2\n\n* Now we're animating the color change on tab titles and icons.\n* Fixed a bug where the BottomBar wouldn't hide completely when it was both shy and drawing under navbar.\n* Made possible to inflate the BottomBar programmatically.\n* Made it possible to control whether the shadow is shown or not.\n* Made setItems to be public to allow writing tests without a designated Activity\n* Made setters for allowing setting tab colors, alphas, textappearances and typefaces programmatically.\n* Increased test coverage a little bit.\n\n### 2.0.1\n\n* Fixed a bug where the tab selection listener is set and multiple tabs could be selected at once\n* Fixed a bug where the reselection listener was fired even it shouldn't have.\n\n### 2.0\n\n* Cleaner code and better APIs\n* No more unnecessary stuff or spaghetti mess\n* Now the look, feel and behavior is defined in XML, as it should be\n* No more nasty regressions, thanks to the automated tests\n* **Everything is a little different compared to earlier, but it's for the greater good!**\n\nSee the readme for how to use the new version.\n\n### 1.4.0.1\n\n* Merged a [PR that fixes removing all tabs from BottomBar](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/339)\n\n### 1.4.0\n\n* Started writing some tests. **Contributions more than welcome**, as I'm still a noob when it comes to testing.\n* Merged a [PR that adds support for vector drawables](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/280)\n* Merged a [PR that adds support for disabling text scale animation](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/298)\n* Merged a [PR that adds support for custom background and tab icon colors, and also custom alpha](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/302)\n* Merged a [PR that fixes wrong method name for message shown by an exception](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/320)\n\n### 1.3.9\n\n* Merged [another PR that should get rid of the infinite Badge loop for good](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/289).\n\n### 1.3.8\n\n* Merged a [PR that fixes infinite loop caused by a layout listener when adding Badges.](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/286)\n\n### 1.3.7\n\n* Merged a [PR that fixes elliptical Badges](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/275).\n* Fixed issues [#276](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/276) and [#277](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/277)\n\n### 1.3.6\n\n* Fixed a bug that would cause the navigation bar to not be transparent.\n* Flattened View hierarchy.\n* Throwing a nice little Exception if someone tries to call ```noResizeGoodness()``` improperly, instead of just failing silently.\n\n### 1.3.5\n\n* [Merged](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/260) [some](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/268) [pull](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/269) [requests.](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/pull/271)\n* Thanks to @henhal, now the unselection bug when using badges is fixed.\n* Deprecated the ```setItemsFromMenu(@MenuRes int resId, OnMenuTabClickListener listener)``` method in favor of two separate methods: ```mBottomBar.setItems(@MenuRes int resId)``` and ```mBottomBar.setOnMenuTabClickListener(OnMenuTabClickListener listener)```. Not only because deprecating stuff is so fun (it is), but because this actually makes more sense than the old approach. The old approach still works.\n\n### 1.3.4\n\n* Now the BottomBar is 56dp tall, as it should be! Make sure your icons are 24dp and **trimmed**, meaning that the whole png size musn't be more than 24dp. So **don't use padding** around the icon.\n* Fixed a minor bug when programmatically selecting a tab.\n* Added a ```setAutoHideOnSelection(boolean autoHideOnSelection)``` method for the BottomBarBadge to control whether it is automatically hidden after the tab that contains it is selected or not. \n* Titles are now forced to be single line, make sure your title texts are short enough, or else they'll get truncated with a \"...\" !\n* Updated some dependencies and Gradle.\n\n### 1.3.3\n\n* The show / hide methods now behave nicely with CoordinatorLayout.\n* Added alpha animation for the tab titles when using the shifting tabs.\n\n### 1.3.2\n\n* Now it's possible to use fixed mode (show titles on inactive tabs) even when there's more than three tabs.\n\n### 1.3.1\n\n* Fixed a critical bug in OnLongClickListener behavior (why didn't I see that before?) when using badges.\n\n### 1.3.0\n\n* Fixed a critical bug in OnClickListener behavior when using badges.\n\n### 1.2.9\n\n* Fixed the issue when using badges and the tab resize animation is enabled. Now the badges automatically adjust their position when the tab's size (or position) updates.\n\n### 1.2.8\n\n* Fixed the [ugly layout bug](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/issues/126) that happened when calling the ```setDefaultTabPosition()``` or ```selectTabAtPosition()``` methods.\n\n### Versions 0.0.1 - 1.2.7\n\n* Sweating my ass off making this library and trying to compete with the other ones.\n"

I basically wrote the whole library in a rush, without tests, while being a serious expert beginner at the time. As a result, there's a lot of unpredictable moving parts and the tests probably aren't that great either. Don't really know, since I haven't touched this in ages.\n\nI'd recommend you to use the official BottomNavigationView from Google and urge them to implement the features you need. Or use another 3rd party library.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/roughike/BottomBar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/roughike/BottomBar) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/roughike/BottomBar/badge.svg?branch=development)](https://coveralls.io/github/roughike/BottomBar?branch=master) [![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/roughike/maven/bottom-bar/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/roughike/maven/bottom-bar/_latestVersion)\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roughike/BottomBar/master/graphics/shy-demo.gif\" width=\"30%\" /> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roughike/BottomBar/master/graphics/shifting-demo.gif\" width=\"30%\" /> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roughike/BottomBar/master/graphics/screenshot_tablet.png\" width=\"33%\" />\n\n## Version 2.0 released!\n\n[The latest version before that can be found in the v1 branch](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/tree/v1)\n\n* Cleaner code and better APIs\n* No more unnecessary stuff or spaghetti mess\n* Now the look, feel and behavior is defined in XML, as it should be\n* No more nasty regressions, thanks to the automated tests\n* **Everything is a little different compared to earlier, but it's for the greater good!**\n\n[How to contribute](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/blob/master/README.md#contributions)\n\n[Changelog](https://github.com/roughike/BottomBar/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)\n\n## What?\n\nA custom view component that mimics the new [Material Design Bottom Navigation pattern](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/bottom-navigation.html).\n\n## Does it work on my Grandpa Gary's HTC Dream?\n\nNope. The minSDK version is **API level 11 (Honeycomb).**\n\n## Gimme that Gradle sweetness, pls?\n\n```groovy\ncompile 'com.roughike:bottom-bar:2.3.1'\n```\n\n**Maven:**\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.roughike</groupId>\n  <artifactId>bottom-bar</artifactId>\n  <version>2.3.1</version>\n  <type>pom</type>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n## How?\n\nYou can add items by **writing a XML resource file**.\n\n### Creating the icons\n\nThe icons must be fully opaque, solid black color, 24dp and **with no padding**. For example, [with Android Asset Studio Generic Icon generator](https://romannurik.github.io/AndroidAssetStudio/icons-generic.html), select \"TRIM\" and make sure the padding is 0dp. Here's what your icons should look like:\n\n![Sample icons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roughike/BottomBar/master/graphics/icons-howto.png)\n\n### Adding items from XML resource\n\nDefine your tabs in an XML resource file.\n\n**res/xml/bottombar_tabs.xml:**\n\n```xml\n<tabs>\n    <tab\n        id=\"@+id/tab_favorites\"\n        icon=\"@drawable/ic_favorites\"\n        title=\"Favorites\" />\n    <tab\n        id=\"@+id/tab_nearby\"\n        icon=\"@drawable/ic_nearby\"\n        title=\"Nearby\" />\n    <tab\n        id=\"@+id/tab_friends\"\n        icon=\"@drawable/ic_friends\"\n        title=\"Friends\" />\n</tabs>\n```\n\nThen, add the BottomBar to your layout and give it a resource id for your tabs xml file.\n\n**layout/activity_main.xml**\n\n```xml\n<RelativeLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\">\n\n    <!-- This could be your fragment container, or something -->\n    <FrameLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/contentContainer\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_above=\"@+id/bottomBar\" />\n\n    <com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar\n        android:id=\"@+id/bottomBar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"60dp\"\n        android:layout_alignParentBottom=\"true\"\n        app:bb_tabXmlResource=\"@xml/bottombar_tabs\" />\n\n</RelativeLayout>\n```\n\n### Setting up listeners\n\nBy default, the tabs don't do anything unless you listen for selection events and do something when the tabs are selected.\n\n**MainActivity.java:**\n\n```java\npublic class MainActivity extends Activity {\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(@Nullable Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);\n\n        BottomBar bottomBar = (BottomBar) findViewById(R.id.bottomBar);\n        bottomBar.setOnTabSelectListener(new OnTabSelectListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onTabSelected(@IdRes int tabId) {\n                if (tabId == R.id.tab_favorites) {\n                    // The tab with id R.id.tab_favorites was selected,\n                    // change your content accordingly.\n                }\n            }\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you want to listen for reselection events, here's how you do it:\n\n```java\nbottomBar.setOnTabReselectListener(new OnTabReselectListener() {\n    @Override\n    public void onTabReSelected(@IdRes int tabId) {\n        if (tabId == R.id.tab_favorites) {\n            // The tab with id R.id.tab_favorites was reselected,\n            // change your content accordingly.\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Intercepting tab selections\n\nIf you want to conditionally cancel selection of any tab, you absolutely can. Just assign a ```TabSelectionInterceptor``` to the BottomBar, and return true from the ```shouldInterceptTabSelection()``` method.\n\n```java\nbottomBar.setTabSelectionInterceptor(new TabSelectionInterceptor() {\n    @Override\n    public boolean shouldInterceptTabSelection(@IdRes int oldTabId, @IdRes int newTabId) {\n        if (newTabId == R.id.tab_pro_feature && !userHasProVersion()) {\n          startProVersionPurchaseFlow();\n          return true;\n        }\n        \n        return false;\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Changing icons based on selection state\n\nIf you want to have different icon when a specific tab is selected, just use state list drawables.\n\n**res/drawable/my_tab_icon.xml**\n\n```xml\n<selector xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\">\n    <item android:drawable=\"@drawable/ic_myicon_selected\" android:state_selected=\"true\" />\n    <item android:drawable=\"@drawable/ic_myicon_default\" android:state_selected=\"false\" />\n</selector>\n```\n\n**res/xml/bottombar_tabs.xml**\n\n```xml\n...\n<tab\n    id=\"@+id/tab_favorites\"\n    icon=\"@drawable/my_tab_icon\"\n    title=\"Favorites\" />\n<!-- You can use @color resources too! -->\n...\n```\n\n### Those color changing tabs look dope. Howdoidodat?\n\nJust add ```barColorWhenSelected``` to each tab. When that tab is selected, the whole BottomBar background color is changed with a nice animation.\n\n**res/xml/bottombar_tabs.xml**\n\n```xml\n<tabs>\n    <tab\n        id=\"@+id/tab_favorites\"\n        icon=\"@drawable/ic_favorites\"\n        title=\"Favorites\"\n        barColorWhenSelected=\"#5D4037\" />\n    <!-- You can use @color resources too! -->\n</tabs>\n```\n\n### How do I draw it under the navbar?\n\nFirst, define a style that is a child of your main application theme:\n\n**res/values-v21/styles.xml**\n\n```xml\n<style name=\"AppTheme.TransNav\" parent=\"AppTheme\">\n    <item name=\"android:navigationBarColor\">@android:color/transparent</item>\n    <item name=\"android:windowTranslucentNavigation\">true</item>\n    <item name=\"android:windowDrawsSystemBarBackgrounds\">true</item>\n</style>\n```\n\nYou'll also have to **make a stub version of the same theme** to avoid crashes in previous API levels than Lollipop:\n\n**res/values/styles.xml**\n\n```xml\n<style name=\"AppTheme.TransNav\" parent=\"AppTheme\" />\n```\n\nAlso include the same stub in your ```values-land-v21.xml``` to avoid transparent navbar and weird behavior on landscape.\n\n**res/values-land-v21.xml:**\n\n```xml\n<style name=\"AppTheme.TransNav\" parent=\"AppTheme\" />\n```\n\nApply the theme in ```AndroidManifest.xml``` for your Activity.\n\n**AndroidManifest.xml:**\n\n```xml\n<activity android:name=\".MyAwesomeActivity\" android:theme=\"@style/AppTheme.TransNav\" />\n```\n\nFinally, set ```bb_behavior``` to include the ```underNavbar``` flag and you're good to go!\n\n**activity_my_awesome.xml:**\n\n```xml\n<com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar\n    android:id=\"@+id/bottomBar\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"56dp\"\n    android:layout_alignParentBottom=\"true\"\n    app:bb_tabXmlResource=\"@xml/my_awesome_bottombar_tabs\"\n    app:bb_behavior=\"underNavbar\" />\n```\n\n### What about Tablets?\n\nSpecify a different layout for your activity in ```res/layout-sw600dp``` folder and set ```bb_tabletMode``` to true.\n\n**res/layout-sw600dp/activity_main.xml:**\n\n```xml\n<RelativeLayout\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n    <com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar\n        android:id=\"@+id/bottomBar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_alignParentLeft=\"true\"\n        app:bb_tabXmlResource=\"@xml/bottombar_tabs_three\"\n        app:bb_tabletMode=\"true\" />\n\n    <!-- This could be your fragment container, or something -->\n    <FrameLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/contentContainer\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_toRightOf=\"@+id/bottomBar\" />\n\n</RelativeLayout>\n```\n\n### How do I hide it automatically on scroll?\n\nEasy-peasy!\n\n**activity_main.xml:**\n\n```xml\n<android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n    <android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView\n        android:id=\"@+id/myScrollingContent\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n\n        <!-- Your loooooong scrolling content here. -->\n\n    </android.support.v4.widget.NestedScrollView>\n\n    <com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar\n        android:id=\"@+id/bottomBar\"\n        android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n        android:layout_height=\"60dp\"\n        android:layout_gravity=\"bottom\"\n        app:bb_tabXmlResource=\"@xml/bottombar_tabs_three\"\n        app:bb_behavior=\"shy\"/>\n\n</android.support.design.widget.CoordinatorLayout>\n```\n\n### Badges\n\nYou can easily add badges for showing an unread message count or new items / whatever you like.\n\n```java\nBottomBarTab nearby = bottomBar.getTabWithId(R.id.tab_nearby);\nnearby.setBadgeCount(5);\n\n// Remove the badge when you're done with it.\nnearby.removeBadge/();\n```\n\n## All customization options\n\n### For the BottomBar\n\n```xml\n<com.roughike.bottombar.BottomBar\n    android:id=\"@+id/bottomBar\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"60dp\"\n    android:layout_alignParentBottom=\"true\"\n    app:bb_tabXmlResource=\"@xml/bottombar_tabs_three\"\n    app:bb_tabletMode=\"true\"\n    app:bb_behavior=\"shifting|shy|underNavbar\"\n    app:bb_inActiveTabAlpha=\"0.6\"\n    app:bb_activeTabAlpha=\"1\"\n    app:bb_inActiveTabColor=\"#222222\"\n    app:bb_activeTabColor=\"@color/colorPrimary\"\n    app:bb_badgesHideWhenActive=\"true\"\n    app:bb_titleTextAppearance=\"@style/MyTextAppearance\"\n
