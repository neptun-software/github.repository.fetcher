          "content": "# Code of Conduct\n## Introduction\n\nThis code of conduct applies to all spaces managed by the Apache Software Foundation, including IRC, all public and private mailing lists, issue trackers, wikis, blogs, Twitter, and any other communication channel used by our communities. A code of conduct which is specific to in-person events (ie., conferences) is codified in the published ASF anti-harassment policy.\n\nWe expect this code of conduct to be honored by everyone who participates in the Apache community formally or informally, or claims any affiliation with the Foundation, in any Foundation-related activities and especially when representing the ASF, in any role.\n\nThis code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative, shared environment and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter, so that it can enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.\n\n# Specific Guidelines\n\nWe strive to:\n\n## **Be open**\nwe invite anyone to participate in our community. We preferably use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made by people answering will be more easily detected and corrected.\n\n## **Be empathetic**\nwelcoming, friendly, and patient. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We should be respectful when dealing with other community members as well as with people outside our community.\n\n## **Be collaborative**,\nour work will be used by other people, and in turn we will depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of the project, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so that they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.\n\n## **Be inquisitive**,\nnobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged, though they may be directed to the appropriate forum. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving Apache project code.\n\n## **Be careful in the words that we choose**,\nWhether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:\n\n* Violent threats or language directed against another person.\n* Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.\n* Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n* Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.\n* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.\n* Unwelcome sexual attention.\n* Excessive or unnecessary profanity.\n* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.\n* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.\n\n## **Be concise**,\nkeep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of persons. Writing a short email means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary.\n\nTry to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each mail adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.\n\nTry to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly large.\n\n## **Step down considerately**,\nmembers of every project come and go. When somebody leaves or disengages from the project they should tell people they are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where they left off. In doing so, they should remain respectful of those who continue to participate in the project and should not misrepresent the project's goals or achievements. Likewise, community members should respect any individual's choice to leave the project.\n\n# Diversity Statement\n\nApache welcomes and encourages participation by everyone. We are committed to being a community that everyone feels good about joining. Although we may not be able to satisfy everyone, we will always work to treat everyone well.\n\nNo matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. Though no list can hope to be comprehensive, we explicitly honour diversity in: age, culture, ethnicity, genotype, gender identity or expression, language, national origin, neurotype, phenotype, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, subculture and technical ability.\n\nThough we welcome people fluent in all languages, Apache development is conducted in English.\n\nStandards for behaviour in the Apache community are detailed in the Code of Conduct above. We expect participants in our community to meet these standards in all their interactions and to help others to do so as well.\n\n# Reporting Guidelines\n\nWhile this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of some of the guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you may reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. However, regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it should not be abusive or disrespectful.\n\nIf you believe someone is violating this code of conduct, you may reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. Assume good faith; it is more likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion. Should there be difficulties in dealing with the situation, you may report your compliance issues in confidence to either:\n\n* President of the Apache Software Foundation: Sam Ruby (rubys at intertwingly dot net)\n\nor one of our volunteers:\n\n* Mark Thomas\n* Joan Touzet\n* Sharan Foga\n\nIf the violation is in documentation or code, for example inappropriate pronoun usage or word choice within official documentation, we ask that people report these privately to the project in question at private@project.apache.org, and, if they have sufficient ability within the project, to resolve or remove the concerning material, being mindful of the perspective of the person originally reporting the issue.\n\n# Endnotes\n\nThis Code defines empathy as \"a vicarious participation in the emotions, ideas, or opinions of others; the ability to imagine oneself in the condition or predicament of another.\" Empathetic is the adjectival form of empathy.\n"

Help out by contributing!\n\n## :beetle: Found a bug\n\nLog it in GitHub issues:\n\n* https://github.com/apache/jmeter/issues\n* or send a note to the [user mailing list](https://jmeter.apache.org/mail2.html#JMeterUser).\n\nBe sure to include all relevant information, like the versions of JMeter you’re using as long as Java version.\nA Test plan  that caused the issue as well as any error messages are also very helpful.\n\n## :question: Need help\n\nContact:\n\n* [Our users mailing list](https://jmeter.apache.org/mail2.html#JMeterUser)\n* or ask question on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/jmeter).\n\n## :bar_chart: What needs to be developed\n\nSee:\n\n* [Open issues for JMeter](https://github.com/apache/jmeter/issues)\n* [Enhancement requests for JMeter](https://github.com/apache/jmeter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement)\n\n## Development setup\n\n### Gradle\n\nYou might find useful Gradle commands in [gradle.md](gradle.md)\n\n### <a name=\"intellij\"></a>IntelliJ IDEA\n\nYou require IntelliJ 2018.3.1 or newer.\n\n1. Open the build.gradle.kts file with IntelliJ IDEA and choose `Open as Project`\n1. Make sure `Create separate module per source set` is selected\n1. Make sure `Use default gradle wrapper` is selected\n1. In the `File already exists` dialogue, choose `Yes` to overwrite\n1. In the `Open Project` dialogue, choose `Delete Existing Project and Import`\n\n### Eclipse\n\nEclipse can import Gradle projects automatically via `Import...->Gradle project` wizard.\n\nOptionally you can generate an Eclipse project by running\n\n    ./gradlew eclipse\n\nThe steps to import the sources (based on Eclipse 2019-06) into Eclipse are as follows:\n\n1. Install `Eclipse IDE for Java Developers`\n1. Install `Kotlin for Eclipse` plugin (JMeter code uses Java and Kotlin)\n1. Make sure you have a Java 17 compatible JDK configured in your workspace\n1. Open `File->Import...`\n1. Select `Existing Gradle Project` and click `Next`\n1. Read `How to experience the best Gradle integration` and click `Next`\n1. Then you might just click `Finish`\n\n## :star2: Have a patch\n\nThe best way to make sure your issue or feature is addressed is to submit a patch.\nWe accept patches through:\n\n* pull requests\n* patch attached to [JMeter developers mailing list](https://jmeter.apache.org/mail2.html#JMeterDev).\n\nHowever, before sending a patch, please make sure that the following applies:\n\n* Your commit message is descriptive.\n* Your patch doesn't have useless merge commits.\n* Your coding style is similar to ours.\n* Your patch is 100% tested. JUnit are welcome.\n* All tests checks pass (run `./gradlew check`)\n* You understand that we're very grateful for your patch!\n\n## :heart: Adding something new\n\nWe do love to enhance Apache JMeter with you to become more powerful!\nThe best way to work out your idea is to discuss it first at our dev mailing list:\n\n* [JMeter developers mailing list](https://jmeter.apache.org/mail2.html#JMeterDev)\n\nPlease, if you can, don't just throw us the code of a new feature; lets figure first together\nwhat would be the best approach regarding the current architecture and future plans,\nbefore any development.\nThis way we all get sure that your idea is aligned with the codebase, and you can enjoy\nyour happy coding even more :)\n\n## :closed_book: Want to write docs\n\nDocumentation is very valuable to us.\n\nIt is located in **[xdocs](xdocs)** folder in XML format.\n\nYou can contribute as you would for code through patch or *PR* (pull request).\n"

A JDK with `keytool` utility is better suited\n  for Recording HTTPS websites.\n\n- Optional jars:\n\n  Some jars are not included with JMeter.\n  If required, these should be downloaded and placed in the lib directory\n  - JDBC - available from the database supplier\n  - JMS - available from the JMS provider\n  - [Bouncy Castle](https://www.bouncycastle.org/) -\n  only needed for SMIME Assertion\n\n- Java Compiler (*OPTIONAL*):\n\n  A Java compiler is not needed since the distribution includes a\n  precompiled Java binary archive.\n  > **Note** that a compiler is required to build plugins for Apache JMeter.\n\n## Installation Instructions\n\n> **Note** that spaces in directory names can cause problems.\n\n- Release builds\n\n  Unpack the binary archive into a suitable directory structure.\n\n## Running JMeter\n\n1. Change to the `bin` directory\n2. Run the `jmeter` (Un\\*x) or `jmeter.bat` (Windows) file.\n\n### Windows\n\nFor Windows, there are also some other scripts which you can drag-and-drop\na JMX file onto:\n\n- `jmeter-n.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI test\n- `jmeter-n-r.cmd` - runs the file as a non-GUI remote (client-server) test\n- `jmeter-t.cmd` - loads the file ready to run it as a GUI test\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation available as of the date of this release is\nalso included, in HTML format, in the [printable_docs](printable_docs) directory,\nand it may be browsed starting from the file called [index.html](printable_docs/index.html).\n\n## Reporting a bug/enhancement\n\nSee [Issue Tracking](https://jmeter.apache.org/issues.html).\n\n## Build instructions\n\n### Release builds\n\nUnpack the source archive into a suitable directory structure.\nMost of the 3rd party library files can be extracted from the binary archive\nby unpacking it into the same directory structure.\n\nAny optional jars (see above) should be placed in `lib/opt` and/or `lib`.\n\nJars in `lib/opt` will be used for building JMeter and running the unit tests,\nbut won't be used at run-time.\n\n_This is useful for testing what happens if the optional jars are not\ndownloaded by other JMeter users._\n\nIf you are behind a proxy, you can set a few build properties in\n`~/.gradle/gradle.properties` for Gradle to use the proxy:\n\n```properties\nsystemProp.http.proxyHost=proxy.example.invalid\nsystemProp.http.proxyPort=8080\nsystemProp.http.proxyUser=your_user_name\nsystemProp.http.proxyPassword=your_password\nsystemProp.https.proxyHost=proxy.example.invalid\nsystemProp.https.proxyPort=8080\nsystemProp.https.proxyUser=your_user_name\nsystemProp.https.proxyPassword=your_password\n```\n\n### Test builds\n\nJMeter is built using Gradle, and it uses [Gradle's Toolchains for JVM projects](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/toolchains.html)\nfor provisioning JDKs. It means the code would search for the needed JDKs locally, or download them\nif they are not found.\n\nBy default, the code would use JDK 17 for build purposes, however it would set the target release to 8,\nso the resulting artifacts would be compatible with Java 8.\n\nThe following command builds and tests JMeter:\n\n```sh\n./gradlew build\n```\n\nIf you want to use a custom JDK for building you can set `-PjdkBuildVersion=11`,\nand you can select `-PjdkTestVersion=21` if you want to use a different JDK for testing.\n\nYou can list the available build parameters by executing\n\n```sh\n./gradlew parameters\n```\n\nIf the system does not have a GUI display then:\n\n```sh\n./gradlew build -Djava.awt.headless=true\n```\n\nThe output artifacts (jars, reports) are placed in the `build` folder.\nFor instance, binary artifacts can be found under `src/dist/build/distributions`.\n\nThe following command would compile the application and enable you to run `jmeter`\nfrom the `bin` directory.\n\n> **Note** that it completely refreshes `lib/` contents,\nso it would remove custom plugins should you have them installed to `lib/`. However, it would keep `lib/ext/` plugins intact.\n\n```sh\n./gradlew createDist\n```\n\nAlternatively, you could get Gradle to start the GUI:\n\n```sh\n./gradlew runGui\n```\n\n## Developer Information\n\nBuilding and contributing is explained in details at\n[building JMeter](https://jmeter.apache.org/building.html)\nand [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). More information on the tasks available for\nbuilding JMeter with Gradle is available in [gradle.md](gradle.md).\n\nThe code can be obtained from:\n\n- https://github.com/apache/jmeter\n- https://gitbox.apache.org/repos/asf/jmeter.git\n\n## Licensing and Legal Information\n\nFor legal and licensing information, please see the following files:\n\n- [LICENSE](LICENSE)\n- [NOTICE](NOTICE)\n\n## Cryptographic Software Notice\n\nThis distribution may include software that has been designed for use\nwith cryptographic software.

Create a new `Java Application` launch configuration\n1. Use `dist` for `Project`\n1. Use `org.apache.jmeter.NewDriver` for the main class\n1. On the arguments tab use the following for `Working Directory`: `${workspace_loc:jmeter/bin}`\n"
