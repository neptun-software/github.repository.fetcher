can make your life a lot easier by generating tons of boring boilerplate code in a jiffy. Android Studio comes pre-loaded with a lot of these templates and here is a collection of some of the best ones for you to get started.\n\n  * `Toast` - Creates a new `Toast.makeText(context, \"\", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();` toast\n  * `newInstance` - Generates the static `newInstance` factory method in a  Fragment with arguments\n  * `noInstance` - Generates a private empty constructor to prevent instance creation\n  * `ViewConstructors` - Generates the view constructors\n  * `Parcelable` - Generates the boilerplate code for Pacelable implementation\n  * `fbc` - Generates the `findViewById` code with the appropriate cast\n  * `const` - Generates a constant according to Android's coding conventions\n  * `logd` - Generates `Log.d(TAG, \"\");` log. Check the other variants as well\n  * `logm` - Generates a log with the current method name and its arguments\n  * `logr` - Generates a log result of the current method\n  * `psf` - Generates the boilerplate `public static final`. Also check `psfi` and `psfs`\n  * `key` - Generates the key constant for a Bundle\n  * `sout` - Prints a string to `System.out`. Also check `soutm` and `soutp`\n  * `visible` - Sets a view's visibility to VISIBLE\n  * `gone` - Sets view's visibility to GONE\n  * `todo` - Adds a TODO comment. Also check `stopship`\n\nCan't get enough of Live Templates? [Here](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/idea-live-templates) is a huge repository of lots of custom Live Templates for you to get your hands on.\n\n## Sites\n\nIf you want to keep yourself updated with all the latest Android development news, articles and tutorials then these are some of the best sites in the Internet where the good Androidy-things happen all the time.\n\n* [AndroidPub](https://android.jlelse.eu) - The Pub(lication) for Android & Tech, focused on Development\n* [Android Arsenal](https://android-arsenal.com) - Android developer portal with tools, libraries, and apps\n* [Android Design Patterns](http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com) - Android Design Patterns is a website for developers who wish to better understand the Android application framework\n* [AndroidDevDigest](https://www.androiddevdigest.com) - A Handcrafted Weekly #AndroidDev Newsletter\n* [Android Developers Official](https://developer.android.com/training/index.html) - The official Android development page provided by Google containing all the documentations and trainings\n* [Android Hive](http://www.androidhive.info) - Androidhive is independent online publication that covers Android programming tutorials, app reviews and more\n* [Android Niceties](http://androidniceties.tumblr.com) - A collection of screenshots encompassing some of the most beautiful looking Android apps\n* [Android Weekly](http://androidweekly.net) - Android Weekly is a free newsletter that helps you to stay cutting-edge with your Android Development\n* [Antonio Leiva's Blog](https://antonioleiva.com/category/blog/) - Amazing blog on Android development, with special focus on Kotlin from Antonio Leiva\n* [Caster.IO](https://caster.io) - Skyrocket your Android career with bite sized Android development video training\n* [Codepath Android Cliffnotes](https://guides.codepath.com/android) - One of the best and most up-to-date crowdsourced resource for Android developers where you will find guides and tutorials about almost everything in Android\n* [Dan Lew Codes](http://blog.danlew.net) - Thoughts on life, the universe and the mystery of it all; but actually mostly just code\n* [Grokking Android](https://www.grokkingandroid.com) - Getting Down to the Nitty Gritty of Android Development\n* [Material Up](https://material.uplabs.com) - Get fresh Material Design inspiration daily\n* [Medium's Google Developers Blog](https://medium.com/google-developers) - Engineering and technology articles for developers, written and curated by Googlers.
