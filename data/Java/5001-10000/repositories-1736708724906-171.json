Check there first!\n\nWe also host an [online forum](https://forum.processing.org) for coding questions, which is also helpful for general \"getting started\" queries.\n\nIf you don't find an answer, please let us know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues). We can only fix the things we've heard about.\n\nPlease keep the tone polite. This project is volunteer work done in our free time. We give it away at no cost. We do this because we think it's important for the community and enjoy it. Complaints that things *suck* are *annoying* or lectures about things that *must* be fixed are... weird things to hear from strangers at best, demotivating at worst. \n\n### Want to Help?\n\nGreat! The number of contributors on this project is *tiny*, especially relative to the number of users. There are [only 2 or 3 people](https://github.com/processing/processing/graphs/contributors) who actively work on this repository, for instance. We need help!\n\nHow to start:\n\n* Issues marked [help](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahelp) are a good place to start, because they're something that's isolated enough that someone can jump into it without significant reworking of other code.\n* Mind the [style guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Style-Guidelines) when submitting pull requests. Otherwise someone else will have to reformat your code so that it fits everything else (or we'll have to reject it if it'll take us too long to clean it up).\n\n### Other Details\n\nThis document was hastily thrown together in an attempt to improve the bug reporting process. It needs more detail about our intent with the project, the community behind it, our values, and an explanation of how the code itself is designed. "

          "content": "# Since the release of Processing 3.5.4 in January 2020, development has moved to [a new repository](https://github.com/processing/processing4/). \nUsing a [4.0 release](https://github.com/processing/processing4/releases) (even an alpha or beta version) is recommended if you find an issue. To avoid confusion, this repo will remain open at least until a 4.0 release is the default download at https://processing.org/download. We chose to move to a new repository so that we could clean out old files accumulated over the last 20 years.\n<!-- Is there not a better way to do a callout box? -->\n\nProcessing\n==========\n\nThis is the official source code for the [Processing](http://processing.org) Development Environment (PDE),\nthe “core” and the libraries that are included with the [download](http://processing.org/download).\n\n__I've found a bug!__\nLet us know [here](https://github.com/processing/processing/issues) (after first checking if someone has already posted a similar problem).\nIf it's a reference, web site, or examples issue, take that up with folks [here](https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues).\nThere are also separate locations for [Android Mode](https://github.com/processing/processing-android/issues), or the [Video](https://github.com/processing/processing-video/issues) and [Sound](https://github.com/processing/processing-sound/issues) libraries.\nThe [processing.js](http://processingjs.org) project is not affiliated with us, but you can find their issue tracker [here](https://github.com/processing-js/processing-js/issues).\n\n__Locked Issues__\nWhere possible, I've started locking issues once resolved. This helps reduce the amount of noise from folks adding to an issue that's been closed for years. Because this project has existed for a long time and we have thousands of closed issues, lots of them may sound similar to an issue you're having. But if there's a new problem, it'll be missed if it's lost in a comment added to an already closed issue. I don't like to lock issues because it cuts off conversation, but it's better than legitimate problems being missed. Once an issue has been resolved for 30 days, it will automatically lock.\n\n__That [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs) fella is suspicious.__\nThe issues list has been imported from Google Code, so there are many spurious references\namongst them since the numbering changed. Basically, any time you see references to\nchanges made by [processing-bugs](https://github.com/processing-bugs), it may be somewhat suspect.\nOver time this will clean itself up as bugs are fixed and new issues are added from within GitHub.\nHelp speed this process along by helping us!\n\n__Please help.__\nThe instructions for building the source [are here](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Build-Instructions).\nPlease help us fix problems, and if you're submitting code, following the [style guidelines](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Style-Guidelines) helps save me a lot of time.\n\n__And finally...__\nSomeday we'll also fix all these bugs, throw together hundreds of unit tests, and get rich off all this stuff that we're giving away for free. But not today.\n\nSo in the meantime, I ask for your patience,\n[participation](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Project-List),\nand [patches](https://github.com/processing/processing/pulls).\n\nBen Fry, 20 January 2019\n"

related classes\nX   resolved, just use inner classes for everything\no   better way to do parent and g.rect stuff in related classes\no     implement g. passed into any function called draw()\no     also important for things like cos, sin, max etc\no     but maybe once you're doing more advanced code, that stuff's ok\no       or using inner classes is better b/c class stuff works\no   related

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\n.....................................................................\n\n\nthe original document can be found at:\nhttp://oss.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/license10.html\n\n\nIBM Public License Version 1.0 \n\nTHE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS IBM\nPUBLIC LICENSE (\"AGREEMENT\"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF\nTHE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT. \n\n\n1. DEFINITIONS \n\n\"Contribution\" means: \n\na) in the case of International Business Machines Corporation (\"IBM\"),\nthe Original Program, and \n\nb) in the case of each Contributor, \n\ni) changes to the Program, and\n\nii) additions to the Program;\nwhere such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and\nare distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by such\nContributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's\nbehalf. Contributions do not include additions to the Program which:\n(i) are separate modules of software distributed in conjunction with\nthe Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\nderivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means IBM and any other entity that distributes the\nProgram. \n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor\nwhich are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution\nalone or when combined with the Program. \n\n\n\"Original Program\" means the original version of the software\naccompanying this Agreement as released by IBM, including source code,\nobject code and documentation, if any. \n\n\"Program\" means the Original Program and Contributions. \n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this\nAgreement, including all Contributors. \n\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS \n\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\nlicense to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,\npublicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\nContributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and\nobject code form.\n\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\ngrants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\nlicense under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\nimport and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if\nany, in source code and object code form. This patent license shall\napply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\nthe time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\nof the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\nLicensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\ncombinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\nlicensed hereunder. \n\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\nlicenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\nprovided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\npatent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\nContributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\nany other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\nor otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\ngranted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility\nto secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\nexample, if a third party patent license is required to allow\nRecipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility\nto acquire that license before distributing the Program.\n\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient\ncopyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright\nlicense set forth in this Agreement. \n\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS \n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form\nunder its own license agreement, provided that: \n\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\nb) its license agreement:\n\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties\nand conditions, express and implied, including warranties or\nconditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\nconditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose; \n\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability\nfor damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and\nconsequential damages, such as lost profits; \n\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are\noffered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such\nContributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable\nmanner on or through a medium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form: \na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and \nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the \nProgram. \n\nEach Contributor must include the following in a conspicuous location\nin the Program: \n\nCopyright 2003, International Business Machines Corporation and\nothers. All Rights Reserved. \n\nIn addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the originator\nof its Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows\nsubsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution. \n\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION \n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain\nresponsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\nlike. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use\nof the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a\ncommercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not\ncreate potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a\nContributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,\nsuch Contributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend\nand indemnify every other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\")\nagainst any losses, damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising\nfrom claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party\nagainst the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts\nor omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\ndistribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\nobligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property\ninfringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a)\npromptly notify the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim,\nand b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with\nthe Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement\nnegotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such\nclaim at its own expense. \n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those\nperformance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\nContributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\nmust pay those damages. \n\n\n5. NO WARRANTY \n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\nPROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY\nWARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\nOR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\nresponsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\nexercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to\nthe risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable\nlaws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and\nunavailability or interruption of operations. \n\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY \n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR\nANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\nINCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\nWITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\nLIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\nNEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\nDISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\nHEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. \n\n\n7. GENERAL \n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\nenforceable. \n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with\nrespect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or\ncounterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that\nContributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as\nof the date such litigation is filed. In addition, If Recipient\ninstitutes patent litigation against any entity (including a\ncross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or\nhardware\n"

the package:\nproductbuild --component YOUR_APP.app /Applications \\\n  --sign \"$SIGNATURE_INST\" YOUR_APP.pkg\nYou can test if the package work with this command:\nsudo installer -store -pkg $YOUR_APP.pkg -target /\nYou can also verify all libraries have been signed\nfind YOUR_APP/Contents/ -type f \\\n   \\( -name \"*.jar\" -or -name \"*.dylib\"\\) \\\n  -exec codesign --verbose --verify

for some indefinite later release...\n\n_ make reference build process part of dist\n_   https://github.com/processing/processing-docs/issues/85\n_   separate ant target, but only require them for dist\n_   as separate targets, folks can build explicitly if they'd like\n_   processing-docs/java_generate/ReferenceGenerator/processingrefBuild.sh\n_   remove reference.zip from main repo\n_ using svg images for res-indep icons/gui\n_   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2495501/swing-batik-create-an-imageicon-from-an-svg-file\n_ nurbs or other architecture stuff\n_ force indentation - implement an option for beginners especially\n_ indents and loops\n_   or make the area light up gray as it's being worked on\n_ get rid of static mode? only setup/draw mode? or create project that way?\n_   pro: simplify internal code, fixes some of the worst errors\n_   con: people love it, most of the books use it heavily\n_ add === for String.equals()\n_   might be problematic since it might be opposite the javascript meaning\n_   jer: it's a decent time to start talking abt references/vars\n_ Blank sketch opened even if opening an existing sketch by double-clicking\n_   https://github.com/processing/processing/issues/218\n_ changing number of screens between run causes things to show up off-screen\n_   so when running, check to make sure that things are out of the area\n_ improve the speed of file copying\n_   use FileChannels, see FileInputStream.getChannel(),\n_   and use transferFrom() or transferTo().)\n_   could also use FileUtils in Apache's common io\n_   http://commons.apache.org/io/api-release/index.html\n_ go through libraries and clean things up\nprotected void finalize() throws Throwable {\n  try {\n    close();\n  } catch (Exception e) {\n    //
