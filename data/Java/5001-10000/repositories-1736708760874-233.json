          "content": "## Embedding BarcodeView\n\nFor more control over the UI or scanning behaviour, some components may be used directly:\n\n* BarcodeView: Handles displaying the preview and decoding of the barcodes.\n* DecoratedBarcodeView: Combines BarcodeView with a viewfinder for feedback, as well as some status /\n  prompt text.\n* CaptureManager: Manages the InactivityTimer, BeepManager, orientation lock, and returning of the\n  barcode result.\n\nThese components can be used from any Activity or Fragment.\n\nThis is much more low-level than using IntentIntegrator. Your code becomes responsible for:\n* Setting up the BarcodeView (doesn't have all the helpers from IntentIntegrator)*\n* Requesting permission to do the Camera.\n* Making sure only one Camera instance is active at a time.\n* Handling the scan results.\n\nSamples:\n* [ContinuousCaptureActivity][6]: continuously scan and display results (instead of a once-off scan).\n* [ToolbarCaptureActivity][8]: Same as the normal CaptureActivity, but with a Lollipop Toolbar.\n\n\n## Notes on threading\n\nFor a responsive user interface, all camera operations happen on a dedicated background thread.\nIn most cases this doesn't matter, but it does mean that the camera is not released immediately\nwhen the BarcodeView is paused. If you want to start using the camera for something else\nimmediately after scanning, use `BarcodeView#pauseAndWait()` instead of `BarcodeView#pause()`.\nThis will block the main thread until the camera is released.\n\n\n## Notes on scaling\n\nOn each Android device, the camera has a set list of available preview sizes. When embedding the\nbarcode scanning along with other components on an Activity, there will almost never be a preview\nsize that matches up exactly, so we have to pick one and scale and/or crop it.\n\nAlso affecting this is that either SurfaceView or TextureView can be used to display the preview.\nSurfaceView has better performance, but does not support cropping. TextureView is more powerful,\nbut has some performance overhead, and is only supported on Android API 14+. We use SurfaceView by\ndefault.\n\nTo avoid aspect ratio distortion, we can crop the preview. However, in some combinations of\nSurfaceView and other components, the camera preview may end up displaying outside the SurfaceView,\nand over other components. This happens especially when:\n\n1. Placing the scanner inside a dialog, or:\n2. Other components are placed before the (Decorated)BarcodeView, resulting in a lower z-order.\n\nFor these cases we have two solutions:\n\n1. Use TextureView instead of SurfaceView. This may have a performance impact, but solves the above\n   issues. Note that this is only available with Android API 14+.\n\n2. Use either `fitCenter` or `fitXY` for scaling, instead of `centerCrop`. Note that `fitCenter` may\n   result in black bars next to the preview, and `fitXY` may distort the aspect ratio.\n   \nThe default is to:\n\n1. Use TextureView on Android API 14+, SurfaceView on lower versions.\n2. Use `centerCrop` scaling when TextureView is used.\n3. Use `fitCenter` if SurfaceView is used.\n\nYou can override these options:\n\n```xml\n<com.journeyapps.barcodescanner.DecoratedBarcodeView\n        android:layout_width=\"...\"\n        android:layout_height=\"...\"\n        app:zxing_use_texture_view=\"false\" (defaults to true, only has an effect on Android API 14+)\n        app:zxing_preview_scaling_strategy=\"centerCrop\"/> (or fitCenter / fitXY)\n```\n\nFor a full-screen barcode scanner with no Toolbar, the recommended options are:\n\n```\napp:zxing_use_texture_view=\"false\"\napp:zxing_preview_scaling_strategy=\"centerCrop\"\n```\n\n\n[8]: sample/src/main/java/example/zxing/ToolbarCaptureActivity.java\n[6]: sample/src/main/java/example/zxing/ContinuousCaptureActivity.java"

Can be used via Intents (little code required).\n2. Can be embedded in an Activity, for advanced customization of UI and logic.\n3. Scanning can be performed in landscape or portrait mode.\n4. Camera is managed in a background thread, for fast startup time.\n\nA sample application is available in [Releases](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded/releases).\n\nBy default, Android SDK 24+ is required because of `zxing:core` 3.4.x.\nSDK 19+ is supported with additional configuration, see [Older SDK versions](#older-sdk-versions).\n\n## Adding aar dependency with Gradle\n\nAdd the following to your `build.gradle` file:\n\n```groovy\n// Config for SDK 24+\n\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:4.3.0'\n}\n```\n\n## Older SDK versions\n\nBy default, only SDK 24+ will work, even though the library specifies 19 as the minimum version.\n\nFor SDK versions 19+, one of the changes below are required.\nSome older SDK versions below 19 may work, but this is not tested or supported.\n\n### Option 1. Downgrade zxing:core to 3.3.0\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n    mavenCentral()\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation('com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:4.3.0') { transitive = false }\n    implementation 'com.google.zxing:core:3.3.0'\n}\n```\n\n### Option 2: Desugaring (Advanced)\n\nThis option does not require changing library versions, but may complicate the build process.\n\nThis requires Android Gradle Plugin version 4.0.0 or later.\n\nSee [Java 8+ API desugaring support](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring).\n\nExample for SDK 21+:\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    defaultConfig {\n        minSdkVersion 21\n    }\n\n    compileOptions {\n        // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs\n        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true\n        // Sets Java compatibility to Java 8\n        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:4.3.0'\n\n    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'\n}\n```\n\nSDK 19+ additionally requires multiDex. In addition to these gradle config changes, the Application\nclass must also be changed. See for details: [Configure your app for multidex](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex#mdex-gradle).\n\n```groovy\nandroid {\n    defaultConfig {\n        multiDexEnabled true\n        minSdkVersion 19\n    }\n\n    compileOptions {\n        // Flag to enable support for the new language APIs\n        coreLibraryDesugaringEnabled true\n        // Sets Java compatibility to Java 8\n        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8\n    }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    implementation 'com.journeyapps:zxing-android-embedded:4.3.0'\n\n    coreLibraryDesugaring 'com.android.tools:desugar_jdk_libs:1.1.5'\n    implementation \"androidx.multidex:multidex:2.0.1\"\n}\n```\n\n## Hardware Acceleration\n\nHardware acceleration is required since TextureView is used.\n\nMake sure it is enabled in your manifest file:\n\n```xml\n    <application android:hardwareAccelerated=\"true\" ... >\n```\n\n## Usage with ScanContract\n\nNote: `startActivityForResult` is deprecated, so this example uses `registerForActivityResult` instead.\nSee for details: https://developer.android.com/training/basics/intents/result\n\n`startActivityForResult` can still be used via `IntentIntegrator`, but that is not recommended anymore.\n\n```java\n// Register the launcher and result handler\nprivate final ActivityResultLauncher<ScanOptions> barcodeLauncher = registerForActivityResult(new ScanContract(),\n        result -> {\n            if(result.getContents() == null) {\n                Toast.makeText(MyActivity.this, \"Cancelled\", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n            } else {\n                Toast.makeText(MyActivity.this, \"Scanned: \" + result.getContents(), Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();\n            }\n        });\n\n// Launch\npublic void onButtonClick(View view) {\n    barcodeLauncher.launch(new ScanOptions());\n}\n```\n\nCustomize options:\n```java\nScanOptions options = new ScanOptions();\noptions.setDesiredBarcodeFormats(ScanOptions.ONE_D_CODE_TYPES);\noptions.setPrompt(\"Scan a barcode\");\noptions.setCameraId(0);  // Use a specific camera of the device\noptions.setBeepEnabled(false);\noptions.setBarcodeImageEnabled(true);\nbarcodeLauncher.launch(options);\n```\n\nSee [BarcodeOptions][5] for more options.\n\n### Generate Barcode example\n\nWhile this is not the primary purpose of this library, it does include basic support for\ngenerating some barcode types:\n\n```java\ntry {\n  BarcodeEncoder barcodeEncoder = new BarcodeEncoder();\n  Bitmap bitmap = barcodeEncoder.encodeBitmap(\"content\", BarcodeFormat.QR_CODE, 400, 400);\n  ImageView imageViewQrCode = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.qrCode);\n  imageViewQrCode.setImageBitmap(bitmap);\n} catch(Exception e) {\n\n}\n```\n\nTo customize the generated barcode image, use the `setBackgroundColor` and `setForegroundColor` functions of the\n`BarcodeEncoder` class with a [`@ColorInt`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/annotation/ColorInt)\nvalue to update the background and foreground colors of the barcode respectively. By default, the barcode has a\nwhite background and black foreground.\n\n\n### Changing the orientation\n\nTo change the orientation, specify the orientation in your `AndroidManifest.xml` and let the `ManifestMerger` to update the Activity's definition.\n\nSample:\n\n```xml\n<activity\n\t\tandroid:name=\"com.journeyapps.barcodescanner.CaptureActivity\"\n\t\tandroid:screenOrientation=\"fullSensor\"\n\t\ttools:replace=\"screenOrientation\" />\n```\n\n```java\nScanOptions options = new ScanOptions();\noptions.setOrientationLocked(false);\nbarcodeLauncher.launch(options);\n```\n\n### Customization and advanced options\n\nSee [EMBEDDING](EMBEDDING.md).\n\nFor more advanced options, look at the [Sample Application](https://github.com/journeyapps/zxing-android-embedded/blob/master/sample/src/main/java/example/zxing/MainActivity.java),\nand browse the source code of the library.\n\nThis is considered advanced usage, and is not well-documented or supported.\n\n## Android Permissions\n\nThe camera permission is required for barcode scanning to function. It is automatically included as\npart of the library. On Android 6 it is requested at runtime when the barcode scanner is first opened.\n\nWhen using BarcodeView directly (instead of via IntentIntegrator / CaptureActivity), you have to\nrequest the permission manually before calling `BarcodeView#resume()`, otherwise the camera will\nfail to open.\n\n## Building locally\n\n    ./gradlew assemble\n\nTo deploy the artifacts the your local Maven repository:\n\n    ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal\n\nYou can then use your local version by specifying in your `build.gradle` file:\n\n    repositories {\n        mavenLocal()\n    }\n\n## Sponsored by\n\n[JourneyApps][1]\n\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the [Apache License 2.0][7]\n\n\tCopyright (C) 2012-2022 ZXing authors, Journey Mobile\n\n\tLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n\tyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n\tYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n\t    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n\tUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n\tdistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n\tWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n\tSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n\tlimitations under the License.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://journeyapps.com\n[2]: https://github.com/zxing/zxing/\n[5]: zxing-android-embedded/src/com/journeyapps/barcodescanner/ScanOptions.java\n[7]: http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n"
