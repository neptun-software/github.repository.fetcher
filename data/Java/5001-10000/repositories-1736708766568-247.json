The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the\ncopyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our\ncodebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also\nneed to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you\nknow that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign\nthe CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has\napproved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.\nBefore you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with\nus first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and\npossibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid\nfrustration later on.\n\n### Code reviews\n\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We\nuse GitHub pull requests for this purpose.\n\n### The small print\n\nContributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than the\none above, the Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement.\n"

This is a deliberate design decision to unify our code formatting on\na single format.*\n\n### IntelliJ, Android Studio, and other JetBrains IDEs\n\nA\n[google-java-format IntelliJ plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527)\nis available from the plugin repository. To install it, go to your IDE's\nsettings and select the `Plugins` category. Click the `Marketplace` tab, search\nfor the `google-java-format` plugin, and click the `Install` button.\n\nThe plugin will be disabled by default. To enable,\n[open the Project settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configure-project-settings.html),\nthen click \"google-java-format Settings\" and check the \"Enable\ngoogle-java-format\" checkbox.\n\nTo enable it by default in new projects,\n[open the default settings for new projects](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configure-project-settings.html#new-default-settings)\nand configure it under \"Other Settings/google-java-format Settings\".\n\nWhen enabled, it will replace the normal `Reformat Code` and `Optimize Imports`\nactions.\n\n#### IntelliJ JRE Config\n\nThe google-java-format plugin uses some internal classes that aren't available\nwithout extra configuration. To use the plugin, you need to\n[add some options to your IDE's Java runtime](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/tuning-the-ide.html#procedure-jvm-options).\nTo do that, go to `Help→Edit Custom VM Options...` and paste in these lines:\n\n```\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.api=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.code=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.file=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.parser=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.tree=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.util=ALL-UNNAMED\n```\n\nOnce you've done that, restart the IDE.\n\n### Eclipse\n\nThe latest version of the `google-java-format` Eclipse plugin can be downloaded\nfrom the [releases page](https://github.com/google/google-java-format/releases).\nDrop it into the Eclipse\n[drop-ins folder](http://help.eclipse.org/neon/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.platform.doc.isv%2Freference%2Fmisc%2Fp2_dropins_format.html)\nto activate the plugin.\n\nThe plugin adds a `google-java-format` formatter implementation that can be\nconfigured in `Window > Preferences > Java > Code Style > Formatter > Formatter\nImplementation`.\n\n### Third-party integrations\n\n*   Visual Studio Code\n    *   [google-java-format-for-vs-code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JoseVSeb.google-java-format-for-vs-code)\n*   Gradle plugins\n    *   [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle#google-java-format)\n    *   [sherter/google-java-format-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/sherter/google-java-format-gradle-plugin)\n*   Apache Maven plugins\n    *   [spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-maven#google-java-format)\n    *   [spotify/fmt-maven-plugin](https://github.com/spotify/fmt-maven-plugin)\n    *   [talios/googleformatter-maven-plugin](https://github.com/talios/googleformatter-maven-plugin)\n    *   [Cosium/maven-git-code-format](https://github.com/Cosium/maven-git-code-format):\n        A maven plugin that automatically deploys google-java-format as a\n        pre-commit git hook.\n*   SBT plugins\n    *   [sbt/sbt-java-formatter](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-java-formatter)\n*   [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)\n    *   [googlejavaformat-action](https://github.com/axel-op/googlejavaformat-action):\n        Automatically format your Java files when you push on github\n\n### as a library\n\nThe formatter can be used in software which generates java to output more\nlegible java code. Just include the library in your maven/gradle/etc.\nconfiguration.\n\n`google-java-format` uses internal javac APIs for parsing Java source. The\nfollowing JVM flags are required when running on JDK 16 and newer, due to\n[JEP 396: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals by Default](https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/396):\n\n```\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.api=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.code=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.file=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.parser=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.tree=ALL-UNNAMED\n--add-exports=jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.util=ALL-UNNAMED\n```\n\n#### Maven\n\n```xml\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>com.google.googlejavaformat</groupId>\n  <artifactId>google-java-format</artifactId>\n  <version>${google-java-format.version}</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\n#### Gradle\n\n```groovy\ndependencies {\n  implementation 'com.google.googlejavaformat:google-java-format:$googleJavaFormatVersion'\n}\n```\n\nYou can then use the formatter through the `formatSource` methods. E.g.\n\n```java\nString formattedSource = new Formatter().formatSource(sourceString);\n```\n\nor\n\n```java\nCharSource source = ...\nCharSink output = ...\nnew Formatter().formatSource(source, output);\n```\n\nYour starting point should be the instance methods of\n`com.google.googlejavaformat.java.Formatter`.\n\n## Building from source\n\n```\nmvn install\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [the contributors guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n## License\n\n```text\nCopyright 2015 Google Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not\nuse this file except in compliance with the License.
