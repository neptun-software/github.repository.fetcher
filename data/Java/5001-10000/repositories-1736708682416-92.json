You may simply download a binary distribution. It is cross-platform.\nRead RUNNING.txt for the instruction on how to run it.\n\nIn order to build a binary distribution version of Apache Tomcat from a\nsource distribution, do the following:\n\n\n(1) Download and Install a Java Development Kit\n\n 1. If the JDK is already installed, skip to (2).\n\n 2. Download a version @BUILD_JAVA_VERSION@ or later of Java Development Kit (JDK) release (use\n    the latest update available for your chosen version) from one of:\n\n        http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html\n        http://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html\n        or another JDK vendor.\n\n    Note regarding later versions of Java:\n\n      As documented elsewhere, one of components in Apache Tomcat includes\n      a private copy of the Apache Commons DBCP 2 library.\n\n      The JDBC interfaces implemented by DBCP frequently change in non-backwards\n      compatible ways between versions of the Java SE specification. Therefore,\n      it is likely that DBCP 2 will only compile with the specific version of Java\n      listed above and that compilation will fail if a later version of Java is\n      used.\n\n      See Apache Commons DBCP 2 project web site for more details on\n      available versions of the library and its requirements,\n\n        https://commons.apache.org/dbcp/\n\n 3. Install the JDK according to the instructions included with the release.\n\n 4. Set an environment variable JAVA_HOME to the pathname of the directory\n    into which you installed the JDK release.\n\n\n(2) Install Apache Ant version @ANT_VERSION_REQUIRED@ or later on your computer.\n\n 1. If Apache Ant version @ANT_VERSION_REQUIRED@ or later is already installed on your\n    computer, skip to (3).\n\n 2. Download a binary distribution of Ant from:\n\n        https://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi\n\n 3. Unpack the binary distribution into a convenient location so that the\n    Ant release resides in its own directory (conventionally named\n    \"apache-ant-[version]\").\n\n    For the purposes of the remainder of this document, the symbolic name\n    \"${ant.home}\" is used to refer to the full pathname of the release\n    directory.\n\n 4. Create an ANT_HOME environment variable to point the directory\n    ${ant.home}.\n\n 5. Modify the PATH environment variable to include the directory\n    ${ant.home}/bin in its list.  This makes the \"ant\" command line script\n    available, which will be used to actually perform the build.\n\n\n(3) Building Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@\n\n(3.1) Checkout or obtain the source code for Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@\n\nClone the source using git, then checkout a specific major branch or\nmain for the latest code development, or download and unpack a source\npackage.\n\n *  Tomcat GitHub repository URL:\n\n        https://github.com/apache/tomcat\n\n *  Source packages can be downloaded from:\n\n        https://tomcat.apache.org/download-@VERSION_MAJOR@.cgi\n\nThe location where the source has been placed will be further referred as\n${tomcat.source}.\n\nThe Tomcat local build process does not modify line-endings. The svn repository\nis configured so that all files will be checked out with the line-ending\nappropriate for the current platform. When using a source package you should\nensure that you use the source package that has the appropriate line-ending\nfor your platform:\n\n  zip    -> CRLF\n  tar.gz -> LF\n\nNote that the release build process does modify line-endings to ensure that\neach release package has the appropriate line-endings.\n\n(3.2) Building\n\n 1. The build is controlled by creating a ${tomcat.source}/build.properties\n    file.\n\n    It is recommended to always create the file, because of unfortunate\n    default value of base.path property. You may start with the following\n    content for the file:\n\n        # ----- Default Base Path for Dependent Packages -----\n        # Replace this path with the directory path where dependencies binaries\n        # should be downloaded\n        base.path=/home/me/some-place-to-download-to\n\n 2. Configure base.path property by adding it to the\n    ${tomcat.source}/build.properties file.\n\n    The base.path property specifies the place where Tomcat dependencies\n    required by the build are downloaded. It is recommended to place this\n    directory outside of the source tree, so that you do not waste your\n    time re-downloading the libraries.\n\n* NOTE: The default value of the base.path property configures the build script\n  to download the libraries required to build Tomcat to the\n  ${user.home}/tomcat-build-libs directory.\n\n* NOTE: Users accessing the Internet through a proxy must use the properties\n  file to indicate to Ant the proxy configuration.\n\n  The following properties should be added to the ${tomcat.source}/build.properties\n  file.\n\n        proxy.use=true\n        proxy.host=proxy.domain\n        proxy.port=8080\n        proxy.user=username\n        proxy.password=password\n\n  See Apache Ant documentation for the <setproxy> task for details.\n\n 3. Go to the sources directory and run Ant:\n\n        cd ${tomcat.source}\n        ant\n\n    This will execute the \"deploy\" target in build.xml.\n\n    Once the build has completed successfully, a usable Tomcat installation\n    will have been produced in the ${tomcat.source}/output/build directory,\n    and can be started and stopped with the usual scripts.\n\n    Note that the build includes Tomcat documentation, which can be found\n    in the output/build/webapps/docs directory.\n\n    The path of the output directory can be controlled by specifying the\n    \"tomcat.output\" property in the build.properties file.\n\n* NOTE: Do not run the build as the root user. Building and running Tomcat\n  does not require root privileges.\n\n\n(4) Updating sources and rebuilding\n\nIt is recommended that you regularly update the downloaded Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@\nsources using your git client.\n\nFor a quick rebuild of only modified code you can use:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant\n\n\n(5) Special builds\n\nThere are several targets in Tomcat build files that are useful to be\ncalled separately. They build components that you may want to build\nquickly, or ones that are included in the full release and are not built\nduring the default \"deploy\" build.\n\n(5.1) Building documentation\n\nThe documentation web application is built during the default \"deploy\"\nbuild.\n\nIt can be built quickly by using the following commands:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant build-docs\n\nThe output of this command will be found in the following directory:\n\n    output/build/webapps/docs\n\n\nThe API documentation (Javadoc) is built during a \"release\" build. It is\neasy to build it separately by using the following commands:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant javadoc\n\nThe output of this command will be found in the following directories:\n\n    output/dist/webapps/docs/api\n    output/dist/webapps/docs/elapi\n    output/dist/webapps/docs/jspapi\n    output/dist/webapps/docs/servletapi\n\n\n(5.2) Building the extras (commons-logging, webservices etc.)\n\nThese components are documented on the \"Additional Components\"\n(extras.html) page of documentation. They are built during a \"release\"\nbuild.\n\nYou can build them by using the following commands:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant extras\n\n(5.3) Building the embedded packages\n\nThese are built during a \"release\" build.\n\nYou can build them by using the following commands:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant embed\n\n\n(6) Building a full release (as provided via the ASF download pages)\n\n    A full release includes the Windows installer which requires a Windows\n    environment to be available to create it. If not building in a Windows\n    environment, the build scripts assume that Wine is available. If this is not\n    the case, the skip.installer property may be set to skip the creation of the\n    Windows installer.\n\n    Provided that Wine is available on non-Windows platforms, a full release\n    build may be made on Windows, Linux or MacOS.\n\n 1. Configure GPG, if needed\n\n    If the released artifacts have to be cryptographically signed with a\n    PGP signature, like the official ASF releases are, the following\n    property can be added to the build.properties file:\n\n        # Location of GPG executable (used only for releases)\n        gpg.exec=/path/to/gpg\n\n    You do not need it if you do not plan to sign the release.\n\n    If \"gpg.exec\" property does not point to an existing file, it will be\n    ignored and this feature will be deactivated.\n\n    You will be prompted for the GPG passphrase when the release build\n    starts, unless \"gpg.passphrase\" property is set.\n\n 2. If building the Windows installer\n\n    If running the build in a UAC enabled environment, building the Windows\n    installer requires elevated privileges. The simplest way to do this is to\n    open the command prompt used for the build with the \"Run as administrator\"\n    option.\n\n 3. Configure the code signing service\n\n    ASF committers performing official releases will need to configure the code\n    signing service so that the Windows installer is signed during the build\n    process. The following properties need to be added to the build.properties\n    file:\n\n        # Location of GPG executable (used only for releases)\n        gpg.exec=/path/to/gpg\n        # Code signing of Windows installer\n        do.codesigning=true\n        codesigning.storepass=request-via-pmc\n\n    Release managers will be provided with the necessary credentials by the PMC.\n\n 4. Build the release:\n\n    Apache Tomcat releases are fully reproducible.\n\n    Release managers producing release builds must follow the following\n    procedure:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant pre-release\n    ant release\n    git commit -a -m \"Tag <version-number>\"\n    git tag <vesion-number>\n    git push origin <version-number>\n    ant release\n    git reset --hard HEAD~1\n\n    The output from either 'ant release' call may be uploaded as the official\n    release since they will be identical. It is recommended that the output from\n    the second call is used.\n\n    Anyone wishing to reproduce an official build must do so from an official\n    source release. The build tool chain defined in build.properties.release\n    must be used to reproduce an official build. Once unpacked to\n    ${tomcat.source}, the following steps must be followed\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant release\n\n    Following the same steps without using the defined build tool chain will\n    create a release that is functionally the same as an official release but\n    not bit for bit identical.\n\n\n(7) Tests\n\n(7.1) Running Tomcat tests\n\nTomcat includes a number of junit tests. The tests are not run when a\nrelease is built. There is separate command to run them.\n\nTo run the testsuite use the following command:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant test\n\nIt is advisable to redirect output of the above command to a file for later\ninspection.\n\nThe JUnit reports generated by the tests will be written to the following\ndirectory:\n\n    output/build/logs\n\nBy default the testsuite is run twice to test the 2 different implementations\nof Tomcat connectors: NIO and NIO2. (If you are not familiar with Tomcat\nconnectors, see config/http.html in documentation for details).\n\nThe 2 runs are activated and deactivated individually by the following\nproperties, which all are \"true\" by default:\n\n    execute.test.nio=true\n    execute.test.nio2=true\n\nThe SSL tests will be run twice. Once with the JSSE implementation and once\nwith the OpenSSL implementation. The OpenSSL implementation can only be\ntested if Tomcat-Native library binaries are found by the testsuite. The\n\"test.apr.loc\" property specifies the directory where the library binaries are\nlocated.\n\nBy default the \"test.apr.loc\" property specifies the following location:\n\n    output/build/bin/\n\nIf you are on Windows and want to test the OpenSSL TLS implementation you can\nput the tcnative-2.dll file into ${tomcat.source}/bin/ and it will be\ncopied into the above directory when the build runs.\n\nThe unit tests include tests of the clustering functionality which require\nmulticast to be enabled. There is a simple application provided in the Tomcat\ntest source (org.apache.catalina.tribes.TesterMulticast) that can be used to\ncheck if a machine supports multicast. Notes on enabling multicast for different\noperating systems are provided in the Javadoc for that class.\n\n\n(7.2) Running a single test\n\nIt is possible to run a single JUnit test class by adding the \"test.entry\"\nproperty to the build.properties file. The property specifies the name of\nthe test class.\n\nFor example:\n\n    test.entry=org.apache.catalina.util.TestServerInfo\n\nIt is possible to further limit such run to a number of selected test\nmethods by adding \"test.entry.methods\" property. The property specifies a\ncomma-separated list of test case methods.\n\nFor example:\n\n    test.entry=org.apache.el.lang.TestELArithmetic\n    test.entry.methods=testMultiply01,testMultiply02\n\n\n(7.3) Running a set of tests\n\nIt is possible to run a set of JUnit test classes by adding the \"test.name\"\nproperty to the build.properties file. The property specifies an Ant\nincludes pattern for the fileset of test class files to run.\n\nThe default value is \"**/Test*.java\", so all test classes are being\nexecuted (with few exceptions - see build.xml for several exclude patterns).\n\nYou can include multiple patterns by concatenating them with a comma (\",\")\nas the separator.\n\nFor example:\n\n    test.name=**/TestSsl.java,**/TestWebSocketFrameClientSSL.java\n\nYou can exclude specific JUnit test classes by adding the \"test.exclude\"\nproperty to the build.properties file. The property specifies an Ant\nexcludes pattern for the fileset of test class files to exclude form the run.\nThe default value is empty, so no classes are excluded. The syntax is the same\nas for the property \"test.name\".\n\n\n(7.4) Other configuration options\n\n 1. It is possible to configure the directory where JUnit reports are\n written to. It is configured by \"test.reports\" property. The default\n value is\n\n        output/build/logs\n\n 2. It is possible to enable generation of access log file when the tests\n are run. This is off by default and can be enabled by the following\n property:\n\n        test.accesslog=true\n\n The \"access_log.<date>\" file will be written to the same directory as\n JUnit reports,\n\n        output/build/logs\n\n 3. The testsuite respects logging configuration as configured by\n ${tomcat.source}/conf/logging.properties\n\n The log files will be written to the temporary directory used by the\n tests,\n\n        output/test-tmp/logs\n\n 4. It is possible to configure formatter used by JUnit reports.\n Configuration properties are \"junit.formatter.type\",\n \"junit.formatter.extension\" and \"junit.formatter.usefile\".\n\n For example the following property deactivates generation of separate report\n files:\n\n        junit.formatter.usefile=false\n\n 5. It is possible to speed up testing by letting JUnit to run several\n tests in parallel.\n\n This is configured by setting \"test.threads\" property. The recommended\n value is one thread per core.\n\n 6. Optional support is provided for the Cobertura code coverage tool.\n\nNOTE: Cobertura is licensed under GPL v2 with parts of it being under\n      Apache License v1.1. See https://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/ for details.\n      Using it during Tomcat build is optional and is off by default.\n\n Cobertura can be enabled using the following properties:\n\n        test.cobertura=true\n        test.threads=1\n\n Using Cobertura currently requires setting test.threads configuration\n property to the value of 1. Setting that property to a different value\n will deactivate code coverage.\n\n The report files by default are written to\n\n        output/coverage\n\n 7. The performance tests are written to run on reasonably powerful machines\n    (such as a developer may use day to day) assuming no other resource hungry\n    processes are running.\n\n    Performance tests may be an absolute test (how long to complete a number\n    of iterations of an operation or set of operations) or may be a relative\n    test (how long two or more different approaches take to generate the same\n    result). The absolute tests may be destructive in that they run until the\n    system runs out of resources.\n\n    Where there is no benefit in running an absolute performance test as part\n    of a standard test run, the test will be excluded by naming it\n    Tester*Performance.java.\n\n    The relative tests are included as part of a standard test run however,\n    where the assumptions made about host capabilities are  not true (e.g. on\n    CI systems running in virtual machine) the tests may be deactivated by\n    using the following property:\n\n        test.excludePerformance=true\n\n 8. Some tests are require large heaps (e.g. 8GB). The CI systems used by the\n    project either cannot support heaps of this size or do not support them by\n    default. These tests are therefore disabled by default and may be enabled by\n    using the following property:\n\n        test.includeLargeHeap=true\n\n 9. Some tests include checks that the access log valve entries are as expected.\n    These checks include timings. On slower / loaded systems these checks will\n    often fail. The checks may be relaxed by using the following property:\n\n        test.relaxTiming=true\n\n 10. It is known that some platforms (e.g. OSX El Capitan) require IPv4 to\n     be the default for the multicast tests to work. This is configured by\n     the following property:\n\n        java.net.preferIPv4Stack=true\n\n 11. By default the output of unit tests is sent to the console and can be\n     quite verbose. The output can be deactivated by setting the property:\n\n        test.verbose=false\n\n(8) Source code checks\n\n(8.1) Checkstyle\n\nNOTE: Checkstyle is licensed under LGPL. Using Checkstyle during Tomcat\n      build is optional and is off by default.\n\n      See http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/ for more information.\n\nTomcat comes with a Checkstyle configuration that tests its source code\nfor certain conventions, like presence of the license header.\n\nTo enable Checkstyle, add the following property to build.properties file:\n\n    execute.validate=true\n\nOnce Checkstyle is enabled, the check will be performed automatically\nduring the build. The check is run before compilation of the source code.\n\nTo speed-up repeated runs of this check, a cache is configured. The cache\nis located in the following directory:\n\n    output/res/checkstyle\n\nIt is possible to run the check separately by calling the \"validate\"\ntarget. The command is:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant -Dexecute.validate=true validate\n\n\n(8.2) SpotBugs\n\nNOTE: SpotBugs is licensed under LGPL. Using SpotBugs during Tomcat build is\n      optional and is off by default.\n\n      See https://spotbugs.github.io/ for more information.\n\nTo enable SpotBugs, add the following property to build.properties file:\n\n    execute.spotbugs=true\n\nTo compile Tomcat classes and generate a SpotBugs report, call the\n\"spotbugs\" target. For example:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant -Dexecute.spotbugs=true spotbugs\n\nThe report file by default is written to\n\n    output/spotbugs\n\n\n(8.3) End-of-line conventions check\n\nYou usually would not need to run this check. You can skip this section.\n\nApache Tomcat project has convention that all of its textual source files,\nstored in the Git repository, use Unix style LF line endings.\n\nThis test is used by developers to check that the source code adheres to\nthis convention. It verifies that the ends of lines in textual files are\nappropriate. The idea is to run this check regularly and notify developers\nwhen an inconsistency is detected.\n\nThe command to run this test is:\n\n    cd ${tomcat.source}\n    ant validate-eoln\n"

Please note that the Beginner keyword\nis pretty new to the project, so if there aren't any issues in the filter feel\nfree to ask on the [dev list](https://tomcat.apache.org/lists.html#tomcat-dev).\n\n* [Beginner issues](https://bz.apache.org/bugzilla/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&bug_status=NEEDINFO&keywords=Beginner&keywords_type=allwords&list_id=160824&product=Tomcat%207&product=Tomcat%208.5&product=Tomcat%209&query_format=advanced) -\nissues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two to\nresolve.\n\nThe list above shows all bugs that are marked 'Beginner' and are open in the\ncurrently supported Tomcat versions (9.0, 10.1, 11.0 and 12.0).\n\nIf you prefer C over Java, you may also take a look at the tomcat-native and\nTomcat Connectors products in Bugzilla.\n\n### How to Provide Your First Patch\n\nExcited yet? This section will guide you through providing a patch to the\ncommitters of the project for review and acceptance.\n\n##### Choose Your Method of Submission\n\nYou can provide a patch in one of the following ways (in order of preference):\n\n* GitHub Pull Request\n* Patch attachment to the Bugzilla issue\n* Email the patch to the developer list. This is not preferred, but if no bug\nis associated with the patch, or you would like a developer review, an email\nmay be appropriate.\n\n##### Get the Sources\n\nNow that you've chosen how you want to submit a patch, you need to get the\nsource code.\n\n###### Download The Source Distribution\n\nThis method works if you want to submit a patch via email, but\nthe difference in using the sources distribution and a VCS is that you have to\nmanually generate the patch file by using diff. If this is what you want, you\ncan download the sources from the \"Source Code Distributions\" section of the\nDownload Page. There is one such page for every major Tomcat version:\n\n- [Tomcat 11](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-11.cgi)\n- [Tomcat 10](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi)\n- [Tomcat 9](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-90.cgi)\n\n##### Manual Patch Generation\n\nIf you have chosen to attach a patch to the Bugzilla issue (or email\none), then you'll need to download the sources as noted above, make your\ndesired changes and then manually generate your patch using diff (or any\nother tool).\n\n##### GitHub\n\nTo submit a GitHub Pull Request you'll need to fork the\n[repository](https://github.com/apache/tomcat), clone your fork to do the work:\n\n```\n$ git clone https://github.com/$USERNAME/tomcat.git\n```\n\nand then push your changes, and submit a Pull Request via the GitHub UI.\n\n#### Submitting Your Patch!\n\nAfter you've chosen your method of submission, retrieved the sources, and\nfixed the issue it's time to submit your work. At this point, just follow\nthe method of submission you chose earlier.\n\n* GitHub PR - after resolving the issue in your local fork and pushing to your\ncopy of the repository, open a GitHub PR for review.\n* Bugzilla attachment - attach the patch to the Bugzilla issue\n* Email - again, not preferred, but you may send an email to the developer list\nwith a patch attached for review.\n\n#### Waiting For Feedback\n\nIt may take a while for committers to review. Please be patient during this\ntime as all committers are volunteers on the project. If a significant amount\nof time has lapsed since your submission, such as a couple of months, feel free\nto either update your BZ, PR, or email the dev list with a message to bump your\nissue. Sometimes things get lost in all the work and we need a reminder :smile:\n\n## IDE Support\n\nSpecial IDE support for\n[Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/ide/),\n[IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) and\n[NetBeans](https://netbeans.org/)\nis provided through special ant targets:\n\n```bash\nant ide-eclipse\n```\n```bash\nant ide-intellij\n```\n```bash\nant ide-netbeans\n```\n\nJust execute the ant target for your IDE after checking out the sources\nto set up the appropriate configuration files.\nAlso make sure to re-execute the target after switching branches or\nafter pulling upstream changes in order to keep your IDE configurations in sync.\n\n## Style Guide\n\nApache Tomcat has very loosely defined coding conventions, but the following\nguidelines will be useful:\n\n* Use spaces for indenting, not tabs\n* 120 char line width for Java source, 80 char line width for documentation\nsource (.txt, .xml)\n* Java source: { at end of line, 4 space indents\n* XML source: 2 space indents\n\n## Did we miss something?\n\nHave you reviewed this guide and found it lacking? Or are you confused about\nsome particular step? If so, please let us know! Or better yet, submit a PR to\naddress the issue :wink:\n"

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner.

The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n  look for such a notice.\n\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n\n\nFor the Windows Installer component:\n\n    * All NSIS source code, plug-ins, documentation, examples, header files and\n       graphics, with the exception of the compression modules and where\n       otherwise noted, are licensed under the zlib/libpng license.\n    * The zlib compression module for NSIS is licensed under the zlib/libpng\n       license.\n    * The bzip2 compression module for NSIS is licensed under the bzip2 license.\n    * The lzma compression module for NSIS is licensed under the Common Public\n       License version 1.0.\n\nzlib/libpng license\n\nThis software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied warranty.

A Contribution 'originates' from a\nContributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone\nacting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to\nthe Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\nconjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are not\nderivative works of the Program.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents \" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are\nnecessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when\ncombined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,\nincluding all Contributors.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\na) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to\nreproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,\ndistribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such\nderivative works, in source code and object code form.\n\nb) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants\nRecipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under Licensed\nPatents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the\nContribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form.\nThis patent license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\nProgram if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such\naddition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\nLicensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other combinations\nwhich include the Contribution. No hardware per se is licensed hereunder.\n\nc) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the licenses to\nits Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by any\nContributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other intellectual\nproperty rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims any liability to\nRecipient for claims brought by any other entity based on infringement of\nintellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\nrights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole\nresponsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any.\nFor example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient to\ndistribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\nbefore distributing the Program.\n\nd) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient copyright\nrights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license set forth in\nthis Agreement.\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\nA Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under its\nown license agreement, provided that:\n\na) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and\n\nb) its license agreement:\n\ni) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and\nconditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title and\nnon-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and\nfitness for a particular purpose;\n\nii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for\ndamages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential\ndamages, such as lost profits;\n\niii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are offered by\nthat Contributor alone and not by any other party; and\n\niv) states that source code for the Program is available from such Contributor,\nand informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a\nmedium customarily used for software exchange.\n\nWhen the Program is made available in source code form:\n\na) it must be made available under this Agreement; and\n\nb) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the Program.\n\nContributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the\nProgram.\n\nEach Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if\nany, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the\noriginator of the Contribution.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with\nrespect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is\nintended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who\nincludes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner\nwhich does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if\na Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such\nContributor (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify\nevery other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses, damages\nand costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal\nactions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the\nextent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in\nconnection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product\noffering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\nrelating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order\nto qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial\nContributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to\ncontrol, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in\nany such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product\noffering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that\nCommercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties\nrelated to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such\nCommercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the\nCommercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other\nContributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court\nrequires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial\nContributor must pay those damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN\n\"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,\nNON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each\nRecipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\ndistributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of\nrights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of\nprogram errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data,\nprograms or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY\nCONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,\nSPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,\nSTRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY\nOUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS\nGRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable\nlaw, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the\nterms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such\nprovision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such\nprovision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with respect to\na patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a\nlawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that Contributor to such Recipient\nunder this Agreement shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed. In\naddition, if Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program\nitself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or hardware)\ninfringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights granted under\nSection 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to\ncomply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does\nnot cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of\nsuch noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,\nRecipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as\nreasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement\nand any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and\nsurvive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in\norder to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be\nmodified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to\npublish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.\nNo one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.\nIBM is the initial Agreement Steward. IBM may assign the responsibility to serve\nas the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version of the\nAgreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\nContributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the Agreement\nunder which it was received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement\nis published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated in Sections\n2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the\nintellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether\nexpressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not\nexpressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.\n\nThis Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the\nintellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party to this\nAgreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more than one year\nafter the cause of action arose. Each party waives its rights to a jury trial in\nany resulting litigation.\n\nSpecial exception for LZMA compression module\n\nIgor Pavlov and Amir Szekely, the authors of the LZMA compression module for\nNSIS, expressly permit you to statically or dynamically link your code (or bind\nby name) to the files from the LZMA compression module for NSIS without\nsubjecting your linked code to the terms of the Common Public license version\n1.0.

No existing interface method will be\nremoved or changed although it may be deprecated.\n- org.apache.catalina.* (excluding sub-packages)\n\nNote: As Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR@ matures, the above list will be added to. The list is not\n      considered complete at this time.\n\nThe remaining classes are considered part of the Tomcat internals and may change\nwithout notice between point releases.\n\n\n=============\nBundled APIs:\n=============\nA standard installation of Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@ makes all of the following APIs available\nfor use by web applications (by placing them in \"lib\"):\n* annotations-api.jar (Annotations package)\n* catalina.jar (Tomcat Catalina implementation)\n* catalina-ant.jar (Tomcat Catalina Ant tasks)\n* catalina-ha.jar (High availability package)\n* catalina-ssi.jar (Server-side Includes module)\n* catalina-storeconfig.jar (Generation of XML configuration from current state)\n* catalina-tribes.jar (Group communication)\n* ecj-@JDT_VERSION@.jar (Eclipse JDT Java compiler)\n* el-api.jar (EL 6.0 API)\n* jasper.jar (Jasper 2 Compiler and Runtime)\n* jasper-el.jar (Jasper 2 EL implementation)\n* jsp-api.jar (JSP 4.0 API)\n* servlet-api.jar (Servlet 6.1 API)\n* tomcat-api.jar (Interfaces shared by Catalina and Jasper)\n* tomcat-coyote.jar (Tomcat connectors and utility classes)\n* tomcat-dbcp.jar (package renamed database connection pool based on Commons DBCP 2)\n* tomcat-jdbc.jar (Tomcat's database connection pooling solution)\n* tomcat-jni.jar (Interface to the native component of the APR/native connector)\n* tomcat-util.jar (Various utilities)\n* tomcat-websocket.jar (WebSocket 2.2 implementation)\n* websocket-api.jar (WebSocket 2.2 API)\n* websocket-client-api.jar (WebSocket 2.2 Client API)\n\nYou can make additional APIs available to all of your web applications by\nputting unpacked classes into a \"classes\" directory (not created by default),\nor by placing them in JAR files in the \"lib\" directory.\n\nTo override the XML parser implementation or interfaces, use the upgradeable\nmodules feature.\n\n\n================================================================\nWeb application reloading and static fields in shared libraries:\n================================================================\nSome shared libraries (many are part of the JDK) keep references to objects\ninstantiated by the web application. To avoid class loading related problems\n(ClassCastExceptions, messages indicating that the classloader\nis stopped, etc.), the shared libraries state should be reinitialized.\n\nSomething which might help is to avoid putting classes which would be\nreferenced by a shared static field in the web application classloader,\nand putting them in the shared classloader instead (JARs should be put in the\n\"lib\" folder, and classes should be put in the \"classes\" folder).\n\n\n============================\nSymlinking static resources:\n============================\nBy default, Unix symlinks will not work when used in a web application to link\nresources located outside the web application root directory.\n\nThis behavior is optional, and the \"allowLinking\" flag may be used to deactivate\nthe check.\n\n\n==============================\nViewing the Tomcat Change Log:\n==============================\nThe full change log is available from https://tomcat.apache.org and is also\nincluded in the documentation web application.\n\n\n=============================\nCryptographic software notice\n=============================\nThis distribution includes cryptographic software.

You can either\n\n  a)  Do the full \"release\" build and find the created distribution in the\n      \"output/release\" directory and then proceed with unpacking as above, or\n\n  b)  Do a simple build and use the \"output/build\" directory as\n      \"CATALINA_HOME\".  Be warned that there are some differences between the\n      contents of the \"output/build\" directory and a full \"release\"\n      distribution.\n\n\n(3) Configure Environment Variables\n\nTomcat is a Java application and does not use environment variables directly.\nEnvironment variables are used by the Tomcat startup scripts. The scripts use\nthe environment variables to prepare the command that starts Tomcat.\n\n(3.1) Set CATALINA_HOME (required) and CATALINA_BASE (optional)\n\nThe CATALINA_HOME environment variable should be set to the location of the\nroot directory of the \"binary\" distribution of Tomcat.\n\nThe Tomcat startup scripts have some logic to set this variable\nautomatically if it is absent, based on the location of the startup script\nin *nix and on the current directory in Windows. That logic might not work\nin all circumstances, so setting the variable explicitly is recommended.\n\nThe CATALINA_BASE environment variable specifies location of the root\ndirectory of the \"active configuration\" of Tomcat. It is optional. It\ndefaults to be equal to CATALINA_HOME.\n\nUsing distinct values for the CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE variables is\nrecommended to simplify further upgrades and maintenance. It is documented\nin the \"Multiple Tomcat Instances\" section below.\n\n\n(3.2) Set JRE_HOME or JAVA_HOME (required)\n\nThese variables are used to specify location of a Java Runtime\nEnvironment or of a Java Development Kit that is used to start Tomcat.\n\nThe JRE_HOME variable is used to specify location of a JRE. The JAVA_HOME\nvariable is used to specify location of a JDK.\n\nUsing JAVA_HOME provides access to certain additional startup options that\nare not allowed when JRE_HOME is used.\n\nIf both JRE_HOME and JAVA_HOME are specified, JRE_HOME is used.\n\nThe recommended place to specify these variables is a \"setenv\" script. See\nbelow.\n\n\n(3.3) Other variables (optional)\n\nOther environment variables exist, besides the four described above.\nSee the comments at the top of catalina.bat or catalina.sh scripts for\nthe list and a description of each of them.\n\nOne frequently used variable is CATALINA_OPTS. It allows specification of\nadditional options for the java command that starts Tomcat.\n\nSee the Java documentation for the options that affect the Java Runtime\nEnvironment.\n\nSee the \"System Properties\" page in the Tomcat Configuration Reference for\nthe system properties that are specific to Tomcat.\n\nA similar variable is JAVA_OPTS. It is used less frequently. It allows\nspecification of options that are used both to start and to stop Tomcat as well\nas for other commands.\n\nNote: Do not use JAVA_OPTS to specify memory limits. You do not need much\nmemory for a small process that is used to stop Tomcat. Those settings\nbelong to CATALINA_OPTS.\n\nAnother frequently used variable is CATALINA_PID (on *nix only). It\nspecifies the location of the file where process id of the forked Tomcat\njava process will be written. This setting is optional. It will activate\nthe following features:\n\n *  better protection against duplicate start attempts and\n *  allows forceful termination of Tomcat process when it does not react to\n    the standard shutdown command.\n\n\n(3.4) Using the \"setenv\" script (optional, recommended)\n\nApart from CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, all environment variables can\nbe specified in the \"setenv\" script. The script is placed either into\nCATALINA_BASE/bin or into CATALINA_HOME/bin directory and is named\nsetenv.bat (on Windows) or setenv.sh (on *nix). The file has to be\nreadable.\n\nBy default the setenv script file is absent. If the script file is present\nboth in CATALINA_BASE and in CATALINA_HOME, the one in CATALINA_BASE is\npreferred.\n\nFor example, to configure the JRE_HOME and CATALINA_PID variables you can\ncreate the following script file:\n\nOn Windows, %CATALINA_BASE%\\bin\\setenv.bat:\n\n  set \"JRE_HOME=%ProgramFiles%\\Java\\jre@MIN_JAVA_VERSION@\"\n  exit /b 0\n\nOn *nix, $CATALINA_BASE/bin/setenv.sh:\n\n  JRE_HOME=/usr/java/latest\n  CATALINA_PID=\"/run/tomcat.pid\"\n\n\nThe CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE variables cannot be configured in the\nsetenv script, because they are used to locate that file.\n\nAll the environment variables described here and the \"setenv\" script are\nused only if you use the standard scripts to launch Tomcat. For example, if\nyou have installed Tomcat as a service on Windows, the service wrapper\nlaunches Java directly and does not use the script files.\n\n\n(4) Start Up Tomcat\n\n(4.1) Tomcat can be started by executing one of the following commands:\n\n  On Windows:\n\n      %CATALINA_HOME%\\bin\\startup.bat\n\n    or\n\n      %CATALINA_HOME%\\bin\\catalina.bat start\n\n  On *nix:\n\n      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh\n\n    or\n\n      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh start\n\n(4.2) After startup, the default web applications included with Tomcat will be\n      available by visiting:\n\n      http://localhost:8080/\n\n(4.3) Further information about configuring and running Tomcat can be found in\n      the documentation included here, as well as on the Tomcat web site:\n\n      https://tomcat.apache.org/\n\n\n(5) Shut Down Tomcat\n\n(5.1) Tomcat can be shut down by executing one of the following commands:\n\n  On Windows:\n\n      %CATALINA_HOME%\\bin\\shutdown.bat\n\n    or\n\n      %CATALINA_HOME%\\bin\\catalina.bat stop\n\n  On *nix:\n\n      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/shutdown.sh\n\n    or\n\n      $CATALINA_HOME/bin/catalina.sh stop\n\n==================================================\nAdvanced Configuration - Multiple Tomcat Instances\n==================================================\n\nIn many circumstances, it is desirable to have a single copy of a Tomcat\nbinary distribution shared among multiple users on the same server.  To make\nthis possible, you can set the CATALINA_BASE environment variable to the\ndirectory that contains the files for your 'personal' Tomcat instance.\n\nWhen running with a separate CATALINA_HOME and CATALINA_BASE, the files\nand directories are split as following:\n\nIn CATALINA_BASE:\n\n * bin  - Only the following files:\n\n           * setenv.sh (*nix) or setenv.bat (Windows),\n           * tomcat-juli.jar\n\n          The setenv scripts were described above. The tomcat-juli library\n          is documented in the Logging chapter in the User Guide.\n\n * conf - Server configuration files (typically all of them, including\n          server.xml)\n\n * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below\n\n * logs - Log and output files\n\n * webapps - Automatically loaded web applications\n\n * work - Temporary working directories for web applications\n\n * temp - Directory used by the JVM for temporary files (java.io.tmpdir)\n\n\nIn CATALINA_HOME:\n\n * bin  - Startup and shutdown scripts\n\n          The following files will be used only if they are absent in\n          CATALINA_BASE/bin:\n\n          setenv.sh (*nix), setenv.bat (Windows), tomcat-juli.jar\n\n * lib  - Libraries and classes, as explained below\n\nIn the default configuration the JAR libraries and classes both in\nCATALINA_BASE/lib and in CATALINA_HOME/lib will be added to the common\nclasspath, but the ones in CATALINA_BASE will be added first and thus will\nbe searched first.\n\nThe idea is that you may leave the standard Tomcat libraries in\nCATALINA_HOME/lib and add other ones such as database drivers into\nCATALINA_BASE/lib.\n\nIn general it is advised to never share libraries between web applications,\nbut put them into WEB-INF/lib directories inside the applications. See\nClassloading documentation in the User Guide for details.\n\n\nIt might be useful to note that the values of CATALINA_HOME and\nCATALINA_BASE can be referenced in the XML configuration files processed\nby Tomcat as ${catalina.home} and ${catalina.base} respectively.\n\nFor example, the standard manager web application can be kept in\nCATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager and loaded into CATALINA_BASE by copying\nits deployment descriptor into the desired virtual host:\n\n * Copy the CATALINA_HOME/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml\n   file as CATALINA_BASE/conf/Catalina/localhost/manager.xml\n\n * Add docBase attribute as shown below.\n\nThe file will look like the following:\n\n  <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n  <Context docBase=\"${catalina.home}/webapps/manager\"\n    antiResourceLocking=\"false\" privileged=\"true\" >\n    <Valve className=\"org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve\"\n         allow=\"127\\.0\\.0\\.1\" />\n    <Manager sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter=\"java\\.lang\\.(?:Boolean|Integer|Long|Number|String)|org\\.apache\\.catalina\\.filters\\.CsrfPreventionFilter\\$LruCache(?:\\$1)?|java\\.util\\.(?:Linked)?HashMap\"/>\n  </Context>\n\nSee Deployer chapter in User Guide and Context and Host chapters in the\nConfiguration Reference for more information on contexts and web\napplication deployment.\n\n\n================\nTroubleshooting\n================\n\nThere are only really 2 things likely to go wrong during the stand-alone\nTomcat install:\n\n(1) The most common hiccup is when another web server (or any process for that\n    matter) has laid claim to port 8080.  This is the default HTTP port that\n    Tomcat attempts to bind to at startup.  To change this, open the file:\n\n       $CATALINA_HOME/conf/server.xml\n\n    and search for '8080'.  Change it to a port that isn't in use, and is\n    greater than 1024, as ports less than or equal to 1024 require superuser\n    access to bind under UNIX.\n\n    Restart Tomcat and you're in business.  Be sure that you replace the \"8080\"\n    in the URL you're using to access Tomcat.  For example, if you change the\n    port to 1977, you would request the URL http://localhost:1977/ in your\n    browser.\n\n(2) The 'localhost' machine isn't found.  This could happen if you're behind a\n    proxy.  If that's the case, make sure the proxy configuration for your\n    browser knows that you shouldn't be going through the proxy to access the\n    \"localhost\".\n\n    In Firefox, this is under Tools/Preferences -> Advanced/Network ->\n    Connection -> Settings..., and in Internet Explorer it is Tools ->\n    Internet Options -> Connections -> LAN Settings.\n\n\n====================\nOptional Components\n====================\n\nThe following optional components may be included with the Apache Tomcat binary\ndistribution. If they are not included, you can install them separately.\n\n 1. Apache Tomcat Native library\n\n 2. Apache Commons Daemon service launcher\n\nBoth of them are implemented in C language and as such have to be compiled\ninto binary code. The binary code will be specific for a platform and CPU\narchitecture and it must match the Java Runtime Environment executables\nthat will be used to launch Tomcat.\n\nThe Windows-specific binary distributions of Apache Tomcat include binary\nfiles for these components. On other platforms you would have to look for\nbinary versions elsewhere or compile them yourself.\n\nIf you are new to Tomcat, do not bother with these components to start with.\nIf you do use them, do not forget to read their documentation.\n\n\nApache Tomcat Native library\n-----------------------------\n\nIt is a library that allows to use the OpenSSL variant of the TLS implementation\nfor the HTTP connector in Apache Tomcat. It is built around OpenSSL and Apache\nPortable Runtime (APR) libraries.\n\nThis feature was especially important in the old days when Java performance\nwas poor. It is less important nowadays, but it is still used and respected\nby many. See Tomcat documentation for more details.\n\nFor further reading:\n\n - Apache Tomcat documentation\n\n    * Documentation for APR/Native library in the Tomcat User's Guide\n\n      https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-@VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@-doc/apr.html\n\n    * Documentation for the HTTP connector in the Tomcat Configuration Reference\n\n      https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-@VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@-doc/config/http.html\n\n - Apache Tomcat Native project home\n\n      https://tomcat.apache.org/native-doc/\n\n - Other projects\n\n    * OpenSSL\n\n      https://www.openssl.org/\n\n    * Apache Portable Runtime\n\n      https://apr.apache.org/\n\n    * Apache HTTP Server\n\n      https://httpd.apache.org/\n\nTo deactivate Apache Tomcat Native library:\n\n - To deactivate Apache Tomcat Native library when it is installed, or\n - To remove the warning that is logged during Tomcat startup when the\n   library is not installed:\n\n   Edit the \"conf/server.xml\" file and remove \"AprLifecycleListener\" from\n   it.\n\nThe binary file of Apache Tomcat Native library is usually named\n\n  - \"tcnative-2.dll\" on Windows\n  - \"libtcnative-2.so\" on *nix systems\n\n\nApache Commons Daemon\n----------------------\n\nApache Commons Daemon project provides wrappers that can be used to\ninstall Apache Tomcat as a service on Windows or as a daemon on *nix\nsystems.\n\nThe Windows-specific implementation of Apache Commons Daemon is called\n\"procrun\". The *nix-specific one is called \"jsvc\".\n\nFor further reading:\n\n - Apache Commons Daemon project\n\n      https://commons.apache.org/daemon/\n\n - Apache Tomcat documentation\n\n    * Installing Apache Tomcat\n\n      https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-@VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@-doc/setup.html\n\n    * Windows Service How-To\n\n      https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-@VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@-doc/windows-service-howto.html\n\nThe binary files of Apache Commons Daemon in Apache Tomcat distributions\nfor Windows are named:\n\n  - \"tomcat@VERSION_MAJOR@.exe\"\n  - \"tomcat@VERSION_MAJOR@w.exe\"\n\nThese files are renamed copies of \"prunsrv.exe\" and \"prunmgr.exe\" from\nApache Commons Daemon distribution. The file names have a meaning: they are\nused as the service name to register the service in Windows, as well as the\nkey name to store distinct configuration for this installation of\n\"procrun\". If you would like to install several instances of Tomcat @VERSION_MAJOR_MINOR@\nin parallel, you have to further rename those files, using the same naming\nscheme.\n"
