Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"

No one from the dev team makes TikTok videos. \n- The official Twitter for PojavLauncher is [@PLaunchTeam](https://twitter.com/PLaunchTeam). Any others (most notably @PojavLauncher) are fake.\n\n## Navigation\n- [Introduction](#introduction)  \n- [Getting PojavLauncher](#getting-pojavlauncher)\n- [Building](#building) \n- [Current status](#current-status) \n- [License](#license) \n- [Contributing](#contributing) \n- [Credits & Third party components and their licenses](#credits--third-party-components-and-their-licenses-if-available)\n\n## Introduction \n* PojavLauncher is a Minecraft: Java Edition launcher for Android and iOS based on [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk). \n* This launcher can launch almost all available Minecraft versions ranging from rd-132211 to 1.21 snapshots (including Combat Test versions). \n* Modding via Forge and Fabric are also supported. \n* This repository contains source code for Android. \n* For iOS/iPadOS, check out [PojavLauncher_iOS](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher_iOS).\n\n## Getting PojavLauncher\n\nYou can get PojavLauncher via three methods:\n\n1. You can get the prebuilt app from [stable releases](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/releases) or [automatic builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/actions).\n\n2. You can get it from Google Play by clicking on this badge:\n[![Google Play](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.kdt.pojavlaunch)\n\n3. You can [build](#building) from source.\n## Building\nIf you want to build from source code, follow the steps below.\n### Java Runtime Environment (JRE)\n- JRE for Android is [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/openjdk-multiarch-jdk8u), and the build script is [here](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch).\n- Follow build instruction on build script [README.md](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/blob/buildjre8/README.md).\n- You can also get [CI auto builds](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/android-openjdk-build-multiarch/actions) if you are lazy or are failing to build it for some reason.\n* Either get the `jre8-pojav` artifact from auto builds, or split all artifacts by yourself:</br>\n   - Get JREs for all of 4 supported architectures (arm, arm64, x86, x86_64) </br> \n      - Split JRE into parts:</br>\n                Platform-independent: .jar files, libraries, configs, etc...</br>\n                Platform-dependent: .so files, etc...</br>\n        - Create:</br>\n                A file named `universal.tar.xz` with all platform-independent files</br>\n                4 files named `bin-<arch>.tar.xz` with all platform-dependent files per-architecture</br>\n        - Put these in the `assets/components/jre/` folder</br>\n        - (If needed) update the Version file with the current date</br>\n\n### LWJGL\nThe build instructions for the custom LWJGL are available over the [LWJGL repository](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3)\n\n### The Launcher\n- Because languages are auto-added by Crowdin, you need to run the language list generator before building. In the project directory, run:\n\n* On Linux, Mac OS:\n```\nchmod +x scripts/languagelist_updater.sh\nbash scripts/languagelist_updater.sh\n```\n* On Windows:\n```\nscripts\\languagelist_updater.bat\n```\nThen, run these commands ~~or build using Android Studio~~.\n\n* Build GLFW stub:\n```\n./gradlew :jre_lwjgl3glfw:build\n```       \n* Build the launcher\n```\n./gradlew :app_pojavlauncher:assembleDebug\n```\n(Replace `gradlew` with `gradlew.bat` if you are building on Windows).\n\n## Current status\n- [x] ~~OpenJDK 9 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64.~~ Replaced by JRE8.\n- [x] OpenJDK 8 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64\n- [x] OpenJDK 17 Mobile port: ARM32, ARM64, x86, x86_64\n- [x] Headless mod installer\n- [x] Mod installer with GUI. Used `Caciocavallo` project for AWT without X11.\n- [x] OpenGL in OpenJDK environment\n- [x] OpenAL (works on most devices)\n- [x] Support for Minecraft 1.12.2 and below. Used [lwjglx](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjglx), a LWJGL2 compatibility layer for LWJGL3.\n- [x] Support for Minecraft 1.13 and above. Used [GLFW stub](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3-glfw-java).\n- [x] Support for Minecraft 1.17 (22w13a to be exact) and above. Used [Holy GL4ES](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/gl4es-114-extra)\n- [x] Game surface zooming.\n- [x] New input pipe rewritten to native code to boost performance.\n- [x] Rewritten entire controls system (thanks to @Mathias-Boulay)\n- [ ] More to come!\n\n## Known Issues\n- Controller mods aren't working.\n- Random crashes could happen very often on Android 5.x when loading the game or joining a world.\n- With big modpacks textures could be messed up\n- Probably more, that's why we have a bug tracker ;) \n\n## License\n- PojavLauncher is licensed under [GNU LGPLv3](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/PojavLauncher/blob/v3_openjdk/LICENSE).\n\n## Contributing\nContributions are welcome! We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. For example, you can help the wiki shape up. You can help the [translation](https://crowdin.com/project/pojavlauncher) too!\n\n\nAny code change to this repository (or iOS) should be submitted as a pull request. The description should explain what the code does and give steps to execute it.\n\n## Credits & Third party components and their licenses (if available)\n- [Boardwalk](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk) (JVM Launcher): Unknown License/[Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/zhuowei/Boardwalk/blob/master/LICENSE) or GNU GPLv2.\n- Android Support Libraries: [Apache License 2.0](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/prebuilts/maven_repo/android/+/master/NOTICE.txt).\n- [GL4ES](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/gl4es): [MIT License](https://github.com/ptitSeb/gl4es/blob/master/LICENSE).<br>\n- [OpenJDK](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/openjdk-multiarch-jdk8u): [GNU GPLv2 License](https://openjdk.java.net/legal/gplv2+ce.html).<br>\n- [LWJGL3](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjgl3): [BSD-3 License](https://github.com/LWJGL/lwjgl3/blob/master/LICENSE.md).\n- [LWJGLX](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/lwjglx) (LWJGL2 API compatibility layer for LWJGL3): unknown license.<br>\n- [Mesa 3D Graphics Library](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/mesa/mesa): [MIT License](https://docs.mesa3d.org/license.html).\n- [pro-grade](https://github.com/pro-grade/pro-grade) (Java sandboxing security manager): [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/pro-grade/pro-grade/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\n- [bhook](https://github.com/bytedance/bhook) (Used for exit code trapping): [MIT license](https://github.com/bytedance/bhook/blob/main/LICENSE).\n- [libepoxy](https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy): [MIT License](https://github.com/anholt/libepoxy/blob/master/COPYING).\n- [virglrenderer](https://github.com/PojavLauncherTeam/virglrenderer): [MIT License](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/virgl/virglrenderer/-/blob/master/COPYING).\n- Thanks to [MCHeads](https://mc-heads.net) for providing Minecraft avatars.\n"

If your /bin/sh is\n#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or\n#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole\n#       command line, like:\n#\n#           ksh Gradle\n#\n#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script\n#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:\n#         * functions;\n#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,\n#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;\n#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;\n#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».\n#\n#   Important for patching:\n#\n#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided\n#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.\n#\n#       The \"traditional\" practice of packing multiple parameters into a\n#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security\n#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating\n#       options in \"$@\", and eventually passing that to Java.\n#\n#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,\n#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;\n#       see the in-line comments for details.\n#\n#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,\n#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.\n#\n#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template\n#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/subprojects/plugins/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt\n#       within the Gradle project.\n#\n#       You can find Gradle at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/.\n#\n##############################################################################\n\n# Attempt to set APP_HOME\n\n# Resolve links: $0 may be a link\napp_path=$0\n\n# Need this for daisy-chained symlinks.\nwhile\n    APP_HOME=${app_path%\"${app_path##*/}\"}  # leaves a trailing /; empty if no leading path\n    [ -h \"$app_path\" ]\ndo\n    ls=$( ls -ld \"$app_path\" )\n    link=${ls#*' -> '}\n    case $link in             #(\n      /*)   app_path=$link ;; #(\n      *)    app_path=$APP_HOME$link ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n# This is normally unused\n# shellcheck disable=SC2034\nAPP_BASE_NAME=${0##*/}\n# Discard cd standard output in case $CDPATH is set (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25036)\nAPP_HOME=$( cd \"${APP_HOME:-./}\" > /dev/null && pwd -P ) || exit\n\n# Use the maximum available, or set MAX_FD != -1 to use that value.\nMAX_FD=maximum\n\nwarn () {\n    echo \"$*\"\n} >&2\n\ndie () {\n    echo\n    echo \"$*\"\n    echo\n    exit 1\n} >&2\n\n# OS specific support (must be 'true' or 'false').\ncygwin=false\nmsys=false\ndarwin=false\nnonstop=false\ncase \"$( uname )\" in                #(\n  CYGWIN* )         cygwin=true  ;; #(\n  Darwin* )         darwin=true  ;; #(\n  MSYS* | MINGW* )  msys=true    ;; #(\n  NONSTOP* )        nonstop=true ;;\nesac\n\nCLASSPATH=$APP_HOME/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar\n\n\n# Determine the Java command to use to start the JVM.\nif [ -n \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n    if [ -x \"$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\" ] ; then\n        # IBM's JDK on AIX uses strange locations for the executables\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\n    else\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\n    fi\n    if [ ! -x \"$JAVACMD\" ] ; then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory: $JAVA_HOME\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nelse\n    JAVACMD=java\n    if ! command -v java >/dev/null 2>&1\n    then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# Increase the maximum file descriptors if we can.\nif ! \"$cygwin\" && ! \"$darwin\" && ! \"$nonstop\" ; then\n    case $MAX_FD in #(\n      max*)\n        # In POSIX sh, ulimit -H is undefined.
