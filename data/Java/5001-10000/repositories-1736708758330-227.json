If you would like to contribute something, or simply want to hack on the code this document should help you get started.\n\n### Sign the Contributor License Agreement\n\nBefore we accept a non-trivial patch or pull request we will need you to sign the Contributor License Agreement. Signing the contributor’s agreement does not grant anyone commit rights to the main repository, but it does mean that we can accept your contributions, and you will get an author credit if we do. Active contributors might be asked to join the core team, and given the ability to merge pull requests.\n\nTo get started, [sign the Contributor License Agreement](https://www.clahub.com/agreements/alipay/SoloPi).\n\n### Code Conventions\n\nNone of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.\n\n1. Make sure all new `.java` files to have a simple Javadoc class comment with at least an `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for.\n2. Add the ASF license header comment to all new `.java` files (copy from existing files in the project)\n3. Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.java` files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).\n4. Add some Javadocs.\n5. When writing a commit message please follow [these conventions](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html), if you are fixing an existing issue please add Fixes gh-XXXX at the end of the commit message (where XXXX is the issue number).\n"

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

[![TesterHome](https://img.shields.io/badge/TTF-TesterHome-2955C5.svg)](https://testerhome.com/opensource_projects/82)\n\n### English Version: [README](./README_eng.md)\n\n> SoloPi是一个无线化、非侵入式的Android自动化工具，公测版拥有录制回放、性能测试、一机多控三项主要功能，能为测试开发人员节省宝贵时间。\n> SoloPi新增鸿蒙版本，欢迎大家试用，切到 solopi-harmony分支\n\n\n### 功能特性\n\n#### 录制回放\n\n![录制回放](assets/replay.gif)\n\n**[游戏录制回放使用视频](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_e29b5f/afts/file/A*ym07T6nACDIAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ)**\n\n**[Native应用录制回放使用视频](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/basement_prod/3472d35c-bd57-4c82-8112-5dcde42fcb32.mov)**\n\nSoloPi拥有录制操作的能力，用户只需要通过SoloPi执行用例步骤，SoloPi就能够将用户的操作记录下来，并且支持在各个设备上进行回放，这一切都能够在手机上独立完成。详见[录制回放](../../wikis/RecordCase)一篇。\n\nSoloPi JSON 可以转化为其他自动化脚本，目前支持 Appium 和 Macaca ，可以前往 https://github.com/soloPi/SoloPi-Convertor 下载体验，欢迎Watch、Star、Fork 三连。\n\n#### 性能工具\n\n![性能工具](assets/performance.gif)\n\n**[性能工具使用视频](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/basement_prod/1996390b-9ec8-4046-8ce8-459afa05d6c5.mov)**\n\n**[响应耗时计算使用视频](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/basement_prod/4e82ca85-13fc-4de2-82ff-a9079344f5ef.mov)**\n\nSoloPi能够记录待测应用的各项指标，你可以在悬浮窗中观察实时更新的数据，也可以对性能数据进行录制，在录制结束后查看图表；同时，SoloPi还支持性能加压，能够对CPU、内存与网络环境进行限制，复现应用在性能较差、网络环境不佳场景下的表现。\n\n除了常规性能指标，SoloPi还提供了启动耗时计算工具，测试同学只需要点击两次按钮，就可以得到最贴近用户体验的启动耗时数据。同时，启动耗时计算工具还可以通过广播调用，可以非常方便的与UI自动化测试打通。详见[性能工具](../../wikis/Performance)一篇。\n\n#### 一机多控\n\n![一机多控](assets/oneToMany.gif)\n\n**[一机多控使用视频](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/basement_prod/971b5467-3db0-4781-86e3-15b3907323f6.mov)**\n\nSoloPi支持通过操作一台主机设备来控制多台从机设备，不需要在各个设备上分别进行重复冗杂的兼容性测试，能够极大提升兼容性测试的效率。详见[一机多控](../../wikis/OneToMany)一篇。\n\n\n\n### 构建\n\n> 开源部分包含录制回放与性能测试工具，一机多控功能由于稳定性原因暂时我们还没有开源，后续我们会继续推进。\n\n#### 编译环境：\n\n- macOS 10.14.3\n- Android Studio 4.0\n- Gradle 6.1.1\n- CMake 3.6/3.10均可\n- Ndk 16\n- TargetApi 29\n- MinimumApi 18\n- **注意，构建时请将Android Studio的instant run功能关闭，否则打出来的安装包会无法使用**\n\n\n\n### 快速开始\n\n#### 下载配置Android SDK路径\n\n   前往<https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads>下载对应系统版本的SDK Platform Tools，解压好后在系统环境变量中添加环境变量`ANDROID_SDK=${sdk解压路径}`。你也可以参考网上的一些adb配置文档进行准备，比如 [https://sspai.com/post/40471](https://sspai.com/post/40471)\n\n> 对于Windows 10以上，配置完环境变量后就可以在新开启的命令行中生效，对于较老版本的Windows系统，需要重启PC才能生效，对于Linux和macOS系统，请通过`echo $ANDROID_SDK`的方式检验是否生效。\n\n#### 开启手机的开发者模式\n\n   请打开手机设置应用，在`关于手机->软件信息`菜单下，连续点击`编译编号`一项7次，系统会提示`您已进入开发者模式`或者类似文案（不同的系统版本开发者模式开启方式略有不同）。\n\n   回到设置应用根页面，可以看到`开发者选项`一项，开启`USB调试`功能。\n\n#### 常见问题\n\n   ** 如果使用过程中有遇到问题，可以先去[FAQ](../../wiki/FAQ)查找是否有解决方法 **\n\n   对于VIVO设备，如果在开发者选项中包含“USB安全操作”，需要手动进行开启，否则录制回放与一机多控功能可能会无法正常操作\n\n   对于小米设备，需要开启开发者选项中的`USB安装`与`USB调试（安全设置）`，否则录制回放与一机多控功能会无法正常操作；此外，还需要手动开启SoloPi应用权限中的`后台弹出界面`选项，否则无法正常使用\n\n   对于魅族设备，如果待测应用属于支付、金融类应用，需要在手机管家中关闭安全支付功能，否则录制回放与一机多控功能可能会无法正常操作\n\n   对于华为设备，需要开启开发者选项中的 `\"仅充电\"模式下允许ADB调试`，否则断开USB线后会提示adb调试中断\n\n   对于OPPO设备，系统会10分钟自动断开USB调试，导致SoloPi不可用。如果想要保持调试稳定，需要将设备连接到电脑\n   \n   **如果设备有安全输入法，请前往`系统设置->输入法`关闭安全输入法，否则例如密码等一些输入框无法正常输入**\n\n#### 连接设备并开启wifi调试端口\n\n   请先连接设备到PC，通过下方命令检查设备是否与电脑建立好连接。\n\n   连接时，您的设备上会提示`是否允许USB调试`，请选择确定。\n\n   Windows：\n\n```bash\n   %ANDROID_SDK%\\platform-tools\\adb.exe devices\n```\n\n   macOS或Linux：\n\n```shell\n   $ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb devices\n```\n\n   如果命令行显示出对应的设备号（如下图所示），则表示连接成功。\n\n   ![建立连接](../../wiki/FirstUse/genConnection.png)\n\n> 对于Windows系统，需要安装Android设备的驱动程序才可以连接成功，可以前往手机厂商官网下载安装对应的驱动程序（通常厂商会将驱动程序集成在手机管家程序中，可以通过下载安装手机管家配置驱动）\n\n   如果显示的不是`device`，请确认下您的设备是否已经安装好驱动，并且允许了USB调试，部分手机需要将连接模式设置为`传输图片（MTP）`模式才可正常连接。\n\n   单机场景\n\n   Windows：\n\n```bash\n   %ANDROID_SDK%\\platform-tools\\adb.exe tcpip 5555\n```\n\n   macOS或Linux：\n\n```shell\n   $ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb tcpip 5555\n```\n\n   通常设备会显示`restarting in TCP mode port: 5555`来提示手机已开启无线ADB调试模式。\n\n> 请确保设备处于安全的网络环境，不要随意允许ADB调试请求，以免给您带来不必要的损失。\n\n   多机场景\n\n   在设备号列表中找到您需要使用的设备，请记录下`device`字段之前的一段字母数字组合，这个是手机的序列号。\n\n   Windows：\n\n```bash\n   %ANDROID_SDK%\\platform-tools\\adb.exe -s ${之前记录的序列号} tcpip 5555\n```\n\n   macOS或Linux：\n\n```shell\n   $ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb -s ${之前记录的序列号} tcpip 5555\n```\n\n**下载打包好的SoloPi APK（SoloPi.apk文件），或者clone源码在本地编译，具体在SoloPi中的操作可以参考： [第一次使用](../../wikis/FirstUse)**\n\n\n\n### 文档\n\n- 如果你是第一次使用SoloPi，推荐你先了解SoloPi的一些[使用注意事项](../../wikis/FirstUse)\n- Wiki文档： [Home](../../wikis/home)\n\n\n\n### 代码导读\n\n- app： 应用业务逻辑。\n- shared:

The Beta version has 3 main features: record and replay, performance testing, multi-device compatibility testing(OneToMany).\n\n### [Features](#1)<br/>\n### [Getting started](#2)<br/>\n### [Folders and description](#3)<br/>\n### [Contributing](#4)<br/>\n### [Attributions](#5)<br/>\n### [License](#6)<br/>\n### [Disclaimer](#7)<br/>\n\n\n## <span id=\"1\">Features</span>\n\n### 1. Record and replay\n\nSoloPi captures all actions performed during tesing sessions so that issues can be identified and resolved more quickly. The recording can be played on any devices. All these actions can be done on just one single phone.\n\n![Recording playback](assets/replay.gif)\n\nThe video tutorial:\n\n**[Record the testing on a mobile game.](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/mdn/rms_e29b5f/afts/file/A*ym07T6nACDIAAAAAAAAAAABkARQnAQ)**\n\n**[Record the testing on a native phone app.](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/basement_prod/3472d35c-bd57-4c82-8112-5dcde42fcb32.mov)**\n\n\n### 2. Performance testing\n\n* SoloPi is able to record and show the app's performance data such as CPU, memory, internet speed while do the testing. The performance window with selected testing metrics will float on top. After testing, you can check each testing parameter with generated data graphs.\n\n* Besides, SoloPi can change testing environment to simulate certain situations. For instance, slow down the internet speed to simulate a situation when the internet is bad while using the app.\n\n* SoloPi also add a function to calculate app launch time. This tool to the most extent, shows the actual launch time. This calculator function can be incorporated with UI automatic tests by sending broadcast messages.\n\n![Performance analysis](assets/performance.gif)\n\nThe video tutorial:\n\n**[Use the performance analysis function](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/basement_prod/1996390b-9ec8-4046-8ce8-459afa05d6c5.mov)**\n\n**[Use the launch time calculator](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/basement_prod/4e82ca85-13fc-4de2-82ff-a9079344f5ef.mov)**\n\n### 3. Multi-device compatibility testing\n\nSoloPi supports simultaneous multi-device compatibility testing which is controlled by one device. So it enormously improves the efficiency of testing on different devices.\n\n![Multi-device testing](assets/oneToMany.gif)\n\nThe video tutorial:\n\n**[Simultaneous multi-device testing](https://gw.alipayobjects.com/os/basement_prod/971b5467-3db0-4781-86e3-15b3907323f6.mov)**\n\n## <span id=\"2\">Getting started</span>\n\n> Open source SoloPi excludes the multi-device compatibility testing feature since it's still unstable.\n\n### 1. Establishing a build environment\n\n- macOS 10.14.3\n- Android Studio 3.2\n- **Gradle 4.4（Upgrading is not recommended.）**\n- **CMake 3.6.4111459（Upgrading is not recommended.）**\n- Ndk 15.2.4203819\n- TargetApi 25\n- MinimumApi 18\n- **Note: Turn off instant run function in Android Studio. Otherwise the app does not work.**\n\n### 2. Downloading and setting Android SDK path\n\n- Download SDK Platform [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads).\n\n- Unzip it and add the path to the system environment variable `ANDROID_SDK=${sdk path}` . You can also refer to articles such as how to set adb system environment variable.\n\n**NOTE:**\nFor system above Windows 10, it takes effect immediately in a new command line window, while for older versions of system, you need to restart the computer. For Linux and MacOS, you can test if it works with `echo $ANDROID_SDK`.\n\n### 3. Turning on on-device developer mode\n\n- Open the Settings app.\n- (Only on Android 8.0 or higher) Select System.\n- Scroll to the bottom and select About phone.\n- Scroll to the bottom and tap Build number 7 times. The system will show ‘You are now a developer.’ (messages may vary.)\n- Return to the previous screen to find Developer options near the bottom. Toggle the options on and enable USB debugging\n\n### 4. Known issues\n\n- For VIVO devices, if there’s an option like ‘USB security access’ under developer options, it needs to be toggled on, otherwise recording and multi-device testing function may not work.\n\n- For Xiaomi devices, under developer options, USB installation and USB debugging also need to be toggled on. Besides, you also need to turn on ‘后台弹出界面’ permission of SoloPi (System Settings -> App Management -> SoloPi -> Permissions).\n\n- For MEIZU devices, if the application to be tested contains highly secured functions like payment function, the secure payment function in the system needs to be turned off.\n\n- For HUAWEI devices, under developer options, you need to turn on ‘USB debugging’ and ‘allow ADB debugging in charge only mode’ option. Otherwise, when the USB cable is unplugged, the ADB debugging is also shut down.\n\n- For  OPPO devices, system would ‘unchecking’ the ‘USB debugging’ every 10 minutes, leading to the unavailability of SoloPi. To solve it, keep connecting the phone to the computer.\n\n- **It's highy recommandded to turn off safety input method in system language settings (if it has), otherwise text input may not work when input password or something else.**\n\n### 5. Debugging apps over Wi-Fi\n\n#### 5.1 Connect the device to PC via USB and make sure debugging is working.\n\nWhen the device is connected to the PC, the device should pop up 'Allow USB debugging?' or similar messages. Click 'Yes'.\n\nCheck if the connection is successful in command line:\n\nWindows: \n```bash\n   %ANDROID_SDK%\\platform-tools\\adb.exe devices\n```\nMacOS/Linux:\n```shell\n   $ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb devices\n```\n\nIf it returns with the device number, then the connection is successful.\n\n#### 5.2 Make the connection\n\n> **Note:** Windows system may need Android device driver to make a successful connection. Devices driver can be downloaded on device's official website. You can also download the phone manager which includes device driver.\n\n> **Note:** If the command line dosen't return `device`, make sure the device driver is installed successfully and the USB debugging is turned on. For some device, the connection mode needs to be `Media Transfer Protocal`(MTP).\n\nFor single device,\n\nWindows: \n```bash\n   %ANDROID_SDK%\\platform-tools\\adb.exe tcpip 5555\n```\n\nmacOS/Linux：\n```shell\n   $ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb tcpip 5555\n```\n\nThe device may show `restarting in TCP mode port: 5555` to remind you the wi-fi ADB debugging mode is on.\n\nFor multiple devices,\n\nFind the device number which is the serial number before `device` and save it.\n\nWindows：\n\n```bash\n   %ANDROID_SDK%\\platform-tools\\adb.exe -s ${serial number} tcpip 5555\n```\nmacOS/Linux：\n\n```shell\n   $ANDROID_SDK/platform-tools/adb -s ${serial number} tcpip 5555\n```\n\n#### 5.3 Downloading SoloPi\n\nYou can either download SoloPi.apk or clone the repository.\n\n## <span id=\"3\">Folders and description</span>\nIn the folder src,\n- app: The business logic of the application.\n- shared: The core function of the application.\n- common: The application architecture.\n- mdlibrary: Proxy generation of ExportService.\n- permission: Permission management.\n- AdbLib: ADB connection.\n- androidWebscoket: Android WebSocket.\n\n## <span id=\"4\">Contributing</span>\n\nThis project is mainly open to developers who want to do software testing.
