Add SwipeBackLayout as a dependency to your existing project.\n2. To enable SwipeBackLayout, you can simply make your `Activity` extend `SwipeBackActivity`:\n\t* In `onCreate` method, `setContentView()` should be called as usual.\n\t* You will have access to the `getSwipeBackLayout()` method so you can customize the `SwipeBackLayout`. \n3. Make window translucent by adding `<item name=\"android:windowIsTranslucent\">true</item>` to your theme.\n\nSimple Example\n===\n```\npublic class DemoActivity extends SwipeBackActivity implements View.OnClickListener {\n    private int[] mBgColors;\n\n    private static int mBgIndex = 0;\n\n    private String mKeyTrackingMode;\n\n    private RadioGroup mTrackingModeGroup;\n\n    private SwipeBackLayout mSwipeBackLayout;\n\n    @Override\n    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n        setContentView(R.layout.activity_demo);\n        changeActionBarColor();\n        findViews();\n        mKeyTrackingMode = getString(R.string.key_tracking_mode);\n        mSwipeBackLayout = getSwipeBackLayout();\n\n        mTrackingModeGroup.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new RadioGroup.OnCheckedChangeListener() {\n            @Override\n            public void onCheckedChanged(RadioGroup group, int checkedId) {\n                int edgeFlag;\n                switch (checkedId) {\n                    case R.id.mode_left:\n                        edgeFlag = SwipeBackLayout.EDGE_LEFT;\n                        break;\n                    case R.id.mode_right:\n                        edgeFlag = SwipeBackLayout.EDGE_RIGHT;\n                        break;\n                    case R.id.mode_bottom:\n                        edgeFlag = SwipeBackLayout.EDGE_BOTTOM;\n                        break;\n                    default:\n                        edgeFlag = SwipeBackLayout.EDGE_ALL;\n                }\n                mSwipeBackLayout.setEdgeTrackingEnabled(edgeFlag);\n                saveTrackingMode(edgeFlag);\n            }\n        });\n    }\n...\n```\n\nDownload\n===\nDownload via Jcenter:\n```\ncompile 'me.imid.swipebacklayout.lib:library:1.1.0'\n```\n\n\nSupport\n===\n<img src=\"https://github.com/ikew0ng/SwipeBackLayout/blob/master/art/support.jpeg\" width=\"300\">\n\n\n\nPull Requests\n===\nI will gladly accept pull requests for fixes and feature enhancements but please do them in the develop branch.\n\nLicense\n===\n\n   Copyright 2013 Isaac Wang\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n     http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n"
