Please only report issues regarding the current repo version (i.e. you must confirm this issue exists in the latest master). This is a different app now, and many old issues with the original app (such as 2FA) were resolved in master but not released.\n* Make sure there's not already an issue (open or closed) regarding your issue.\n* Include detailed information and steps to reproduce. Any issues opened with no description will be ignored.\n* Include a screenshot(s) of the issue. Brownie points for a screen recording of the issue.\n\n## ALL pull requests\n\nPlease include a descriptive title and description. If you changed anything with the UI, please include screenshots of how\nit looks. Use descriptive messages for your commits, and be sure to explain the *why* for commits where appropriate.\n\nPlease **don't** squash all your commits into one before opening the PR. Commits are easier to review when they're split up and in the\norder they happened. Of course, do squash smaller commits together as needed to ensure a clean history.\n\nIf you open a pull request, you are responsible for engaging with us in the review and discussion afterward. If you don't respond\nto comments after opening, we will probably just close it.\n\n## Translations\n\nAlways welcome, but please be prepared to have someone else that speaks if available to review it. Chances are that we cannot\nreview it ourselves, for obvious reasons.\n\n## Bugfixes for existing issues\n\nAlways welcome. Please reference the issue number you're addressing in the PR, and let us know in the issue tracker if\nyou're working on it.\n\n## New features, UI changes, and infrastructure changes\n\nPlease make sure you discuss these with us in the issue tracker before opening a pull request. It's good to get a conversation\ngoing first to make sure that everyone is on the same page, and this way you don't accidentally invest a lot of time into\nsomething we don't want to merge. That said, we're always open to these, so please don't hesitate to start the discussion!\n"

We're a team of a few people helping organizing and prepare this. \n\n> What about the other forks out there?\n\nThey'll remain forks. Obviously we'd prefer them to focus on improving this project, but otherwise we're not coordinating anything with them.\n\n> What's the immediate plan?\n\nWe're shooting for an initial re-release just to get the app out there. There have been a significant number of changes since the app was last updated, with many functional and design changes that we need to make sure are good to go.\n\n> What's the less-immediate plan?\n\nAfter the initial release, we'll start working on giving this app a proper refresh. Much of the UI has already been touched up with elements of Material Design, but we have a long ways to go. Android has changed a lot since this was actively developed, and it's time we take advantage of those changes.\n\n> How can I help?\n\nPlease see the [issues](https://github.com/pockethub/PocketHub/issues) section to report any bugs or feature requests and to see the list of known issues. We can't promise fast response times since we all have full time jobs of our own, but we will do our best to respond in a timely fashion.  If you'd like to contribute, please fork this repository and contribute back using [pull requests](https://github.com/pockethub/PocketHub/pulls).\n\nAny contributions, large or small, major features, bug fixes, additional language translations, unit/integration tests are welcomed and appreciated but will be thoroughly reviewed and discussed. **Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pockethub/PocketHub/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) first!**\n\n## Setup Environment\n\n1. Create a GitHub application (https://github.com/settings/applications/new)\n2. Set the following gradle properties via one of the ways described [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:gradle_properties_and_system_properties):\n  - `pockethub_github_client`=your_application_client_id\n  - `pockethub_github_secret`=your_application_client_secret\n  - `pockethub_github_callback`=your_callback_url\n\n### Callback URL\n- The callback URL needs to be in the format `your_schema://whatever_you_want`\n- Use a custom schema like `myawesomeschema` (not `http` or `https`)\n- The schema must be lowercase ([Reference](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/data-element.html))\n\n## Legacy Notes\n\nIf you had a current installation of the Github App installed and then enabled 2FA (2 Factor Authentication), then you must delete the Personal Access Token (PAT) from your configuration (via the web interface).
