Prebuilds when enabled builds a project\n## like a CI server so you can start coding right away - no more waiting for\n## dependencies to download and builds to finish when reviewing pull-requests\n## or hacking on something new.\n##\n## With Gitpod you can develop software from any device (even iPads) via\n## desktop or browser based versions of VS Code or any JetBrains IDE and\n## customise it to your individual needs - from themes to extensions, you\n## have full control.\n##\n## The easiest way to try out Gitpod is install the browser extenion:\n## 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/browser-extension' or by prefixing\n## 'https://gitpod.io#' to the source control URL of any project.\n##\n## For example: 'https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/gitpod-io/gitpod'\n\n\n## The 'image' section defines which Docker image Gitpod should use.\n## By default, Gitpod uses a standard Docker Image called 'workspace-full'\n## which can be found at 'https://github.com/gitpod-io/workspace-images'\n##\n## Workspaces started based on this default image come pre-installed with\n## Docker, Go, Java, Node.js, C/C++, Python, Ruby, Rust, PHP as well as\n## tools such as Homebrew, Tailscale, Nginx and several more.\n##\n## If this image does not include the tools needed for your project then\n## a public Docker image or your own Docker file can be configured.\n##\n## Learn more about images at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-docker'\n\n# image: node:buster                        # use 'https://hub.docker.com/_/node'\n#\n# image:                                   # leave image undefined if using a Dockerfile\n#  file: .gitpod.Dockerfile                # relative path to the Dockerfile from the\n#                                          # root of the project\n\n## The 'tasks' section defines how Gitpod prepares and builds this project\n## or how Gitpod can start development servers. With Gitpod, there are three\n## types of tasks:\n##\n## - before: Use this for tasks that need to run before init and before command.\n## - init: Use this to configure prebuilds of heavy-lifting tasks such as\n##         downloading dependencies or compiling source code.\n## - command: Use this to start your database or application when the workspace starts.\n##\n## Learn more about these tasks at 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-start-tasks'\n\n# tasks:\n#  - before: |\n#      # commands to execute...\n#\n#  - init: |\n#      # sudo apt-get install python3     # can be used to install operating system\n#                                         # dependencies but these are not kept after the\n#                                         # prebuild completes thus Gitpod recommends moving\n#                                         # operating system dependency installation steps\n#                                         # to a custom Dockerfile to make prebuilds faster\n#                                         # and to keep your codebase DRY.\n#                                         # 'https://www.gitpod.io/docs/config-docker'\n#\n#      # pip install -r requirements.txt  # install codebase dependencies\n#      # cmake                            # precompile codebase\n#\n#  - name: Web Server\n#    openMode: split-left\n#    env:\n#      WEBSERVER_PORT: 8080\n#    command: |\n#     python3 -m http.server $WEBSERVER_PORT\n#\n#  - name: Web Browser\n#    openMode: split-right\n#    env:\n#      WEBSERVER_PORT: 8080\n#    command: |\n#     gp await-port $WEBSERVER_PORT\n#     lynx `gp url`\n\ntasks:\n  - init: ./mvnw package -DskipTests\n## The 'ports' section defines various ports your may listen on are\n## configured in Gitpod on an authenticated URL.

We welcome your\nfeedback and want to listen and discuss your ideas and issues.\n\nThere are many different ways to help contribute to the Dropwizard project.\n\n* Helping others by participating in the [Dropwizard User Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dropwizard-user)\n* Improving or enhancing our [documentation](http://dropwizard.github.io/dropwizard/)\n* Fixing open issues listed in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dropwizard/dropwizard/issues?state=open)\n* Adding new features to the Dropwizard codebase\n\nYou can triage issues which may include reproducing bug reports or asking for vital information, such as version numbers or reproduction instructions. If you would like to start triaging issues, one easy way to get started is to [subscribe to dropwizard on CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/dropwizard/dropwizard).\n\nGuidelines\n===\nWhen submitting a pull request, please make sure to fork the repository and create a\nseparate branch for your feature or fix for an issue.\n\nAll contributions are welcome to be submitted for review for inclusion, but before\nthey will be accepted, we ask that you follow these simple guidelines:\n\nCode style\n---\nWhen submitting code, please make every effort to follow existing conventions and\nstyle in order to keep the code as readable as possible. We realize that the style\nused in Dropwizard might be different that what is used in your projects, but in the end\n it makes it easier to merge changes and maintain in the future.\n\nTesting\n---\nWe kindly ask that all new features and fixes for an issue should include any unit tests.\nEven if it is small improvement, adding a unit test will help to ensure no regressions or the\nissue is not re-introduced. If you need help with writing a test for your feature, please\ndon't be shy and ask!\n\nDocumentation\n---\nUp-to-date documentation makes all our lives easier. If you are adding a new feature,\nenhancing an existing feature, or fixing an issue, please add or modify the documentation\nas needed and include it with your pull request.\n\nNew Features\n===\nIf you would like to implement a new feature, please raise an issue before sending a\npull request so the feature can be discussed. **We appreciate the effort and want\nto avoid a situation where a contribution requires extensive rework on either side,\nit sits in the queue for a long time, or cannot be accepted at all.**\n\nDeveloper List\n===\nThe Google Group [dropwizard-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/dropwizard-dev)\nis the place to discuss everything to do with the development of the framework itself,\nincluding docs, process and community management.\n\n\nFeel free to post questions about internals, ideas for new features or refactorings,\ndifferent strategies, requests for comment/review etc. This is the forum for everyone\nwho wants to actively contribute to the project itself.\n\nCommitters\n===\nThe list of people with committer access is kept in the developer section of the pom.xml located in the parent directory.\n\n* Committers aren't allowed to merge their own changes, the exception being bug fixes\n* A commit may be reverted, but it requires 2+ committer's approval. The goal is to keep it democratic\n"

There is no formal structure for\nthe announcement, but generally it should contain a short description of the release, the artifact coordinates in the\nMaven Central, a link to documentation, a link to the release notes, and a link to the bug tracker.\n"
