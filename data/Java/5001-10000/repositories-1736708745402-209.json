For styling, please view [Wiki](https://github.com/rey5137/Material/wiki). Note that default style of widgets depend on theme of AppCompat. Here is an example:\n\n```xml\n     <style name=\"AppTheme\" parent=\"Theme.AppCompat.Light.DarkActionBar\">\n        <!-- Customize your theme here. -->\n\n        <!-- colorPrimary is used for the default action bar background -->\n        <item name=\"colorPrimary\">@color/colorPrimary</item>\n\n        <!-- colorPrimaryDark is used for the status bar -->\n        <item name=\"colorPrimaryDark\">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>\n\n        <!-- colorAccent is used as the default value for colorControlActivated\n             which is used to tint widgets -->\n        <item name=\"colorAccent\">@color/colorAccent</item>\n\n        <!-- You can also set colorControlNormal, colorControlActivated\n             colorControlHighlight & colorSwitchThumbNormal. -->\n    </style>\n```\n\n## Donation\nYou can support the project and thank the author for his hard work.\n\n<a href='https://pledgie.com/campaigns/28714'><img alt='Click here to lend your support to: Support Material Library project. and make a donation at pledgie.com !' src='https://pledgie.com/campaigns/28714.png?skin_name=chrome' border='0' ></a>\n\n**PayPal**\n- [Donate](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=pea5137%40gmail%2ecom&lc=US&item_name=Rey%20Pham&no_note=0&currency_code=USD&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donateCC_LG%2egif%3aNonHostedGuest)\n\n## Contributing\nWant to contribute?
