'com.github.razerdp:BasePopup_Candy:{latestVersion}'\n\t}\n```\n\n\n使用方法\n---\n\nps:从1.9.0-alpha开始支持背景模糊（只需要一个方法：`setBlurBackgroundEnable()`）\n\n**RenderScript最低支持api 17（更低的情况将会使用fastblur），您需要在gradle配置一下代码**\n\n```xml\ndefaultConfig {\n        renderscriptTargetApi 25\n        renderscriptSupportModeEnabled true\n    }\n```\n\n* **Step 1:**\n\n像您平时定制activity布局文件一样定制您的popup布局（请注意，展示动画的那个view必须是popupview的子view）\n\netc.\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n\n<!--根布局，常用作蒙层（就是变暗的背景）-->\n<RelativeLayout xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    android:background=\"#8f000000\">\n    \n    <!--播放动画的内容，可以认为是popup的主要内容布局-->\n    <RelativeLayout\n        android:id=\"@+id/popup_anima\"\n        android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n        android:background=\"@drawable/bg_dialog\"\n        android:layout_centerInParent=\"true\"\n        android:layout_margin=\"25dp\">\n        \n        \n        <... many views>\n        \n        \n\n    </RelativeLayout>\n</RelativeLayout>\n```\n![image](https://github.com/razerdp/BasePopup/blob/master/img/etc.png)\n\n\n* **Step 2:**\n\n新建一个类继承BasePopupWindow\n\n* **Step 3:**\n\n实现必要的几个方法：\n\n`initShowAnimation()`:初始化一个进入动画，该动画将会用到`initAnimaView()`返回的view\n\n`onCreatePopupView()`:初始化您的popupwindow界面，建议直接使用`createPopupById()`，不能返回空值\n\n`getClickToDismissView()`:如果有需要的话，可以使用这个方法返回一个点击dismiss popupwindow的view(也许是遮罩层也许是某个view，这个随您喜欢)\n\n例如\n\n```java\npublic class DialogPopup extends BasePopupWindow implements View.OnClickListener{\n\n    private TextView ok;\n    private TextView cancel;\n\n    public DialogPopup(Activity context) {\n        super(context);\n\n        ok= (TextView) findViewById(R.id.ok);\n        cancel= (TextView) findViewById(R.id.cancel);\n\n        setViewClickListener(this,ok,cancel);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected Animation initShowAnimation() {\n        AnimationSet set=new AnimationSet(false);\n        Animation shakeAnima=new RotateAnimation(0,15,Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF,0.5f,Animation.RELATIVE_TO_SELF,0.5f);\n        shakeAnima.setInterpolator(new CycleInterpolator(5));\n        shakeAnima.setDuration(400);\n        set.addAnimation(getDefaultAlphaAnimation());\n        set.addAnimation(shakeAnima);\n        return set;\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    protected View getClickToDismissView() {\n        return getPopupWindowView();\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public View onCreatePopupView() {\n        return createPopupById(R.layout.popup_dialog);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public View initAnimaView() {\n        return findViewById(R.id.popup_anima);\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onClick(View v) {\n        switch (v.getId()){\n            case R.id.ok:\n                Toast.makeText(getContext(),\"click the ok button\",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                break;\n            case R.id.cancel:\n                Toast.makeText(getContext(),\"click the cancel button\",Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();\n                break;\n            default:\n                break;\n        }\n\n    }\n}\n```\n\n* **Step 4:**\n\n把您刚才实现的popup给new出来并调用show方法\n\n例如\n\n```java\n    DialogPopup popup = new DialogPopup(context);\n    popup.showPopupWindow();\n```\n\n方法介绍：\n---\n\n请看wiki（陆续完善中）\n\n**Link👉**[WIKI](https://github.com/razerdp/BasePopup/wiki)\n\n交流群：590777418\n---\n\n因为目前还有朋友圈项目，建立了一个交流群，出于懒得管理那么多，所以如果有想法或者优化建议或者其他问题，欢迎加入“朋友圈交流群”\n\n![](https://github.com/razerdp/FriendCircle/blob/master/qqgroup.png)\n\n打赏（看在我那么努力维护的份上。。。给个零食呗~）\n---\n\n|

It is a basic library class with a high degree of freedom and a rich API that allows you to do a wide range of popups very easily within the framework of BasePopup.\r\n\r\n### Download\r\n\r\n```groovy\r\n// root gradle\r\nallprojects {\r\n    repositories {\r\n        // release dependency repository (available after 4.1 as default configuration)\r\n        mavenCentral()\r\n\r\n        // snapshot repository (if you need snapshot dependency, please configure this maven)\r\n        maven { url 'https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots' }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// project dependencies\r\ndependencies {\r\n  implementation 'io.github.razerdp:BasePopup:3.1.8'\r\n\r\n  // for snapshot\r\n  // implementation 'io.github.razerdp:BasePopup:3.1.8-SNAPSHOT'\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\n\r\n - [**BasePopup Manuals**](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup)\r\n\r\n### Precautions\r\n\r\n  - Switching between Release and Snapshot versions may cause the Build to fail, so you can clean the Project.\r\n  - Version 3.0 will cause a large range of changes to users who have upgraded from version 2.x. Please be sure to read the upgrade instructions:[关于BasePopup 3.0的破坏性更新说明](./Update_3.0.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n### ChangeLog [(History ChangeLog)](https://www.yuque.com/razerdp/basepopup/uyrsxx)\r\n\r\n* **[Release] 3.2.0** (2021/10/15)\r\n    * After two months, we have made a series of optimizations to BasePopup after taking in user feedback. After a period of testing, it has stabilized, so we officially release version 3.2.0, welcome to update and download.\r\n    * [Optimization]\r\n        * To address the historical problems, we have unified the role of the root layout margin under match_parent and wrap_content this time, now the role is consistent with the system, used as margin instead of offset.\r\n        * The default value of `setFitSize()` method is now True, which means BasePopup will resize by default to meet the display when there is not enough space, if you don't want BasePopup to resize automatically, please set this method to False.\r\n            * Automatically turn off fitSize when setting mirroring and cache the original value\r\n        * Add new Api to QuickPopup, and modify the implementation of QuickPopupConfig to make the code more refreshing and neat.\r\n    * [Bug fix]\r\n        * Fix measure issue: [#435](https://github.com/razerdp/BasePopup/issues/435)\r\n        * Fix the problem of displaying on the left side of the target horizontally instead of aligning the left edge when AnchorView is associated by default.\r\n        * Fix the problem of update error when rotating the screen.\r\n        * Fix the problem of event distribution: [#443](https://github.com/razerdp/BasePopup/issues/443)\r\n    * [New features\r\n        * Add the function of not hiding the keyboard when dismiss: `hideKeyboardOnDismiss(boolean)`\r\n    * [Other]\r\n        * Clear all marker obsolete methods\r\n\r\nTranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)\r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\n#### Demo Apk Download：[**apk download（pass:123）**](https://www.pgyer.com/basepopup)\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./img/download.png\"  width=\"256\"/>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n|  |  |  |\r\n| - | - | - |\r\n| ![](https://github.com/razerdp/Pics/blob/master/BasePopup/demo_1.gif) | ![](https://github.com/razerdp/Pics/blob/master/BasePopup/new_demo_2.gif) | ![](https://github.com/razerdp/Pics/blob/master/BasePopup/demo_3.gif) |\r\n| ![](https://github.com/razerdp/Pics/blob/master/BasePopup/demo_4.gif) | ![](https://github.com/razerdp/Pics/blob/master/BasePopup/demo_5.gif) | ![](https://github.com/razerdp/Pics/blob/master/BasePopup/demo_6.gif) |\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n[![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Frazerdp%2FBasePopup.svg?type=large)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2Frazerdp%2FBasePopup?ref=badge_large)\r\n\r\n[Apache-2.0](./LICENSE)\r\n\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  Visit Count（from 2020/08/19）<br>\r\n  <img src=\"https://profile-counter.glitch.me/razerdp-basepopup/count.svg\" />\r\n</p>\r\n"

          "content": " **中文** | [**English**](./Update_3.0_EN.md)\n\n---\n\n## 关于BasePopup 3.0的破坏性更新说明\n\n### 改动说明\n\n   * 删除**BaseLazyPopupWindow**：往后不需要区分懒加载和正常的BasePopupWindow，统一依赖BasePopupWindow\n   * 删除方法`onCreateConstructor`：该方法实际上是给BaseLazyPopupWindow使用的，现在没有了BaseLazyPopupWindow，自然不需要该方法\n   * 【重要】删除方法`onCreateContentView`：该方法的删除将会影响所有的BasePopupWindow子类，您需要手动去改动\n      * 该方法将会被`setContentView(@LayoutRes int layoutResID)`或`setContentView(final View view)`所代替，您需要修改其使用。\n      * 当然，如果使用`setContentView(final View view)`，我们依然建议您用setContentView(createPopupById(layoutResID))，以便我们解析到正确的xml配置。\n\n### 为什么要这么改\n\n事实上想改这个很久了，而且也不止一位开发者向我提过这个issue，如[#368](https://github.com/razerdp/BasePopup/issues/368)。\n\n初始化ContentView其实就应该跟Dialog或者Activity一样，把权限交给使用者而非框架强行设定。\n\n之所以会出现`onCreateContentView`这样的强制实现的方法，是因为第一版的BasePopup就是这么设计的，而第一版的设计时间是16年，那时候我大四，设计这个框架的目的就是为了求职。\n\n那时候我也想不到BasePopup会被我一直维护且迭代更新，也没想到会有那么多开发者使用。\n\n但也正因为是那么多人使用，因此我一直不太敢去动他，毕竟这是一个破坏性更新，要改的很多很多（虽然改动很小，但可能依赖BasePopup的类很多）。\n\n但是，随着越来越多人的提出这个问题，我认为这种修改是躲不过的。\n\n因此这次改动我将直接发布3.0版本，与2.x版本区分开来。\n\n\n### 修改的好处\n\n优点有很多，先来说说以前的缺点：\n\n#### BaseLazyPopupWindow\n\n在以前的版本中，我提供了一个BaseLazyPopupWindow来解决构造器传参，onViewCreated中无法获取的问题。\n\n咋一眼似乎还行，实际上仍有弊端，最主要体现在两个：\n\n    1. inflate的时机在showPopupWindow()，这会导致复杂的布局在第一次show的时候会卡顿（卡顿原因：inflate）\n    2. 由于懒加载，其加载时机在show的时候，因此我们无法在构造器中findViewById，其次对于 new popup().setText().showPopupWindow()这样的在setText中直接访问控件的方法是不可行的，只会得到NPE报错（在show之前都没有inflate呢，访问控件只能是空的）。\n\n这两个问题也许很多人没遇到过，但一旦遇到了就会觉得巨麻烦，框架为啥这么设计。\n\n#### 构造器传参及onViewCreated取参的问题\n\n在以前的版本中，onViewCreated是在父类的构造器中调用的，此时子类的参数都还没赋值进行初始化，因此执行onViewCreated时我们无法得到参数。\n\n哪怕后来提供了BaseLazyPopupWindow，也会有上述几个问题。\n\n\n### 修改后的使用\n\n修改后的使用上跟以前其实没啥区别，优点是`setContentView`的时机完全由您控制，不必担心上面所说的问题。\n\ne.g.\n\n```java\npublic class DemoPopup extends BasePopupWindow {\n    @BindView(R.id.tv_desc)\n    public TextView mTvDesc;\n\n    int a;\n\n    public DemoPopup(Context context,int a) {\n        super(context);\n        // 此时赋值构造器传入的值\n        this.a = a;\n        setContentView(R.layout.popup_demo);\n    }\n\n\n    @Override\n    public void onViewCreated(View contentView) {\n        ButterKnifeUtil.bind(this, contentView);\n        // 此时能正确访问到a\n        mTvDesc.setText(String.valueOf(a));\n    }\n\n    // 如果使用 new DemoPopup().setText()，不需要担心mTvDesc为空\n    public DemoPopup setText(CharSequence text) {\n        mTvDesc.setText(text);\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n```\n"

The timing of the inflate is in `showPopupWindow()`, which can cause complex layouts to lag on the first show (reason for lag: inflate)\n    2. Because of lazy loading, its loading time is at show time, so we can't findViewById in the constructor, and secondly for `new popup().setText().showPopupWindow()` which accesses the control directly in setText is not feasible, it just gets an NPE error (there is no inflate before show There is no inflate before the show, so the access control will be empty).\n\nThese two problems may not be encountered by many people, but when they are, they can be a huge pain in the ass to understand why the framework is designed the way it is.\n\n#### Problems with constructor passing and onViewCreated taking parameters\n\nIn previous versions, onViewCreated was called in the constructor of the parent class, where none of the subclass parameters had been assigned for initialisation, so we could not get the parameters when onViewCreated was executed.\n\nEven with the later provision of BaseLazyPopupWindow, there were several problems with this.\n\n\n### How\n\nThe advantage is that the timing of the `setContentView` is entirely under your control and you don't have to worry about the problems described above.\n\ne.g.\n\n```java\npublic class DemoPopup extends BasePopupWindow {\n    @BindView(R.id.tv_desc)\n    public TextView mTvDesc;\n\n    int a;\n\n    public DemoPopup(Context context,int a) {\n        super(context);\n        // The value passed in by the assignment constructor at this point\n        this.a = a;\n        setContentView(R.layout.popup_demo);\n    }\n\n\n    @Override\n    public void onViewCreated(View contentView) {\n        ButterKnifeUtil.bind(this, contentView);\n        // At this point it is possible to correctly access the a\n        mTvDesc.setText(String.valueOf(a));\n    }\n\n    // If you use new DemoPopup().setText(), you don't need to worry about mTvDesc being empty\n    public DemoPopup setText(CharSequence text) {\n        mTvDesc.setText(text);\n        return this;\n    }\n}\n```\n"
