          "content": "CASSANDRA-14092: MAXIMUM TTL EXPIRATION DATE\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe maximum expiration timestamp that can be represented by the storage engine has been raised to\n2106-02-07T06:28:13+00:00 from the previous 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00, which means that INSERTS using \nTTL that would expire after this date are not currently supported. Notice that on previous versions <5.0 \nor when 5.0 is ran in compatibility mode (<=\"oa\" sstable formats) the limit stays at at 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00.\n\nThere is a new yaml property storage_compatibility_mode that determines the\nCassandra major version we want to stay compatible with. Its default is CASSANDRA_4, which means that\nthe node sstables, commitlog, hints and messaging version will stay compatible with Cassandra 4.x,\n2038 will still be the limit, and it will be possible to rollback to the previous version. To upgrade:\n - Do a rolling upgrade to 5.0 where 2038 will still be the limit. At this point, the node won't write\n anything incompatible with Cassandra 4.x, and you would still be able to rollback to that version.\n - Do a rolling restart setting storage_compatibility_mode=UPGRADING. Once all nodes\n are in storage version 5, 2106 will become the new limit.\n - Do a rolling restart setting storage_compatibility_mode=NONE. Now mixed\n 2038 and 2106 nodes are no longer possible.\nNotice the yaml property needs to be set all the time for all executables and tools. It\nwill be removed in future versions when 2038 nodes are no longer possible.\n\n# Expiration Date Overflow Policy\n\nWe plan to lift this limitation in newer versions, but while the fix is not available,\noperators can decide which policy to apply when dealing with inserts with TTL exceeding\nthe maximum supported expiration date:\n  -     REJECT: this is the default policy and will reject any requests with expiration\n                date timestamp after 2106-02-07T06:28:13+00:00 or 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00.\n  -        CAP: any insert with TTL expiring after 2106-02-07T06:28:13+00:00 will expire on\n                2106-02-07T06:28:13+00:00 or 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 and the client will receive a warning.\n  - CAP_NOWARN: same as previous, except that the client warning will not be emitted.\n\nThese policies may be specified via the -Dcassandra.expiration_date_overflow_policy=POLICY\nstartup option in the jvm.options configuration file.\n\n# Potential data loss on earlier versions\n\nPrior to 3.0.16 (3.0.X) and 3.11.2 (3.11.x), there was no protection against\nINSERTS with TTL expiring after the maximum supported date, causing the expiration\ntime field to overflow and the records to expire immediately. Expired records due\nto overflow will not be queryable and will be permanently removed after a compaction.\n\n2.1.X, 2.2.X and earlier series are not subject to this bug when assertions are enabled\nsince an AssertionError is thrown during INSERT when the expiration time field overflows\non these versions. When assertions are disabled then it is possible to INSERT entries\nwith overflowed local expiration time and even the earlier versions are subject to data\nloss due to this bug.\n\nOn versions < 5.0 the overflow limit was at 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 so this issue \nonly affected INSERTs with very large TTLs, close to the maximum allowed value\nof 630720000 seconds (20 years), starting from 2018-01-19T03:14:06+00:00. As time progresses,\nthe maximum supported TTL will be gradually reduced as the maximum expiration date approaches.\nFor instance, a user on an affected version on 2028-01-19T03:14:06 with a TTL of 10 years\nwill be affected by this bug, so we urge users of very large TTLs to upgrade to a version\nwhere this issue is addressed as soon as possible.\n\nOn versions >= 5.0 this limit has been raised to 2106-02-07T06:28:13+00:00.\n\n# Data Recovery\n\nSSTables from Cassandra versions prior to 2.1.20/2.2.12/3.0.16/3.11.2 containing entries\nwith overflowed expiration time that were backed up or did not go through compaction can\nbe recovered by reinserting overflowed entries with a valid expiration time and a higher\ntimestamp, since tombstones may have been generated with the original timestamp.\n\nTo find out if an SSTable has an entry with overflowed expiration, inspect it with the\n'sstablemetadata' tool and look for a negative \"Minimum local deletion time\" field. SSTables\nin this condition should be backed up immediately, as they are subject to data loss during\ncompaction.\n\nA \"--reinsert-overflowed-ttl\" option was added to scrub to rewrite SSTables containing\nrows with overflowed expiration time with the maximum expiration date of\n2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 and the original timestamp + 1 (ms). Two methods are offered\nfor recovery of SSTables via scrub:\n\n- Offline scrub:\n   - Clone the data directory tree to another location, keeping only the folders and the\n     contents of the system tables.\n   - Clone the configuration directory to another location, setting the data_file_directories\n     property to the cloned data directory in the cloned cassandra.yaml.\n   - Copy the affected SSTables to the cloned data location of the affected table.\n   - Set the environment variable CASSANDRA_CONF=<cloned configuration directory>.\n   - Execute \"sstablescrub --reinsert-overflowed-ttl <keyspace> <table>\".\n         WARNING: not specifying --reinsert-overflowed-ttl is equivalent to a single-sstable\n         compaction, so the data with overflowed will be removed - make sure to back up\n         your SSTables before running scrub.\n   - Once the scrub is completed, copy the resulting SSTables to the original data directory.\n   - Execute \"nodetool refresh\" in a live node to load the recovered SSTables.\n\n- Online scrub:\n   - Disable compaction on the node with \"nodetool disableautocompaction\" - this step is crucial\n     as otherwise, the data may be removed permanently during compaction.\n   - Copy the SSTables containing entries with overflowed expiration time to the data directory.\n   - run \"nodetool refresh\" to load the SSTables.\n   - run \"nodetool scrub --reinsert-overflowed-ttl <keyspace> <table>\".\n   - Re-enable compactions after verifying that scrub recovered the missing entries.\n\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-14092 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-14227 for more details about this issue.\n"

By default, INSERTS with TTL exceeding the\nmaximum supported date are rejected, but it's possible to choose a different \nexpiration overflow policy. See CASSANDRA-14092.txt for more details.\n \nThere is a new yaml property storage_compatibility_mode that determines the\nCassandra major version we want to stay compatible with. Its default is CASSANDRA_4, which means that\nthe node sstables, commitlog, hints and messaging version will stay compatible with Cassandra 4.x,\n2038 will still be the limit, and it will be possible to rollback to the previous version. To upgrade:\n - Do a rolling upgrade to 5.0 where 2038 will still be the limit. At this point, the node won't write\n anything incompatible with Cassandra 4.x, and you would still be able to rollback to that version.\n - Do a rolling restart setting storage_compatibility_mode=UPGRADING. Once all nodes\n are in storage version 5, 2106 will become the new limit.\n - Do a rolling restart setting storage_compatibility_mode=NONE. Now mixed\n 2038 and 2106 nodes are no longer possible.\nNotice the yaml property needs to be set all the time for all executables and tools. It\nwill be removed in future versions when 2038 nodes are no longer possible.\n\nPrior to 3.0.16 (3.0.X) and 3.11.2 (3.11.x) there was no protection against INSERTS\nwith TTL expiring after the maximum supported date, causing the expiration time\nfield to overflow and the records to expire immediately. Clusters in the 2.X and\nlower series are not subject to this when assertions are enabled. Backed up SSTables\ncan be potentially recovered and recovery instructions can be found on the\nCASSANDRA-14092.txt file.\n\nIf you use or plan to use very large TTLS (10 to 20 years), read CASSANDRA-14092.txt\nfor more information.\n\nPLEASE READ: CVE-2021-44521 SCRIPTED UDF SYSTEM ACCESS (CASSANDRA-17352)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you have enabled scripted UDFs and run without UDF threads in cassandra.yaml:\n\n    enable_user_defined_functions_threads: false\n\nan attacker could access java.lang.System methods and execute arbitrary code on\nthe machine. Disabling UDF threads is still considered insecure and not recommended.\n\nTo continue running without UDF threads you will need to set:\n\n    allow_insecure_udfs: true\n\nand if you need access to java.lang.System for existing UDFs, set:\n\n    allow_extra_insecure_udfs: true\n\nGENERAL UPGRADING ADVICE FOR ANY VERSION\n========================================\n\nSnapshotting is fast (especially if you have JNA installed) and takes\neffectively zero disk space until you start compacting the live data\nfiles again.  Thus, best practice is to ALWAYS snapshot before any\nupgrade, just in case you need to roll back to the previous version.\n(Cassandra version X + 1 will always be able to read data files created\nby version X, but the inverse is not necessarily the case.)\n\nWhen upgrading major versions of Cassandra, you will be unable to\nrestore snapshots created with the previous major version using the\n'sstableloader' tool. You can upgrade the file format of your snapshots\nusing the provided 'sstableupgrade' tool.\n\n\n5.1\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n    [The following is a placeholder, to be revised asap]\n    - CEP-21 Transactional Cluster Metadata introduces a distributed log for linearizing modifications to cluster\n    metadata. In the first instance, this encompasses cluster membership, token ownership and schema metadata. See\n    https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA/CEP-21%3A+Transactional+Cluster+Metadata for more detail on\n    the motivation and design, and see \"Upgrading\" below for specific instructions on migrating clusters to this system.\n    More updates and documentation to follow.\n    - New Guardrails added:\n      - Whether bulk loading of SSTables is allowed.\n    - nodetool tpstats can display core pool size, max pool size and max tasks queued if --verbose / -v flag is specified.\n      system_views.thread_pools adds core_pool_size, max_pool_size and max_tasks_queued columns.\n    - Authentication mode is exposed in system_views.clients table, nodetool clientstats and ClientMetrics \n      to help operators identify which authentication modes are being used. nodetool clientstats introduces --verbose flag \n      behind which this information is visible.\n    - CEP-24 - Password validation / generation. When built-in 'password_validator' guardrail is enabled, it will\n      generate a password of configured password strength policy upon role creation or alteration\n      when 'GENERATED PASSWORD' clause is used. Character sets supported are: English, Cyrillic, modern Cyrillic,\n      German, Polish and Czech.\n    - There is new MBean of name org.apache.cassandra.service.snapshot:type=SnapshotManager which exposes user-facing\n      snapshot operations. Snapshot-related methods on StorageServiceMBean are still present and functional\n      but marked as deprecated.\n    - The unified compaction strategy will now parallelize individual compactions by splitting operations into separate\n      tasks per output shard. This significantly shortens compaction durations but cannot take advantage of preemptive\n      SSTable opening and thus can be less efficient if the strategy is configured to create large sstables.\n      This functionality is controlled by the parallelize_output_shards compaction option (the default can also be set\n      using -Dunified_compaction.parallelize_output_shards=false/true).\n    - Compaction parallelism for the unified compaction strategy also applies to major compactions. Because the number\n      of shards for a major compaction is usually quite high, this can dramatically improve the duration of major\n      compactions. To avoid the possibility of starving background compactions from resources, the number of threads\n      used for major compactions is limited to half the available compaction threads by default, and can be controlled\n      by a new --jobs / -j option of nodetool compact.\n    - It is possible to configure JMX server in cassandra.yaml in jmx_server_options configuration section.\n      JMX SSL configuration can be configured via jmx_encryption_options in jmx_server_options. The old way of\n      configuring JMX is still present and default, but new way is preferable as it will e.g. not leak credentials for\n      JMX to JVM parameters. You have to opt-in to use the configuration via cassandra.yaml by uncommenting\n      the respective configuration sections and by commenting out `configure_jmx` function call in cassandra-env.sh.\n      Enabling both ways of configuring JMX will result in a node failing to start.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    [The following is a placeholder, to be revised asap]\n    - Upgrading to 5.1 is currently only supported from 4.0, 4.1 or 5.0. Clusters running earlier releases must first\n    upgrade to at least the latest 4.0 release. When a cluster is upgraded to 5.1 there is an additional step for\n    operators to perform. The upgrade is not considered complete until:\n      1. All UP nodes are running 5.1\n      2. The Cluster Metadata Service (CMS) has been enabled\n    The first step is just a regular upgrade, there are no changes to external APIs, SSTable formats to consider.\n    Step 2 requires an operator to run a new nodetool subcommand, intializecms, on one node in the cluster.\n      - > nodetool cms initialize\n    Doing so creates the CMS with the local node as its only member. The initialize command cannot be executed until\n    step 1 is complete and all nodes are running 5.1 as migrating metadata management over to the new TCM system\n    requires all nodes to be in agreement over the current state of the cluster. Essentially this means agreement on\n    schema and topology. Once the upgrade has started, but before the initialize command is run, metadata-changing\n    operations are not permitted and if attempted from an upgraded node will be rejected.\n    Prohibited operations include:\n      - schema changes\n      - node replacement\n      - bootstrap\n      - decommission\n      - move\n      - assasinate\n    For the time being there is no mechanism in place to prevent these operations being executed by a node still running\n    a previous version, though this is planned before release. Any automation which can trigger these operations should\n    be disabled for the cluster prior to starting the upgrade.\n    Should any of the prohibited operations be executed (i.e. on a node that is still running a pre-5.1 version) before\n    the CMS intialization, nodes which are DOWN or which have been upgraded will not process the metadata changes.\n    However, nodes still UP and running the old version will. This will eventually cause the migration to fail, as the\n    cluster will not be in agreement.\n      - > nodetool cms initialize\n        Got mismatching cluster metadatas from [/x.x.x.x:7000] aborting migration\n        See 'nodetool help' or 'nodetool help <command>'.\n    If the cms initialize command fails, it will indicate which nodes’ current metadata does not agree with the node\n    where the command was executed. To mitigate this situation, bring any mismatching nodes DOWN and rerun the\n    cms initialize command with the additional —ignore flag.\n      - nodetool cms intialize -ignore x.x.x.x\n    Once the command has run successfully the ignored nodes can be restarted but any metadata changes that they\n    accepted/and or applied whilst the cluster was in mixed mode will be lost. We plan to improve this before beta, but\n    in the meantime operators should ensure no schema or membership/ownership changes are performed during the upgrade.\n    Although the restrictions on metadata-changing operations will be removed as soon as the initial CMS migration is\n    complete, at that point the CMS will only contain a single member, which is not suitable for real clusters. To\n    modify the membership of the CMS a second nodetool subcommand, cms reconfigure, should be run. This command allows\n    the number of required number of CMS members to be specified for each datacenter. Consensus for metadata operations\n    by the CMS is obtained via Paxos, operating at SERIAL/QUORUM consistency, so the minimum safe size for the CMS is 3\n    nodes. In multi-DC deployments, the CMS members may be distributed across DCs to ensure resilience in the case of a\n    DC outage. It is not recommended to make every node a member of the CMS. Redundancy is the primary concern here, not\n    locality or latency, so between 3 and 7 nodes per DC depending on the size of the cluster should be the goal.\n    Deploying to a fresh cluster is more straightforward. As the cluster comes up, at least one node will automatically\n    nominate itself as the first CMS node. A simple election mechanism ensures that only one node will be chosen if\n    multiple peers attempt to nominate themselves. As soon as the election is complete, metadata modifications are\n    supported. Typically, this takes only a few seconds and is likely to complete before all nodes are fully UP. Nodes\n    which come up during or after an election will learn of the elected first CMS node and direct metadata updates to\n    it. It is important to remember that at the completion of the election, the CMS still only comprises a single\n    member. Just as in the upgrade case, operators should add further members as soon as possible.\n    - native_transport_port_ssl property was removed. Please transition to using one port only. Encrypted communication\n    may be optional by setting `optional` flag in `client_encryption_options` to `true` and it should be set only\n    while in unencrypted or transitional operation. Please consult `client_encryption_options` in cassandra.yaml\n    for more information.\n\n\nDeprecation\n-----------\n    - `use_deterministic_table_id` is no longer supported and should be removed from cassandra.yaml. Table IDs may still be supplied explicitly on CREATE.\n    - IEndpointSnitch has been deprecated as ClusterMetadata is now the source of truth regarding topology information.\n      The responsibilities of the snitch have been broken out to a handful of new classes:\n      * o.a.c.locator.Locator provides datacenter and rack info for endpoints. This is not configurable as topology is\n        always sourced from ClusterMetadata.\n      * o.a.c.locator.InitialLocationProvider supplies the local datacenter and rack for a new node joining a cluster\n        for the first time. This will be used exactly once to register the Location of the node in ClusterMetadata and\n        is configurable using the `initial_location_provider` yaml setting.\n      * o.a.c.locator.NodeProximity handles sorting and ranking of replica lists. It is configurable via the\n        `node_proximity` yaml setting.\n      * o.a.c.locator.NodeAddressConfig exists mainly to support the functionality of ReconnectableSnitchHelper and\n        Ec2MultiRegionSnitch which dynamically configures the broadcast address based on cloud metadata. Optionally\n        configurable using the `address_config` yaml setting.\n      For migration and to allow us to deprecate snitches in a controlled way, use of endpoint_snitch in yaml remains\n      fully supported and all existing IEndpointSnitch implementations should continue to work seamlessly and no action\n      is required by operators at upgrade time. The in-tree snitches have been refactored to extract implementations of\n      the new interfaces so that their functionality can also be used via the new `initial_location_provider`,\n      `node_proximity` and `address_config` settings.\n\n5.0\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - A new configuration file, `cassandra_latest.yaml`, is provided for users that would like to evaluate and\n      experiment with the latest recommended features and changes in Cassandra, which provide improved functionality and\n      performance. This file is intended to be used in a development environment and is only recommended for production\n      use after careful evaluation. The file is located in the conf directory and is not selected by default.\n      To use it, one may specify the file using the `-Dcassandra.config` option, e.g. by running\n      `cassandra -Dcassandra.config=file://$CASSANDRA_HOME/conf/cassandra_latest.yaml`.\n    - Added a new authorizer, CIDR authorizer, to restrict user access based on CIDR groups.\n    - Pluggable crypto providers were made possible via `crypto_provider` section in cassandra.yaml. The default provider is \n      Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider and it is installed automatically upon node's start. Only x86_64 and aarch64 architectures are supported now.\n      Please consult upgrade section to know more details when upgrading from older Cassandra versions.\n    - Added a new secondary index implementation, Storage-Attached Indexes (SAI). Overview documentation and a basic\n      tutorial can be found at src/java/org/apache/cassandra/index/sai/README.md.\n    - *Experimental* support for Java 17 has been added. JVM options that differ between or are\n      specific for Java 17 have been added into jvm17.options.\n      IMPORTANT: Running C* on Java 17 is *experimental* and do it at your own risk.\n    - Added a new \"unified\" compaction strategy that supports the use cases of the legacy compaction strategies, with\n      low space overhead, high parallelism and flexible configuration. Implemented by the UnifiedCompactionStrategy\n      class. Further details and documentation can be found in\n      src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/compaction/UnifiedCompactionStrategy.md\n    - New `VectorType` (cql `vector<element_type, dimension>`) which adds new fixed-length element arrays. See CASSANDRA-18504\n    - Added new vector similarity functions `similarity_cosine`, `similarity_euclidean` and `similarity_dot_product`.\n    - Added ANN vector similarity search via ORDER BY ANN OF syntax on SAI indexes (using jvector library).\n    - Removed UDT type migration logic for 3.6+ clusters upgrading to 4.0.  If migration has been disabled, it must be\n      enabled before upgrading to 5.0 if the cluster used UDTs. See CASSANDRA-18504\n    - Entended max expiration time from 2038-01-19T03:14:06+00:00 to 2106-02-07T06:28:13+00:00\n    - Added new Mathematical CQL functions: abs, exp, log, log10 and round.\n    - Added a trie-based memtable implementation, which improves memory use, garbage collection efficiency and lookup\n      performance. The new memtable is implemented by the TrieMemtable class and can be selected using the memtable\n      API, see src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/memtable/Memtable_API.md.\n    - Added a new trie-indexed SSTable format with better lookup efficiency and size. The new format removes the index\n      summary component and does not require key caching. Additionally, it is able to efficiently search in partitions\n      spanning thousands or millions of rows.\n      The format is applied by setting \"bti\" as the selected sstable format in cassandra.yaml's sstables option.\n    - Added a new configuration cdc_on_repair_enabled to toggle whether CDC mutations are replayed through the\n      write path on streaming, e.g. repair. When enabled, CDC data streamed to the destination node will be written into\n      commit log first. When disabled, the streamed CDC data is written into SSTables just the same as normal streaming.\n      If this is set to false, streaming will be considerably faster however it's possible that, in extreme situations\n      (losing > quorum # nodes in a replica set), you may have data in your SSTables that never makes it to the CDC log.\n      The default is true/enabled. The configuration can be altered via JMX.\n    - Added support for reading the write times and TTLs of the elements of collections and UDTs, regardless of being\n      frozen or not. The CQL functions writetime, maxwritetime and ttl can now be applied to entire collections/UDTs,\n      single collection/UDT elements and slices of collection/UDT elements.\n    - Added a new CQL function, maxwritetime. It shows the largest unix timestamp that the data was written, similar to\n      its sibling CQL function, writetime.\n    - New Guardrails added:\n      - Whether ALTER TABLE commands are allowed to mutate columns\n      - Whether SimpleStrategy is allowed on keyspace creation or alteration\n      - Maximum replication factor\n      - Whether DROP KEYSPACE commands are allowed.\n      - Column value size\n      - Partition size\n      - Partition tombstones\n      - Vector dimensions\n      - Whether it is possible to execute secondary index queries without restricting on partition key\n      - Warning and failure thresholds for maximum referenced SAI indexes on a replica when executing a SELECT query\n      - Warning and failure thresholds for the size of terms written to an SAI index\n    - It is possible to list ephemeral snapshots by nodetool listsnaphots command when flag \"-e\" is specified.\n    - Added a new flag to `nodetool profileload` and JMX endpoint to set up recurring profile load generation on specified\n      intervals (see CASSANDRA-17821)\n    - Added a new property, gossiper.loose_empty_enabled, to allow for a looser definition of \"empty\" when\n      considering the heartbeat state of another node in Gossip. This should only be used by knowledgeable\n      operators in the following scenarios:\n\n      Currently \"empty\" w/regards to heartbeat state in Gossip is very specific to a single edge case (i.e. in\n      isEmptyWithoutStatus() our usage of hbState() + applicationState), however there are other failure cases which\n      block host replacements and require intrusive workarounds and human intervention to recover from when you\n      have something in hbState() you don't expect. See CASSANDRA-17842 for further details.\n    - Added new CQL table property 'allow_auto_snapshot' which is by default true. When set to false and 'auto_snapshot: true'\n      in cassandra.yaml, there will be no snapshot taken when a table is truncated or dropped. When auto_snapshot in\n      casandra.yaml is set to false, the newly added table property does not have any effect.\n    - Changed default on resumable bootstrap to be disabled. Resumable bootstrap has edge cases with potential correctness\n      violations or data loss scenarios if nodes go down during bootstrap, tombstones are written, and operations race with\n      repair. As streaming is considerably faster in the 4.0+ era (as well as with zero copy streaming), the risks of\n      having these edge cases during a failed and resumed bootstrap are no longer deemed acceptable.\n      To re-enable this feature, use the -Dcassandra.reset_bootstrap_progress=false environment flag.\n    - Added --older-than and --older-than-timestamp options to nodetool clearsnapshot command. It is possible to\n      clear snapshots which are older than some period for example, \"--older-than 5h\" to remove\n      snapshots older than 5 hours and it is possible to clear all snapshots older than some timestamp, for example\n      --older-than-timestamp 2022-12-03T10:15:30Z.\n    - Cassandra logs can be viewed in the virtual table system_views.system_logs.\n      Please uncomment the respective appender in logback.xml file to make logs flow into this table. This feature is turned off by default.\n    - Added new CQL table property 'incremental_backups' which is by default true. When 'incremental_backups' property in cassandra.yaml\n      is set to true and table property is set to false, incremental backups for that specific table will not be done.\n      When 'incremental_backups' in casandra.yaml is set to false, the newly added table property does not have any effect.\n      Both properties have to be set to true (cassandra.yaml and table property) in order to make incremental backups.\n    - Added new CQL native scalar functions for collections. The new functions are mostly analogous to the existing\n      aggregation functions, but they operate on the elements of collection columns. The new functions are `map_keys`,\n      `map_values`, `collection_count`, `collection_min`, `collection_max`, `collection_sum` and `collection_avg`.\n    - Added compaction_properties column to system.compaction_history table and nodetool compactionhistory command\n    - SimpleSeedProvider can resolve multiple IP addresses per DNS record. SimpleSeedProvider reacts on\n      the paramater called `resolve_multiple_ip_addresses_per_dns_record` which value is meant to be boolean and by\n      default it is set to false. When set to true, SimpleSeedProvider will resolve all IP addresses per DNS record,\n      based on the configured name service on the system.\n    - Added new native CQL functions for data masking, allowing to replace or obscure sensitive data. The functions are:\n      - `mask_null` replaces the column value by null.\n      - `mask_default` replaces the data by a fixed default value of the same type.\n      - `mask_replace` replaces the data by a custom value.\n      - `mask_inner` replaces every character but the first and last ones by a fixed character.\n      - `mask_outer` replaces the first and last characters by a fixed character.\n      - `mask_hash` replaces the data by its hash, according to the specified algorithm.\n    - On virtual tables, it is not strictly necessary to specify `ALLOW FILTERING` for select statements which would\n      normally require it, except `system_views.system_logs`.\n    - More accurate skipping of sstables in read path due to better handling of min/max clustering and lower bound;\n      SSTable format has been bumped to 'oa' because there are new fields in stats metadata\\\n    - Added MaxSSTableSize and MaxSSTableDuration metrics to TableMetrics. The former returns the size of the biggest \n      SSTable of a table or 0 when there is not any SSTable. The latter returns the maximum duration, computed as \n      `maxTimestamp - minTimestamp`, effectively non-zero for SSTables produced by TimeWindowCompactionStrategy.\n    - Added local read/write ratio to tablestats.\n    - Added system_views.max_sstable_size and system_views.max_sstable_duration tables.\n    - Added virtual table system_views.snapshots to see all snapshots from CQL shell.\n    - Added support for attaching CQL dynamic data masking functions to table columns on the schema. These masking\n      functions can be attached to or dettached from columns with CREATE/ALTER TABLE statements. The functions obscure\n      the masked data during queries, but they don't change the stored data.\n    - Added new UNMASK permission. It allows to see the clear data of columns with an attached mask. Superusers have it\n      by default, whereas regular users don't have it by default.\n    - Added new SELECT_MASKED permission. It allows to run SELECT queries selecting the clear values of masked columns.\n      Superusers have it by default, whereas regular users don't have it by default.\n    - Added support for using UDFs as masking functions attached to table columns on the schema.\n    - Added `sstablepartitions` offline tool to find large partitions in sstables.\n    - `cassandra-stress` has a new option called '-jmx' which enables a user to pass username and password to JMX (CASSANDRA-18544)\n    - It is possible to read all credentials for `cassandra-stress` from a file via option `-credentials-file` (CASSANDRA-18544)\n    - nodetool info displays bootstrap state a node is in as well as if it was decommissioned or if it failed to decommission (CASSANDRA-18555)\n    - Added snitch for Microsoft Azure of name AzureSnitch (CASSANDRA-18646)\n    - legacy command line options from cassandra-stress were removed\n    - `-mode` option in cassandra-stress has `native` and `cql3` as defaults and they do not need to be specified\n    - Allow to write the commitlog using direct I/O. Direct I/O is a new feature that minimizes cache effects and\n      memory-mapping overhead by using user-space buffers. This helps in transferring data from/to disk at high speed.\n      Java enabled support for the direct I/O feature from version 10 onwards - see JDK-8164900 for reference. (CASSANDRA-18464)\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Default disk_access_mode value changed from \"auto\" to \"mmap_index_only\". Override this setting with \"disk_access_mode: auto\" on\n      cassandra.yaml to keep the previous default. See CASSANDRA-19021 for details.\n    - The Python versions recommended for running cqlsh have been bumped from 3.6+ to 3.8-3.11. Python 3.6-3.7 are now \n      deprecated, as they have reached end-of-life, and support will be removed in a future major release.\n    - Java 8 has been removed. Lowest supported version is Java 11.\n    - Ephemeral marker files for snapshots done by repairs are not created anymore,\n      there is a dedicated flag in snapshot manifest instead. On upgrade of a node to this version, on node's start, in case there\n      are such ephemeral snapshots on disk, they will be deleted (same behaviour as before) and any new ephemeral snapshots\n      will stop to create ephemeral marker files as flag in a snapshot manifest was introduced instead.\n    - There were new table properties introduced called 'allow_auto_snapshot' and 'incremental_backups' (see section 'New features'). Hence, upgraded\n      node will be on a new schema version. Please do a rolling upgrade of nodes of a cluster to converge to one schema version.\n    - All previous versions of 4.x contained a mistake on the implementation of the old CQL native protocol v3. That\n     mistake produced issues when paging over tables with compact storage and a single clustering column during rolling\n     upgrades involving 3.x and 4.x nodes. The fix for that issue makes it can now appear during rolling upgrades from\n     4.1.0 or 4.0.0-4.0.7. If that is your case, please use protocol v4 or higher in your driver. See CASSANDRA-17507\n     for further details.\n   - Added API for alternative sstable implementations. For details, see src/java/org/apache/cassandra/io/sstable/SSTable_API.md\n   - DateTieredCompactionStrategy was removed. Please change the compaction strategy for the tables using this strategy\n     to TimeWindowCompactionStrategy before upgrading to this version.\n   - The deprecated functions `dateOf` and `unixTimestampOf` have been removed. They were deprecated and replaced by\n     `toTimestamp` and `toUnixTimestamp` in Cassandra 2.2.\n   - Hadoop integration is no longer available (CASSANDRA-18323). If you want to process Cassandra data by big data frameworks, \n     please upgrade your infrastructure to use Cassandra Spark connector.\n   - Keystore/truststore password configurations are nullable now and the code defaults of those passwords to 'cassandra' are\n     removed. Any deployments that depend upon the code default to this password value without explicitly specifying\n     it in cassandra.yaml will fail on upgrade. Please specify your keystore_password and truststore_password elements in cassandra.yaml with appropriate\n     values to prevent this failure.\n   - Please beware that if you use Ec2Snitch or Ec2MultiRegionSnitch, by default it will \n     communicate with AWS IMDS of version 2. This change is transparent, there does not need \n     to be done anything upon upgrade. Furthermore, IMDS of version 2 can be configured to be required in AWS EC2 console.\n     Consult cassandra-rackdc.properties for more details. (CASSANDRA-16555)\n    - JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=BufferPool` without scope has been removed.\n      Use instead `org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=BufferPool,scope=chunk-cache`.  (CASSANDRA-17668)\n    - Upon upgrade, when cassandra.yaml does not contain `crypto_provider` configuration section, crypto providers from JRE installation will be used\n      and no installation of DefaultCryptoProvider installing Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider will be conducted. \n      You need to explicitly add this section to the old yaml if it does not contain it yet to enable Amazon Corretto Crypto Provider for such node. \n      New deployments have `crypto_provider` uncommented with DefaultCryptoProvider hence Corretto provider will be installed automatically for corresponding architecture.\n    - `commitlog_sync_batch_window_in_ms` configuration property in cassandra.yaml was removed. Please ensure your configuration is not using this property.\n    - The pluggable metrics reporter called metrics-reporter-config is removed. The way that metrics can be exported is\n      fully covered by the dropwizard metrics library itself, using e.g. CsvReporter. See CASSANDRA-18743 for more details.\n    - Deprecated CQL compression parameters for table, `sstable_compression` and `chunk_length_kb`, were removed. Please use `class` and `chunk_length_in_kb` instead.\n\n\nDeprecation\n-----------\n    - Deprecated code in Cassandra 1.x and 2.x was removed. See CASSANDRA-18959 for more details.\n    - In the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=RepairService` (CASSANDRA-17668):\n        - deprecate the getter/setter methods `getRepairSessionSpaceInMebibytes` and `setRepairSessionSpaceInMebibytes`\n          in favor of `getRepairSessionSpaceInMiB` and `setRepairSessionSpaceInMiB` respectively\n    - In the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService` (CASSANDRA-17668):\n        - deprecate the getter/setter methods `getRepairSessionMaxTreeDepth` and `setRepairSessionMaxTreeDepth`\n          in favor of `getRepairSessionMaximumTreeDepth` and `setRepairSessionMaximumTreeDepth`\n        - deprecate the setter method `setColumnIndexSize` in favor of `setColumnIndexSizeInKiB`\n        - deprecate the getter/setter methods `getColumnIndexCacheSize` and `setColumnIndexCacheSize` in favor of\n          `getColumnIndexCacheSizeInKiB` and `setColumnIndexCacheSizeInKiB` respectively\n        - deprecate the getter/setter methods `getBatchSizeWarnThreshold` and `setBatchSizeWarnThreshold` in favor of\n          `getBatchSizeWarnThresholdInKiB` and `setBatchSizeWarnThresholdInKiB` respectively\n    - All native CQL functions names that don't use the snake case names are deprecated in favour of equivalent names\n      using snake casing. Thus, `totimestamp` is deprecated in favour of `to_timestamp`, `intasblob` in favour\n      of `int_as_blob`, `castAsInt` in favour of `cast_as_int`, etc.\n    - The config property `compaction_large_partition_warning_threshold` has been deprecated in favour of the new\n      guardrail for partition size. That guardrail is based on the properties `partition_size_warn_threshold` and\n      `partition_size_fail_threshold`. The warn threshold has a very similar behaviour to the old config property.\n      The old property is still supported for backward compatibility, but now it is disabled by default.\n    - The config property `compaction_tombstone_warning_threshold` has been deprecated in favour of the new guardrail\n      for partition tombstones. That guardrail is based on the properties `partition_tombstones_warn_threshold` and\n      `partition_tombstones_fail_threshold`. The warn threshold has a very similar behaviour to the old config property.\n      The old property is still supported for backward compatibility, but now it is disabled by default.\n    - CloudstackSnitch is marked as deprecated and it is not actively maintained anymore. It is scheduled to be removed \n      in the next major version of Cassandra.\n    - Usage of dual native ports (native_transport_port and native_transport_port_ssl) is deprecated and will be removed\n      in a future release. A single native port can be used for both encrypted and unencrypted traffic; see CASSANDRA-10559.\n      Cluster hosts running with dual native ports were not correctly identified in the system.peers tables and server-sent EVENTs,\n      causing clients that encrypt traffic to fail to maintain correct connection pools. For more information, see CASSANDRA-19392.\n    - Deprecated `use_deterministic_table_id` in cassandra.yaml. Table IDs may still be supplied explicitly on CREATE.\n\n4.1\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - Added API for alternative memtable implementations. For details, see\n      src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/memtable/Memtable_API.md\n    - Added a new guardrails framework allowing to define soft/hard limits for different user actions, such as limiting\n      the number of tables, columns per table or the size of collections. These guardrails are only applied to regular\n      user queries, and superusers and internal queries are excluded. Reaching the soft limit raises a client warning,\n      whereas reaching the hard limit aborts the query. In both cases a log message and a diagnostic event are emitted.\n      Additionally, some guardrails are not linked to specific user queries due to techincal limitations, such as\n      detecting the size of large collections during compaction or periodically monitoring the disk usage. These\n      guardrails would only emit the proper logs and diagnostic events when triggered, without aborting any processes.\n      Guardrails config is defined through cassandra.yaml properties, and they can be dynamically updated through the\n      JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=Guardrails`. There are guardrails for:\n        - Number of user keyspaces.\n        - Number of user tables.\n        - Number of columns per table.\n        - Number of secondary indexes per table.\n        - Number of materialized tables per table.\n        - Number of fields per user-defined type.\n        - Number of items in a collection .\n        - Number of partition keys selected by an IN restriction.\n        - Number of partition keys selected by the cartesian product of multiple IN restrictions.\n        - Allowed table properties.\n        - Allowed read consistency levels.\n        - Allowed write consistency levels.\n        - Collections size.\n        - Query page size.\n        - Minimum replication factor.\n        - Data disk usage, defined either as a percentage or as an absolute size.\n        - Whether user-defined timestamps are allowed.\n        - Whether GROUP BY queries are allowed.\n        - Whether the creation of secondary indexes is allowed.\n        - Whether the creation of uncompressed tables is allowed.\n        - Whether querying with ALLOW FILTERING is allowed.\n        - Whether DROP or TRUNCATE TABLE commands are allowed.\n    - Add support for the use of pure monotonic functions on the last attribute of the GROUP BY clause.\n    - Add floor functions that can be use to group by time range.\n    - Support for native transport rate limiting via native_transport_rate_limiting_enabled and\n      native_transport_max_requests_per_second in cassandra.yaml.\n    - Support for pre hashing passwords on CQL DCL commands\n    - Expose all client options via system_views.clients and nodetool clientstats --client-options.\n    - Add new nodetool compactionstats --vtable option to match the sstable_tasks vtable.\n    - Support for String concatenation has been added through the + operator.\n    - New configuration max_hints_size_per_host to limit the size of local hints files per host in mebibytes. Setting to\n      non-positive value disables the limit, which is the default behavior. Setting to a positive value to ensure\n      the total size of the hints files per host does not exceed the limit.\n    - Added ability to configure auth caches through corresponding `nodetool` commands.\n    - CDC data flushing now can be configured to be non-blocking with the configuration cdc_block_writes. Setting to true,\n      any writes to the CDC-enabled tables will be blocked when reaching to the limit for CDC data on disk, which is the\n      existing and the default behavior. Setting to false, the writes to the CDC-enabled tables will be accepted and\n      the oldest CDC data on disk will be deleted to ensure the size constraint.\n    - Top partitions based on partition size or tombstone count are now tracked per table. These partitions are stored\n      in a new system.top_partitions table and exposed via JMX and nodetool tablestats. The partitions are tracked\n      during full or validation repairs but not incremental ones since those don't include all sstables and the partition\n      size/tombstone count would not be correct.\n    - New native functions to convert unix time values into C* native types: toDate(bigint), toTimestamp(bigint),\n      mintimeuuid(bigint) and maxtimeuuid(bigint)\n    - Support for multiple permission in a single GRANT/REVOKE/LIST statement has been added. It allows to\n      grant/revoke/list multiple permissions using a single statement by providing a list of comma-separated\n      permissions.\n    - A new ALL TABLES IN KEYSPACE resource has been added. It allows to grant permissions for all tables and user types\n      in a keyspace while preventing the user to use those permissions on the keyspace itself.\n    - Added support for type casting in the WHERE clause components and in the values of INSERT and UPDATE statements.\n    - A new implementation of Paxos (named v2) has been included that improves the safety and performance of LWT operations.\n      Importantly, v2 guarantees linearizability across safe range movements, so users are encouraged to enable v2.\n      v2 also halves the number of WAN messages required to be exchanged if used on conjunction with the new Paxos Repair\n      mechanism (see below) and with some minor modifications to applications using LWTs.\n      The new implementation may be enabled at any time by setting paxos_variant: v2, and disabled by setting to v1,\n      and this alone will reduce the number of WAN round-trips by between one and two for reads, and one for writes.\n    - A new Paxos Repair mechanism has been introduced as part of Repair, that permits further reducing the number of WAN\n      round-trips for write LWTs. This process may be manually executed for v1 and is run automatically alongside normal\n      repairs for v2. Once users are running regular repairs that include paxos repairs they are encouraged to set\n      paxos_state_purging: repaired. Once this has been set across the cluster, users are encouraged to set their\n      applications to supply a Commit consistency level of ANY with their LWT write operations, saving one additional WAN\n      round-trip. See upgrade notes below.\n    - Warn/fail thresholds added to read queries notifying clients when these thresholds trigger (by\n      emitting a client warning or failing the query).  This feature is disabled by default, scheduled\n      to be enabled in 4.2; it is controlled with the configuration read_thresholds_enabled,\n      setting to true will enable this feature.  Each check has its own warn/fail thresholds, currently\n      tombstones (tombstone_warn_threshold, and tombstone_failure_threshold), coordinator result set\n      materialized size (coordinator_read_size_warn_threshold and coordinator_read_size_fail_threshold),\n      local read materialized heap size\n      (local_read_size_warn_threshold and local_read_size_fail_threshold),\n      and RowIndexEntry estimated memory size (row_index_read_size_warn_threshold and\n      row_index_read_size_fail_threshold) are supported; more checks will be added over time.\n    - Prior to this version, the hint system was storing a window of hints as defined by\n      configuration property max_hint_window_in_ms, however this window is not persistent across restarts.\n      For example, if a node is restarted, it will be still eligible for a hint to be sent to it because it\n      was down less than max_hint_window_in_ms. Hence if that node continues restarting without hint delivery completing,\n      hints will be sent to that node indefinitely which would occupy more and more disk space.\n      This behaviour was changed in CASSANDRA-14309. From now on, by default, if a node is not down longer than\n      max_hint_window_in_ms, there is an additional check to see if there is a hint to be delivered which is older\n      than max_window_in_ms. If there is, a hint is not persisted. If there is not, it is.\n      This behaviour might be reverted as it was in previous version by property hint_window_persistent_enabled by\n      setting it to false. This property is by default set to true.\n    - Added a new feature to allow denylisting (i.e. blocking read, write, or range read configurable) access to partition\n      keys in configured keyspaces and tables. See doc/operating/denylisting_partitions.rst for details on using this new\n      feature. Also see CASSANDRA-12106.\n    - Information about pending hints is now available through `nodetool listpendinghints` and `pending_hints` virtual\n      table.\n    - Added ability to invalidate auth caches through corresponding `nodetool` commands and virtual tables.\n    - DCL statements in audit logs will now obscure only the password if they don't fail to parse.\n    - Starting from 4.1 sstables support UUID based generation identifiers. They are globally unique and thus they let\n      the node to create sstables without any prior knowledge about the existing sstables in the data directory.\n      The feature is disabled by default in cassandra.yaml because once enabled, there is no easy way to downgrade.\n      When the node is restarted with UUID based generation identifiers enabled, each newly created sstable will have\n      a UUID based generation identifier and such files are not readable by previous Cassandra versions. In the future\n      those new identifiers will become enabled by default.\n    - Resetting schema behavior has changed in 4.1 so that: 1) resetting schema is prohibited when there is no live node\n      where the schema could be fetched from, and 2) truncating local schema keyspace is postponed to the moment when\n      the node receives schema from some other node.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - `cache_load_timeout_seconds` being negative for disabled is equivalent to `cache_load_timeout` = 0 for disabled.\n    - `sstable_preemptive_open_interval_in_mb` being negative for disabled is equivalent to `sstable_preemptive_open_interval`\n      being null again. In the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService`, the setter method\n      `setSSTablePreemptiveOpenIntervalInMB`still takes `intervalInMB` negative numbers for disabled.\n    - `enable_uuid_sstable_identifiers` parameter from 4.1 alpha1 was renamed to `uuid_sstable_identifiers_enabled`.\n    - `index_summary_resize_interval_in_minutes = -1` is equivalent to index_summary_resize_interval being set to `null` or\n      disabled. In the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=IndexSummaryManager`, the setter method `setResizeIntervalInMinutes` still takes\n      `resizeIntervalInMinutes = -1` for disabled.\n    - min_tracked_partition_size_bytes parameter from 4.1 alpha1 was renamed to min_tracked_partition_size.\n    - Parameters of type data storage, duration and data rate cannot be set to Long.MAX_VALUE (former parameters of long type)\n      and Integer.MAX_VALUE (former parameters of int type). Those numbers are used during conversion between units to prevent\n      an overflow from happening. (CASSANDRA-17571)\n    - We added new JMX methods `setStreamThroughputMbitPerSec`, `getStreamThroughputMbitPerSec`, `setInterDCStreamThroughputMbitPerSec`,\n      `getInterDCStreamThroughputMbitPerSec` to the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService`. They replace the now\n      deprecated methods `setStreamThroughputMbPerSec`, `getStreamThroughputMbPerSec`, `setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec`, and\n      `getInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec`, which will be removed in a future major release.\n    - The config property `repair_session_space_in_mb` was wrongly advertised in previous versions that it should be set in\n      megabytes when it is interpreted internally in mebibytes. To reduce the confusion we added two new JMX methods\n      `setRepairSessionSpaceInMebibytes(int sizeInMebibytes)` and `getRepairSessionSpaceInMebibytes`. They replace the now\n      deprecated methods `setRepairSessionSpaceInMegabytes(int sizeInMegabytes)` and `getRepairSessionSpaceInMegabytes`, which\n      will be removed in a future major release.\n    - There is a new cassandra.yaml version 2. Units suffixes should be provided for all rates(B/s|KiB/s|MiB/s),\n      memory (B|KiB|MiB|GiB) and duration(d|h|m|s|ms|us|µs|ns)\n      parameters. List of changed parameters and details to consider during configuration setup can be\n      found at https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/new/configuration.html. (CASSANDRA-15234)\n      Backward compatibility with the old cassandra.yaml file will be in place until at least the next major version.\n      By default we refuse starting Cassandra with a config containing both old and new config keys for the same parameter. Start\n      Cassandra with -Dcassandra.allow_new_old_config_keys=true to override. For historical reasons duplicate config keys\n      in cassandra.yaml are allowed by default, start Cassandra with -Dcassandra.allow_duplicate_config_keys=false to disallow this.\n    - Many cassandra.yaml parameters' names have been changed. Full list and details to consider during configuration setup\n      when installing/upgrading Cassandra can be found at https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cassandra/new/configuration.html (CASSANDRA-15234)\n    - Negative values cannot be used for parameters of type data rate, duration and data storage with both old and new cassandra.yaml version.\n      Only exception is if you use old cassandra.yaml, pre-CASSANDRA-15234 - then -1 or other negative values which were advertised as an option\n      to disable config parameters in the old cassandra.yaml are still used. Those are probably converted to null value with the new cassandra.yaml,\n      as written in the new cassandra.yaml version and docs.\n    - Before you upgrade, if you are using `cassandra.auth_bcrypt_gensalt_log2_rounds` property,\n      confirm it is set to value lower than 31 otherwise Cassandra will fail to start. See CASSANDRA-9384\n      for further details. You also need to regenerate passwords for users for who the password\n      was created while the above property was set to be more than 30 otherwise they will not be able to log in.\n    - JNA library was updated from 5.6.0 to 5.9.0. In version 5.7.0, Darwin support for M1 devices\n      was fixed but prebuild native library for Darwin x86 (32bit Java on Mac OS) was removed.\n    - The config properties for setting the streaming throughput `stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec` and\n      `inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec` were incorrectly interpreted as mebibits. This has\n      been fixed by CASSANDRA-17243, so the values for these properties will now indicate a throughput ~4.6% lower than\n      what was actually applied in previous versions. This also affects the setters and getters for these properties in\n      the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService` and the nodetool commands `set/getstreamthroughput`\n      and `set/getinterdcstreamthroughput`.\n    - Steps for upgrading Paxos\n        - Set paxos_variant: v2 across the cluster. This may be set via JMX, but should also be written\n          persistently to any yaml.\n        - Ensure paxos repairs are running regularly, either as part of normal incremental repair workflows or on their\n          own separate schedule. These operations are cheap and better to run frequently (e.g. once per hour)\n        - Set paxos_state_purging: repaired across the cluster.  This may be set via JMX, but should also be written\n          persistently to any yaml. NOTE: once this has been set, you must not restore paxos_state_purging: legacy. If\n          this setting must be disabled you must instead set paxos_state_purging: gc_grace. This may be necessary if\n          paxos repairs must be disabled for some reason on an extended basis, but in this case your applications must\n          restore default commit consistency to ensure correctness.\n        - Applications may now safely be updated to use ANY commit consistency level (or LOCAL_QUORUM, as preferred).\n          Uncontended writes should now take 2 round-trips, and uncontended reads should typically take one round-trip.\n    - A required [f|force] flag has been added to both \"nodetool verify\" and the standalone \"sstableverify\" tools.\n      These tools have some subtleties and should not be used unless the operator is familiar with what they do\n      and do not do, as well as the edge cases associated with their use.\n      NOTE: ANY SCRIPTS THAT RELY ON sstableverify OR nodetool verify WILL STOP WORKING UNTIL MODIFIED.\n      Please see CASSANDRA-17017 for details: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-17017\n    - `MutationExceededMaxSizeException` thrown when a mutation exceeds `max_mutation_size` inherits\n      from `InvalidRequestException` instead of `RuntimeException`. See CASSANDRA-17456 for details.\n\nDeprecation\n-----------\n    - In the command line options for `org.apache.cassandra.tools.LoaderOptions`: deprecate the `-t`, `--throttle`,\n      `-idct`, and `--inter-dc-throttle` options for setting the throttle and inter-datacenter throttle options in\n      Mbps. Instead, users are instructed to use the `--throttle-mib`, and `--inter-dc-throttle-mib` for setting the\n      throttling options in MiB/s. Additionally, in the loader options builder\n      `org.apache.cassandra.tools.LoaderOptions$Builder`: deprecate the `throttle(int)`, `interDcThrottle(int)`,\n      `entireSSTableThrottle(int)`, and the `entireSSTableInterDcThrottle(int)` methods.\n    - In the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService`: deprecate getter method `getStreamThroughputMbitPerSec`\n      in favor of getter method `getStreamThroughputMbitPerSecAsDouble`; deprecate getter method `getStreamThroughputMbPerSec`\n      in favor of getter methods `getStreamThroughputMebibytesPerSec` and `getStreamThroughputMebibytesPerSecAsDouble`;\n      deprecate getter method `getInterDCStreamThroughputMbitPerSec` in favor of getter method `getInterDCStreamThroughputMbitPerSecAsDouble`;\n      deprecate getter method `getInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec` in favor of getter methods `getInterDCStreamThroughputMebibytesPerSecAsDouble`;\n      deprecate getter method `getCompactionThroughputMbPerSec` in favor of getter methods `getCompactionThroughtputMibPerSecAsDouble`\n      and `getCompactionThroughtputBytesPerSec`; deprecate setter methods `setStreamThroughputMbPerSec` and `setStreamThroughputMbitPerSec`\n      in favor of `setStreamThroughputMebibytesPerSec`; deprecate setter methods `setInterDCStreamThroughputMbitPerSec` and\n      `setInterDCStreamThroughputMbPerSec` in favor of `setInterDCStreamThroughputMebibytesPerSec`. The deprecated JMX methods\n      may return a rounded value so if precision is important, you want to use the new getters. While those deprecated JMX getters\n      will return a rounded number, the nodetool commands `getstreamthroughput` and `getinterdcstreamthroughput`\n      will throw Runtime Exceptions advising to use the new -d flag in case an integer cannot be returned. See CASSANDRA-17725 for further details.\n    - Deprecate public method `setRate(final double throughputMbPerSec)` in `Compaction Manager` in favor of\n      `setRateInBytes(final double throughputBytesPerSec)`\n    - `withBufferSizeInMB(int size)` in `StressCQLSSTableWriter.Builder` class is deprecated in favor of `withBufferSizeInMiB(int size)`\n      No change of functionality in the new one, only name change for clarity in regards to units and to follow naming\n      standartization.\n    - `withBufferSizeInMB(int size)` in `CQLSSTableWriter.Builder` class is deprecated in favor of `withBufferSizeInMiB(int size)`\n      No change of functionality in the new one, only name change for clarity in regards to units and to follow naming\n      standartization.\n    - The properties `keyspace_count_warn_threshold` and `table_count_warn_threshold` in cassandra.yaml have been\n      deprecated in favour of the new `keyspaces_warn_threshold` and `tables_warn_threshold` properties and will be removed\n      in a subsequent major version. This also affects the setters and getters for those properties in the JMX MBean\n      `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=StorageService`, which are equally deprecated in favour of the analogous methods\n      in the JMX MBean `org.apache.cassandra.db:type=Guardrails`. See CASSANDRA-17195 for further details.\n    - The functionality behind the property `windows_timer_interval` was removed as part of CASSANDRA-16956. The\n      property is still present but it is deprecated and it is just a place-holder to prevent breaking upgrades. This\n      property is expected to be fully removed in the next major release of Cassandra.\n\n4.0\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - Full support for Java 11, it is not experimental anymore.\n    - The data of the system keyspaces using a local strategy (at the exception of the system.batches,\n      system.paxos, system.compaction_history, system.prepared_statements and system.repair tables)\n      is now stored by default in the first data directory, instead of being distributed among all\n      the data directories. This approach will allow the server to tolerate the failure of the other disks.\n      To ensure that a disk failure will not bring a node down, it is possible to use the system_data_file_directory\n      yaml property to store the local system keyspaces data on a directory that provides redundancy.\n      On node startup the local system keyspaces data will be automatically migrated if needed to the\n      correct location.\n    - Nodes will now bootstrap all intra-cluster connections at startup by default and wait\n      10 seconds for the all but one node in the local data center to be connected and marked\n      UP in gossip. This prevents nodes from coordinating requests and failing because they\n      aren't able to connect to the cluster fast enough. block_for_peers_timeout_in_secs in\n      cassandra.yaml can be used to configure how long to wait (or whether to wait at all)\n      and block_for_peers_in_remote_dcs can be used to also block on all but one node in\n      each remote DC as well. See CASSANDRA-14297 and CASSANDRA-13993 for more information.\n    - *Experimental* support for Transient Replication and Cheap Quorums introduced by CASSANDRA-14404\n      The intended audience for this functionality is expert users of Cassandra who are prepared\n      to validate every aspect of the database for their application and deployment practices. Future\n      releases of Cassandra will make this feature suitable for a wider audience.\n    - *Experimental* support for Java 11 has been added. JVM options that differ between or are\n      specific for Java 8 and 11 have been moved from jvm.options into jvm8.options and jvm11.options.\n      IMPORTANT: Running C* on Java 11 is *experimental* and do it at your own risk.\n    - LCS now respects the max_threshold parameter when compacting - this was hard coded to 32\n      before, but now it is possible to do bigger compactions when compacting from L0 to L1.\n      This also applies to STCS-compactions in L0 - if there are more than 32 sstables in L0\n      we will compact at most max_threshold sstables in an L0 STCS compaction. See CASSANDRA-14388\n      for more information.\n    - There is now an option to automatically upgrade sstables after Cassandra upgrade, enable\n      either in `cassandra.yaml:automatic_sstable_upgrade` or via JMX during runtime. See\n      CASSANDRA-14197.\n    - `nodetool refresh` has been deprecated in favour of `nodetool import` - see CASSANDRA-6719\n      for details\n    - An experimental option to compare all merkle trees together has been added - for example, in\n      a 3 node cluster with 2 replicas identical and 1 out-of-date, with this option enabled, the\n      out-of-date replica will only stream a single copy from up-to-date replica. Enable it by adding\n      \"-os\" to nodetool repair. See CASSANDRA-3200.\n    - The currentTimestamp, currentDate, currentTime and currentTimeUUID functions have been added.\n      See CASSANDRA-13132\n    - Support for arithmetic operations between `timestamp`/`date` and `duration` has been added.\n      See CASSANDRA-11936\n    - Support for arithmetic operations on number has been added. See CASSANDRA-11935\n    - Preview expected streaming required for a repair (nodetool repair --preview), and validate the\n      consistency of repaired data between nodes (nodetool repair --validate). See CASSANDRA-13257\n    - Support for selecting Map values and Set elements has been added for SELECT queries. See CASSANDRA-7396\n    - Change-Data-Capture has been modified to make CommitLogSegments available\n      immediately upon creation via hard-linking the files. This means that incomplete\n      segments will be available in cdc_raw rather than fully flushed. See documentation\n      and CASSANDRA-12148 for more detail.\n    - The initial build of materialized views can be parallelized. The number of concurrent builder\n      threads is specified by the property `cassandra.yaml:concurrent_materialized_view_builders`.\n      This property can be modified at runtime through both JMX and the new `setconcurrentviewbuilders`\n      and `getconcurrentviewbuilders` nodetool commands. See CASSANDRA-12245 for more details.\n    - There is now a binary full query log based on Chronicle Queue that can be controlled using\n      nodetool enablefullquerylog, disablefullquerylog, and resetfullquerylog. The log\n      contains all queries invoked, approximate time they were invoked, any parameters necessary\n      to bind wildcard values, and all query options. A human readable version of the log can be\n      dumped or tailed using the new bin/fqltool utility. The full query log is designed to be safe\n      to use in production and limits utilization of heap memory and disk space with limits\n      you can specify when enabling the log.\n      See nodetool and fqltool help text for more information.\n    - SSTableDump now supports the -l option to output each partition as it's own json object\n      See CASSANDRA-13848 for more detail\n    - Metric for coordinator writes per table has been added. See CASSANDRA-14232\n    - Nodetool cfstats now has options to sort by various metrics as well as limit results.\n    - Operators can restrict login user activity to one or more datacenters. See `network_authorizer`\n      in cassandra.yaml, and the docs for create and alter role statements. CASSANDRA-13985\n    - Roles altered from login=true to login=false will prevent existing connections from executing any\n      statements after the cache has been refreshed. CASSANDRA-13985\n    - Support for audit logging of database activity. If enabled, logs every incoming\n      CQL command request, Authentication (successful as well as unsuccessful login) to a node.\n    - Faster streaming of entire SSTables using ZeroCopy APIs. If enabled, Cassandra will use stream\n      entire SSTables, significantly speeding up transfers. Any streaming related operations will see\n      corresponding improvement. See CASSANDRA-14556.\n    - NetworkTopologyStrategy now supports auto-expanding the replication_factor\n      option into all available datacenters at CREATE or ALTER time. For example,\n      specifying replication_factor: 3 translates to three replicas in every\n      datacenter. This auto-expansion will _only add_ datacenters for safety.\n      See CASSANDRA-14303 for more details.\n    - Added Python 3 support so cqlsh and cqlshlib is now compatible with Python 2.7 and Python 3.6.\n      Added --python option to cqlsh so users can specify the path to their chosen Python interpreter.\n      See CASSANDRA-10190 for details.\n    - Support for server side DESCRIBE statements has been added. See CASSANDRA-14825\n    - It is now possible to rate limit snapshot creation/clearing. See CASSANDRA-13019\n    - Authentication reads and writes have been changed from a mix of ONE, LOCAL_ONE, and QUORUM\n      to LOCAL_QUORUM on reads and EACH_QUORUM on writes. This is configurable via cassandra.yaml with\n      auth_read_consistency_level and auth_write_consistency_level respectively. See CASSANDRA-12988.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - If you were on 4.0.1 - 4.0.5 and if you haven't set the compaction_thoroughput_mb_per_sec in your 4.0 cassandra.yaml\n      file but you relied on the internal default value,then compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec was equal to an old default\n      value of 16MiB/s in Cassandra 4.0. After CASSANDRA-17790 this is changed to 64MiB/s to match the default value in\n      cassandra.yaml. If you prefer the old one of 16MiB/s, you need to set it explicitly in your cassandra.yaml file.\n    - otc_coalescing_strategy, otc_coalescing_window_us, otc_coalescing_enough_coalesced_messages,\n      otc_backlog_expiration_interval_ms are deprecated and will be removed at earliest with next major release.\n      otc_coalescing_strategy is disabled since 3.11.\n    - As part of the Internode Messaging improvement work in CASSANDRA-15066, internode_send_buff_size_in_bytes and\n      internode_recv_buff_size_in_bytes were renamed to internode_socket_send_buffer_size_in_bytes and\n      internode_socket_receive_buffer_size_in_bytes. To support upgrades pre-4.0, we add backward compatibility and\n      currently both old and new names should work. Cassandra 4.0.0 and Cassandra 4.0.1 work ONLY with the new names\n      (They weren't updated in cassandra.yaml though).\n    - DESCRIBE|DESC was moved to server side in Cassandra 4.0. As a consequence DESCRIBE|DESC will not work in cqlsh 6.0.0\n      being connected to earlier major Cassandra versions where DESCRIBE does not exist server side.\n    - cqlsh shell startup script now prefers 'python3' before 'python' when identifying a runtime.\n    - As part of the Internode Messaging improvement work in CASSANDRA-15066, matching response verbs for every request\n      verb were introduced and verbs were renamed. DroppedMessageMetrics pre-4.0 are now available with _REQ suffix. As\n      part of CASSANDRA-16083, we added DroppedMessageMetrics backward compatibility layer which exposes the metrics with\n      their old names too. Only the value for verbs READ and RANGE_SLICE will differ from the same metrics in 3.11 as it\n      does not include anymore the responses dropped, only the requests. After being deprecated in 3.11 PAGED_RANGE was\n      fully removed in 4.0. ConditionNotMet metric has been moved under scope CASClientWriteRequestMetrtic but as part of\n      CASSANDRA-16083, backward compatibility layer was added so it can be still exposed under the old 3.11 scope.\n    - Native protocol v5 is promoted from beta in this release. The wire format has changed\n      significantly and users should take care to ensure client drivers are upgraded to a version\n      with support for the final v5 format, if currently connecting over v5-beta. (CASSANDRA-15299, CASSANDRA-14973)\n    - Cassandra removed support for the OldNetworkTopologyStrategy. Before upgrading you will need to change the\n      replication strategy for the keyspaces using this strategy to the NetworkTopologyStrategy. (CASSANDRA-13990)\n    - Sstables for tables using with a frozen UDT written by C* 3.0 appear as corrupted.\n\n      Background: The serialization-header in the -Statistics.db sstable component contains the type information\n      of the table columns. C* 3.0 write incorrect type information for frozen UDTs by omitting the\n      \"frozen\" information. Non-frozen UDTs were introduced by CASSANDRA-7423 in C* 3.6. Since then, the missing\n      \"frozen\" information leads to deserialization issues that result in CorruptSSTableExceptions, potentially other\n      exceptions as well.\n\n      As a mitigation, the sstable serialization-headers are rewritten to contain the missing \"frozen\" information for\n      UDTs once, when an upgrade from C* 3.0 is detected. This migration does not touch snapshots or backups.\n\n      The sstablescrub tool now performs a check of the sstable serialization-header against the schema. A mismatch of\n      the types in the serialization-header and the schema will cause sstablescrub to error out and stop by default.\n      See the new `-e` option. `-e off` disables the new validation code. `-e fix` or `-e fix-only`, e.g.\n      `sstablescrub -e fix keyspace table`, will validate the serialization-header, rewrite the non-frozen UDTs\n      in the serialzation-header to frozen UDTs, if that matches the schema, and continue with scrub.\n      See `sstablescrub -h`.\n      (CASSANDRA-15035)\n    - CASSANDRA-13241 lowered the default chunk_lengh_in_kb for compresesd tables from\n      64kb to 16kb. For highly compressible data this can have a noticeable impact\n      on space utilization. You may want to consider manually specifying this value.\n    - Additional columns have been added to system_distributed.repair_history,\n      system_traces.sessions and system_traces.events. As a result select queries\n      against these tables - including queries against tracing tables performed\n      automatically by the drivers and cqlsh - will fail and generate an error in the log\n      during upgrade when the cluster is mixed version. On 3.x side this will also lead\n      to broken internode connections and lost messages.\n      Cassandra versions 3.0.20 and 3.11.6 pre-add these columns (see CASSANDRA-15385),\n      so please make sure to upgrade to those versions or higher before upgrading to\n      4.0 for query tracing to not cause any issues during the upgrade to 4.0.\n    - Timestamp ties between values resolve differently: if either value has a TTL,\n      this value always wins. This is to provide consistent reconciliation before\n      and after the value expires into a tombstone.\n    - Support for legacy auth tables in the system_auth keyspace (users,\n      permissions, credentials) and the migration code has been removed. Migration\n      of these legacy auth tables must have been completed before the upgrade to\n      4.0 and the legacy tables must have been removed. See the 'Upgrading' section\n      for version 2.2 for migration instructions.\n    - Cassandra 4.0 removed support for the deprecated Thrift interface. Amongst\n      other things, this implies the removal of all yaml options related to thrift\n      ('start_rpc', rpc_port, ...).\n    - Cassandra 4.0 removed support for any pre-3.0 format. This means you\n      cannot upgrade from a 2.x version to 4.0 directly, you have to upgrade to\n      a 3.0.x/3.x version first (and run upgradesstable). In particular, this\n      mean Cassandra 4.0 cannot load or read pre-3.0 sstables in any way: you\n      will need to upgrade those sstable in 3.0.x/3.x first.\n    - Upgrades from 3.0.x or 3.x are supported since 3.0.13 or 3.11.0, previous\n      versions will causes issues during rolling upgrades (CASSANDRA-13274).\n    - Cassandra will no longer allow invalid keyspace replication options, such\n      as invalid datacenter names for NetworkTopologyStrategy. Operators MUST\n      add new nodes to a datacenter before they can set set ALTER or CREATE\n      keyspace replication policies using that datacenter. Existing keyspaces\n      will continue to operate, but CREATE and ALTER will validate that all\n      datacenters specified exist in the cluster.\n    - Cassandra 4.0 fixes a problem with incremental repair which caused repaired\n      data to be inconsistent between nodes. The fix changes the behavior of both\n      full and incremental repairs. For full repairs, data is no longer marked\n      repaired. For incremental repairs, anticompaction is run at the beginning\n      of the repair, instead of at the end. If incremental repair was being used\n      prior to upgrading, a full repair should be run after upgrading to resolve\n      any inconsistencies.\n    - Config option index_interval has been removed (it was deprecated since 2.0)\n    - Deprecated repair JMX APIs are removed.\n    - The version of snappy-java has been upgraded to 1.1.2.6\n    - the miniumum value for internode message timeouts is 10ms. Previously, any\n      positive value was allowed. See cassandra.yaml entries like\n      read_request_timeout_in_ms for more details.\n    - Cassandra 4.0 allows a single port to be used for both secure and insecure\n      connections between cassandra nodes (CASSANDRA-10404). See the yaml for\n      specific property changes, and see the security doc for full details.\n    - Due to the parallelization of the initial build of materialized views,\n      the per token range view building status is stored in the new table\n      `system.view_builds_in_progress`. The old table `system.views_builds_in_progress`\n      is no longer used and can be removed. See CASSANDRA-12245 for more details.\n    - Config option commitlog_sync_batch_window_in_ms has been deprecated as it's\n      documentation has been incorrect and the setting itself near useless.\n      Batch mode remains a valid commit log mode, however.\n    - There is a new commit log mode, group, which is similar to batch mode\n      but blocks for up to a configurable number of milliseconds between disk flushes.\n    - nodetool clearsnapshot now required the --all flag to remove all snapshots.\n      Previous behavior would delete all snapshots by default.\n    - Nodes are now identified by a combination of IP, and storage port.\n      Existing JMX APIs, nodetool, and system tables continue to work\n      and accept/return just an IP, but there is a new\n      version of each that works with the full unambiguous identifier.\n      You should prefer these over the deprecated ambiguous versions that only\n      work with an IP. This was done to support multiple instances per IP.\n      Additionally we are moving to only using a single port for encrypted and\n      unencrypted traffic and if you want multiple instances per IP you must\n      first switch encrypted traffic to the storage port and not a separate\n      encrypted port. If you want to use multiple instances per IP\n      with SSL you will need to use StartTLS on storage_port and set\n      outgoing_encrypted_port_source to gossip outbound connections\n      know what port to connect to for each instance. Before changing\n      storage port or native port at nodes you must first upgrade the entire cluster\n      and clients to 4.0 so they can handle the port not being consistent across\n      the cluster.\n    - Names of AWS regions/availability zones have been cleaned up to more correctly\n      match the Amazon names. There is now a new option in conf/cassandra-rackdc.properties\n      that lets users enable the correct names for new clusters, or use the legacy\n      names for existing clusters. See conf/cassandra-rackdc.properties for details.\n    - Background repair has been removed. dclocal_read_repair_chance and\n      read_repair_chance table options have been removed and are now rejected.\n      See CASSANDRA-13910 for details.\n    - Internode TCP connections that do not ack segments for 30s will now\n      be automatically detected and closed via the Linux TCP_USER_TIMEOUT\n      socket option. This should be exceedingly rare, but AWS networks (and\n      other stateful firewalls) apparently suffer from this issue. You can\n      tune the timeouts on TCP connection and segment ack via the\n      `cassandra.yaml:internode_tcp_connect_timeout_in_ms` and\n      `cassandra.yaml:internode_tcp_user_timeout_in_ms` options respectively.\n      See CASSANDRA-14358 for details.\n    - repair_session_space_in_mb setting has been added to cassandra.yaml to allow operators to reduce\n      merkle tree size if repair is creating too much heap pressure. The repair_session_max_tree_depth\n      setting added in 3.0.19 and 3.11.5 is deprecated in favor of this setting. See CASSANDRA-14096\n    - The flags 'enable_materialized_views' and 'enable_sasi_indexes' in cassandra.yaml\n      have been set as false by default. Operators should modify them to allow the\n      creation of new views and SASI indexes, the existing ones will continue working.\n      See CASSANDRA-14866 for details.\n    - CASSANDRA-15216 - The flag 'cross_node_timeout' has been set as true by default.\n      This change is done under the assumption that users have setup NTP on\n      their clusters or otherwise synchronize their clocks, and that clocks are\n      mostly in sync, since this is a requirement for general correctness of\n      last write wins.\n    - CASSANDRA-15257 removed the joda time dependency.  Any time formats\n      passed will now need to conform to java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter.\n      Most notably, days and months must be two digits, and years exceeding\n      four digits need to be prefixed with a plus or minus sign.\n    - cqlsh now returns a non-zero code in case of errors. This is a backward incompatible change so it may\n      break existing scripts that rely on the current behavior. See CASSANDRA-15623 for more details.\n    - Updated the default compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec to to 64. The original\n      default (16) was meant for spinning disk volumes.  See CASSANDRA-14902 for details.\n    - Custom compaction strategies must now handle getting sstables added/removed notifications for\n      sstables already added/removed - see CASSANDRA-14103 for details.\n    - Support for JNA with glibc 2.6 and earlier has been removed. Centos 5, Debian 4, and Ubuntu 7.10 operating systems\n      must be first upgraded. See CASSANDRA-16212 for more.\n    - In cassandra.yaml, when using vnodes num_tokens must be defined if initial_token is defined.\n      If it is not defined, or not equal to the numbers of tokens defined in initial_tokens,\n      the node will not start. See CASSANDRA-14477 for details.\n    - CASSANDRA-13701 To give a better out of the box experience, the default 'num_tokens'\n      value has been changed from 256 to 16 for reasons described in\n      https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/getting-started/production.html#tokens\n      'allocate_tokens_for_local_replication_factor' is also uncommented and set to 3.\n      Please note when upgrading that if the 'num_tokens' value is different than what you have\n      configured, the upgraded node will refuse to start. Also note that if a new node joining\n      the cluster has a different value for 'num_tokens' than the rest of the datacenter,\n      the new node will be responsible for a different amount of data than the rest of the datacenter.\n\nDeprecation\n-----------\n    - JavaScript user-defined functions have been deprecated. They are planned for removal\n      in the next major release. (CASSANDRA-17280)\n    - The JMX MBean org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Streaming,name=ActiveOutboundStreams has been\n      deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent major version. This metric was not updated since several version\n      already.\n    - The JMX MBean org.apache.cassandra.db:type=BlacklistedDirectories has been\n      deprecated in favor of org.apache.cassandra.db:type=DisallowedDirectories\n      and will be removed in a subsequent major version.\n    - cqlsh support of 2.7 is deprecated and will warn when running with Python 2.7.\n\nALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE\n------------------------------\n   - Following a discussion regarding concerns about the safety of the 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statement,\n     the C* development community does not recommend its use in production and considers it experimental\n     (see https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@cassandra.apache.org/msg16789.html).\n   - An 'enable_drop_compact_storage' flag has been added to cassandra.yaml to allow operators to prevent its use.\n\nMaterialized Views\n-------------------\n    - Following a discussion regarding concerns about the design and safety of Materialized Views, the C* development\n      community no longer recommends them for production use, and considers them experimental. Warnings messages will\n      now be logged when they are created. (See https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@cassandra.apache.org/msg11511.html)\n    - An 'enable_materialized_views' flag has been added to cassandra.yaml to allow operators to prevent creation of\n      views\n    - CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW syntax has become stricter. Partition key columns are no longer implicitly considered\n      to be NOT NULL, and no base primary key columns get automatically included in view definition. You have to\n      specify them explicitly now.\n\nWindows Support Removed\n-----------------------\n    - Due to the lack of maintenance and testing, Windows support is removed from this version onward. The developers\n      who use Windows 10 still can run Apache Cassandra locally using WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2),\n      Docker for Windows, or virtualization platform like Hyper-V and VirtualBox.\n\n3.11.10\n======\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - This release fix a correctness issue with SERIAL reads, and LWT writes that do not apply.\n      Unfortunately, this fix has a performance impact on read performance at the SERIAL or\n      LOCAL_SERIAL consistency levels. For heavy users of such SERIAL reads, the performance\n      impact may be noticeable and may also result in an increased of timeouts. For that\n      reason, a opt-in system property has been added to disable the fix:\n        -Dcassandra.unsafe.disable-serial-reads-linearizability=true\n      Use this flag at your own risk as it revert SERIAL reads to the incorrect behavior of\n      previous versions. See CASSANDRA-12126 for details.\n    - SASI's `max_compaction_flush_memory_in_mb` setting was previously getting interpreted in bytes. From 3.11.8\n      it is correctly interpreted in megabytes, but prior to 3.11.10 previous configurations of this setting will\n      lead to nodes OOM during compaction. From 3.11.10 previous configurations will be detected as incorrect,\n      logged, and the setting reverted to the default value of 1GB. It is up to the user to correct the setting\n      after an upgrade, via dropping and recreating the index. See CASSANDRA-16071 for details.\n\n\n3.11.6\n======\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Sstables for tables using with a frozen UDT written by C* 3.0 appear as corrupted.\n\n      Background: The serialization-header in the -Statistics.db sstable component contains the type information\n      of the table columns. C* 3.0 write incorrect type information for frozen UDTs by omitting the\n      \"frozen\" information. Non-frozen UDTs were introduced by CASSANDRA-7423 in C* 3.6. Since then, the missing\n      \"frozen\" information leads to deserialization issues that result in CorruptSSTableExceptions, potentially other\n      exceptions as well.\n\n      As a mitigation, the sstable serialization-headers are rewritten to contain the missing \"frozen\" information for\n      UDTs once, when an upgrade from C* 3.0 is detected. This migration does not touch snapshots or backups.\n\n      The sstablescrub tool now performs a check of the sstable serialization-header against the schema. A mismatch of\n      the types in the serialization-header and the schema will cause sstablescrub to error out and stop by default.\n      See the new `-e` option. `-e off` disables the new validation code. `-e fix` or `-e fix-only`, e.g.\n      `sstablescrub -e fix keyspace table`, will validate the serialization-header, rewrite the non-frozen UDTs\n      in the serialzation-header to frozen UDTs, if that matches the schema, and continue with scrub.\n      See `sstablescrub -h`.\n      (CASSANDRA-15035)\n\t- repair_session_max_tree_depth setting has been added to cassandra.yaml to allow operators to reduce\n\t  merkle tree size if repair is creating too much heap pressure. See CASSANDRA-14096 for details.\n\n3.11.5\n======\n\nExperimental features\n---------------------\n    - An 'enable_sasi_indexes' flag, true by default, has been added to cassandra.yaml to allow operators to prevent\n      the creation of new SASI indexes, which are considered experimental and are not recommended for production use.\n      (See https://www.mail-archive.com/dev@cassandra.apache.org/msg13582.html)\n    - The flags 'enable_sasi_indexes' and 'enable_materialized_views' have been grouped under an experimental features\n      section in cassandra.yaml.\n\n3.11.4\n======\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - The order of static columns in SELECT * has been fixed to match that of 2.0 and 2.1 - they are now sorted\n      alphabetically again, by their name, just like regular columns are. If you use prepared statements and\n      SELECT * queries, and have both simple and collection static columns in those tables, and are upgrading from an\n      earlier 3.0 version, then you might be affected by this change. Please see CASSANDRA-14638 for details.\n\n3.11.3\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Materialized view users upgrading from 3.0.15 (3.0.X series) or 3.11.1 (3.11.X series) and  later that have performed range movements (join, decommission, move, etc),\n      should run repair on the base tables, and subsequently on the views to ensure data affected by CASSANDRA-14251 is correctly propagated to all replicas.\n    - Changes to bloom_filter_fp_chance will no longer take effect on existing sstables when the node is restarted. Only\n      compactions/upgradesstables regenerates bloom filters and Summaries sstable components. See CASSANDRA-11163\n\n3.11.2\n======\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - See MAXIMUM TTL EXPIRATION DATE NOTICE above.\n    - Cassandra is now relying on the JVM options to properly shutdown on OutOfMemoryError. By default it will\n      rely on the OnOutOfMemoryError option as the ExitOnOutOfMemoryError and CrashOnOutOfMemoryError options\n      are not supported by the older 1.7 and 1.8 JVMs. A warning will be logged at startup if none of those JVM\n      options are used. See CASSANDRA-13006 for more details\n    - Cassandra is not logging anymore by default an Heap histogram on OutOfMemoryError. To enable that behavior\n      set the 'cassandra.printHeapHistogramOnOutOfMemoryError' System property to 'true'. See CASSANDRA-13006\n      for more details.\n\n3.11.1\n======\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Creating Materialized View with filtering on non-primary-key base column\n      (added in CASSANDRA-10368) is disabled, because the liveness of view row\n      is depending on multiple filtered base non-key columns and base non-key\n      column used in view primary-key. This semantic cannot be supported without\n      storage format change, see CASSANDRA-13826. For append-only use case, you\n      may still use this feature with a startup flag: \"-Dcassandra.mv.allow_filtering_nonkey_columns_unsafe=true\"\n\nCompact Storage (only when upgrading from 3.X or any version lower than 3.0.15)\n---------------\n    - Starting version 4.0, Thrift is no longer supported.\n      COMPACT STORAGE will no longer be supported after 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE'\n      is taken out of experimental mode. This will be done in a major future release, post 5.0 (CASSANDRA-19324).\n      'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' statement makes Compact Tables CQL-compatible,\n      exposing internal structure of Thrift/Compact Tables. You can find more details\n      on exposed internal structure under:\n      http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/cql/appendices.html#appendix-c-dropping-compact-storage\n\n      For uninterrupted cluster upgrades, drivers now support 'NO_COMPACT' startup option.\n      Supplying this flag will have same effect as 'DROP COMPACT STORAGE', but only for the\n      current connection.\n\n      In order to upgrade, clients supporting a non-compact schema view can be rolled out\n      gradually. When all the clients are updated 'ALTER ... DROP COMPACT STORAGE' can be\n      executed. After dropping compact storage, ’NO_COMPACT' option will have no effect\n      after that.\n\n\nMaterialized Views\n-------------------\n\nMaterialized Views (only when upgrading from any version lower than 3.0.15 (3.0 series) or 3.11.1 (3.X series))\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    - Cassandra will no longer allow dropping columns on tables with Materialized Views.\n    - A change was made in the way the Materialized View timestamp is computed, which\n      may cause an old deletion to a base column which is view primary key (PK) column\n      to not be reflected in the view when repairing the base table post-upgrade. This\n      condition is only possible when a column deletion to an MV primary key (PK) column\n      not present in the base table PK (via UPDATE base SET view_pk_col = null or DELETE\n      view_pk_col FROM base) is missed before the upgrade and received by repair after the upgrade.\n      If such column deletions are done on a view PK column which is not a base PK, it's advisable\n      to run repair on the base table of all nodes prior to the upgrade. Alternatively it's possible\n      to fix potential inconsistencies by running repair on the views after upgrade or drop and\n      re-create the views. See CASSANDRA-11500 for more details.\n    - Removal of columns not selected in the Materialized View (via UPDATE base SET unselected_column\n      = null or DELETE unselected_column FROM base) may not be properly reflected in the view in some\n      situations so we advise against doing deletions on base columns not selected in views\n      until this is fixed on CASSANDRA-13826.\n\n3.11.0\n======\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - Creating Materialized View with filtering on non-primary-key base column\n     (added in CASSANDRA-10368) is disabled, because the liveness of view row\n     is depending on multiple filtered base non-key columns and base non-key\n     column used in view primary-key. This semantic cannot be supported without\n     storage format change, see CASSANDRA-13826. For append-only use case, you\n     may still use this feature with a startup flag: \"-Dcassandra.mv.allow_filtering_nonkey_columns_unsafe=true\"\n   - The NativeAccessMBean isAvailable method will only return true if the\n     native library has been successfully linked. Previously it was returning\n     true if JNA could be found but was not taking into account link failures.\n   - Primary ranges in the system.size_estimates table are now based on the keyspace\n     replication settings and adjacent ranges are no longer merged (CASSANDRA-9639).\n   - In 2.1, the default for otc_coalescing_strategy was 'DISABLED'.\n     In 2.2 and 3.0, it was changed to 'TIMEHORIZON', but that value was shown\n     to be a performance regression. The default for 3.11.0 and newer has\n     been reverted to 'DISABLED'. Users upgrading from Cassandra 2.2 or 3.0 should\n     be aware that the default has changed.\n   - The StorageHook interface has been modified to allow to retrieve read information from\n     SSTableReader (CASSANDRA-13120).\n\n3.10\n====\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - New `DurationType` (cql duration). See CASSANDRA-11873\n   - Runtime modification of concurrent_compactors is now available via nodetool\n   - Support for the assignment operators +=/-= has been added for update queries.\n   - An Index implementation may now provide a task which runs prior to joining\n     the ring. See CASSANDRA-12039\n   - Filtering on partition key columns is now also supported for queries without\n     secondary indexes.\n   - A slow query log has been added: slow queries will be logged at DEBUG level.\n     For more details refer to CASSANDRA-12403 and slow_query_log_timeout_in_ms\n     in cassandra.yaml.\n   - Support for GROUP BY queries has been added.\n   - A new compaction-stress tool has been added to test the throughput of compaction\n     for any cassandra-stress user schema.  see compaction-stress help for how to use.\n   - Compaction can now take into account overlapping tables that don't take part\n     in the compaction to look for deleted or overwritten data in the compacted tables.\n     Then such data is found, it can be safely discarded, which in turn should enable\n     the removal of tombstones over that data.\n\n     The behavior can be engaged in two ways:\n       - as a \"nodetool garbagecollect -g CELL/ROW\" operation, which applies\n         single-table compaction on all sstables to discard deleted data in one step.\n       - as a \"provide_overlapping_tombstones:CELL/ROW/NONE\" compaction strategy flag,\n         which uses overlapping tables as a source of deletions/overwrites during all\n         compactions.\n     The argument specifies the granularity at which deleted data is to be found:\n       - If ROW is specified, only whole deleted rows (or sets of rows) will be\n         discarded.\n       - If CELL is specified, any columns whose value is overwritten or deleted\n         will also be discarded.\n       - NONE (default) specifies the old behavior, overlapping tables are not used to\n         decide when to discard data.\n     Which option to use depends on your workload, both ROW and CELL increase the\n     disk load on compaction (especially with the size-tiered compaction strategy),\n     with CELL being more resource-intensive. Both should lead to better read\n     performance if deleting rows (resp. overwriting or deleting cells) is common.\n   - Prepared statements are now persisted in the table prepared_statements in\n     the system keyspace. Upon startup, this table is used to preload all\n     previously prepared statements - i.e. in many cases clients do not need to\n     re-prepare statements against restarted nodes.\n   - cqlsh can now connect to older Cassandra versions by downgrading the native\n     protocol version. Please note that this is currently not part of our release\n     testing and, as a consequence, it is not guaranteed to work in all cases.\n     See CASSANDRA-12150 for more details.\n   - Snapshots that are automatically taken before a table is dropped or truncated\n     will have a \"dropped\" or \"truncated\" prefix on their snapshot tag name.\n   - Metrics are exposed for successful and failed authentication attempts.\n     These can be located using the object names org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Client,name=AuthSuccess\n     and org.apache.cassandra.metrics:type=Client,name=AuthFailure respectively.\n   - Add support to \"unset\" JSON fields in prepared statements by specifying DEFAULT UNSET.\n     See CASSANDRA-11424 for details\n   - Allow TTL with null value on insert and update. It will be treated as equivalent to inserting a 0.\n   - Removed outboundBindAny configuration property. See CASSANDRA-12673 for details.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Support for alter types of already defined tables and of UDTs fields has been disabled.\n      If it is necessary to return a different type, please use casting instead. See\n      CASSANDRA-12443 for more details.\n    - Specifying the default_time_to_live option when creating or altering a\n      materialized view was erroneously accepted (and ignored). It is now\n      properly rejected.\n    - Only Java and JavaScript are now supported UDF languages.\n      The sandbox in 3.0 already prevented the use of script languages except Java\n      and JavaScript.\n    - Compaction now correctly drops sstables out of CompactionTask when there\n      isn't enough disk space to perform the full compaction.  This should reduce\n      pending compaction tasks on systems with little remaining disk space.\n    - Request timeouts in cassandra.yaml (read_request_timeout_in_ms, etc) now apply to the\n      \"full\" request time on the coordinator.  Previously, they only covered the time from\n      when the coordinator sent a message to a replica until the time that the replica\n      responded.  Additionally, the previous behavior was to reset the timeout when performing\n      a read repair, making a second read to fix a short read, and when subranges were read\n      as part of a range scan or secondary index query.  In 3.10 and higher, the timeout\n      is no longer reset for these \"subqueries\".  The entire request must complete within\n      the specified timeout.  As a consequence, your timeouts may need to be adjusted\n      to account for this.  See CASSANDRA-12256 for more details.\n    - Logs written to stdout are now consistent with logs written to files.\n      Time is now local (it was UTC on the console and local in files). Date, thread, file\n      and line info where added to stdout. (see CASSANDRA-12004)\n    - The 'clientutil' jar, which has been somewhat broken on the 3.x branch, is not longer provided.\n      The features provided by that jar are provided by any good java driver and we advise relying on drivers rather on\n      that jar, but if you need that jar for backward compatiblity until you do so, you should use the version provided\n      on previous Cassandra branch, like the 3.0 branch (by design, the functionality provided by that jar are stable\n      accross versions so using the 3.0 jar for a client connecting to 3.x should work without issues).\n    - (Tools development) DatabaseDescriptor no longer implicitly startups components/services like\n      commit log replay. This may break existing 3rd party tools and clients. In order to startup\n      a standalone tool or client application, use the DatabaseDescriptor.toolInitialization() or\n      DatabaseDescriptor.clientInitialization() methods. Tool initialization sets up partitioner,\n      snitch, encryption context. Client initialization just applies the configuration but does not\n      setup anything. Instead of using Config.setClientMode() or Config.isClientMode(), which are\n      deprecated now, use one of the appropiate new methods in DatabaseDescriptor.\n    - Application layer keep-alives were added to the streaming protocol to prevent idle incoming connections from\n      timing out and failing the stream session (CASSANDRA-11839). This effectively deprecates the streaming_socket_timeout_in_ms\n      property in favor of streaming_keep_alive_period_in_secs. See cassandra.yaml for more details about this property.\n    - Duration litterals support the ISO 8601 format. By consequence, identifiers matching that format\n      (e.g P2Y or P1MT6H) will not be supported anymore (CASSANDRA-11873).\n\n3.8\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - Shared pool threads are now named according to the stage they are executing\n     tasks for. Thread names mentioned in traced queries change accordingly.\n   - A new option has been added to cassandra-stress \"-rate fixed={number}/s\"\n     that forces a scheduled rate of operations/sec over time. Using this, stress can\n     accurately account for coordinated ommission from the stress process.\n   - The cassandra-stress \"-rate limit=\" option has been renamed to \"-rate throttle=\"\n   - hdr histograms have been added to stress runs, it's output can be saved to disk using:\n     \"-log hdrfile=\" option. This histogram includes response/service/wait times when used with the\n     fixed or throttle rate options.  The histogram file can be plotted on\n     http://hdrhistogram.github.io/HdrHistogram/plotFiles.html\n   - TimeWindowCompactionStrategy has been added. This has proven to be a better approach\n     to time series compaction and new tables should use this instead of DTCS. See\n     CASSANDRA-9666 for details.\n   - Change-Data-Capture is now available. See cassandra.yaml and for cdc-specific flags and\n     a brief explanation of on-disk locations for archived data in CommitLog form. This can\n     be enabled via ALTER TABLE ... WITH cdc=true.\n     Upon flush, CommitLogSegments containing data for CDC-enabled tables are moved to\n     the data/cdc_raw directory until removed by the user and writes to CDC-enabled tables\n     will be rejected with a WriteTimeoutException once cdc_total_space_in_mb is reached\n     between unflushed CommitLogSegments and cdc_raw.\n     NOTE: CDC is disabled by default in the .yaml file. Do not enable CDC on a mixed-version\n     cluster as it will lead to exceptions which can interrupt traffic. Once all nodes\n     have been upgraded to 3.8 it is safe to enable this feature and restart the cluster.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - The ReversedType behaviour has been corrected for clustering columns of\n     BYTES type containing empty value. Scrub should be run on the existing\n     SSTables containing a descending clustering column of BYTES type to correct\n     their ordering. See CASSANDRA-12127 for more details.\n   - Ec2MultiRegionSnitch will no longer automatically set broadcast_rpc_address\n     to the public instance IP if this property is defined on cassandra.yaml.\n   - The name \"json\" and \"distinct\" are not valid anymore a user-defined function\n     names (they are still valid as column name however). In the unlikely case where\n     you had defined functions with such names, you will need to recreate\n     those under a different name, change your code to use the new names and\n     drop the old versions, and this _before_ upgrade (see CASSANDRA-10783 for more\n     details).\n\nDeprecation\n-----------\n   - DateTieredCompactionStrategy has been deprecated - new tables should use\n     TimeWindowCompactionStrategy. Note that migrating an existing DTCS-table to TWCS might\n     cause increased compaction load for a while after the migration so make sure you run\n     tests before migrating. Read CASSANDRA-9666 for background on this.\n\n3.7\n===\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - A maximum size for SSTables values has been introduced, to prevent out of memory\n     exceptions when reading corrupt SSTables. This maximum size can be set via\n     max_value_size_in_mb in cassandra.yaml. The default is 256MB, which matches the default\n     value of native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb. SSTables will be considered corrupt if\n     they contain values whose size exceeds this limit. See CASSANDRA-9530 for more details.\n\n\n3.6\n=====\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - JMX connections can now use the same auth mechanisms as CQL clients. New options\n     in cassandra-env.(sh|ps1) enable JMX authentication and authorization to be delegated\n     to the IAuthenticator and IAuthorizer configured in cassandra.yaml. The default settings\n     still only expose JMX locally, and use the JVM's own security mechanisms when remote\n     connections are permitted. For more details on how to enable the new options, see the\n     comments in cassandra-env.sh. A new class of IResource, JMXResource, is provided for\n     the purposes of GRANT/REVOKE via CQL. See CASSANDRA-10091 for more details.\n     Also, directly setting JMX remote port via the com.sun.management.jmxremote.port system\n     property at startup is deprecated. See CASSANDRA-11725 for more details.\n   - JSON timestamps are now in UTC and contain the timezone information, see CASSANDRA-11137 for more details.\n   - Collision checks are performed when joining the token ring, regardless of whether\n     the node should bootstrap. Additionally, replace_address can legitimately be used\n     without bootstrapping to help with recovery of nodes with partially failed disks.\n     See CASSANDRA-10134 for more details.\n   - Key cache will only hold indexed entries up to the size configured by\n     column_index_cache_size_in_kb in cassandra.yaml in memory. Larger indexed entries\n     will never go into memory. See CASSANDRA-11206 for more details.\n   - For tables having a default_time_to_live specifying a TTL of 0 will remove the TTL\n     from the inserted or updated values.\n   - Startup is now aborted if corrupted transaction log files are found. The details\n     of the affected log files are now logged, allowing the operator to decide how\n     to resolve the situation.\n   - Filtering expressions are made more pluggable and can be added programatically via\n     a QueryHandler implementation. See CASSANDRA-11295 for more details.\n\n\n\n3.4\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - Internal authentication now supports caching of encrypted credentials.\n      Reference cassandra.yaml:credentials_validity_in_ms\n    - Remote configuration of auth caches via JMX can be disabled using the\n      the system property cassandra.disable_auth_caches_remote_configuration\n    - sstabledump tool is added to be 3.0 version of former sstable2json. The tool only\n      supports v3.0+ SSTables. See tool's help for more detail.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 3.4 but please see previous versions upgrading section,\n      especially if you are upgrading from 2.2.\n\nDeprecation\n-----------\n    - The mbean interfaces org.apache.cassandra.auth.PermissionsCacheMBean and\n      org.apache.cassandra.auth.RolesCacheMBean are deprecated in favor of\n      org.apache.cassandra.auth.AuthCacheMBean. This generalized interface is\n      common across all caches in the auth subsystem. The specific mbean interfaces\n      for each individual cache will be removed in a subsequent major version.\n\n\n3.2\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - We now make sure that a token does not exist in several data directories. This\n     means that we run one compaction strategy per data_file_directory and we use\n     one thread per directory to flush. Use nodetool relocatesstables to make sure your\n     tokens are in the correct place, or just wait and compaction will handle it. See\n     CASSANDRA-6696 for more details.\n   - bound maximum in-flight commit log replay mutation bytes to 64 megabytes\n     tunable via cassandra.commitlog_max_outstanding_replay_bytes\n   - Support for type casting has been added to the selection clause.\n   - Hinted handoff now supports compression. Reference cassandra.yaml:hints_compression.\n     Note: hints compression is currently disabled by default.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - The compression ratio metrics computation has been modified to be more accurate.\n   - Running Cassandra as root is prevented by default.\n   - JVM options are moved from cassandra-env.(sh|ps1) to jvm.options file\n\nDeprecation\n-----------\n   - The Thrift API is deprecated and will be removed in Cassandra 4.0.\n\n\n3.1\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - The return value of SelectStatement::getLimit as been changed from DataLimits\n     to int.\n   - Custom index implementation should be aware that the method Indexer::indexes()\n     has been removed as its contract was misleading and all custom implementation\n     should have almost surely returned true inconditionally for that method.\n   - GC logging is now enabled by default (you can disable it in the jvm.options\n     file if you prefer).\n\n\n3.0\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - EACH_QUORUM is now a supported consistency level for read requests.\n   - Support for IN restrictions on any partition key component or clustering key\n     as well as support for EQ and IN multicolumn restrictions has been added to\n     UPDATE and DELETE statement.\n   - Support for single-column and multi-colum slice restrictions (>, >=, <= and <)\n     has been added to DELETE statements\n   - nodetool rebuild_index accepts the index argument without\n     the redundant table name\n   - Materialized Views, which allow for server-side denormalization, is now\n     available. Materialized views provide an alternative to secondary indexes\n     for non-primary key queries, and perform much better for indexing high\n     cardinality columns.\n     See http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/new-in-cassandra-3-0-materialized-views\n   - Hinted handoff has been completely rewritten. Hints are now stored in flat\n     files, with less overhead for storage and more efficient dispatch.\n     See CASSANDRA-6230 for full details.\n   - Option to not purge unrepaired tombstones. To avoid users having data resurrected\n     if repair has not been run within gc_grace_seconds, an option has been added to\n     only allow tombstones from repaired sstables to be purged. To enable, set the\n     compaction option 'only_purge_repaired_tombstones':true but keep in mind that if\n     you do not run repair for a long time, you will keep all tombstones around which\n     can cause other problems.\n   - Enabled warning on GC taking longer than 1000ms. See\n     cassandra.yaml:gc_warn_threshold_in_ms\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - Clients must use the native protocol version 3 when upgrading from 2.2.X as\n     the native protocol version 4 is not compatible between 2.2.X and 3.Y. See\n     https://www.mail-archive.com/user@cassandra.apache.org/msg45381.html for details.\n   - A new argument of type InetAdress has been added to IAuthenticator::newSaslNegotiator,\n     representing the IP address of the client attempting authentication. It will be a breaking\n     change for any custom implementations.\n   - token-generator tool has been removed.\n   - Upgrade to 3.0 is supported from Cassandra 2.1 versions greater or equal to 2.1.9,\n     or Cassandra 2.2 versions greater or equal to 2.2.2. Upgrade from Cassandra 2.0 and\n     older versions is not supported.\n   - The 'memtable_allocation_type: offheap_objects' option has been removed. It should\n     be re-introduced in a future release and you can follow CASSANDRA-9472 to know more.\n   - Configuration parameter memory_allocator in cassandra.yaml has been removed.\n   - The native protocol versions 1 and 2 are not supported anymore.\n   - Max mutation size is now configurable via max_mutation_size_in_kb setting in\n     cassandra.yaml; the default is half the size commitlog_segment_size_in_mb * 1024.\n   - 3.0 requires Java 8u40 or later.\n   - Garbage collection options were moved from cassandra-env to jvm.options file.\n   - New transaction log files have been introduced to replace the compactions_in_progress\n     system table, temporary file markers (tmp and tmplink) and sstable ancerstors.\n     Therefore, compaction metadata no longer contains ancestors. Transaction log files\n     list sstable descriptors involved in compactions and other operations such as flushing\n     and streaming. Use the sstableutil tool to list any sstable files currently involved\n     in operations not yet completed, which previously would have been marked as temporary.\n     A transaction log file contains one sstable per line, with the prefix \"add:\" or \"remove:\".\n     They also contain a special line \"commit\", only inserted at the end when the transaction\n     is committed. On startup we use these files to cleanup any partial transactions that were\n     in progress when the process exited. If the commit line is found, we keep new sstables\n     (those with the \"add\" prefix) and delete the old sstables (those with the \"remove\" prefix),\n     vice-versa if the commit line is missing. Should you lose or delete these log files,\n     both old and new sstable files will be kept as live files, which will result in duplicated\n     sstables. These files are protected by incremental checksums so you should not manually\n     edit them. When restoring a full backup or moving sstable files, you should clean-up\n     any left over transactions and their temporary files first. You can use this command:\n      ===> sstableutil -c ks table\n     See CASSANDRA-7066 for full details.\n   - New write stages have been added for batchlog and materialized view mutations\n     you can set their size in cassandra.yaml\n   - User defined functions are now executed in a sandbox.\n     To use UDFs and UDAs, you have to enable them in cassandra.yaml.\n   - New SSTable version 'la' with improved bloom-filter false-positive handling\n     compared to previous version 'ka' used in 2.2 and 2.1. Running sstableupgrade\n     is not necessary but recommended.\n   - Before upgrading to 3.0, make sure that your cluster is in complete agreement\n     (schema versions outputted by `nodetool describecluster` are all the same).\n   - Schema metadata is now stored in the new `system_schema` keyspace, and\n     legacy `system.schema_*` tables are now gone; see CASSANDRA-6717 for details.\n   - Pig's support has been removed.\n   - Hadoop BulkOutputFormat and BulkRecordWriter have been removed; use\n     CqlBulkOutputFormat and CqlBulkRecordWriter instead.\n   - Hadoop ColumnFamilyInputFormat and ColumnFamilyOutputFormat have been removed;\n     use CqlInputFormat and CqlOutputFormat instead.\n   - Hadoop ColumnFamilyRecordReader and ColumnFamilyRecordWriter have been removed;\n     use CqlRecordReader and CqlRecordWriter instead.\n   - hinted_handoff_enabled in cassandra.yaml no longer supports a list of data centers.\n     To specify a list of excluded data centers when hinted_handoff_enabled is set to true,\n     use hinted_handoff_disabled_datacenters, see CASSANDRA-9035 for details.\n   - The `sstable_compression` and `chunk_length_kb` compression options have been deprecated.\n     The new options are `class` and `chunk_length_in_kb`. Disabling compression should now\n     be done by setting the new option `enabled` to `false`.\n   - The compression option `crc_check_chance` became a top-level table option, but is currently\n     enforced only against tables with enabled compression.\n   - Only map syntax is now allowed for caching options. ALL/NONE/KEYS_ONLY/ROWS_ONLY syntax\n     has been deprecated since 2.1.0 and is being removed in 3.0.0.\n   - The 'index_interval' option for 'CREATE TABLE' statements, which has been deprecated\n     since 2.1 and replaced with the 'min_index_interval' and 'max_index_interval' options,\n     has now been removed.\n   - The 'replicate_on_write' and 'populate_io_cache_on_flush' options for 'CREATE TABLE' statements,\n     which have been deprecated since 2.1, have also been removed.\n   - Batchlog entries are now stored in a new table - system.batches.\n     The old one has been deprecated.\n   - JMX methods set/getCompactionStrategyClass have been removed, use\n     set/getCompactionParameters or set/getCompactionParametersJson instead.\n   - SizeTieredCompactionStrategy parameter cold_reads_to_omit has been removed.\n   - The secondary index API has been comprehensively reworked. This will be a breaking\n     change for any custom index implementations, which should now look to implement\n     the new org.apache.cassandra.index.Index interface. New syntax has been added to create\n     and query row-based indexes, which are not explicitly linked to a single column in the\n     base table.\n\n\n2.2.4\n=====\n\nDeprecation\n-----------\n    - Pig support has been deprecated, and will be removed in 3.0.\n      Please see CASSANDRA-10542 for more details.\n    - Configuration parameter memory_allocator in cassandra.yaml has been deprecated\n      and will be removed in 3.0.0. As mentioned below for 2.2.0, jemalloc is\n      automatically preloaded on Unix platforms.\n\nOperations\n----------\n    - Switching data center or racks is no longer an allowed operation on a node\n      which has data. Instead, the node will need to be decommissioned and\n      rebootstrapped. If moving from the SimpleSnitch, make sure that the data\n      center and rack containing all current nodes is named \"datacenter1\" and\n      \"rack1\". To override this behaviour use -Dcassandra.ignore_rack=true and/or\n      -Dcassandra.ignore_dc=true.\n    - Reloading the configuration file of GossipingPropertyFileSnitch has been disabled.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - The default for the inter-DC stream throughput setting\n      (inter_dc_stream_throughput_outbound_megabits_per_sec in cassandra.yaml) is\n      the same than the one for intra-DC one (200Mbps) instead of being unlimited.\n      Having it unlimited was never intended and was a bug.\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - Time windows in DTCS are now limited to 1 day by default to be able to\n      handle bootstrap and repair in a better way. To get the old behaviour,\n      increase max_window_size_seconds.\n    - DTCS option max_sstable_age_days is now deprecated and defaults to 1000 days.\n    - Native protocol server now allows both SSL and non-SSL connections on\n      the same port.\n\n2.2.3\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 2.2 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n2.2.2\n=====\n\nChanged Defaults\n----------------\n   - commitlog_total_space_in_mb will use the smaller of 8192, and 1/4\n     of the total space of the commitlog volume. (Before: always used\n     8192)\n   - The following INFO logs were reduced to DEBUG level and will now show\n     on debug.log instead of system.log:\n      - Memtable flushing actions\n      - Commit log replayed files\n      - Compacted sstables\n      - SStable opening (SSTableReader)\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - Custom QueryHandlers can retrieve the column specifications for the bound\n     variables from QueryOptions by using the hasColumnSpecifications()\n     and getColumnSpecifications() methods.\n   - A new default assynchronous log appender debug.log was created in addition\n     to  the system.log appender in order to provide more detailed log debugging.\n     In order to disable debug logging, you must comment-out the ASYNCDEBUGLOG\n     appender on conf/logback.xml. See CASSANDRA-10241 for more information.\n\n\n2.2.1\n=====\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - COUNT(*) and COUNT(1) can be selected with other columns or functions\n\n\n2.2\n===\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - The authentication & authorization subsystems have been redesigned to\n     support role based access control (RBAC), resulting in a change to the\n     schema of the system_auth keyspace. See below for more detail.\n     For systems already using the internal auth implementations, the process\n     for converting existing data during a rolling upgrade is straightforward.\n     As each node is restarted, it will attempt to convert any data in the\n     legacy tables into the new schema. Until enough nodes to satisfy the\n     replication strategy for the system_auth keyspace are upgraded and so have\n     the new schema, this conversion will fail with the failure being reported\n     in the system log.\n     During the upgrade, Cassandra's internal auth classes will continue to use\n     the legacy tables, so clients experience no disruption. Issuing DCL\n     statements during an upgrade is not supported.\n     Once all nodes are upgraded, an operator with superuser privileges should\n     drop the legacy tables, system_auth.users, system_auth.credentials and\n     system_auth.permissions. Doing so will prompt Cassandra to switch over to\n     the new tables without requiring any further intervention.\n     While the legacy tables are present a restarted node will re-run the data\n     conversion and report the outcome so that operators can verify that it is\n     safe to drop them.\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - The LIMIT clause applies now only to the number of rows returned to the user,\n     not to the number of row queried. By consequence, queries using aggregates will not\n     be impacted by the LIMIT clause anymore.\n   - Very large batches will now be rejected (defaults to 50kb). This\n     can be customized by modifying batch_size_fail_threshold_in_kb.\n   - Selecting columns,scalar functions, UDT fields, writetime or ttl together\n     with aggregated is now possible. The value returned for the columns,\n     scalar functions, UDT fields, writetime and ttl will be the ones for\n     the first row matching the query.\n   - Windows is now a supported platform. Powershell execution for startup scripts\n     is highly recommended and can be enabled via an administrator command-prompt\n     with: 'powershell set-executionpolicy unrestricted'\n   - It is now possible to do major compactions when using leveled compaction.\n     Doing that will take all sstables and compact them out in levels. The\n     levels will be non overlapping so doing this will still not be something\n     you want to do very often since it might cause more compactions for a while.\n     It is also possible to split output when doing a major compaction with\n     STCS - files will be split in sizes 50%, 25%, 12.5% etc of the total size.\n     This might be a bit better than old major compactions which created one big\n     file on disk.\n   - A new tool has been added bin/sstableverify that checks for errors/bitrot\n     in all sstables.  Unlike scrub, this is a non-invasive tool.\n   - Authentication & Authorization APIs have been updated to introduce\n     roles. Roles and Permissions granted to them are inherited, supporting\n     role based access control. The role concept supercedes that of users\n     and CQL constructs such as CREATE USER are deprecated but retained for\n     compatibility. The requirement to explicitly create Roles in Cassandra\n     even when auth is handled by an external system has been removed, so\n     authentication & authorization can be delegated to such systems in their\n     entirety.\n   - In addition to the above, Roles are also first class resources and can be the\n     subject of permissions. Users (roles) can now be granted permissions on other\n     roles, including CREATE, ALTER, DROP & AUTHORIZE, which removesthe need for\n     superuser privileges in order to perform user/role management operations.\n   - Creators of database resources (Keyspaces, Tables, Roles) are now automatically\n     granted all permissions on them (if the IAuthorizer implementation supports\n     this).\n   - SSTable file name is changed. Now you don't have Keyspace/CF name\n     in file name. Also, secondary index has its own directory under parent's\n     directory.\n   - Support for user-defined functions and user-defined aggregates have\n     been added to CQL.\n     ************************************************************************\n     IMPORTANT NOTE: user-defined functions can be used to execute\n     arbitrary and possibly evil code in Cassandra 2.2, and are\n     therefore disabled by default.  To enable UDFs edit\n     cassandra.yaml and set enable_user_defined_functions to true.\n\n     CASSANDRA-9402 will add a security manager for UDFs in Cassandra\n     3.0.  This will inherently be backwards-incompatible with any 2.2\n     UDF that perform insecure operations such as opening a socket or\n     writing to the filesystem.\n     ************************************************************************\n   - Row-cache is now fully off-heap.\n   - jemalloc is now automatically preloaded and used on Linux and OS-X if\n     installed.\n   - Please ensure on Unix platforms that there is no libjnadispath.so\n     installed which is accessible by Cassandra. Old versions of\n     libjna packages (< 4.0.0) will cause problems - e.g. Debian Wheezy\n     contains libjna versin 3.2.x.\n   - The node now keeps up when streaming is failed during bootstrapping. You can\n     use new `nodetool bootstrap resume` command to continue streaming after resolving\n     an issue.\n   - Protocol version 4 specifies that bind variables do not require having a\n     value when executing a statement. Bind variables without a value are\n     called 'unset'. The 'unset' bind variable is serialized as the int\n     value '-2' without following bytes.\n     In an EXECUTE or BATCH request an unset bind value does not modify the value and\n     does not create a tombstone, an unset bind ttl is treated as 'unlimited',\n     an unset bind timestamp is treated as 'now', an unset bind counter operation\n     does not change the counter value.\n     Unset tuple field, UDT field and map key are not allowed.\n     In a QUERY request an unset limit is treated as 'unlimited'.\n     Unset WHERE clauses with unset partition column, clustering column\n     or index column are not allowed.\n   - New `ByteType` (cql tinyint). 1-byte signed integer\n   - New `ShortType` (cql smallint). 2-byte signed integer\n   - New `SimpleDateType` (cql date). 4-byte unsigned integer\n   - New `TimeType` (cql time). 8-byte long\n   - The toDate(timeuuid), toTimestamp(timeuuid) and toUnixTimestamp(timeuuid) functions have been added to allow\n     to convert from timeuuid into date type, timestamp type and bigint raw value.\n     The functions unixTimestampOf(timeuuid) and dateOf(timeuuid) have been deprecated.\n   - The toDate(timestamp) and toUnixTimestamp(timestamp) functions have been added to allow\n     to convert from timestamp into date type and bigint raw value.\n   - The toTimestamp(date) and toUnixTimestamp(date) functions have been added to allow\n     to convert from date into timestamp type and bigint raw value.\n   - SizeTieredCompactionStrategy parameter cold_reads_to_omit has been removed.\n   - The default JVM flag -XX:+PerfDisableSharedMem will cause the following tools JVM\n     to stop working: jps, jstack, jinfo, jmc, jcmd as well as 3rd party tools like Jolokia.\n     If you wish to use these tools you can comment this flag out in cassandra-env.{sh,ps1}\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - Thrift rpc is no longer being started by default.\n     Set `start_rpc` parameter to `true` to enable it.\n   - Pig's CqlStorage has been removed, use CqlNativeStorage instead\n   - Pig's CassandraStorage has been deprecated. CassandraStorage\n     should only be used against tables created via thrift.\n     Use CqlNativeStorage for all other tables.\n   - IAuthenticator been updated to remove responsibility for user/role\n     maintenance and is now solely responsible for validating credentials,\n     This is primarily done via SASL, though an optional method exists for\n     systems which need support for the Thrift login() method.\n   - IRoleManager interface has been added which takes over the maintenance\n     functions from IAuthenticator. IAuthorizer is mainly unchanged. Auth data\n     in systems using the stock internal implementations PasswordAuthenticator\n     & CassandraAuthorizer will be automatically converted during upgrade,\n     with minimal operator intervention required. Custom implementations will\n     require modification, though these can be used in conjunction with the\n     stock CassandraRoleManager so providing an IRoleManager implementation\n     should not usually be necessary.\n   - Fat client support has been removed since we have push notifications to clients\n   - cassandra-cli has been removed. Please use cqlsh instead.\n   - YamlFileNetworkTopologySnitch has been removed; switch to\n     GossipingPropertyFileSnitch instead.\n   - CQL2 has been removed entirely in this release (previously deprecated\n     in 2.0.0). Please switch to CQL3 if you haven't already done so.\n   - The results of CQL3 queries containing an IN restriction will be ordered\n     in the normal order and not anymore in the order in which the column values were\n     specified in the IN restriction.\n   - Some secondary index queries with restrictions on non-indexed clustering\n     columns were not requiring ALLOW FILTERING as they should. This has been\n     fixed, and those queries now require ALLOW FILTERING (see CASSANDRA-8418\n     for details).\n   - The SSTableSimpleWriter and SSTableSimpleUnsortedWriter classes have been\n     deprecated and will be removed in the next major Cassandra release. You\n     should use the CQLSSTableWriter class instead.\n   - The sstable2json and json2sstable tools have been deprecated and will be\n     removed in the next major Cassandra release. See CASSANDRA-9618\n     (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-9618) for details.\n   - nodetool enablehandoff will no longer support a list of data centers starting\n     with the next major release. Two new commands will be added, enablehintsfordc and disablehintsfordc,\n     to exclude data centers from using hinted handoff when the global status is enabled.\n     In cassandra.yaml, hinted_handoff_enabled will no longer support a list of data centers starting\n     with the next major release. A new setting will be added, hinted_handoff_disabled_datacenters,\n     to exclude data centers when the global status is enabled, see CASSANDRA-9035 for details.\n\n\n2.1.13\n======\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - New options for cqlsh COPY FROM and COPY TO, see CASSANDRA-9303 for details.\n\n2.1.10\n=====\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - The syntax TRUNCATE TABLE X is now accepted as an alias for TRUNCATE X\n\n\n2.1.9\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - cqlsh will now display timestamps with a UTC timezone. Previously,\n      timestamps were displayed with the local timezone.\n    - Commit log files are no longer recycled by default, due to negative\n      performance implications. This can be enabled again with the\n      commitlog_segment_recycling option in your cassandra.yaml\n    - JMX methods set/getCompactionStrategyClass have been deprecated, use\n      set/getCompactionParameters/set/getCompactionParametersJson instead\n\n2.1.8\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 2.1 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n2.1.7\n=====\n\n\n\n2.1.6\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 2.1 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n2.1.5\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - The option to omit cold sstables with size tiered compaction has been\n      removed - it is almost always better to use date tiered compaction for\n      workloads that have cold data.\n\n2.1.4\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\nThe default JMX config now listens to localhost only. You must enable\nthe other JMX flags in cassandra-env.sh manually.\n\n\n2.1.3\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Prepending a list to a list collection was erroneously resulting in\n      the prepended list being reversed upon insertion.  If you were depending\n      on this buggy behavior, note that it has been corrected.\n    - Incremental replacement of compacted SSTables has been disabled for this\n      release.\n\n\n2.1.2\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 2.1 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n2.1.1\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 2.1 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - Netty support for epoll on linux is now enabled.  If for some\n     reason you want to disable it pass, the following system property\n     -Dcassandra.native.epoll.enabled=false\n\n\n2.1\n===\n\nNew features\n------------\n   - Default data and log locations have changed.  If not set in\n     cassandra.yaml, the data file directory, commitlog directory,\n     and saved caches directory will default to $CASSANDRA_HOME/data/data,\n     $CASSANDRA_HOME/data/commitlog, and $CASSANDRA_HOME/data/saved_caches,\n     respectively.  The log directory now defaults to $CASSANDRA_HOME/logs.\n     If not set, $CASSANDRA_HOME, defaults to the top-level directory of\n     the installation.\n     Note that this should only affect source checkouts and tarballs.\n     Deb and RPM packages will continue to use /var/lib/cassandra and\n     /var/log/cassandra in cassandra.yaml.\n   - SSTable data directory name is slightly changed. Each directory will\n     have hex string appended after CF name, e.g.\n         ks/cf-5be396077b811e3a3ab9dc4b9ac088d/\n     This hex string part represents unique ColumnFamily ID.\n     Note that existing directories are used as is, so only newly created\n     directories after upgrade have new directory name format.\n   - Saved key cache files also have ColumnFamily ID in their file name.\n   - It is now possible to do incremental repairs, sstables that have been\n     repaired are marked with a timestamp and not included in the next\n     repair session. Use nodetool repair -par -inc to use this feature.\n     A tool to manually mark/unmark sstables as repaired is available in\n     tools/bin/sstablerepairedset. This is particularly important when\n     using LCS, or any data not repaired in your first incremental repair\n     will be put back in L0.\n   - Bootstrapping now ensures that range movements are consistent,\n     meaning the data for the new node is taken from the node that is no\n     longer a responsible for that range of keys.\n     If you want the old behavior (due to a lost node perhaps)\n     you can set the following property (-Dcassandra.consistent.rangemovement=false)\n   - It is now possible to use quoted identifiers in triggers' names.\n     WARNING: if you previously used triggers with capital letters in their\n     names, then you must quote them from now on.\n   - Improved stress tool (http://goo.gl/OTNqiQ)\n   - New incremental repair option (http://goo.gl/MjohJp, http://goo.gl/f8jSme)\n   - Incremental replacement of compacted SSTables (http://goo.gl/JfDBGW)\n   - The row cache can now cache only the head of partitions (http://goo.gl/6TJPH6)\n   - Off-heap memtables (http://goo.gl/YT7znJ)\n   - CQL improvements and additions: User-defined types, tuple types, 2ndary\n     indexing of collections, ... (http://goo.gl/kQl7GW)\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n   - commitlog_sync_batch_window_in_ms behavior has changed from the\n     maximum time to wait between fsync to the minimum time.  We are\n     working on making this more user-friendly (see CASSANDRA-9533) but in the\n     meantime, this means 2.1 needs a much smaller batch window to keep\n     writer threads from starving.  The suggested default is now 2ms.\n   - Rolling upgrades from anything pre-2.0.7 is not supported. Furthermore\n     pre-2.0 sstables are not supported. This means that before upgrading\n     a node on 2.1, this node must be started on 2.0 and\n     'nodetool upgdradesstables' must be run (and this even in the case\n     of not-rolling upgrades).\n   - For size-tiered compaction users, Cassandra now defaults to ignoring\n     the coldest 5% of sstables.  This can be customized with the\n     cold_reads_to_omit compaction option; 0.0 omits nothing (the old\n     behavior) and 1.0 omits everything.\n   - Multithreaded compaction has been removed.\n   - Counters implementation has been changed, replaced by a safer one with\n     less caveats, but different performance characteristics. You might have\n     to change your data model to accomodate the new implementation.\n     (See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-6504 and the\n     blog post at http://goo.gl/qj8iQl for details).\n   - (per-table) index_interval parameter has been replaced with\n     min_index_interval and max_index_interval paratemeters. index_interval\n     has been deprecated.\n   - support for supercolumns has been removed from json2sstable\n\n\n2.0.11\n======\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but refer to previous entries if you\n      are upgrading from a previous version.\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - DateTieredCompactionStrategy added, optimized for time series data and groups\n      data that is written closely in time (CASSANDRA-6602 for details). Consider\n      this experimental for now.\n\n\n2.0.10\n======\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - CqlPaginRecordReader and CqlPagingInputFormat have both been removed.\n      Use CqlInputFormat instead.\n    - If you are using Leveled Compaction, you can now disable doing size-tiered\n      compaction in L0 by starting Cassandra with -Dcassandra.disable_stcs_in_l0\n      (see CASSANDRA-6621 for details).\n    - Shuffle and taketoken have been removed.  For clusters that choose to\n      upgrade to vnodes, creating a new datacenter with vnodes and migrating is\n      recommended. See http://goo.gl/Sna2S1 for further information.\n\n\n2.0.9\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Default values for read_repair_chance and local_read_repair_chance have been\n      swapped. Namely, default read_repair_chance is now set to 0.0, and default\n      local_read_repair_chance to 0.1.\n    - Queries selecting only CQL static columns were (mistakenly) not returning one\n      result per row in the partition. This has been fixed and a SELECT DISTINCT\n      can be used when only the static column of a partition needs to be fetch\n      without fetching the whole partition. But if you use static columns, please\n      make sure this won't affect you (see CASSANDRA-7305 for details).\n\n\n2.0.8\n=====\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - New snitches have been used for users of Google Compute Engine and of\n      Cloudstack.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 2.0.7 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n2.0.7\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 2.0.6 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n2.0.6\n=====\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - CQL now support static columns, allows to batch multiple conditional updates\n      and has a new syntax for slicing over multiple clustering columns\n      (http://goo.gl/B6qz4j).\n    - Repair can be restricted to a set of nodes using the -hosts option in nodetool.\n    - A new 'nodetool taketoken' command relocate tokens with vnodes.\n    - Hinted handoff can be enabled only for some data-centers (see\n      hinted_handoff_enabled in cassandra.yaml)\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 2.0.5 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n2.0.5\n=====\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - Batchlog replay can be, and is throttled by default now.\n      See batchlog_replay_throttle_in_kb setting in cassandra.yaml.\n    - Scrub can now optionally skip corrupt counter partitions. Please note\n      that this will lead to the loss of all the counter updates in the skipped\n      partition. See the --skip-corrupted option.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - If your cluster began on a version before 1.2, check that your secondary\n      index SSTables are on version 'ic' before upgrading.  If not, run\n      'nodetool upgradesstables' if on 1.2.14 or later, or run 'nodetool\n      upgradesstables ks cf' with the keyspace and secondary index named\n      explicitly otherwise.  If you don't do this and upgrade to 2.0.x and it\n      refuses to start because of 'hf' version files in the secondary index,\n      you will need to delete/move them out of the way and recreate the index\n      when 2.0.x starts.\n\n\n2.0.3\n=====\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - It's now possible to configure the maximum allowed size of the native\n      protocol frames (native_transport_max_frame_size_in_mb in the yaml file).\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - NaN and Infinity are new valid floating point constants in CQL3 and are now reserved\n      keywords. In the unlikely case you were using one of them as an identifier (for a\n      column, a keyspace or a table), you will now have to double-quote them (see\n      http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html#identifiers for \"quoted identifiers\").\n    - The IEndpointStateChangeSubscriber has a new method, beforeChange, that\n      any custom implemenations using the class will need to implement.\n\n\n2.0.2\n=====\n\nNew features\n------------\n    - Speculative retry defaults to 99th percentile\n      (See blog post at http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/rapid-read-protection-in-cassandra-2-0-2)\n    - Configurable metrics reporting\n      (see conf/metrics-reporter-config-sample.yaml)\n    - Compaction history and stats are now saved to system keyspace\n      (system.compaction_history table). You can access historiy via\n      new 'nodetool compactionhistory' command or CQL.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nodetool defaults to Sequential mode for repair operations\n\n\n2.0.1\n=====\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - The default memtable allocation has changed from 1/3 of heap to 1/4\n      of heap.  Also, default (single-partition) read and write timeouts\n      have been reduced from 10s to 5s and 2s, respectively.\n\n\n2.0.0\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Java 7 is now *required*!\n    - Upgrading is ONLY supported from Cassandra 1.2.9 or later. This\n      goes for sstable compatibility as well as network.  When\n      upgrading from an earlier release, upgrade to 1.2.9 first and\n      run upgradesstables before proceeding to 2.0.\n    - CAS and new features in CQL such as DROP COLUMN assume that cell\n      timestamps are microseconds-since-epoch.  Do not use these\n      features if you are using client-specified timestamps with some\n      other source.\n    - Replication and strategy options do not accept unknown options anymore.\n      This was already the case for CQL3 in 1.2 but this is now the case for\n      thrift too.\n    - auto_bootstrap of a single-token node with no initial_token will\n      now pick a random token instead of bisecting an existing token\n      range.  We recommend upgrading to vnodes; failing that, we\n      recommend specifying initial_token.\n    - reduce_cache_sizes_at, reduce_cache_capacity_to, and\n      flush_largest_memtables_at options have been removed from cassandra.yaml.\n    - CacheServiceMBean.reduceCacheSizes() has been removed.\n      Use CacheServiceMBean.set{Key,Row}CacheCapacityInMB() instead.\n    - authority option in cassandra.yaml has been deprecated since 1.2.0,\n      but it has been completely removed in 2.0. Please use 'authorizer' option.\n    - ASSUME command has been removed from cqlsh. Use CQL3 blobAsType() and\n      typeAsBlob() conversion functions instead.\n      See https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html#blobFun for details.\n    - Inputting blobs as string constants is now fully deprecated in\n      favor of blob constants. Make sure to update your applications to use\n      the new syntax while you are still on 1.2 (which supports both string\n      and blob constants for blob input) before upgrading to 2.0.\n    - index_interval is now moved to ColumnFamily property. You can change value\n      with ALTER TABLE ... WITH statement and SSTables written after that will\n      have new value. When upgrading, Cassandra will pick up the value defined in\n      cassanda.yaml as the default for existing ColumnFamilies, until you explicitly\n      set the value for those.\n    - The deprecated native_transport_min_threads option has been removed in\n      Cassandra.yaml.\n\nOperations\n----------\n    - VNodes are enabled by default in cassandra.yaml.  initial_token\n      for non-vnode deployments has been removed from the example\n      yaml, but is still respected if specified.\n    - Major compactions, cleanup, scrub, and upgradesstables will interrupt\n      any in-progress compactions (but not repair validations) when invoked.\n    - Disabling autocompactions by setting min/max compaction threshold to 0\n      has been deprecated, instead, use the nodetool commands 'disableautocompaction'\n      and 'enableautocompaction' or set the compaction strategy option enabled = false\n    - ALTER TABLE DROP has been reenabled for CQL3 tables and has new semantics now.\n      See https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html#alterTableStmt and\n      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-3919 for details.\n    - CAS uses gc_grace_seconds to determine how long to keep unused paxos\n      state around for, or a minimum of three hours.\n    - A new hints created metric is tracked per target, replacing countPendingHints\n    - After performance testing for CASSANDRA-5727, the default LCS filesize\n      has been changed from 5MB to 160MB.\n    - cqlsh DESCRIBE SCHEMA no longer outputs the schema of system_* keyspaces;\n      use DESCRIBE FULL SCHEMA if you need the schema of system_* keyspaces.\n    - CQL2 has been deprecated, and will be removed entirely in 2.2. See\n      CASSANDRA-5918 for details.\n    - Commit log archiver now assumes the client time stamp to be in microsecond\n      precision, during restore. Please refer to commitlog_archiving.properties.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Lightweight transactions\n      (http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/lightweight-transactions-in-cassandra-2-0)\n    - Alias support has been added to CQL3 SELECT statement. Refer to\n      CQL3 documentation (http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html) for details.\n    - JEMalloc support (see memory_allocator in cassandra.yaml)\n    - Experimental triggers support.  See examples/ for how to use.  \"Experimental\"\n      means \"tied closely to internal data structures; we plan to decouple this in\n      the future, which will probably break triggers written against this initial\n      API.\"\n    - Numerous improvements to CQL3 and a new version of the native protocol. See\n      http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/cql-in-cassandra-2-0 for details.\n\n1.2.11\n======\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Added a new consistency level, LOCAL_ONE, that forces all CL.ONE operations to\n      execute only in the local datacenter.\n    - New replace_address to supplant the (now removed) replace_token and\n      replace_node workflows to replace a dead node in place.  Works like the\n      old options, but takes the IP address of the node to be replaced.\n\n1.2.9\n=====\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - A history of executed nodetool commands is now captured.\n      It can be found in ~/.cassandra/nodetool.history. Other tools output files\n      (cli and cqlsh history, .cqlshrc) are now centralized in ~/.cassandra, as well.\n    - A new sstablesplit utility allows to split large sstables offline.\n\n\n\n1.2.8\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 1.2.7 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n1.2.7\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - If you have decommissioned a node in the past 72 hours, it is imperative\n      that you not upgrade until such time has passed, or do a full cluster\n      restart (not rolling) before beginning the upgrade.  This only applies to\n      decommission, not removetoken.\n\n\n1.2.6\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - hinted_handoff_throttle_in_kb is now reduced by a factor\n      proportional to the number of nodes in the cluster (see\n      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-5272).\n    - CQL3 syntax for CREATE CUSTOM INDEX has been updated. See CQL3\n      documentation for details.\n\n\n1.2.5\n=====\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Custom secondary index support has been added to CQL3. Refer to\n      CQL3 documentation (http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html)\n      for details and examples.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - The native CQL transport is enabled by default on part 9042.\n\n\n1.2.4\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - 'nodetool upgradesstables' now only upgrades/rewrites sstables that are\n      not on the current version (which is usually what you want). Use the new\n      -a flag to recover the old behavior of rewriting all sstables.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - superuser setup delay (10 seconds) can now be overridden using\n      'cassandra.superuser_setup_delay_ms' property.\n\n\n1.2.3\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - CQL3 used to be case-insensitive for property map key in ALTER and CREATE\n      statements. In other words:\n        CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = { 'CLASS' : 'SimpleStrategy',\n                                                  'REPLICATION_FACTOR' : '1' }\n      was allowed. However, this was not consistent with the fact that string\n      literal are case sensitive in every other places and more importantly this\n      break NetworkTopologyStrategy for which DC names are case sensitive. Those\n      property map key are now case sensitive. So the statement above should be\n      changed to:\n        CREATE KEYSPACE test WITH replication = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy',\n                                                  'replication_factor' : '1' }\n\n\n1.2.2\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - CQL3 type validation for constants has been fixed, which may require\n      fixing queries that were relying on the previous loose validation. Please\n      refer to the CQL3 documentation (http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html)\n      and in particular the changelog section for more details. Please note in\n      particular that inputing blobs as strings constants is now deprecated (in\n      favor of blob constants) and its support will be removed in a future\n      version.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Built-in CQL3-based implementations of IAuthenticator (PasswordAuthenticator)\n      and IAuthorizer (CassandraAuthorizer) have been added. PasswordAuthenticator\n      stores usernames and hashed passwords in system_auth.credentials table;\n      CassandraAuthorizer stores permissions in system_auth.permissions table.\n    - system_auth keyspace is now alterable via ALTER KEYSPACE queries.\n      The default is SimpleStrategy with replication_factor of 1, but it's\n      advised to raise RF to at least 3 or 5, since CL.QUORUM is used for all\n      auth-related queries. It's also possible to change the strategy to NTS.\n    - Permissions caching with time-based expiration policy has been added to reduce\n      performance impact of authorization. Permission validity can be configured\n      using 'permissions_validity_in_ms' setting in cassandra.yaml. The default\n      is 2000 (2 seconds).\n    - SimpleAuthenticator and SimpleAuthorizer examples have been removed. Please\n      look at CassandraAuthorizer/PasswordAuthenticator instead.\n\n\n1.2.1\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - In CQL3, date string are no longer accepted as timeuuid value since a\n      date string is not a correct representation of a timeuuid. Instead, new\n      methods (minTimeuuid, maxTimeuuid, now, dateOf, unixTimestampOf) have been\n      introduced to make working on timeuuid from date string easy. cqlsh also\n      does not display timeuuid as date string (since this is a lossy\n      representation), but the new dateOf method can be used instead. Please\n      refer to the reference documentation (http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html)\n      for more detail.\n    - For client implementors: CQL3 client using the thrift interface should\n      use the new execute_cql3_query, prepare_cql3_query and execute_prepared_cql3_query\n      since 1.2.0. However, Cassandra 1.2.0 was not complaining if CQL3 was set\n      through set_cql_version but the now CQL2 only methods were used. This is\n      now the case.\n    - Queries that uses unrecognized or bad compaction or replication strategy\n      options are now refused (instead of simply logging a warning).\n\n\n1.2\n===\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - IAuthenticator interface has been updated to support dynamic\n      user creation, modification and removal. Users, even when stored\n      externally, now have to be explicitly created using\n      CREATE USER query first. AllowAllAuthenticator and SimpleAuthenticator\n      have been updated for the new interface, but you'll have to update\n      your old IAuthenticator implementations for 1.2. To ease this process,\n      a new abstract LegacyAuthenticator class has been added - subclass it\n      in your old IAuthenticator implementaion and everything should just work\n      (this only affects users who implemented custom authenticators).\n    - IAuthority interface has been deprecated in favor of IAuthorizer.\n      AllowAllAuthority and SimpleAuthority have been renamed to\n      AllowAllAuthorizer and SimpleAuthorizer, respectively. In order to\n      simplify the upgrade to the new interface, a new abstract\n      LegacyAuthorizer has been added - you should subclass it in your\n      old IAuthority implementation and everything should just work\n      (this only affects users who implemented custom authorities).\n      'authority' setting in cassandra.yaml has been renamed to 'authorizer',\n      'authority' is no longer recognized. This affects all upgrading users.\n    - 1.2 is NOT network-compatible with versions older than 1.0. That\n      means if you want to do a rolling, zero-downtime upgrade, you'll need\n      to upgrade first to 1.0.x or 1.1.x, and then to 1.2.  1.2 retains\n      the ability to read data files from Cassandra versions at least\n      back to 0.6, so a non-rolling upgrade remains possible with just\n      one step.\n    - The default partitioner for new clusters is Murmur3Partitioner,\n      which is about 10% faster for index-intensive workloads.  Partitioners\n      cannot be changed once data is in the cluster, however, so if you are\n      switching to the 1.2 cassandra.yaml, you should change this to\n      RandomPartitioner or whatever your old partitioner was.\n    - If you using counters and upgrading from a version prior to\n      1.1.6, you should drain existing Cassandra nodes prior to the\n      upgrade to prevent overcount during commitlog replay (see\n      CASSANDRA-4782).  For non-counter uses, drain is not required\n      but is a good practice to minimize restart time.\n    - Tables using LeveledCompactionStrategy will default to not\n      creating a row-level bloom filter.  The default in older versions\n      of Cassandra differs; you should manually set the false positive\n      rate to 1.0 (to disable) or 0.01 (to enable, if you make many\n      requests for rows that do not exist).\n    - The hints schema was changed from 1.1 to 1.2. Cassandra automatically\n      snapshots and then truncates the hints column family as part of\n      starting up 1.2 for the first time.  Additionally, upgraded nodes\n      will not store new hints destined for older (pre-1.2) nodes. It is\n      therefore recommended that you perform a cluster upgrade when all\n      nodes are up. Because hints will be lost, a cluster-wide repair (with\n      -pr) is recommended after upgrade of all nodes.\n    - The `nodetool removetoken` command (and corresponding JMX operation)\n      have been renamed to `nodetool removenode`.  This function is\n      incompatible with the earlier `nodetool removetoken`, and attempts to\n      remove nodes in this way with a mixed 1.1 (or lower) / 1.2 cluster,\n      is not supported.\n    - The somewhat ill-conceived CollatingOrderPreservingPartitioner\n      has been removed. Use Murmur3Partitioner (recommended) or\n      ByteOrderedPartitioner instead.\n    - Global option hinted_handoff_throttle_delay_in_ms has been removed.\n      hinted_handoff_throttle_in_kb has been added instead.\n    - The default bloom filter fp chance has been increased to 1%.\n      This will save about 30% of the memory used by the old default.\n      Existing columnfamilies will retain their old setting.\n    - The default partitioner (for new clusters; the partitioner cannot be\n      changed in existing clusters) was changed from RandomPartitioner to\n      Murmur3Partitioner which provides faster hashing as well as improved\n      performance with secondary indexes.\n    - The default version of CQL (and cqlsh) is now CQL3. CQL2 is still\n      available but you will have to use the thrift set_cql_version method\n      (that is already supported in 1.1) to use CQL2. For cqlsh, you will need\n      to use 'cqlsh -2'.\n    - CQL3 is now considered final in this release. Compared to the beta\n      version that is part of 1.1, this final version has a few additions\n      (collections), but also some (incompatible) changes in the syntax for the\n      options of the create/alter keyspace/table statements. Typically, the\n      syntax to create a keyspace is now:\n        CREATE KEYSPACE ks WITH replication = { 'class' : 'SimpleStrategy',\n                                                'replication_factor' : 2 };\n      Also, the consistency level cannot be set in the language anymore, but is\n      at the protocol level.\n      Please refer to the CQL3 documentation (http://cassandra.apache.org/doc/cql3/CQL.html)\n      for details.\n    - In CQL3, the DROP behavior from ALTER TABLE has currently been removed\n      (because it was not correctly implemented). We hope to add it back soon\n      (Cassandra 1.2.1 or 1.2.2)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Cassandra can now handle concurrent CREATE TABLE schema changes\n      as well as other updates\n    - rpc_timeout has been split up to allow finer-grained control\n      on timeouts for different operation types\n    - num_tokens can now be specified in cassandra.yaml. This defines the\n      number of tokens assigned to the host on the ring (default: 1).\n      Also specifying initial_token will override any num_tokens setting.\n    - disk_failure_policy allows blacklisting failed disks in JBOD\n      configuration instead of erroring out indefinitely\n    - event tracing can be configured per-connection (\"trace_next_query\")\n      or globally/probabilistically (\"nodetool settraceprobability\")\n    - Atomic batches are now supported server side, where Cassandra will\n      guarantee that (at the price of pre-writing the batch to another node\n      first), all mutations in the batch will be applied, even if the\n      coordinator fails mid-batch.\n    - new IAuthorizer interface has replaced the old IAuthority. IAuthorizer\n      allows dynamic permission management via new CQL3 statements:\n      GRANT, REVOKE, LIST PERMISSIONS. A native implementation storing\n      the permissions in Cassandra is being worked on and we expect to\n      include it in 1.2.1 or 1.2.2.\n    - IAuthenticator interface has been updated to support dynamic user\n      creation, modification and removal via new CQL3 statements:\n      CREATE USER, ALTER USER, DROP USER, LIST USERS. A native implementation\n      that stores users in Cassandra itself is being worked on and is expected to\n      become part of 1.2.1 or 1.2.2.\n\n\n1.1.5\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 1.1 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n1.1.4\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 1.1 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\n\n1.1.3\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Running \"nodetool upgradesstables\" after upgrading is recommended\n      if you use Counter columnfamilies.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - the cqlsh COPY command can now export to CSV flat files\n    - added a new tools/bin/token-generator to facilitate generating evenly distributed tokens\n\n\n1.1.2\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - If you have column families using the LeveledCompactionStrategy, you should run scrub on those column families.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - cqlsh has a new COPY command to load data from CSV flat files\n\n\n1.1.1\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to this release, but please see 1.1 if you are upgrading\n      from a previous version.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Continuous commitlog archiving and point-in-time recovery.\n      See conf/commitlog_archiving.properties\n    - Incremental repair by token range, exposed over JMX\n\n\n1.1\n===\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Compression is enabled by default on newly created ColumnFamilies\n      (and unchanged for ColumnFamilies created prior to upgrading).\n    - If you are running a multi datacenter setup, you should upgrade to\n      the latest 1.0.x (or 0.8.x) release before upgrading.  Versions\n      0.8.8 and 1.0.3-1.0.5 generate cross-dc forwarding that is incompatible\n      with 1.1.\n    - EACH_QUORUM ConsistencyLevel is only supported for writes and will now\n      throw an InvalidRequestException when used for reads.  (Previous\n      versions would silently perform a LOCAL_QUORUM read instead.)\n    - ANY ConsistencyLevel is only supported for writes and will now\n      throw an InvalidRequestException when used for reads.  (Previous\n      versions would silently perform a ONE read for range queries;\n      single-row and multiget reads already rejected ANY.)\n    - The largest mutation batch accepted by the commitlog is now 128MB.\n      (In practice, batches larger than ~10MB always caused poor\n      performance due to load volatility and GC promotion failures.)\n      Larger batches will continue to be accepted but will not be\n      durable.  Consider setting durable_writes=false if you really\n      want to use such large batches.\n    - Make sure that global settings: key_cache_{size_in_mb, save_period}\n      and row_cache_{size_in_mb, save_period} in conf/cassandra.yaml are\n      used instead of per-ColumnFamily options.\n    - JMX methods no longer return custom Cassandra objects.  Any such methods\n      will now return standard Maps, Lists, etc.\n    - Hadoop input and output details are now separated.  If you were\n      previously using methods such as getRpcPort you now need to use\n      getInputRpcPort or getOutputRpcPort depending on the circumstance.\n    - CQL changes:\n      + Prior to 1.1, you could use KEY as the primary key name in some\n        select statements, even if the PK was actually given a different\n        name.  In 1.1+ you must use the defined PK name.\n    - The sliced_buffer_size_in_kb option has been removed from the\n      cassandra.yaml config file (this option was a no-op since 1.0).\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Concurrent schema updates are now supported, with any conflicts\n      automatically resolved. Please note that simultaneously running\n      ‘CREATE COLUMN FAMILY’ operation on the different nodes wouldn’t\n      be safe until version 1.2 due to the nature of ColumnFamily\n      identifier generation, for more details see CASSANDRA-3794.\n    - The CQL language has undergone a major revision, CQL3, the\n      highlights of which are covered at [1].  CQL3 is not\n      backwards-compatibile with CQL2, so we've introduced a\n      set_cql_version Thrift method to specify which version you want.\n      (The default remains CQL2 at least until Cassandra 1.2.)  cqlsh\n      adds a --cql3 flag to enable this.\n      [1] http://www.datastax.com/dev/blog/schema-in-cassandra-1-1\n    - Row-level isolation: multi-column updates to a single row have\n      always been *atomic* (either all will be applied, or none)\n      thanks to the CommitLog, but until 1.1 they were not *isolated*\n      -- a reader may see mixed old and new values while the update\n      happens.\n    - Finer-grained control over data directories, allowing a ColumnFamily to\n      be pinned to specfic volume, e.g. one backed by SSD.\n    - The bulk loader is not longer a fat client; it can be run from an\n      existing machine in a cluster.\n    - A new write survey mode has been added, similar to bootstrap (enabled via\n      -Dcassandra.write_survey=true), but the node will not automatically join\n      the cluster.  This is useful for cases such as testing different\n      compaction strategies with live traffic without affecting the cluster.\n    - Key and row caches are now global, similar to the global memtable\n      threshold. Manual tuning of cache sizes per-columnfamily is no longer\n      required.\n    - Off-heap caches no longer require JNA, and will work out of the box\n      on Windows as well as Unix platforms.\n    - Streaming is now multithreaded.\n    - Compactions may now be aborted via JMX or nodetool.\n    - The stress tool is not new in 1.1, but it is newly included in\n      binary builds as well as the source tree\n    - Hadoop: a new BulkOutputFormat is included which will directly write\n      SSTables locally and then stream them into the cluster.\n      YOU SHOULD USE BulkOutputFormat BY DEFAULT.  ColumnFamilyOutputFormat\n      is still around in case for some strange reason you want results\n      trickling out over Thrift, but BulkOutputFormat is significantly\n      more efficient.\n    - Hadoop: KeyRange.filter is now supported with ColumnFamilyInputFormat,\n      allowing index expressions to be evaluated server-side to reduce\n      the amount of data sent to Hadoop.\n    - Hadoop: ColumnFamilyRecordReader has a wide-row mode, enabled via\n      a boolean parameter to setInputColumnFamily, that pages through\n      data column-at-a-time instead of row-at-a-time.\n    - Pig: can use the wide-row Hadoop support, by setting PIG_WIDEROW_INPUT\n      to true.  This will produce each row's columns in a bag.\n\n\n\n1.0.8\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 1.0.8\n\nOther\n-----\n    - Allow configuring socket timeout for streaming\n\n\n1.0.7\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 1.0.7, please report to instruction for 1.0.6\n\nOther\n-----\n    - Adds new setstreamthroughput to nodetool to configure streaming\n      throttling\n    - Adds JMX property to get/set rpc_timeout_in_ms at runtime\n    - Allow configuring (per-CF) bloom_filter_fp_chance\n\n\n1.0.6\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - This release fixes an issue related to the chunk_length_kb option for\n      compressed sstables. If you use compression on some column families, it\n      is recommended after the upgrade to check the value for this option on\n      these column families (the default value is 64). In case the option would\n      not be set correctly, you should update the column family definition,\n      setting the right value and then run scrub on the column family.\n    - Please report to instruction for 1.0.5 if coming from an older version.\n\n\n1.0.5\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - 1.0.5 comes to fix two important regression of 1.0.4. So all information\n      concerning 1.0.4 are valid for this release, but please avoids upgrading\n      to 1.0.4.\n\n\n1.0.4\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 1.0.4 but please see the 1.0 upgrading section if\n      upgrading from a version prior to 1.0.0\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - A new upgradesstables command has been added to nodetool. It is very\n      similar to scrub but without the ability to discard corrupted rows (and\n      as a consequence it does not snapshot automatically before). This new\n      command is to be prefered to scrub in all cases where sstables should be\n      rewritten to the current format for upgrade purposes.\n\nJMX\n---\n    - The path for the data, commit log and saved cache directories exposed\n      through JMX\n    - The in-memory bloom filter sizes are now exposed through JMX\n\n\n1.0.3\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 1.0.3 but please see the 1.0 upgrading section if\n      upgrading from a version prior to 1.0.0\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - For non compressed sstables (compressed sstable already include more\n      fine grained checsums), a sha1 for the full sstable is now automatically\n      created (in a fix with suffix -Digest.sha1). It can be used to check the\n      sstable integrity with sha1sum.\n\n\n1.0.2\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 1.0.2 but please see the 1.0 upgrading section if\n      upgrading from a version prior to 1.0.0\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Cassandra CLI queries now have timing information\n\n\n1.0.1\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - If upgrading from a version prior to 1.0.0, please see the 1.0 Upgrading\n      section\n    - For running on Windows as a Service, procrun is no longer discributed\n      with Cassandra, see README.txt for more information on how to download\n      it if necessary.\n    - The name given to snapshots directories have been improved for human\n      readability. If you had scripts relying on it, you may need to update\n      them.\n\n\n1.0\n===\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Upgrading from version 0.7.1+ or 0.8.2+ can be done with a rolling\n      restart, one node at a time.  (0.8.0 or 0.8.1 are NOT network-compatible\n      with 1.0: upgrade to the most recent 0.8 release first.)\n      You do not need to bring down the whole cluster at once.\n    - After upgrading, run nodetool scrub against each node before running\n      repair, moving nodes, or adding new ones.\n    - CQL inserts/updates now generate microsecond resolution timestamps\n      by default, instead of millisecond. THIS MEANS A ROLLING UPGRADE COULD\n      MIX milliseconds and microseconds, with clients talking to servers\n      generating milliseconds unable to overwrite the larger microsecond\n      timestamps. If you are using CQL and this is important for your\n      application, you can either perform a non-rolling upgrade to 1.0, or\n      update your application first to use explicit timestamps with the \"USING\n      timestamp=X\" syntax.\n    - The BinaryMemtable bulk-load interface has been removed (use the\n      sstableloader tool instead).\n    - The compaction_thread_priority setting has been removed from\n      cassandra.yaml (use compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec to throttle\n      compaction instead).\n    - CQL types bytea and date were renamed to blob and timestamp, respectively,\n      to conform with SQL norms.  CQL type int is now a 4-byte int, not 8\n      (which is still available as bigint).\n    - Cassandra 1.0 uses arena allocation to reduce old generation\n      fragmentation.  This means there is a minimum overhead of 1MB\n      per ColumnFamily plus 1MB per index.\n    - The SimpleAuthenticator and SimpleAuthority classes have been moved to\n      the example directory (and are thus not available from the binary\n      distribution). They never provided actual security and in their current\n      state are only meant as examples.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - SSTable compression is supported through the 'compression_options'\n      parameter when creating/updating a column family. For instance, you can\n      create a column family Cf using compression (through the Snappy library)\n      in the CLI with:\n        create column family Cf with compression_options={sstable_compression: SnappyCompressor}\n      SSTable compression is not activated by default but can be activated or\n      deactivated at any time.\n    - Compressed SSTable blocks are checksummed to protect against bitrot\n    - New LevelDB-inspired compaction algorithm can be enabled by setting the\n      Columnfamily compaction_strategy=LeveledCompactionStrategy option.\n      Leveled compaction means you only need to keep a few MB of space free for\n      compaction instead of (in the worst case) 50%.\n    - Ability to use multiple threads during a single compaction. See\n      multithreaded_compaction in cassandra.yaml for more details.\n    - Windows Service (\"cassandra.bat install\" to enable)\n    - A dead node may be replaced in a single step by starting a new node\n      with -Dcassandra.replace_token=<token>. More details can be found at\n      http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations#Replacing_a_Dead_Node\n    - It is now possible to repair only the first range returned by the\n      partitioner for a node with `nodetool repair -pr`. It makes it\n      easier/possible to repair a full cluster without any work duplication by\n      running this command on every node of the cluster.\n\nNew data types\n--------------\n    - decimal\n\nOther\n-----\n    - Hinted Handoff has two major improvements:\n        - Hint replay is much more efficient thanks to a change in the data model\n        - Hints are created for all replicas that do not ack a write.  (Formerly,\n          only replicas known to be down when the write started were hinted.)\n      This means that running with read repair completely off is much more\n      viable than before, and the default read_repair_chance is reduced from 1.0\n      (\"always repair\") to 0.1 (\"repair 10% of the time\").\n    - The old per-ColumnFamily memtable thresholds\n      (memtable_throughput_in_mb, memtable_operations_in_millions,\n      memtable_flush_after_mins) are ignored, in favor of the global\n      memtable_total_space_in_mb and commitlog_total_space_in_mb settings.\n      This does not affect client compatibility -- the old options are\n      still allowed, but have no effect. These options may be removed\n      entirely in a future release.\n    - Backlogged compactions will begin five minutes after startup.  The 0.8\n      behavior of never starting compaction until a flush happens is usually\n      not what is desired, but a short grace period is useful to allow caches\n      to warm up first.\n    - The deletion of compacted data files is not performed during Garbage\n      Collection anymore. This means compacted files will now be deleted\n      without delay.\n\n\n0.8.5\n=====\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - SSTables copied to a data directory can be loaded by a live node through\n      nodetool refresh (may be handy to load snapshots).\n    - The configured compaction throughput is exposed through JMX.\n\nOther\n-----\n    - The sstableloader is now bundled with the debian package.\n    - Repair detects when a participating node is dead and fails instead of\n      hanging forever.\n\n\n0.8.4\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 0.8.4\n\nOther\n-----\n    - This release comes to fix a bug in counter that could lead to\n      (important) over-count.\n    - It also fixes a slight upgrade regression from 0.8.3. It is thus advised\n      to jump directly to 0.8.4 if upgrading from before 0.8.3.\n\n\n0.8.3\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Token removal has been revamped.  Removing tokens in a mixed cluster with\n      0.8.3 will not work, so the entire cluster will need to be running 0.8.3\n      first, except for the dead node.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - It is now possible to use thrift asynchronous and\n      half-synchronous/half-asynchronous servers (see cassandra.yaml for more\n      details).\n    - It is now possible to access counter columns through Hadoop.\n\nOther\n-----\n    - This release fix a regression of 0.8 that can make commit log segment to\n      be deleted even though not all data it contains has been flushed.\n      Upgrades from 0.8.* is very much encouraged.\n\n\n0.8.2\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - 0.8.0 and 0.8.1 shipped with a bug that was setting the\n      replicate_on_write option for counter column families to false (this\n      option has no effect on non-counter column family). This is an unsafe\n      default and 0.8.2 correct this, the default for replicate_on_write is\n      now true. It is advised to update your counter column family definitions\n      if replicate_on_write was uncorrectly set to false (before or after\n      upgrade).\n\n\n0.8.1\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - 0.8.1 is backwards compatible with 0.8, upgrade can be achieved by a\n      simple rolling restart.\n    - If upgrading for earlier version (0.7), please refer to the 0.8 section\n      for instructions.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Numerous additions/improvements to CQL (support for counters, TTL, batch\n      inserts/deletes, index dropping, ...).\n    - Add two new AbstractTypes (comparator) to support compound keys\n      (CompositeType and DynamicCompositeType), as well as a ReverseType to\n      reverse the order of any existing comparator.\n    - New option to bypass the commit log on some keyspaces (for advanced\n      users).\n\nTools\n-----\n    - Add new data bulk loading utility (sstableloader).\n\n\n0.8\n===\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Upgrading from version 0.7.1 or later can be done with a rolling\n      restart, one node at a time.  You do not need to bring down the\n      whole cluster at once.\n    - After upgrading, run nodetool scrub against each node before running\n      repair, moving nodes, or adding new ones.\n    - Running nodetool drain before shutting down the 0.7 node is\n      recommended but not required. (Skipping this will result in\n      replay of entire commitlog, so it will take longer to restart but\n      is otherwise harmless.)\n    - 0.8 is fully API-compatible with 0.7.  You can continue\n      to use your 0.7 clients.\n    - Avro record classes used in map/reduce and Hadoop streaming code have\n      been removed. Map/reduce can be switched to Thrift by changing\n      org.apache.cassandra.avro in import statements to\n      org.apache.cassandra.thrift (no class names change). Streaming support\n      has been removed for the time being.\n    - The loadbalance command has been removed from nodetool.  For similar\n      behavior, decommission then rebootstrap with empty initial_token.\n    - Thrift unframed mode has been removed.\n    - The addition of key_validation_class means the cli will assume keys\n      are bytes, instead of strings, in the absence of other information.\n      See http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/FAQ#cli_keys for more details.\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - added CQL client API and JDBC/DBAPI2-compliant drivers for Java and\n      Python, respectively (see: drivers/ subdirectory and doc/cql)\n    - added distributed Counters feature;\n      see http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Counters\n    - optional intranode encryption; see comments around 'encryption_options'\n      in cassandra.yaml\n    - compaction multithreading and rate-limiting; see\n      'concurrent_compactors' and 'compaction_throughput_mb_per_sec' in\n      cassandra.yaml\n    - cassandra will limit total memtable memory usage to 1/3 of the heap\n      by default.  This can be ajusted or disabled with the\n      memtable_total_space_in_mb option.  The old per-ColumnFamily\n      throughput, operations, and age settings are still respected but\n      will be removed in a future major release once we are satisfied that\n      memtable_total_space_in_mb works adequately.\n\nTools\n-----\n    - stress and py_stress moved from contrib/ to tools/\n    - clustertool was removed (see\n      https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-2607 for examples\n      of how to script nodetool across the cluster instead)\n\nOther\n-----\n    - In the past, sstable2json would write column names and values as\n      hex strings, and now creates human readable values based on the\n      comparator/validator.  As a result, JSON dumps created with\n      older versions of sstable2json are no longer compatible with\n      json2sstable, and imports must be made with a configuration that\n      is identical to the export.\n    - manually-forced compactions (\"nodetool compact\") will do nothing\n      if only a single SSTable remains for a ColumnFamily. To force it\n      to compact that anyway (which will free up space if there are\n      a lot of expired tombstones), use the new forceUserDefinedCompaction\n      JMX method on CompactionManager.\n    - most of contrib/ (which was not part of the binary releases)\n      has been moved either to examples/ or tools/. We plan to move the\n      rest for 0.8.1.\n\nJMX\n---\n    - By default, JMX now listens on port 7199.\n\n\n0.7.6\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 0.7.6, but see 0.7.3 Upgrading if upgrading\n      from earlier than 0.7.1.\n\n\n0.7.5\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 0.7.5, but see 0.7.3 Upgrading if upgrading\n      from earlier than 0.7.1.\n\nChanges\n-------\n    - system_update_column_family no longer snapshots before applying\n      the schema change. (_update_keyspace never did.  _drop_keyspace\n      and _drop_column_family continue to snapshot.)\n    - added memtable_flush_queue_size option to cassandra.yaml to\n      avoid blocking writes when multiple column families (or a colum\n      family with indexes) are flushed at the same time.\n    - allow overriding initial_token, storage_port and rpc_port using\n      system properties\n\n\n0.7.4\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - Nothing specific to 0.7.4, but see 0.7.3 Upgrading if upgrading\n      from earlier than 0.7.1.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Output to Pig is now supported as well as input\n\n\n0.7.3\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - 0.7.1 and 0.7.2 shipped with a bug that caused incorrect row-level\n      bloom filters to be generated when compacting sstables generated\n      with earlier versions.  This would manifest in IOExceptions during\n      column name-based queries.  0.7.3 provides \"nodetool scrub\" to\n      rebuild sstables with correct bloom filters, with no data lost.\n      (If your cluster was never on 0.7.0 or earlier, you don't have to\n      worry about this.)  Note that nodetool scrub will snapshot your\n      data files before rebuilding, just in case.\n\n\n0.7.1\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - 0.7.1 is completely backwards compatible with 0.7.0.  Just restart\n      each node with the new version, one at a time.  (The cluster does\n      not all need to be upgraded simultaneously.)\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - added flush_largest_memtables_at and reduce_cache_sizes_at options\n      to cassandra.yaml as an escape valve for memory pressure\n    - added option to specify -Dcassandra.join_ring=false on startup\n      to allow \"warm spare\" nodes or performing JMX maintenance before\n      joining the ring\n\nPerformance\n-----------\n    - Disk writes and sequential scans avoid polluting page cache\n      (requires JNA to be enabled)\n    - Cassandra performs writes efficiently across datacenters by\n      sending a single copy of the mutation and having the recipient\n      forward that to other replicas in its datacenter.\n    - Improved network buffering\n    - Reduced lock contention on memtable flush\n    - Optimized supercolumn deserialization\n    - Zero-copy reads from mmapped sstable files\n    - Explicitly set higher JVM new generation size\n    - Reduced i/o contention during saving of caches\n\n\n0.7.0\n=====\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - Secondary indexes (indexes on column values) are now supported\n    - Row size limit increased from 2GB to 2 billion columns.  rows\n      are no longer read into memory during compaction.\n    - Keyspace and ColumnFamily definitions may be added and modified live\n    - Streaming data for repair or node movement no longer requires\n      anticompaction step first\n    - NetworkTopologyStrategy (formerly DatacenterShardStrategy) is ready for\n      use, enabling ConsistencyLevel.DCQUORUM and DCQUORUMSYNC.  See comments\n      in `cassandra.yaml.`\n    - Optional per-Column time-to-live field allows expiring data without\n      have to issue explicit remove commands\n    - `truncate` thrift method allows clearing an entire ColumnFamily at once\n    - Hadoop OutputFormat and Streaming [non-jvm map/reduce via stdin/out]\n      support\n    - Up to 8x faster reads from row cache\n    - A new ByteOrderedPartitioner supports bytes keys with arbitrary content,\n      and orders keys by their byte value.  This should be used in new\n      deployments instead of OrderPreservingPartitioner.\n    - Optional round-robin scheduling between keyspaces for multitenant\n      clusters\n    - Dynamic endpoint snitch mitigates the impact of impaired nodes\n    - New `IntegerType`, faster than LongType and allows integers of\n      both less and more bits than Long's 64\n    - A revamped authentication system that decouples authorization and\n      allows finer-grained control of resources.\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    The Thrift API has changed in incompatible ways; see below, and refer\n    to http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/ClientOptions for a list of\n    higher-level clients that have been updated to support the 0.7 API.\n\n    The Cassandra inter-node protocol is incompatible with 0.6.x\n    releases (and with 0.7 beta1), meaning you will have to bring your\n    cluster down prior to upgrading: you cannot mix 0.6 and 0.7 nodes.\n\n    The hints schema was changed from 0.6 to 0.7. Cassandra automatically\n    snapshots and then truncates the hints column family as part of\n    starting up 0.7 for the first time.\n\n    Keyspace and ColumnFamily definitions are stored in the system\n    keyspace, rather than the configuration file.\n\n    The process to upgrade is:\n    1) run \"nodetool drain\" on _each_ 0.6 node.  When drain finishes (log\n       message \"Node is drained\" appears), stop the process.\n    2) Convert your storage-conf.xml to the new cassandra.yaml using\n       \"bin/config-converter\".\n    3) Rename any of your keyspace or column family names that do not adhere\n       to the '^\\w+' regex convention.\n    4) Start up your cluster with the 0.7 version.\n    5) Initialize your Keyspace and ColumnFamily definitions using\n       \"bin/schematool <host> <jmxport> import\".  _You only need to do\n       this to one node_.\n\nThrift API\n----------\n    - The Cassandra server now defaults to framed mode, rather than\n      unframed.  Unframed is obsolete and will be removed in the next\n      major release.\n    - The Cassandra Thrift interface file has been updated for Thrift 0.5.\n      If you are compiling your own client code from the interface, you\n      will need to upgrade the Thrift compiler to match.\n    - Row keys are now bytes: keys stored by versions prior to 0.7.0 will be\n      returned as UTF-8 encoded bytes. OrderPreservingPartitioner and\n      CollatingOrderPreservingPartitioner continue to expect that keys contain\n      UTF-8 encoded strings, but RandomPartitioner now works on any key data.\n    - keyspace parameters have been replaced with the per-connection\n      set_keyspace method.\n    - The return type for login() is now AccessLevel.\n    - The get_string_property() method has been removed.\n    - The get_string_list_property() method has been removed.\n\nConfiguraton\n------------\n    - Configuration file renamed to cassandra.yaml and log4j.properties to\n      log4j-server.properties\n    - PropertyFileSnitch configuration file renamed to\n      cassandra-topology.properties\n    - The ThriftAddress and ThriftPort directives have been renamed to\n      RPCAddress and RPCPort respectively.\n    - EndPointSnitch was renamed to RackInferringSnitch.  A new SimpleSnitch\n      has been added.\n    - RackUnawareStrategy and RackAwareStrategy have been renamed to\n      SimpleStrategy and OldNetworkTopologyStrategy, respectively.\n    - RowWarningThresholdInMB replaced with in_memory_compaction_limit_in_mb\n    - GCGraceSeconds is now per-ColumnFamily instead of global\n\t- Keyspace and column family names that do not confirm to a '^\\w+' regex\n      are considered illegal.\n    - Keyspace and column family definitions will need to be loaded via\n      \"bin/schematool <host> <jmxport> import\".  _You only need to do this to\n      one node_.\n    - In addition to an authenticator, an authority must be configured as\n      well. Users of SimpleAuthenticator should use SimpleAuthority for this\n      value (the default is AllowAllAuthority, which corresponds with\n      AllowAllAuthenticator).\n    - The format of access.properties has changed, see the sample configuration\n      conf/access.properties for documentation on the new format.\n\n\nJMX\n---\n    - StreamingService moved from o.a.c.streaming to o.a.c.service\n    - GMFD renamed to GOSSIP_STAGE\n    - {Min,Mean,Max}RowCompactedSize renamed to {Min,Mean,Max}RowSize\n      since it no longer has to wait til compaction to be computed\n\nOther\n-----\n    - If extending AbstractType, make sure you follow the singleton pattern\n      followed by Cassandra core AbstractType classes: provide a public\n      static final variable called 'instance'.\n\n\n0.6.6\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - As part of the cache-saving feature, a third directory\n      (along with data and commitlog) has been added to the config\n      file.  You will need to set and create this directory\n      when restarting your node into 0.6.6.\n\n\n0.6.1\n=====\n\nUpgrading\n---------\n    - We try to keep minor versions 100% compatible (data format,\n      commitlog format, network format) within the major series, but\n      we introduced a network-level incompatibility in 0.6.1.\n      Thus, if you are upgrading from 0.6.0 to any higher version\n      (0.6.1, 0.6.2, etc.) then you will need to restart your entire\n      cluster with the new version, instead of being able to do a\n      rolling restart.\n\n\n0.6.0\n=====\n\nFeatures\n--------\n    - row caching: configure with the RowsCached attribute in\n      ColumnFamily definition\n    - Hadoop map/reduce support: see contrib/word_count for an example\n    - experimental authentication support, described under\n      Authenticator in storage.conf\n\nConfiguraton\n------------\n    - MemtableSizeInMB has been replaced by MemtableThroughputInMB which\n      triggers a memtable flush when the specified amount of data has\n      been written, including overwrites.\n    - MemtableObjectCountInMillions has been replaced by the\n      MemtableOperationsInMillions directive which causes a memtable flush\n      to occur after the specified number of operations.\n    - Like MemtableSizeInMB, BinaryMemtableSizeInMB has been replaced by\n      BinaryMemtableThroughputInMB.\n    - Replication factor is now per-keyspace, rather than global.\n    - KeysCachedFraction is deprecated in favor of KeysCached\n    - RowWarningThresholdInMB added, to warn before very large rows\n      get big enough to threaten node stability\n\nThrift API\n----------\n    - removed deprecated get_key_range method\n    - added batch_mutate meethod\n    - deprecated multiget and batch_insert methods in favor of\n      multiget_slice and batch_mutate, respectively\n    - added ConsistencyLevel.ANY, for when you want write\n      availability even when it may not be readable immediately.\n      Unlike CL.ZERO, though, it will throw an exception if\n      it cannot be written *somewhere*.\n\nJMX metrics\n-----------\n    - read and write statistics are reported as lifetime totals,\n      instead of averages over the last minute.  average-since-last\n      requested are also available for convenience.\n    - cache hit rate statistics are now available from JMX under\n      org.apache.cassandra.db.Caches\n    - compaction JMX metrics are moved to\n      org.apache.cassandra.db.CompactionManager.  PendingTasks is now\n      a much better estimate of compactions remaining, and the\n      progress of the current compaction has been added.\n    - commitlog JMX metrics are moved to org.apache.cassandra.db.Commitlog\n    - progress of data streaming during bootstrap, loadbalance, or other\n      data migration, is available under\n      org.apache.cassandra.streaming.StreamingService.\n      See http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Streaming for details.\n\nInstallation/Upgrade\n--------------------\n    - 0.6 network traffic is not compatible with earlier versions.  You\n      will need to shut down all your nodes at once, upgrade, then restart.\n\n\n\n0.5.0\n=====\n\n0. The commitlog format has changed (but sstable format has not).\n   When upgrading from 0.4, empty the commitlog either by running\n   bin/nodeprobe flush on each machine and waiting for the flush to finish,\n   or simply remove the commitlog directory if you only have test data.\n   (If more writes come in after the flush command, starting 0.5 will error\n   out; if that happens, just go back to 0.4 and flush again.)\n   The format changed twice: from 0.4 to beta1, and from beta2 to RC1.\n\n.5 The gossip protocol has changed, meaning 0.5 nodes cannot coexist\n   in a cluster of 0.4 nodes or vice versa; you must upgrade your\n   whole cluster at the same time.\n\n1. Bootstrap, move, load balancing, and active repair have been added.\n   See http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/Operations.  When upgrading\n   from 0.4, leave autobootstrap set to false for the first restart\n   of your old nodes.\n\n2. Performance improvements across the board, especially on the write\n   path (over 100% improvement in stress.py throughput).\n\n3. Configuration:\n     - Added \"comment\" field to ColumnFamily definition.\n     - Added MemtableFlushAfterMinutes, a global replacement for the\n       old per-CF FlushPeriodInMinutes setting\n     - Key cache settings\n\n4. Thrift:\n     - Added get_range_slice, deprecating get_key_range\n\n\n\n0.4.2\n=====\n\n1. Improve default garbage collector options significantly --\n   throughput will be 30% higher or more.\n\n\n\n0.4.1\n=====\n\n1. SnapshotBeforeCompaction configuration option allows snapshotting\n   before each compaction, which allows rolling back to any version\n   of the data.\n\n\n\n0.4.0\n=====\n\n1. On-disk data format has changed to allow billions of keys/rows per\n   node instead of only millions.  The new format is incompatible with 0.3;\n   see 0.3 notes below for how to import data from a 0.3 install.\n\n2. Cassandra now supports multiple keyspaces.  Typically you will have\n   one keyspace per application, allowing applications to be able to\n   create and modify ColumnFamilies at will without worrying about\n   collisions with others in the same cluster.\n\n3. Many Thrift API changes and documentation.  See\n   http://wiki.apache.org/cassandra/API\n\n4. Removed the web interface in favor of JMX and bin/nodeprobe, which\n   has significantly enhanced functionality.\n\n5. Renamed configuration \"<Table>\" to \"<Keyspace>\".\n\n6. Added commitlog fsync; see \"<CommitLogSync>\" in configuration.\n\n\n\n0.3.0\n=====\n\n1. With enough and large enough keys in a ColumnFamily, Cassandra will\n   run out of memory trying to perform compactions (data file merges).\n   The size of what is stored in memory is (S + 16) * (N + M) where S\n   is the size of the key (usually 2 bytes per character), N is the\n   number of keys and M, is the map overhead (which can be guestimated\n   at around 32 bytes per key).\n   So, if you have 10-character keys and 1GB of headroom in your heap\n   space for compaction, you can expect to store about 17M keys\n   before running into problems.\n   See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-208\n\n2. Because fixing #1 requires a data file format change, 0.4 will not\n   be binary-compatible with 0.3 data files.  A client-side upgrade\n   can be done relatively easily with the following algorithm:\n     for key in old_client.get_key_range(everything):\n         columns = old_client.get_slice or get_slice_super(key, all columns)\n     new_client.batch_insert or batch_insert_super(key, columns)\n   The inner loop can be trivially parallelized for speed.\n\n3. Commitlog does not fsync before reporting a write successful.\n   Using blocking writes mitigates this to some degree, since all\n   nodes that were part of the write quorum would have to fail\n   before sync for data to be lost.\n   See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-182\n\nAdditionally, row size (that is, all the data associated with a single\nkey in a given ColumnFamily) is limited by available memory, because\ncompaction deserializes each row before merging.\n\nSee https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CASSANDRA-16\n"

Rows are organized into tables with a required primary key.\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA2/Partitioners[Partitioning] means that Cassandra can distribute your data across multiple machines in an application-transparent matter. Cassandra will automatically repartition as machines are added and removed from the cluster.\n\nhttps://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CASSANDRA2/DataModel[Row store] means that like relational databases, Cassandra organizes data by rows and columns.

While not every point here will be immediately practical to implement or relevant for every \ncontribution, it errs on the side of not making rules out of potential exceptions. It provides guidelines on test scope, style, and goals, as\nwell as guidelines for dealing with global state and refactoring untested code.\n\n## What to Test\n\nThere are 3 main types of tests in Cassandra, unit tests, integration tests, and dtests. Below, each type of test is described, and a high level description of \nwhat should and shouldn't be tested in each is given.\n\n### Unit Tests\nJUnit tests of smaller components that are fairly narrow in scope (ie: data structures, verb handlers, helper classes)\n\n#### What should be tested\n * All state transitions should be tested\n * Illegal state transitions should be tested (that they throw exceptions)\n * all conditional branches should be tested. \n * Code that deals with ranges of values should have tests around expected ranges, unexpected ranges, different functional ranges and their boundaries.\n * Exception handling should be tested.\n\n#### What shouldn't be tested\n* implementation details (test that the system under test works a certain way, not that it's implemented a certain way)\n\n### Integration Tests\nJUnit tests of larger components with a lot of moving parts, usually involved in some internode communication (ie: Gossip, MessagingService).\nThe smaller components that make up the system under test in an integration test should be individually unit tested.\n\n#### What should be tested\n* messages are sent when expected\n* received messages have the intended side effects\n* internal interfaces work as expected\n* external interfaces are interacted with as expected\n* multiple instances of components interact as expected (with a mocked messaging service, and other dependencies, where appropriate)\n* dry start - test that a system starts up properly the first time a node start\n* restart - test that a system starts up properly on node restart (from both clean and unclean shutdown)\n* shutdown - test that a system can shutdown properly\n* upgrade - test that a system is able to restart with data from a previous version\n\n#### What shouldn't be tested\n* The rest of the application. It should be possible to test large systems without starting the entire database through the use of mocks.\n\n**Note:** it's generally not a good idea to mock out the storage layer if the component under test needs to interact with it. If you're testing\nhow multiple instances interact with each other, AND they need to use the storage layer, parameterizing the keyspace/table they store data is\nthe way to do it.\n\n### dtests\npython/ccm tests that start local clusters and interact with them via the python client.\n\ndtests are effectively black box tests, and should be used for checking that clusters and client side interfaces work as expected. They are not \na replacement for proper functional java tests. They take much longer to run, and are much less flexible in what they can test.\n\nSystems under test in dtest should have more granular integration tests as well.\n\n#### What should be tested\n* end to end cluster functionality\n* client contracts\n* trivial (to create) failure cases\n\n#### What shouldn't be tested\n* internal implementation details\n\n## Expanded Guidelines\n\nThis section has more in depth descriptions and reasoning about some of the points raised in the previous section.\n\n### Test structure\n\nTests cases should have a clear progression of setup, precondition check, performing some action under test, then a postcondition check.\n\n**Example**\n\n```java\n@Test\npublic void increment() throws Exception\n{\n\t// setup code\n\tint x = 1;\n\n\t// check preconditions\n\tassertEquals(1, x);\n\n\t// perform the state changing action under test\n\tx++;\n\n\t// check post conditions\n\tassertEquals(2, x);\n}\n```\n\n#### Reason\n\nTest cases should be optimized for readability\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nCases where simple cases can be tested in one line. Such as validation logic checks:\nproperty-based state testing (ie: ScalaCheck/QuickCheck)\n\n*Example:*\n```java\n@Test\npublic void validation()\n{\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withState(null));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withSessionID(null));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withCoordinator(null));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withTableIds(null));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withTableIds(new HashSet<>()));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withRepairedAt(0));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withRepairedAt(-1));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withRanges(null));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withRanges(new HashSet<>()));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withParticipants(null));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withParticipants(new HashSet<>()));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withStartedAt(0));\n\tassertValidationFailure(b -> b.withLastUpdate(0));\n}\n```\n\n### Test distributed components in junit\n\nComponents that rely on nodes communicating with each other should be testable in java. \n\n#### Reason\n\nOne of the more difficult aspects of distributed systems is ensuring that they continue to behave correctly during various failure modes.  This includes weird \nedge cases involving specific ordering of events between nodes that rarely occur in the wild. Testing these sorts of scenarios is much easier in junit because \nmock 'clusters' can be placed in specific states, and deterministically stepped through a sequence of events, ensuring that they behave as expected, and are in \nthe expected state after each step.\n\n#### Exceptions\n\nThis rule mainly applies to new or significantly overhauled systems. Older systems *should* be refactored to be thoroughly tested, but it's not necessarily a \nprerequisite for working on them.\n\n### Test all branches and inputs.\n\nAll branches and inputs of a method should be exercised. For branches that require multiple criteria to be met, (ie `x > 10 && y < 100`), there\nshould be tests demonstrating that the branch is taken when all critera are met (ie `x=11,y=99`), and that it is not taken when only one is met \n(ie: `x=11, y=200 or x=5,y=99`). If a method deals with ranges of values, (ie `x >= 10`), the boundaries of the ranges should be tested (ie: `x=9, x=10`)\n\nIn the following example\n\n**Example**\n```java\nclass SomeClass\n{\n\tpublic static int someFunction(bool aFlag, int aValue)\n\t{\n\t\tif (aFlag && aValue > 10)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn 20;\n\t\t}\n\t\telse if (aValue > 5)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn 10;\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n\nclass SomeTest\n{\n\tpublic void someFunction() throws Exception\n\t{\n\t\tassertEquals(10, somefunction(true, 11));\n\t\tassertEquals(5, somefunction(false, 11));\n\t\tassertEquals(5, somefunction(true, 8));\n\t\tassertEquals(5, somefunction(false, 8));\n\t\tassertEquals(0, somefunction(false, 4));\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n### Test any state transitions\n\nAs an extension of testing all branches and inputs. For stateful systems, there should be tests demonstrating that states change under the intended \ncircumstances, and that state changes have the intended side effects.\n \n### Test unsupported arguments and states throw exceptions\n\nIf a system is not intended to perform an action in a given state (ie: a node performing reads during bootstrap), or a method is not intended\nto encounter some type of argument (ie: a method that is only designed to work with numeric values > 0), then there should be tests demonstrating\nthat an appropriate exception is raised (IllegalStateException or IllegalArgumentException, respectively) in that case.\n\nThe guava preconditions module makes this straightforward.\n\n#### Reason\n\nInadvertent misuse of methods and systems cause bugs that are often silent and subtle. Raising exceptions on unintended usage helps\nprotect against future bugs and reduces developer surprise.\n\n## Dealing with global state\n\nUnfortunately, the project has extensive amounts of global state which makes actually writing robust tests difficult, but not impossible.\n\nHaving dependencies on global state is not an excuse to not test something, or to throw a dtest or assertion at it and call it a day.\n\nStructuring code in a way that interacts with global state that can still be deterministically tested just takes a few tweaks\n\n**Example, bad**\n```java\nclass SomeVerbHandler implements IVerbHandler<SomeMessage>\n{\n\tpublic void doVerb(MessageIn<SomeMessage> msg)\n\t{\n\t\tif (FailureDetector.instance.isAlive(msg.payload.otherNode))\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tnew StreamPlan(msg.payload.otherNode).requestRanges(someRanges).execute();\n\t\t}\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tCompactionManager.instance.submitBackground(msg.payload.cfs);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn this made up example, we're checking global state, and then taking some action against other global state. None of the global state\nwe're working with is easy to manipulate for tests, so comprehensive tests for this aren't very likely to be written. Even worse, whether\nthe FailureDetector, streaming, or compaction work properly are out of scope for our purposes. We're concerned with whether SomeVerbHandler\nworks as expected.\n\nIdeally though, classes won't have dependencies on global state at all, and have everything they need to work passed in as constructor arguments.\nThis also enables comprehensive testing, and stops the spread of global state. \n\nThis prevents the spread of global state, and also begins to identify and define the internal interfaces that will replace global state.\n\n**Example, better**\n```java\nclass SomeVerbHandler implements IVerbHandler<SomeMessage>\n{\n\tprivate final IFailureDetector failureDetector;\n\tprivate final ICompactionManager compactionManager;\n\tprivate final IStreamManager streamManager;\n\n\tpublic SomeVerbHandler(IFailureDetector failureDetector, ICompactionManager compactionManager, IStreamManager streamManager)\n\t{\n\t\tthis.failureDetector = failureDetector;\n\t\tthis.compactionManager = compactionManager;\n\t\tthis.streamManager = streamManager;\n\t}\n\n\tpublic void doVerb(MessageIn<SomeMessage> msg)\n\t{\n\t\tif (failureDetector.isAlive(msg.payload.otherNode))\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tstreamExecutor.submitPlan(new StreamPlan(msg.payload.otherNode).requestRanges(someRanges));\n\t\t}\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tcompactionManager.submitBackground(msg.payload.cfs);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n**Example test**\n```java\nclass SomeVerbTest\n{\n\tclass InstrumentedFailureDetector implements IFailureDetector\n\t{\n\t\tboolean alive = false;\n\t\t@Override\n\t\tpublic boolean isAlive(InetAddress address)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\treturn alive;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tclass InstrumentedCompactionManager implements ICompactionManager\n\t{\n\t\tboolean submitted = false;\n\t\t@Override\n\t\tpublic void submitBackground(ColumnFamilyStore cfs)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tsubmitted = true;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tclass InstrumentedStreamManager implements IStreamManager\n\t{\n\t\tboolean submitted = false;\n\t\t@Override\n\t\tpublic void submitPlan(StreamPlan plan)\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tsubmitted = true;\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t@Test\n\tpublic void liveNode() throws Exception\n\t{\n\t\tInstrumentedFailureDetector failureDetector = new InstrumentedFailureDetector();\n\t\tfailureDetector.alive = true;\n\t\tInstrumentedCompactionManager compactionManager = new InstrumentedCompactionManager();\n\t\tInstrumentedStreamManager streamManager = new InstrumentedStreamManager();\n\t\tSomeVerbHandler handler = new SomeVerbHandler(failureDetector, compactionManager, streamManager);\n\n\t\tMessageIn<SomeMessage> msg = new MessageIn<>(...);\n\n\t\tassertFalse(streamManager.submitted);\n\t\tassertFalse(compactionManager.submitted);\n\n\t\thandler.doVerb(msg);\n\n\t\tassertTrue(streamManager.submitted);\n\t\tassertFalse(compactionManager.submitted);\n\t}\n\n\t@Test\n\tpublic void deadNode() throws Exception\n\t{\n\t\tInstrumentedFailureDetector failureDetector = new InstrumentedFailureDetector();\n\t\tfailureDetector.alive = false;\n\t\tInstrumentedCompactionManager compactionManager = new InstrumentedCompactionManager();\n\t\tInstrumentedStreamManager streamManager = new InstrumentedStreamManager();\n\t\tSomeVerbHandler handler = new SomeVerbHandler(failureDetector, compactionManager, streamManager);\n\n\t\tMessageIn<SomeMessage> msg = new MessageIn<>(...);\n\n\t\tassertFalse(streamManager.submitted);\n\t\tassertFalse(compactionManager.submitted);\n\n\t\thandler.doVerb(msg);\n\n\t\tassertFalse(streamManager.submitted);\n\t\tassertTrue(compactionManager.submitted);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nBy abstracting away accesses to global state we can exhaustively test the paths this verb handler can take, and directly confirm that it's taking the correct \nactions. Obviously, this is a simple example, but for classes or functions with more complex logic, this makes comprehensive testing much easier.\n\nNote that the interfaces used here probably shouldn't be the same ones we use for MBeans.\n\nHowever, in some cases, passing interfaces into the constructor may not be practical. Classes that are instantiated on startup need to be handled with care, since accessing\na singleton may change the initialization order of the database. It may also be a larger change than is warranted for something like a bug fix. In any case, if passing\ndependencies into the constructor is not practical, wrapping accesses to global state in protected methods that are overridden for tests will achieve the same thing.\n\n\n**Example, alternative**\n```java\nclass SomeVerbHandler implements IVerbHandler<SomeMessage>\n{ \n\t@VisibleForTesting\n\tprotected boolean isAlive(InetAddress addr) { return FailureDetector.instance.isAlive(msg.payload.otherNode); }\n\n\t@VisibleForTesting\n\tprotected void streamSomething(InetAddress to) { new StreamPlan(to).requestRanges(someRanges).execute(); }\n\n\t@VisibleForTesting\n\tprotected void compactSomething(ColumnFamilyStore cfs ) { CompactionManager.instance.submitBackground(); }\n\n\tpublic void doVerb(MessageIn<SomeMessage> msg)\n\t{\n\t\tif (isAlive(msg.payload.otherNode))\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tstreamSomething(msg.payload.otherNode);\n\t\t}\n\t\telse\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tcompactSomething();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n**Example test**\n```java\nclass SomeVerbTest\n{\n\tstatic class InstrumentedSomeVerbHandler extends SomeVerbHandler\n\t{\n\t\tpublic boolean alive = false;\n\t\tpublic boolean streamCalled = false;\n\t\tpublic boolean compactCalled = false;\n\n\t\t@Override\n\t\tprotected boolean isAlive(InetAddress addr) { return alive; }\n\t\t\n\t\t@Override\n\t\tprotected void streamSomething(InetAddress to) { streamCalled = true; }\n\n\t\t@Override\n\t\tprotected void compactSomething(ColumnFamilyStore cfs ) { compactCalled = true; }\n\t}\n\n\t@Test\n\tpublic void liveNode() throws Exception\n\t{\n\t\tInstrumentedSomeVerbHandler handler = new InstrumentedSomeVerbHandler();\n\t\thandler.alive = true;\n\t\tMessageIn<SomeMessage> msg = new MessageIn<>(...);\n\n\t\tassertFalse(handler.streamCalled);\n\t\tassertFalse(handler.compactCalled);\n\n\t\thandler.doVerb(msg);\n\n\t\tassertTrue(handler.streamCalled);\n\t\tassertFalse(handler.compactCalled);\n\t}\n\n\t@Test\n\tpublic void deadNode() throws Exception\n\t{\n\t\tInstrumentedSomeVerbHandler handler = new InstrumentedSomeVerbHandler();\n\t\thandler.alive = false;\n\t\tMessageIn<SomeMessage> msg = new MessageIn<>(...);\n\n\t\tassertFalse(handler.streamCalled);\n\t\tassertFalse(handler.compactCalled);\n\n\t\thandler.doVerb(msg);\n\n\t\tassertFalse(handler.streamCalled);\n\t\tassertTrue(handler.compactCalled);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\n## Refactoring Existing Code\n\nIf you're working on a section of the project that historically hasn't been well tested, it will likely be more difficult for you to write tests around\nwhatever you're doing, since the code may not have been written with testing in mind. You do need to add tests around the subject of you're \njira, and this will probably involve some refactoring, but you're also not expected to completely refactor a huge class to submit a bugfix. \n\nBasically, you need to be able to verify the behavior you intend to modify before and after your patch. The amount of testing debt you pay back should be \nroughly proportional to the scope of your change. If you're doing a small bugfix, you can get away with refactoring just enough to make the subject of your \nfix testable, even if you start to get into 'testing implementation details' territory'. The goal is incremental improvement, not making things perfect on \nthe first iteration. If you're doing something more ambitious though, you may have to do some extra work to sufficiently test your changes.\n\n## Refactoring Untested Code\n\nThere are several components that have very little, if any, direct test coverage. We really should try to improve the test coverage of these components.\nFor people interested in getting involved with the project, adding tests for these is a great way to get familiar with the codebase.\n\nFirst, get feedback on the subject and scope of your proposed refactor, especially larger ones. The smaller and more narrowly focused your proposed \nrefactor is, the easier it will be for you to get it reviewed and committed.\n\nStart with smaller pieces, refactor and test them, and work outwards, iteratively. Preferably in several jiras. Ideally, each patch should add some value\nto the project on it's own in terms of test coverage. Patches that are heavy on refactoring, and light on tests are not likely to get committed. People come and go\nfrom projects, and having a many small improvements is better for the project than several unfinished or ongoing refactors that don't add much test coverage.\n"
