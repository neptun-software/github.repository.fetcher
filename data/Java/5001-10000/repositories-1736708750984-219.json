          "content": "<a name=\"README\">[<img src=\"https://rawgithub.com/robolectric/robolectric/master/images/robolectric-horizontal.png\"/>](https://robolectric.org)</a>\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/actions?query=workflow%3Atests)\n[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/robolectric/robolectric.svg?maxAge=60)](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/releases)\n\nRobolectric is the industry-standard unit testing framework for Android. With Robolectric, your tests run in a simulated Android environment inside a JVM, without the overhead and flakiness of an emulator. Robolectric tests routinely run 10x faster than those on cold-started emulators.\n\nRobolectric supports running unit tests for *15* different versions of Android, ranging from Lollipop (API level 21) to V (API level 35).\n\n## Usage\n\nHere's an example of a simple test written using Robolectric:\n\n```java\n@RunWith(AndroidJUnit4.class)\npublic class MyActivityTest {\n\n  @Test\n  public void clickingButton_shouldChangeResultsViewText() {\n    Activity activity = Robolectric.setupActivity(MyActivity.class);\n\n    Button button = (Button) activity.findViewById(R.id.press_me_button);\n    TextView results = (TextView) activity.findViewById(R.id.results_text_view);\n\n    button.performClick();\n    assertThat(results.getText().toString(), equalTo(\"Testing Android Rocks!\"));\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFor more information about how to install and use Robolectric on your project, extend its functionality, and join the community of contributors, please visit [robolectric.org](https://robolectric.org).\n\n## Install\n\n### Starting a New Project\n\nIf you'd like to start a new project with Robolectric tests, you can refer to `deckard` (for either [Maven](https://github.com/robolectric/deckard-maven) or [Gradle](https://github.com/robolectric/deckard-gradle)) as a guide to setting up both Android and Robolectric on your machine.\n\n### `build.gradle`\n\n```groovy\ntestImplementation \"junit:junit:4.13.2\"\ntestImplementation \"org.robolectric:robolectric:4.14.1\"\n```\n\n## Building and Contributing\n\nRobolectric is built using Gradle. Both Android Studio and IntelliJ can import the top-level `build.gradle.kts` file and will automatically generate their project files from it.\n\nTo get Robolectric up and running on your machine, check out\n[this guide](https://robolectric.org/building-robolectric/).\n\nTo get a high-level overview of Robolectric's architecture, check out\n[robolectric.org](https://robolectric.org/architecture).\n\n## Development model\n\nRobolectric is actively developed in several locations. The primary location is\nthis GitHub repository, which is considered the *source-of-truth* for\nRobolectric code. It is where contributions from the broader Android developer\ncommunity occur. There is also an active development tree of Robolectric\ninternally at Google, where contributions from first-party Android developers\noccur. By having a development tree of Robolectric internally at Google, it\nenables first-party Android developers to more efficiently make contributions\nto Robolectric. This tree is synced directly to the [`google`\nbranch](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/tree/google) every\ntime a change occurs using the [`Copybara`](https://github.com/google/copybara)\ncode sync tool. Bidirectional merges of this branch and the\n[`master`](https://github.com/robolectric/robolectric/tree/master) branch occur\nregularly.\n\nRobolectric also has usage in the Android platform via the\n[external/robolectric](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:external/robolectric/)\nrepo project. Contributions to this source tree are typically related to new\nSDK support and evolving platform APIs. Changes from this branch are upstreamed\nto the internal Robolectric tree at Google, which eventually propagate to the\nGitHub branches.\n\nAlthough complex, this distributed development model enables Android developers\nin different environments to use and contribute to Robolectric, while allowing\nchanges to eventually make their way to public Robolectric releases.\n\n## Using Snapshots\n\nIf you would like to live on the bleeding edge, you can try running against a snapshot build. Keep in mind that snapshots represent the most recent changes on the `master` and may contain bugs.\n\n### `build.gradle`\n\n```groovy\nrepositories {\n    maven { url \"https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots\" }\n}\n\ndependencies {\n    testImplementation \"org.robolectric:robolectric:4.15-SNAPSHOT\"\n}\n```\n"
