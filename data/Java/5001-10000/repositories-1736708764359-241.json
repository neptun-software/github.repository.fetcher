min scale:  \n     allows you to set the minimum scale of left and right bottom pages.\n    \n - max scale:  \n     allows you to set the maximum scale of center top page.\n    \n - min scale offset:  \n     allows you to set offset from edge to minimum scaled pages.\n         \n - center scale offset:  \n    allows you to set offset from center when two pages appears.\n\n - model selected icon:  \n     allows you to set selected icon when current model is active.\n\n - medium scaled:  \n     allows you to set is scaling would be min -> max or min -> medium -> max.\n    \n - scroll duration:  \n     allows you to set snap scrolling duration.\n     \n - scroll interpolator:  \n     allows you to set snap scrolling interpolator.\n    \n - page transform listener:  \n     allows you to set page transform listener.\n     \n - auto scroll:  \n     allows you to set auto scroll in positive and negative directions.\n    \n<b>Tips</b>\n\nTwo-way widget need a lot of memory.  \nInfinite scroll available when item count more then 2.  \nYou can set vertical or horizontal infinite cycle ViewPager.\n\n<b>Init</b>\n\nCheck out in code init:\n\n```java\n//      final VerticalInfiniteCycleViewPager infiniteCycleViewPager =\n//                (VerticalInfiniteCycleViewPager) view.findViewById(R.id.vicvp);\n        final HorizontalInfiniteCycleViewPager infiniteCycleViewPager =\n                (HorizontalInfiniteCycleViewPager) view.findViewById(R.id.hicvp);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setAdapter(...);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setScrollDuration(500);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setInterpolator(...);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setMediumScaled(true);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setMaxPageScale(0.8F);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setMinPageScale(0.5F);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setCenterPageScaleOffset(30.0F);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setMinPageScaleOffset(5.0F);\n        infiniteCycleViewPager.setOnInfiniteCyclePageTransformListener(...);\n```\n\nIf you want to get item position just call this method:  \n```java\ninfiniteCycleViewPager.getRealItem();\n```\n          \nTo update your ViewPager after some adapter update or else, you can call this method:  \n```java\ninfiniteCycleViewPager.notifyDataSetChanged();\n```\n\nIf you want to start auto scroll or stop call this methods:  \n```java\n// true - positive\n// false - negative\ninfiniteCycleViewPager.startAutoScroll(...);\ninfiniteCycleViewPager.stopAutoScroll();\n```\n\nOther methods check out in sample.\n\nAnd XML init:\n\n```xml\n\n<!--<com.gigamole.infinitecycleviewpager.VerticalInfiniteCycleViewPager-->\n<com.gigamole.infinitecycleviewpager.HorizontalInfiniteCycleViewPager\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n    app:icvp_interpolator=\"...\"\n    app:icvp_center_page_scale_offset=\"30dp\"\n    app:icvp_max_page_scale=\"0.8\"\n    app:icvp_medium_scaled=\"true\"\n    app:icvp_min_page_scale=\"0.5\"\n    app:icvp_min_page_scale_offset=\"5dp\"\n    app:icvp_scroll_duration=\"500\"/>\n```\n\nGetting Help\n============\n\nTo report a specific problem or feature request, [open a new issue on Github](https://github.com/DevLight-Mobile-Agency/InfiniteCycleViewPager/issues/new).\n\nXamarin\n=======\n\nThanks to [Martijn van Dijk](https://github.com/martijn00) for developing Xamarin bindings library for [InfiniteCycleViewPager](https://github.com/martijn00/InfiniteCycleViewPagerXamarin).  \nPlugin is available on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Xam.Plugins.Android.InfiniteCycleViewPager/).\n\nCredits\n=======\n\n|[Yehor Kosinov](https://dribbble.com/Kosinov)|[Prakhar Neel Sharma](https://dribbble.com/prakhar)|\n|:-------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------:|\n[![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0BxPO_UeS7wScVEZRbk5LaFVzUzQ)](https://dribbble.com/shots/2832006-Cinema-App)|[![](https://d13yacurqjgara.cloudfront.net/users/452635/screenshots/2383427/festival.png)](https://dribbble.com/shots/2383427-Personal-Festival-App-Finally-Done)\n\nAuthor\n======\n\nCreated by [Basil Miller](https://github.com/GIGAMOLE) -
