          "content": "# Keycloak Community\n\nKeycloak is an Open Source Identity and Access Management solution for modern Applications and Services.\n\n## Building and working with the codebase\n\nDetails for building from source and working with the codebase are provided in the [building and working with the code base](docs/building.md) guide.\n\n## Contributing to Keycloak\n\nKeycloak is an Open Source community-driven project and we welcome contributions as well as feedback from the community. We do have a few guidelines in place to help you be successful with your contribution to Keycloak.\n\nFirstly, if you want to contribute a larger change to Keycloak we ask that you open a \ndiscussion first. For minor changes you can skip this part and go straight ahead to sending a contribution. Bear in mind that if you open a discussion first you can identify if the change will be accepted, as well as getting early feedback.  \n\nEach PR, no matter how small, should have a GitHub issue associated with it.\nIssues are important for administrative purposes such as generating a changelog and handling backports.\n\nHere's a quick checklist for a good PR, more details below:\n\n1. A discussion around the change (https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/categories/ideas)\n1. A GitHub Issue with a good description associated with the PR\n1. One feature/change per PR\n1. One commit per PR\n1. PR rebased on main (`git rebase`, not `git pull`) \n1. [Good descriptive commit message, with link to issue](#commit-messages-and-issue-linking)\n1. No changes to code not directly related to your PR\n1. Includes functional/integration test\n1. Includes documentation\n\nOnce you have submitted your PR please monitor it for comments/feedback. We reserve the right to close inactive PRs if\nyou do not respond within 2 weeks (bear in mind you can always open a new PR if it is closed due to inactivity).\n\nAlso, please remember that we do receive a fairly large amount of PRs and also have code to write ourselves, so we may\nnot be able to respond to your PR immediately. The best place to ping us is on the thread you started on the dev mailing list.\n\n### Finding something to work on\n\nIf you would like to contribute to Keycloak, but are not sure exactly what to work on, you can find a number of open\nissues that are awaiting contributions in  \n[issues](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues).\n\n### Open a discussion on a proposed change\n\nAs Keycloak is a community-driven project we require contributors to open a discussion on what they are planning to contribute.\n\nDiscussions should first and foremost be done through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/categories/ideas).\n\nThe [Keycloak Dev Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/keycloak-dev) can be used to notify the community on your new discussion, and can also be used for more low-level implementation discussions.\n\nFor very large proposals it can be inefficient to capture all the information in the GitHub Discussion. In this cases a separate design proposal can be sent to the [Keycloak Community repository](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/tree/main/design), and linked to from the GitHub Discussion.\n\n### Create an issue\n\nTake your time to write a proper issue including a good summary and description. \n\nRemember this may be the first thing a reviewer of your PR will look at to get an idea of what you are proposing \nand it will also be used by the community in the future to find about what new features and enhancements are included in \nnew releases.\n\n### Implementing\n\nDetails for building from source and working with the codebase are provided in the \n[building and working with the code base](docs/building.md) guide.\n\nDo not format or refactor code that is not directly related to your contribution. If you do this it will significantly\nincrease our effort in reviewing your PR. If you have a strong need to refactor code then submit a separate PR for the\nrefactoring.\n\n### Testing\n\nDetails for implementing tests are provided in the [writing tests](docs/tests-development.md) guide.\n\nDo not add mock frameworks or other testing frameworks that are not already part of the testsuite. Please write tests\nin the same way as we have written our tests.\n\n### Documentation\n\nWe require contributions to include relevant documentation. Before submitting your code changes, please take the time to review the [documentation](docs/documentation/README.md) guide and ensure that any necessary documentation changes are included in your pull request.\n\n### Submitting your PR\n\nWhen preparing your PR make sure you have a single commit and your branch is rebased on the main branch from the \nproject repository.\n\nThis means use the `git rebase` command and not `git pull` when integrating changes from main to your branch. See\n[Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Rebasing) for more details.\n\nWe require that you squash to a single commit. You can do this with the `git rebase -i HEAD~X` command where X\nis the number of commits you want to squash. See the [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)\nfor more details.\n\nThe above helps us review your PR and also makes it easier for us to maintain the repository. It is also required by\nour automatic merging process. \n\nPlease, also provide a good description [commit message, with a link to the issue](#commit-messages-and-issue-linking).\nWe also require that the commit message includes a link to the issue ([linking a pull request to an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)).\n\n### Developer's Certificate of Origin\n\nAny contributions to Keycloak must only contain code that can legally be contributed to Keycloak, and which the Keycloak\nproject can distribute under its license.\n\nPrior to contributing to Keycloak please read the [Developer's Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)\nand sign-off all commits with the `--signoff` option provided by `git commit`. For example:\n\n```\ngit commit --signoff --message \"This is the commit message\"\n```\n\nThis option adds a `Signed-off-by` trailer at the end of the commit log message.\n\n### Commit messages and issue linking\n\nThe format for a commit message should look like:\n\n```\nA brief descriptive summary\n\nOptionally, more details around how it was implemented\n\nCloses #1234\n``` \n\nThe very last part of the commit message should be a link to the GitHub issue, when done correctly GitHub will automatically link the issue with the PR. There are 3 alternatives provided by GitHub here:\n\n* Closes: Issues in the same repository\n* Fixes: Issues in a different repository (this shouldn't be used, as issues should be created in the correct repository instead)\n* Resolves: When multiple issues are resolved (this should be avoided)\n\nAlthough, GitHub allows alternatives (close, closed, fix, fixed), please only use the above formats.\n\nCreating multi line commit messages with `git` can be done with:\n\n```\ngit commit -m \"Summary\" -m \"Optional description\" -m \"Closes #1234\"\n```\n\nAlternatively, `shift + enter` can be used to add line breaks:\n\n```\n$ git commit -m \"Summary\n> \n> Optional description\n> \n> Closes #1234\"\n```\n\nFor more information linking PRs to issues refer to the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue).\n\n### Contributing Translations\n\nIn order to provide translations for Keycloak, kindly follow the instructions provided in [Translation Docs](./docs/translation.md).\n"

          "content": "# Keycloak Governance\n\n* [Vision](#vision) \n* [Maintainers](#maintainers) \n* [Contributing](#contributing)\n\n## Vision\n\nKeycloak aims to be easy to use and lightweight. The project was founded to make it easy for application developers \nto secure modern applications and services.\n\nThe 80/20 rule, that states 80% of requirements come from around 20% of use cases, is a core part of the vision behind \nKeycloak. We strongly believe if Keycloak would support all use cases by default it would become bloated and hard to use.\n\nKeycloak aims to be opinionated and make it as easy as possible to achieve the common use cases, while still\nenabling the less common use cases through custom extensions.\n\n\n## Projects\n\nKeycloak consists of several projects:\n\n* [Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak) - Keycloak Server and Java adapters\n* [Keycloak QuickStarts](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts) - QuickStarts for getting started with Keycloak\n* [Keycloak Benchmark](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-benchmark) - Load tests for benchmarking Keycloak\n* [Keycloak Community](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community) - Keycloak design documents\n* [Keycloak Web](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-web) - Website keycloak.org\n\nThe same governance model applies to all projects. However, the list of maintainers may vary per project. \n\n\n## Maintainers\n\nThe list of maintainers can be found in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) file in the repository for the individual \nprojects listed in the [Projects](#projects) section.\n\n### Maintainer Responsibilities\n\nA maintainer is someone who has shown deep knowledge of vision, features and codebase. It is their \nresponsibility to drive the project forward, encourage collaboration and contributions, and generally help the \ncommunity.\n\nResponsibilities of a maintainer include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Engage in design discussions\n* Actively monitor mailing lists, user forum and chat\n* Contribute high quality code\n* Maintain deep knowledge of vision, features and codebase\n* Review pull requests either personally or delegate to experts in the relevant area\n* Helping the community\n\n### Becoming a Maintainer\n\nTo become a maintainer, you need to demonstrate the following:\n\n* Good understanding of vision, features and codebase\n* Contribution of larger features\n* Contribution of bug fixes\n* Participation in design discussions\n* Participation in pull request reviews\n* Ability to collaborate with the team\n* Helping the community\n\nA new maintainer must be proposed by sending an email to keycloak-maintainers(at)googlegroups.com.\nThe email should include evidence of the above list.\n\nThe existing maintainers will then discuss the proposal. If anyone objects or wants more information, the maintainers \nwill reach out to the nominee directly for further discussion. \n\nFor the nominee to be accepted as a maintainer at least 2/3 of existing maintainers have to approve the nominee.\n\n\n### Changes in Maintainership\n\nEvery 6 months (March and September) active maintainers fill in a survey covering what they have been doing as a maintainer \nfor the last period, and what they are planning on focusing on in the next period. The survey is not made publicly \navailable, but is shared with existing maintainers. This serves two purposes; firstly for the maintainers group to better\nunderstand what each maintainer is focusing on, and secondly to identify maintainers that are no longer active.\n\nIn the majority of cases a maintainer is removed by the maintainer stepping down themselves (by sending an email to\nkeycloak-maintainers(at)googlegroups.com). However, in exceptional circumstances a maintainer can also be removed with\n2/3 of votes from existing maintainers.\n\n\n## Contributing Changes\n\nThe process of reviewing proposed changes differs depending of the size and impact of the change.\n\n### Minor Changes\n\nA minor change is a bug fix, a smaller enhancement or a smaller addition to existing features.\n\nTo propose a minor change, simply create an issue in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/issues) and\nsend a pull request.\n\nA maintainer will be responsible for ultimately approving the pull request. The maintainer may do a deep review of the\npull request or delegate to an expert in the corresponding area.\n\nIf the change has a bigger impact it has to follow the process for larger changes.\n\n### Larger Changes\n\nFor larger changes all maintainers and contributors should have a chance of reviewing the change. This is done through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/categories/ideas).\n\nFor new features we highly recommend always opening a discussion in GitHub Discussions early.\n\nFor very large proposals it can be inefficient to capture all the information in the GitHub Discussion. In this cases a separate design proposal can be sent to the [Keycloak Community repository](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/tree/main/design), and linked to from the GitHub Discussion.\n\nThe contributor can decide to send a pull request prior to discussions. However, the change will not be accepted until it has been discussed through [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/categories/ideas).\n\nIf there are any objections to the change they can in most cases be resolved through discussions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/discussions/categories/ideas), or\nin the pull request. If a resolution can not be made it can be accepted if at least 2/3 of maintainers approve the change.\n"
