          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThis is for code contributions. For translations, see [TRANSLATING](TRANSLATING.md).\n\n## Basic Guidelines\n\n### Use an IDE.\nSpecifically, IntelliJ IDEA. Download the (free) Community Edition of it [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/). Some people use other tools, like VS Code, but I would personally not recommend them for Java development.\n\n### Always test your changes.\nDo not submit something without at least running the game to see if it compiles.  \nIf you are submitting a new block, make sure it has a name and description, and that it works correctly in-game. If you are changing existing block mechanics, test them out first.\n\n### Do not make large changes before discussing them first.\nIf you are interested in adding a large mechanic/feature or changing large amounts of code, first contact me (Anuken) via [Discord](https://discord.gg/mindustry) - either via PM or by posting in the `#pulls` channel.\nFor most changes, this should not be necessary. I just want to know if you're doing something big so I can offer advice and/or make sure you're not wasting your time on it.\n\n### Do not make formatting PRs.\nYes, there are occurrences of trailing spaces, extra newlines, empty indents, and other tiny errors. No, I don't want to merge, view, or get notified by your 1-line PR fixing it. If you're implementing a PR with modification of *actual code*, feel free to fix formatting in the general vicinity of your changes, but please don't waste everyone's time with pointless changes.\n\n## Style Guidelines\n\n### Follow the formatting guidelines.\nThis means:\n- No spaces around parentheses: `if(condition){`, `SomeType s = (SomeType)object`\n- Same-line braces.\n- 4 spaces indentation\n- `camelCase`, **even for constants or enums**. Why? Because `SCREAMING_CASE` is ugly, annoying to type and does not achieve anything useful. Constants are *less* dangerous than variables, not more. Any reasonable IDE should highlight them for you anyway.\n- No underscores for anything. (Yes, I know `Bindings` violates this principle, but that's for legacy reasons and really should be cleaned up some day)\n- Do not use braceless `if/else` statements. `if(x) statement else statement2` should **never** be done. In very specific situations, having braceless if-statements on one line is allowed: `if(cond) return;` would be valid.\n- Prefer single-line javadoc `/** @return for example */` instead of multiline javadoc whenever possible\n- Short method/variable names (multipleLongWords should be avoided if it's possible to do so reasonably, especially for variables)\n- Use wildcard imports - `import some.package.*` - for everything. This makes incorrect class usage more obvious (*e.g. arc.util.Timer vs java.util.Timer*) and leads to cleaner-looking code.\n\nImport [this style file](.github/Mindustry-CodeStyle-IJ.xml) into IntelliJ to get correct formatting when developing Mindustry.\n\n### Do not use incompatible Java features (java.util.function, java.awt).\nAndroid and RoboVM (iOS) do not support many of Java 8's features, such as the packages `java.util.function`, `java.util.stream` or `forEach` in collections. Do not use these in your code.  \nIf you need to use functional interfaces, use the ones in `arc.func`, which are more or less the same with different naming schemes.\n  \nThe same applies to any class *outside* of the standard `java.[n]io` / `java.net` / `java.util` packages: Most of them are not supported.  \n`java.awt` is one of these packages: do not use it, ever. It is not supported on any platform, even desktop - the entire package is removed during JRE minimization.\nIn general, if you are using IntelliJ, you should be warned about platform incompatiblities.\n\n\n### Use `arc` collections and classes when possible.\nInstead of using `java.util.List`, `java.util.HashMap`, and other standard Java collections, use `Seq`, `ObjectMap` and other equivalents from `arc.struct`.\nWhy? Because that's what the rest of the codebase uses, and the standard collections have a lot of cruft and usability issues associated with them.  \nIn the rare case that concurrency is required, you may use the standard Java classes for that purpose (e.g. `CopyOnWriteArrayList`).  \n\nWhat you'll usually need to change:\n- `HashSet` -> `ObjectSet`\n- `HashMap` -> `ObjectMap`\n- `List` / `ArrayList` / `Stack` -> `Seq`\n- `java.util.Queue` -> `arc.struct.Queue`\n- *Many others*\n\n\n### Avoid boxed types (Integer, Boolean)\nNever create variables or collections with boxed types `Seq<Integer>` or `ObjectMap<Integer, ...>`. Use the collections specialized for this task, e.g. `IntSeq` and `IntMap`.\n\n\n### Do not allocate anything if possible.\nNever allocate `new` objects in the main loop. If you absolutely require new objects, use `Pools` to obtain and free object instances. \nOtherwise, use the `Tmp` variables for things like vector/shape operations, or create `static` variables for re-use.\nIf using a list, make it a static variable and clear it every time it is used. Re-use as much as possible.\n\n### Avoid bloated code and unnecessary getters/setters.\nThis is situational, but in essence what it means is to avoid using any sort of getters and setters unless absolutely necessary. Public or protected fields should suffice for most things. \nIf something needs to be encapsulated in the future, IntelliJ can handle it with a few clicks.\n\n\n### Do not create methods unless necessary.\nUnless a block of code is very large or used in more than 1-2 places, don't split it up into a separate method. Making unnecessary methods only creates confusion, and may slightly decrease performance.  \n\n## Other Notes\nIf you would like your name to appear in the game's credits, add it to the [list of contributors](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/blob/master/core/assets/contributors) as part of your PR.\n"

Note that this does **not** mean that the latest stable version of Mindustry has the fix! \nIt simply means that I have committed (or am about to commit) a patch that fixes it *on the current development branch*.\n\n## Your issue is missing a crash report or log\n\nIf the game crashes without a specific cause, and you don't send me a log, I can't fix it. There is no way for me to know what went wrong.\n\nDuring a normal crash, the game should tell you where the log is saved. If not, you should still be able to look in the game's crash folder on most operating systems, or export the logs in *Settings -> Game Data -> Export Crash Logs*.\n\n## Your issue is missing saves or screenshots\n\nEven if you think your problem happens everywhere and saves/screenshots are redundant, this is frequently not the case.\nIf I cannot reproduce the problem on my own saves and you have not linked any of your own, then the problem is likely to be save-specific. If you do not send me any, the problem cannot be investigated further.\n\n## Your issue is related to an external program\n\nIf Mindustry causes something else to crash or misbehave, I am very unlikely to fix it. Unless the problem is serious, widespread and/or clearly a bug *in Mindustry*, it is not my responsibility.\n\nSimilarly, if you use another (invasive) program to change how Mindustry works, and something goes wrong, that is not my problem. Don't do it.\n\n## Your issue is caused by mods\n\nCrashes and bugs related to installed mods should be reported in the relevant mod repository, not here.\n*Note that problems with the Mindustry modding API are a separate problem, and do not apply.*\n\n## I cannot reproduce your issue\n\nIf I follow your instructions and am repeatedly unable to reproduce the problem you've reported, then it is very unlikely to be fixed. \nEither the problem is device-specific, or there is not enough information given for me to be able to reproduce it.\n\nI may attempt to change some code if I think it will make the issue less likely to occur, but without knowing for sure, the issue cannot be considered truly \"fixed\". \nAs I cannot make any further progress on the problem, there is no reason to keep it open. If it is a common bug/crash, other people will come along with information that may shed some light on the issue.\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n"

You can see them [here](https://github.com/Anuken/MindustryBuilds/releases).\n\nIf you'd rather compile on your own, follow these instructions.\nFirst, make sure you have [JDK 17](https://adoptium.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot) installed. **Other JDK versions will not work.** Open a terminal in the Mindustry directory and run the following commands:\n\n### Windows\n\n_Running:_ `gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `gradlew desktop:dist`  \n_Sprite Packing:_ `gradlew tools:pack`\n\n### Linux/Mac OS\n\n_Running:_ `./gradlew desktop:run`  \n_Building:_ `./gradlew desktop:dist`  \n_Sprite Packing:_ `./gradlew tools:pack`\n\n### Server\n\nServer builds are bundled with each released build (in Releases). If you'd rather compile on your own, replace 'desktop' with 'server', e.g. `gradlew server:dist`.\n\n### Android\n\n1. Install the Android SDK [here.](https://developer.android.com/studio#command-tools) Make sure you're downloading the \"Command line tools only\", as Android Studio is not required.\n2. In the unzipped Android SDK folder, find the cmdline-tools directory. Then create a folder inside of it called `latest` and put all of its contents into the newly created folder.\n3. In the same directory run the command `sdkmanager --licenses` (or `./sdkmanager --licenses` if on linux/mac)\n4. Set the `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable to point to your unzipped Android SDK directory.\n5. Enable developer mode on your device/emulator. If you are on testing on a phone you can follow [these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb#Enabling), otherwise you need to google how to enable your emulator's developer mode specifically.\n6. Run `gradlew android:assembleDebug` (or `./gradlew` if on linux/mac). This will create an unsigned APK in `android/build/outputs/apk`.\n\nTo debug the application on a connected device/emulator, run `gradlew android:installDebug android:run`.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\n#### Permission Denied\n\nIf the terminal returns `Permission denied` or `Command not found` on Mac/Linux, run `chmod +x ./gradlew` before running `./gradlew`. *This is a one-time procedure.*\n\n#### Where is the `mindustry.gen` package?\n\nAs the name implies, `mindustry.gen` is generated *at build time* based on other code. You will not find source code for this package in the repository, and it should not be edited by hand.\n\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of the \"source\" of generated code in `mindustry.gen`:\n\n- `Call`, `*Packet` classes: Generated from methods marked with `@Remote`.\n- All entity classes (`Unit`, `EffectState`, `Posc`, etc): Generated from component classes in the `mindustry.entities.comp` package, and combined using definitions in `mindustry.content.UnitTypes`.\n- `Sounds`, `Musics`, `Tex`, `Icon`, etc: Generated based on files in the respective asset folders.\n\n---\n\nGradle may take up to several minutes to download files. Be patient. <br>\nAfter building, the output .JAR file should be in `/desktop/build/libs/Mindustry.jar` for desktop builds, and in `/server/build/libs/server-release.jar` for server builds.\n\n## Feature Requests\n\nPost feature requests and feedback [here](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry-Suggestions/issues/new/choose).\n\n## Downloads\n\n| [![](https://static.itch.io/images/badge.svg)](https://anuke.itch.io/mindustry)    |    [![](https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en-play-badge.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.anuke.mindustry)   |    [![](https://fdroid.gitlab.io/artwork/badge/get-it-on.png)](https://f-droid.org/packages/io.anuke.mindustry)\t| [![](https://flathub.org/assets/badges/flathub-badge-en.svg)](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.Anuken.Mindustry)  \n|---\t|---\t|---\t|---\t|\n"

          "content": "# Note: Server list review is currently on pause. No new servers will be merged until v8 is released!\n\n*PRs to edit addresses of existing servers will still be accepted, although very infrequently.*\n\n### Adding a server to the list\n\nMindustry now has a public list of servers that everyone can see and connect to. \nThis is done by letting clients `GET` a [JSON list of servers](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/blob/master/servers_v7.json) in this repository.\n\nYou may want to add your server to this list. The steps for getting this done are as follows:\n\n0. **Take note of the fact that modded servers are not allowed on this list.** Such servers confuse users, and there's currently no easy way to fix mod incompatibilities after a failed connection.\n1. **Ensure your server is properly moderated.** For the most part, this applies to survival servers, but PvP servers can be affected as well.\nYou'll need to either hire some moderators, or make use of (currently non-existent) anti-grief and anti-curse plugins.\n*Consider enabling a rate limit:* `config messageRateLimit 2` will make it so that players can only send messages every 2 seconds, for example.\n2. Make sure that your server is able to handle inappropriate content - this includes NSFW display/sorter art and abusive messages. **Servers that allow such content will be removed immediately.** Consider banning display blocks if it is a problem for your server: `rules add bannedBlocks [\"canvas\", \"logic-display\", \"large-logic-display\"]`.\n3. **Set an appropriate MOTD, name and description.** This is set with `config <name/desc/motd> <value>`. \"Appropriate\" means that:\n   - Your name or description must reflect the type of server you're hosting. \n   Since new players may be exposed to the server list early on, put in a phrase like \"Co-op survival\" or \"PvP\" so players know what they're getting into. Yes, this is also displayed in the server mode info text, but having extra info in the name doesn't hurt.\n   - Make sure players know where to refer to for server support. It should be fairly clear that the server owner is not me, but you.\n   - Try to be professional in your text; use common sense.\n4. **Get some good maps.** *(optional, but highly recommended)*. Add some maps to your server and set the map rotation to custom-only. You can get maps from the Steam workshop by subscribing and exporting them; using the `#maps` channel on Discord is also an option.\n5. **Check your server configuration.** *(optional)* I would recommend adding a message rate limit of 1 second (`config messageRateLimit 1`), and disabling connect/disconnect messages to reduce spam (`config showConnectMessages false`).\n6. Finally, **submit a pull request** to add your server's IP to the list. \nThis should be fairly straightforward: Press the edit button on the [server file](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/blob/master/servers_v7.json), then add a JSON object with the following format:\n    ```json\n      {\n        \"name\": \"Your Server Group Name\",\n        \"address\": [\"your.server.address\"]\n      }\n    ```\n\n    If your group has multiple servers, simply add extra addresses inside the square brackets, separated by commas. For example: `[\"address1\", \"address2\"]`\n    \n    > Note that Mindustry also support SRV records. This allows you to use a subdomain for your server address instead of specifying the port. For example, if you want to use `play.example.com` instead of `example.com:6000`, in the dns settings of your domain, add an SRV record with `_mindustry` as the service, `tcp` as the protocol, `play` as the target and `6000` as the port. You can also setup fallback servers by modifying the weight or priority of the record. Although SRV records are very convenient, keep in mind they are slower than regular addresses. Avoid using them in the server list, but rather as an easy way to share your server address.\n\n    Then, press the *'submit pull request'* button and I'll take a look at your server. If I have any issues with it, I'll let you know in the PR comments.\n"

          "content": "## Translating for Mindustry\n\nTo begin, log in to your GitHub account, or if you don't have one yet, create it [here](https://github.com/).\n\nConsult [this list](https://www.science.co.il/language/Locale-codes.php) to find the locale code for your language. Once you've found it, \nhead over to the translation bundle folder and check the [list of bundles](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master/core/assets/bundles) that have already been created. \nYou're looking for a file called \"`bundle_`(insert locale code here)`.properties`\". If you don't find one, create one manually (more info below).\n\n#### Editing an existing translation\n\nIf a translation bundle already exists, that means someone has already started working on a translation. To edit it or translate text, simply click the file and press the edit (pencil) button in the top right. Once you're done editing, press the green \"propose file change\" button at the bottom, then \"create pull request\" (twice).\nOnce this is done, all you need to do is wait for me to approve your changes.\n\n#### Creating a new translation bundle\n\nIf a translation bundle for your language *doesn't* exist, you need to create one yourself.  \nIn the folder with all the bundles in it, click the *'create new file'* button, and name it `bundle_(locale code here).properties`. \nThen, copy-paste the entire contents of the [English translation bundle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anuken/Mindustry/master/core/assets/bundles/bundle.properties) into the file, and translate all the necessary text to your language.\nOnce you are done, press the *propose new file* button at the bottom, then 'create pull request' twice.  \n\n#### Useful Information\n\n- When you see text surrounded by square brackets, such as `[RED]`, `[]` or `[accent]`, this indicates a color code. Don't translate it.\n- `{0}` means an argument that will be replaced when the text is displayed. For example, `Wave: {0}` will replace the `{0}` with whatever wave you are in.\n- Empty lines are fine, and it doesn't matter in what order you place the text.\n- `\\n` means \"new line\". If you want to split text into multiple lines, use `\\n` to do it.\n\n#### Testing your translation bundle\n\nThere are two ways to test the translation bundle:\n1) Assuming you have the PC version downloaded, download your bundle file, name it `bundle.properties`, then place it in the same folder as the Mindustry desktop executable and run it. *You should get a popup message in-game confirming that you have loaded an external translation.*\n2) For advanced users: simply download your fork of mindustry and compile/run the game.\n\n#### Translating for stores (Steam, ~~Google Play~~)\n\nNOTE: The Google Play description is in the process of being re-written, please do not translate it.\n\nIf you would like to translate the descriptions for ~~Google Play~~ or Steam, see the [Fastlane Metadata folder](https://github.com/Anuken/Mindustry/tree/master/fastlane/metadata) and submit a pull request for files there. On Google Play, you would create or edit the folder with the correct local code; for Steam, I have to update the translations manually, so just name the folder with the language name, and include the same files as the English folder does.\n\n**And that's it.**  \n\n*(...of course, that's never really it. Bother me on Discord when something inevitably goes wrong.)*\n"
