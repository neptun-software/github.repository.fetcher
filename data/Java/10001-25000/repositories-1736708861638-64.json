For more\ndetails, see our [user's guide][users-guide] and browse the [API docs][javadoc] for the latest\nrelease.\n\n### Cache\n\nCaffeine provides an in-memory cache using a Google Guava inspired API. The improvements draw on our\nexperience designing [Guava's cache][guava-cache] and [ConcurrentLinkedHashMap][clhm].\n\n```java\nLoadingCache<Key, Graph> graphs = Caffeine.newBuilder()\n    .maximumSize(10_000)\n    .expireAfterWrite(Duration.ofMinutes(5))\n    .refreshAfterWrite(Duration.ofMinutes(1))\n    .build(key -> createExpensiveGraph(key));\n```\n\n#### Features at a Glance\n\nCaffeine provides flexible construction to create a cache with a combination of the following\noptional features:\n\n* [automatic loading of entries][population] into the cache, optionally asynchronously\n* [size-based eviction][size] when a maximum is exceeded based on [frequency and recency][efficiency]\n* [time-based expiration][time] of entries, measured since last access or last write\n* [asynchronously refresh][refresh] when the first stale request for an entry occurs\n* keys automatically wrapped in [weak references][reference]\n* values automatically wrapped in [weak or soft references][reference]\n* [notification][listener] of evicted (or otherwise removed) entries\n* [writes propagated][compute] to an external resource\n* accumulation of cache access [statistics][statistics]\n\nIn addition, Caffeine offers the following extensions:\n\n* [JSR-107 JCache][jsr107]\n* [Guava adapters][guava-adapter]\n* [Simulation][simulator]\n\nUse Caffeine in a
