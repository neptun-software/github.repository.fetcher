          "content": "# Eclipse Vert.x Community Contributing Guide\n\nThis document describes a very simple process suitable for most projects in the Vert.x ecosystem. Projects are encouraged to adopt this whether they are hosted in the Vert.x Organization or not.\n\nThe goal of this document is to create a contribution process that:\n\n* Encourages new contributions.\n* Encourages contributors to remain involved.\n* Avoids unnecessary processes and bureaucracy whenever possible.\n* Creates a transparent decision-making process which makes it clear how contributors can be involved in decision-making.\n\n## Vocabulary\n\n* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request.\n* A **Committer** is a subset of contributors who have been given write access to the repository.\n\n\n# Logging Issues\n\nLog an issue for any problem you might have. When in doubt, log an issue, any additional policies about what to include will be provided in the responses. The only exception is security disclosures which should be sent [privately](vertx-enquiries@googlegroups.com).\n\nCommitters may direct you to another repository, ask for additional clarifications, and add appropriate info before the issue is addressed.\n\nFor questions that are not an issue with the code, e.g.: questions related to usage of the project, it is recommended that they are sent to the [community group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vertx). This exposes the question to the whole community, which increases the chance of getting faster responses than just from contributors and committers.\n\n# Contributions\n\nAny change that would roughly be more than 10 lines (non-trivial change) to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes to documentation, code, binary files, etc. Even long term committers must use pull requests. Changes less than 10 lines or so (e.g.: correcting typos, small changes to configuration and such-like) can be make directly on a master branch. For a more detailed development process, please consult the article [Development Process](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki/Development-Process) in the [wiki](https://github.com/vert-x3/wiki/wiki).\n\nNo pull request can be merged without being reviewed.\n\nIt is expected that all contributors to Eclipse Vert.x organization sign the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php). In order to sign the ECA a contributor is required to have an Eclipse Foundation user id and read and digitally sign the following [document](http://www.eclipse.org/contribute/cla). Digitally signing is as simple as read the document and submit the \"I agree\" button.\n\nFor non-trivial contributions, pull requests should sit for at least 36 hours to ensure that contributors in other time zones have time to review. Consideration should also be given to weekends and other holiday periods to ensure active committers all have reasonable time to become involved in the discussion and review process if they wish.\n\nThe default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no committer has an objection. During review committers may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a \"LGTM\" before the PR can be merged.\n\nFor more info, see [here](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Development_Resources/Contributing_via_Git). Once all issues brought by committers are addressed it can be landed by any committer.\n\nIn the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another committer, all involved committers should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.\n\nIf a contribution is controversial and committers cannot agree about how to get it to land or if it should land then it should be escalated to the [committers group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vertx-committers). Members of the developers group should regularly discuss pending contributions in order to find a resolution. It is expected that only a small minority of issues be brought to the group for resolution and that discussion and compromise among committers be the default resolution mechanism.\n\n# Copyright notice headers\n\nIt is important that all source code files have correct copyright notice headers.\n\nYou can opt for the general-purpose form:\n\n    /*\n     * Copyright (c) 2011-2019 Contributors to the Eclipse Foundation\n     *\n     * This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the\n     * terms of the Eclipse Public License 2.0 which is available at\n     * http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0, or the Apache License, Version 2.0\n     * which is available at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.\n     *\n     * SPDX-License-Identifier: EPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0\n     */\n\nOr you may choose to explicitly mention all contributors in the declaration, like in:\n\n    /*\n     * Copyright (c) {date} {owner}[ and others]\n     *\n     * This program and the accompanying materials are made available under the\n     * terms of the Eclipse Public License 2.0 which is available at\n     * http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0, or the Apache License, Version 2.0\n     * which is available at https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.\n     *\n     * SPDX-License-Identifier: EPL-2.0 OR Apache-2.0\n     */\n\nCheck https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#legaldoc\n\n# Becoming a Contributor\n\nBecoming a contributor to the project should be an easy step. In order to reduce that barrier new contributors should look for issues tagged as:\n\n* `Quick Win`\n* `Help Wanted`\n\nThese tags should be applied to issues that are relatively simple to fix but not critical to be handled by the current group of committers. Once you pick such an issue to work on a discussion with a committer should happen on the issue itself and the committer should guide you with the mentoring/onboarding process.\n\n\n# Becoming a Committer\n\nAll contributors who land a non-trivial contribution should be on-boarded in a timely manner, and added as a committer, and be given write access to the repository.\n\nCommitters are expected to follow this policy and continue to send pull requests, go through proper review, and have other committers merge their pull requests.\n\n\n# Mentoring / Onboarding\n\nCommitters should help mentor/on-board new contributors. The workflow should roughly follow this items:\n\n* suggest the new contributor to join the [development group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/vertx-dev)\n* ask for participation on github issue discussions\n* suggest to keep in touch with on the dev group on periodic way (e.g.: weekly)\n* help finding a good mentor if one is not well versed in a specific area of the project\n* suggest progress reporting\n* assist with creating an Eclipse user id and ECA sign\n\n\n# Technical Conflict Process\n\nThe Vert.x project uses a \"consensus seeking\" process for issues that are escalated to the [committers group](https://github.com/orgs/vert-x3/people). The group tries to find a resolution that has no open objections among the members. If a consensus cannot be reached that has no objections then the Project Lead should decide on which approach to take. It is also expected that the majority of decisions made by the group are via a consensus seeking process and that voting is only used as a last-resort.\n\nResolution may involve returning the issue to committers with suggestions on how to move forward towards a consensus. It is not expected that a meeting of the group will resolve all issues on its agenda during that meeting and may prefer to continue the discussion happening among the committers.\n\nMembers can be added to the group at any time. Any committer can nominate another committer to the group and the group uses its standard consensus seeking process to evaluate whether or not to add this new member. Members who do not participate consistently at the level of a majority of the other members are expected to resign.\n"

A Contribution\n      \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n      such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n      Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n      are not Modified Works.\n\n    \"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n    \"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\n    are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\n    or when combined with the Program.\n\n    \"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\n    Agreement.\n\n    \"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\n    or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n    \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\n    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\n    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\n    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\n    \"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\n    results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\n    contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\n    in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n      a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n      license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n      publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n      Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n\n      b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n      grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n      license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n      import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n      if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n      apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n      the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n      of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n      Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n      combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n      licensed hereunder.\n\n      c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n      licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n      provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n      patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n      Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n      brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n      property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n      rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n      assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n      property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n      patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n      Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n      before distributing the Program.\n\n      d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n      sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n      the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n      e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n      Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n      those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n      receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n      (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n    3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n    3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n      a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n      accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n      the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n      is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n      obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n      used for software exchange; and\n\n      b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n      different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n         i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n         warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n         warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n         implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n         for a particular purpose;\n\n         ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n         liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n         incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n         iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n         in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n         iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n         party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n         of this section 3.\n\n    3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n      a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n      Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n      files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n      Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n      Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n      under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n      b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n      the Program.\n\n    3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\n    trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\n    of liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\n    the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\n    their own appropriate notices.\n\n    4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\n    Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\n    with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\n    license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\n    the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\n    offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\n    liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\n    the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n    (\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\n    other Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\n    damages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\n    and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\n    Contributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\n    Commercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\n    in a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\n    apply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\n    intellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\n    Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\n    writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\n    and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\n    related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\n    participate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\n    For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n    product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n    Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n    claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n    claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n    alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n    defend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\n    claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\n    pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\n    those damages.\n\n    5. NO WARRANTY\n\n    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\n    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\n    IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\n    TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n    PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\n    appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\n    risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\n    including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\n    compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\n    or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n    6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\n    EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\n    PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\n    SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\n    EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\n    PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\n    CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\n    ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\n    EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\n    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n    7. GENERAL\n\n    If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n    the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\n    action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\n    minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\n    If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n    Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\n    or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\n    rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\n    litigation is filed.\n\n    All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n    fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n    Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\n    time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\n    rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\n    and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\n    However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\n    granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\n    Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\n    but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\n    may only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\n    reserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\n    this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\n    Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\n    is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\n    responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\n    entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\n    version number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\n    Distributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\n    received. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\n    Contributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\n    Contributions) under the new version.\n\n    Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\n    receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\n    Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\n    estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\n    under this Agreement are reserved.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
