This document is a guideline about how to contribute to Sentinel.\nIf you find something incorrect or missing, please leave comments / suggestions.\n\n## Before you get started\n\n### Code of Conduct\n\nPlease make sure to read and observe our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### Setting up your development environment\n\nYou should have JDK 17 or later installed in your system.\n\n### How to run test\n\n1. add `~/.m2/toolchains.xml`, to define JDK and path. See [toolcahinas-example.xml](./toolchains-example.xml).\n2. With JDK 17 as your default JDK, you could specify the JDK version to run test,\n\ni.e. Run test at JDK 8:\n\n```bash\nmvn test -Dsurefire.jdk-toolchain-version=8\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe are always very happy to have contributions, whether for typo fix, bug fix or big new features.\nPlease do not ever hesitate to ask a question or send a pull request.\n\nWe strongly value documentation and integration with other projects.\nWe are very glad to accept improvements for these aspects.\n\n### GitHub workflow\n\nWe use the `master` branch as the development branch, which indicates that this is a unstable branch.\n\nHere are the workflow for contributors:\n\n1. Fork to your own\n2. Clone fork to local repository\n3. Create a new branch and work on it\n4. Keep your branch in sync\n5. Commit your changes (make sure your commit message concise)\n6. Push your commits to your forked repository\n7. Create a pull request\n\nPlease follow [the pull request template](./.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).\nPlease make sure the PR has a corresponding issue.\n\nAfter creating a PR, one or more reviewers will be assigned to the pull request.\nThe reviewers will review the code.\n\nBefore merging a PR, squash any fix review feedback, typo, merged, and rebased sorts of commits.\nThe final commit message should be clear and concise.\n\n### Open an issue / PR\n\nWe use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/issues) and [Pull Requests](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/pulls) for trackers.\n\nIf you find a typo in document, find a bug in code, or want new features, or want to give suggestions,\nyou can [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/issues/new) to report it.\nPlease follow the guideline message in the issue template.\n\nIf you want to contribute, please follow the [contribution workflow](#github-workflow) and create a new pull request.\nIf your PR contains large changes, e.g. component refactor or new components, please write detailed documents\nabout its design and usage.\n\nNote that a single PR should not be too large. If heavy changes are required, it's better to separate the changes\nto a few individual PRs.\n\n### Code review\n\nAll code should be well reviewed by one or more committers. Some principles:\n\n- Readability: Important code should be well-documented. Comply with our code style.\n- Elegance: New functions, classes or components should be well designed.\n- Testability: Important code should be well-tested (high unit test coverage).\n\n## Community\n\n### Contact us\n\n#### Mailing list\n\nIf you have any questions or advice, please contact <sentinel@linux.alibaba.com>.\n\n#### Gitter\n\nOur Gitter room: [https://gitter.im/alibaba/Sentinel](https://gitter.im/alibaba/Sentinel).\n"

You can see the runtime information of a single machine in real-time, and the aggregated runtime info of a cluster with less than 500 nodes.\n- **Widespread open-source ecosystem**: Sentinel provides out-of-box integrations with commonly-used frameworks and libraries such as Spring Cloud, gRPC, Apache Dubbo and Quarkus. You can easily use Sentinel by simply add the adapter dependency to your services.\n- **Polyglot support**: Sentinel has provided native support for Java, [Go](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-golang), [C++](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel-cpp) and [Rust](https://github.com/sentinel-group/sentinel-rust).\n- **Various SPI extensions**: Sentinel provides easy-to-use SPI extension interfaces that allow you to quickly customize your logic, for example, custom rule management, adapting data sources, and so on.\n\nFeatures overview:\n\n![features-of-sentinel](./doc/image/sentinel-features-overview-en.png)\n\nThe community is also working on **the specification of traffic governance and fault-tolerance**.\nPlease refer to [OpenSergo](https://opensergo.io/) for details.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee the [Sentinel Website](https://sentinelguard.io/) for the official website of Sentinel.\n\nSee the [中文文档](https://sentinelguard.io/zh-cn/docs/introduction.html) for document in Chinese.\n\nSee the [Wiki](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki) for full documentation, examples, blog posts, operational details and other information.\n\nSentinel provides integration modules for various open-source frameworks\n(e.g. Spring Cloud, Apache Dubbo, gRPC, Quarkus, Spring WebFlux, Reactor) and service mesh.\nYou can refer to [the document](https://sentinelguard.io/en-us/docs/open-source-framework-integrations.html) for more information.\n\nIf you are using Sentinel, please [**leave a comment here**](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/issues/18) to tell us your scenario to make Sentinel better.\nIt's also encouraged to add the link of your blog post, tutorial, demo or customized components to [**Awesome Sentinel**](./doc/awesome-sentinel.md).\n\n## Ecosystem Landscape\n\n![ecosystem-landscape](./doc/image/sentinel-opensource-eco-landscape-en.png)\n\n## Quick Start\n\nBelow is a simple demo that guides new users to use Sentinel in just 3 steps. It also shows how to monitor this demo using the dashboard.\n\n### 1. Add Dependency\n\n**Note:** Sentinel requires JDK 1.8 or later.\n\nIf you're using Maven, just add the following dependency in `pom.xml`.\n\n```xml\n<!-- replace here with the latest version -->\n<dependency>\n    <groupId>com.alibaba.csp</groupId>\n    <artifactId>sentinel-core</artifactId>\n    <version>1.8.8</version>\n</dependency>\n```\n\nIf not, you can download JAR in [Maven Center Repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.alibaba.csp/sentinel-core).\n\n### 2. Define Resource\n\nWrap your code snippet via Sentinel API: `SphU.entry(resourceName)`.\nIn below example, it is `System.out.println(\"hello world\");`:\n\n```java\ntry (Entry entry = SphU.entry(\"HelloWorld\")) {\n    // Your business logic here.\n    System.out.println(\"hello world\");\n} catch (BlockException e) {\n    // Handle rejected request.\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n// try-with-resources auto exit\n```\n\nSo far the code modification is done. We've also provided [annotation support module](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/blob/master/sentinel-extension/sentinel-annotation-aspectj/README.md) to define resource easier.\n\n### 3. Define Rules\n\nIf we want to limit the access times of the resource, we can **set rules to the resource**.\nThe following code defines a rule that limits access to the resource to 20 times per second at the maximum.\n\n```java\nList<FlowRule> rules = new ArrayList<>();\nFlowRule rule = new FlowRule();\nrule.setResource(\"HelloWorld\");\n// set limit qps to 20\nrule.setCount(20);\nrule.setGrade(RuleConstant.FLOW_GRADE_QPS);\nrules.add(rule);\nFlowRuleManager.loadRules(rules);\n```\n\nFor more information, please refer to [How To Use](https://sentinelguard.io/en-us/docs/basic-api-resource-rule.html).\n\n### 4. Check the Result\n\nAfter running the demo for a while, you can see the following records in `~/logs/csp/${appName}-metrics.log.{date}` (When using the default `DateFileLogHandler`).\n\n```plaintext\n|--timestamp-|------date time----|-resource-|p |block|s |e|rt  |occupied\n1529998904000|2018-06-26 15:41:44|HelloWorld|20|0    |20|0|0   |0\n1529998905000|2018-06-26 15:41:45|HelloWorld|20|5579 |20|0|728 |0\n1529998906000|2018-06-26 15:41:46|HelloWorld|20|15698|20|0|0   |0\n1529998907000|2018-06-26 15:41:47|HelloWorld|20|19262|20|0|0   |0\n1529998908000|2018-06-26 15:41:48|HelloWorld|20|19502|20|0|0   |0\n1529998909000|2018-06-26 15:41:49|HelloWorld|20|18386|20|0|0   |0\n\np stands for incoming request, block for blocked by rules, s for success handled by Sentinel, e for exception count, rt for average response time (ms), occupied stands for occupiedPassQps since 1.5.0 which enable us booking more than 1 shot when entering.\n```\n\nThis shows that the demo can print \"hello world\" 20 times per second.\n\nMore examples and information can be found in the [How To Use](https://sentinelguard.io/en-us/docs/basic-api-resource-rule.html) section.\n\nThe working principles of Sentinel can be found in [How it works](https://sentinelguard.io/en-us/docs/basic-implementation.html) section.\n\nSamples can be found in the [sentinel-demo](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/tree/master/sentinel-demo) module.\n\n### 5. Start Dashboard\n\n> Note: Java 8 is required for building or running the dashboard.\n\nSentinel also provides a simple dashboard application, on which you can monitor the clients and configure the rules in real time.\n\n![dashboard](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9434884/55449295-84866d80-55fd-11e9-94e5-d3441f4a2b63.png)\n\nFor details please refer to [Dashboard](https://github.com/alibaba/Sentinel/wiki/Dashboard).\n\n## Trouble Shooting and Logs\n\nSentinel will generate logs for troubleshooting and real-time monitoring.\nAll the information can be found in [logs](https://sentinelguard.io/en-us/docs/logs.html).\n\n## Bugs and Feedback\n\nFor bug report, questions and discussions please submit [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/alibaba/sentinel/issues).\n\nContact us via [Gitter](https://gitter.im/alibaba/Sentinel) or [Email](mailto:sentinel@linux.alibaba.com).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are always welcomed!
