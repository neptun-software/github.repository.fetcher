Unit tests\nshould be JUnit based tests and can use either standard JUnit assertions or\nTruth assertions and be added to `<project>/src/test/java`.  Changes to\ncode generation or other build-time behaviour should go into small maven\nprojects using the `maven-invoker-plugin`.  Examples of this are in\n`generator/src/it` and can include bean-shell verification scripts and other\nfacilities provided by `maven-invoker-plugin`.\n\nPlease make sure your code compiles by running `mvn clean verify` which will\nexecute both unit and integration test phases.  Additionally, consider using\nhttp://travis-ci.org to validate your branches before you even put them into\npull requests.  All pull requests will be validated by Travis-ci in any case\nand must pass before being merged.\n\nIf you are adding or modifying files you may add your own copyright line, but\nplease ensure that the form is consistent with the existing files, and please\nnote that a Google, Inc. copyright line must appear in every copyright notice.\nAll files are released with the Apache 2.0 license and any new files may only\nbe accepted under the terms of that license.\n\nBefore your code can be accepted into the project you must sign the\n[Individual Contributor License Agreement (CLA)][1].\n\n\n [1]: https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual\n"
