It's recommended to read the following Contributing Guide first before contributing. \n\n## Issues\nWe use Github Issues to track public bugs and feature requests.\n\n### Search Known Issues First\nPlease search the existing issues to see if any similar issue or feature request has already been filed. You should make sure your issue isn't redundant.\n\n### Reporting New Issues\nIf you open an issue, the more information the better. Such as detailed description, screenshot or video of your problem, logcat or code blocks for your crash.\n\n## Pull Requests\nWe strongly welcome your pull request to make Wechat-Matrix better. \n\n### Branch Management\nThere are three main branches here:\n\n1. `master` branch.\n\t1. It is the latest (pre-)release branch. We use `master` for tags, with version number `1.1.0`, `1.2.0`, `1.3.0`...\n\t2. **Don't submit any PR on `master` branch.**\n2. `dev` branch. \n\t1. It is our stable developing branch. After full testing, `dev` will be merged to `master` branch for the next release.\n\t2. **You are recommended to submit bugfix or feature PR on `dev` branch.**\n3. `hotfix` branch. \n\t1. It is the latest tag version for hot fix. If we accept your pull request, we may just tag with version number `1.1.1`, `1.2.3`.\n\t2. **Only submit urgent PR on `hotfix` branch for next specific release.**\n\nNormal bugfix or feature request should be submitted to `dev` branch. After full testing, we will merge them to `master` branch for the next release. \n\nIf you have some urgent bugfixes on a published version, but the `master` branch have already far away with the latest tag version, you can submit a PR on hotfix. And it will be cherry picked to `dev` branch if it is possible.\n\n```\nmaster\n ↑\ndev        <--- hotfix PR\n ↑ \nfeature/bugfix PR\n```  \n\n### Make Pull Requests\nThe code team will monitor all pull request, we run some code check and test on it. After all tests passed, we will accecpt this PR. But it won't merge to `master` branch at once, which have some delay.\n\nBefore submitting a pull request, please make sure the followings are done:\n\n1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master` or `hotfix`.\n2. Update code or documentation if you have changed APIs.\n3. Add the copyright notice to the top of any new files you've added.\n4. Check your code lints and checkstyles.\n5. Test and test again your code.\n6. Now, you can submit your pull request on `dev` or `hotfix` branch.\n\n## Code Style Guide\nUse [Code Style](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/blob/master/checkstyle.xml) for Java and Android.\n\n* 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs\n\n## License\nBy contributing to Wechat-Matrix, you agree that your contributions will be licensed\nunder its [BSD LICENSE](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/blob/master/LICENSE)\n"

It also counts as the successor of the GNU\nLibrary Public License, version 2, hence the version number 2.1.]\n\n                                        Preamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.  By\ncontrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and\nchange free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated software\npackages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use\nit.  You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the\nordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case, based on the\nexplanations below.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.  Our General Public\nLicenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software\n(and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want it;\nthat you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are\nnformed that you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you these rights\nor to ask you to surrender these rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you\nif you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the\nrecipients all the rights that we gave you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\nrecipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library and\nrecompiling it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\nWe protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we offer you\nthis license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nTo protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for the free\nlibrary.  Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be\naffected by problems that might be introduced by others.\n\nFinally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program.  We wish to\nmake sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a\nversion of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense.  This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated\nlibraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this license for\ncertain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.\n\nWhen a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the\ncombination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original library\nThe ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination\nfits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for linking\nother code with the library.\n\nWe call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it does Less to protect the user's\nfreedom than the ordinary General Public License.  It also provides other free software developers\nLess of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the reason we use\nthe ordinary General Public License for many libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides\nadvantages in certain special circumstances.\n\nFor example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest possible use of a\ncertain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely\nused non-free libraries.  In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software\nonly, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\nIn other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a greater number\nof people to use a large body of free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its\nvariant, the GNU/Linux operating system.\n\nAlthough the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it does ensure\nthat the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.  Pay close\nattention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".\nThe former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library\nin order to run.\n\n                                 GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n                TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a notice\nplaced by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms\nof this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as\nyou\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently\nlinked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under\nthese terms.  A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with\nmodifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.  For a\nlibrary, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of\nthe library.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are\noutside its scope.  The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of\nthe use of the Library in a tool for writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive\nit, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer\nwarranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work\nbased on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Sectio\n1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable sections of that work are\nnot derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them\nas separate works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work\nbased on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\npermissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless\nof who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely\nby you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective\nworks based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a\nwork based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other\nwork under the scope of this License.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this\nLicense to a given copy of the Library.  To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this\nLicense, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this\nLicense.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has\nappeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU\nGeneral Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not\na library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in\nobject code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you\naccompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\ninterchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then\noffering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with\nthe object code.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with\nthe Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this\nLicense.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a\nderivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses\nthe library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for\ndistribution of such executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the\nobject code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the\nwork is itself a library.  The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small\nmacros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is\nunrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.  (Executables containing this\nobject code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work\nunder the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that\nwork under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the\ncustomer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the\nLibrary and its use are covered by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library\namong them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do\none of these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and\nutility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source\nor binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries\nthat do not normally accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot use\nboth them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single\nibrary together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a\ncombined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the\nother library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have\ntheir licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.  However, nothing else\ngrants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\nLibrary (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,\nand all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on\nit.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient\nautomatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the\nLibrary subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further restrictions on the\nrecipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by\nthird parties with this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other\nreason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,\nagreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from\nthe conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your\nobligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free\nredistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution\nof the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the\nbalance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right\nclaims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices.\nMany people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through\nthat system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide\nif he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest o\n this License.\n\n12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or\nby copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that\ndistribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser General\nPublic License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library specifies a version number of\nthis License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms\nand conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version\never published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution\nconditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which\nis copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the\nfree status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software\ngenerally.\n\n                         NO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT\nWHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER\nPARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS\nWITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY\nMODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO\nYOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                         END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n                   How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\nIf you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we\nrecommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so\nby permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General\nPublic License).\n\nTo apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is safest to attach them to the\nstart of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU\n    Lesser General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a\n\"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThat's all there is to it!\n\n\nOpen Source Software Licensed Under the BSD 2-Clause License: \nThe below software in this distribution may have been modified by THL A29 Limited (“Tencent\nModifications”).

It is a **plugin style**, **non-invasive** solution and is currently available on iOS, macOS and Android.\n\n# <a name='matrix_ios_en'> Matrix for iOS/macOS </a>\n\nThe monitoring scope of the current tool includes: crash, lag, and memory, which includes the following three plugins:\n\n* **WCCrashBlockMonitorPlugin：** Based on [KSCrash](https://github.com/kstenerud/KSCrash) framework, it features cutting-edge lag stack capture capabilities with crash capture.\n\n* **WCMemoryStatPlugin：** A memory monitoring tool that captures memory allocation and the callstack of an application's memory event.\n\n* **WCFPSMonitorPlugin：** A fps monitoring tool that captures main thread's callstack while user scrolling.\n\n## Features\n\n#### WCCrashBlockMonitorPlugin\n\n* Easy integration, no code intrusion.\n* Determine whether the app is stuck by checking the running status of the Runloop, and support both the iOS and macOS platform.\n* Add time-consuming stack fetching, attaching the most time-consuming main thread stack to the thread snapshot log.\n\n#### WCMemoryStatPlugin\n\n* Live recording every object's creating and the corresponding callstack of its creation, and report it when the application out-of-memory is detected.\n\n## Getting Started\n#### Install\n\n* **Install with static framework**\n  1. Get source code of Matrix;\n  2. Open terminal, execute `make` in the `matrix/matrix-iOS` directory to compile and generate static library. After compiling, the iOS platform library is in the `matrix/matrix-iOS/build_ios` directory, and the macOS platform library is in the `matrix/matrix-iOS/build_macos` directory.\n  3. Link with static framework in the project:\n    * iOS : Use `Matrix.framework` under the `matrix/matrix-iOS/build_ios` path, link `Matrix.framework` to the project as a static library;\n    * macOS : Use `Matrix.framework` under the `matrix/matrix-iOS/build_macos` path, link `Matrix.framework` to the project as a static library.\n  4. Add `#import <Matrix/Matrix.h>`, then you can use the performance probe tool of WeChat.\n\n#### Start the plugins\n\nIn the following places:\n\n* Program `main` function;\n* `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` of  `AppDelegate`;\n* Or other places running as earlier as possible after application launching.\n\nAdd a code similar to the following to start the plugin:\n\n```objective-c\n#import <Matrix/Matrix.h>\n  \nMatrix *matrix = [Matrix sharedInstance];\nMatrixBuilder *curBuilder = [[MatrixBuilder alloc] init];\ncurBuilder.pluginListener = self; // get the related event of plugin via the callback of the pluginListener\n    \nWCCrashBlockMonitorPlugin *crashBlockPlugin = [[WCCrashBlockMonitorPlugin alloc] init];    \n[curBuilder addPlugin:crashBlockPlugin]; // add lag and crash monitor.\n    \nWCMemoryStatPlugin *memoryStatPlugin = [[WCMemoryStatPlugin alloc] init];\n[curBuilder addPlugin:memoryStatPlugin]; // add memory monitor.\n\nWCFPSMonitorPlugin *fpsMonitorPlugin = [[WCFPSMonitorPlugin alloc] init];\n[curBuilder addPlugin:fpsMonitorPlugin]; // add fps monitor.\n    \n[matrix addMatrixBuilder:curBuilder];\n    \n[crashBlockPlugin start]; // start the lag and crash monitor.\n[memoryStatPlugin start]; // start memory monitor\n[fpsMonitorPlugin start]; // start fps monitor\n```\n\n#### Receive callbacks to obtain monitoring data\n\nSet `pluginListener` of the `MatrixBuilder` object, implement the `MatrixPluginListenerDelegate`\n\n```objective-c\n// set delegate\n\nMatrixBuilder *curBuilder = [[MatrixBuilder alloc] init];\ncurBuilder.pluginListener = <object conforms to MatrixPluginListenerDelegate>; \n\n// MatrixPluginListenerDelegate\n\n- (void)onInit:(id<MatrixPluginProtocol>)plugin;\n- (void)onStart:(id<MatrixPluginProtocol>)plugin;\n- (void)onStop:(id<MatrixPluginProtocol>)plugin;\n- (void)onDestroy:(id<MatrixPluginProtocol>)plugin;\n- (void)onReportIssue:(MatrixIssue *)issue;\n```\n\nEach plugin added to `MatrixBuilder` will call back the corresponding event via `pluginListener`.\n\n**Important: Get the monitoring data of the Matrix via `onReportIssue:`, the data format info reference to [Matrix for iOS/macOS Data Format Description](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/wiki/Matrix-for-iOS-macOS-Data-Format-Description)**\n\n## Tutorials\n\nAt this point, Matrix has been integrated into the app and is beginning to collect crash, lag, and memory data. If you still have questions, check out the example: `samples/sample-iOS/MatrixDemo`.\n\n\n\n# <a name='matrix_android_en'> Matrix for android </a>\n\n## Plugins\n\n- **APK Checker:**\n\n  Analyse the APK package, give suggestions of reducing the APK's size; Compare two APK and find out the most significant increment on size\n\n- **Resource Canary:**\n\n  Detect the activity leak and bitmap duplication basing on WeakReference and [Square Haha](https://github.com/square/haha) \n\n- **Trace Canary:**\n\n  FPS Monitor, Startup Performance, ANR, UI-Block / Slow Method Detection\n\n- **SQLite Lint:**\n\n  Evaluate the quality of SQLite statement automatically by using SQLite official tools\n\n- **IO Canary:**\n\n  Detect the file IO issues, including performance of file IO and closeable leak \n\n- **Battery Canary:**\n\n  App thread activities monitor (Background watch & foreground loop watch), Sonsor usage monitor (WakeLock/Alarm/Gps/Wifi/Bluetooth), Background network activities (Wifi/Mobile) monitor.\n  \n- **MemGuard**\n\n  Detect heap memory overlap, use-after-free and double free issues.\n\n\n## Features\n#### APK Checker\n\n- **Easy-to-use.** Matrix provides a JAR tool, which is more convenient to apply to your integration systems. \n- **More features.** In addition to APK Analyzer, Matrix find out the R redundancies, the dynamic libraries statically linked STL, unused resources, and supports custom checking rules.\n- **Visual Outputs.** supports HTML and JSON outputs.\n\n#### Resource Canary\n\n- **Separated detection and analysis.** Make possible to use in automated test and in release versions (monitor only).\n- **Pruned Hprof.** Remove the useless data in hprof and easier to upload.\n- **Detection of duplicate bitmap.** \n\n#### Trace Canary\n\n- **High performance.** Dynamically modify bytecode at compile time, record function cost and call stack with little performance loss.\n- **Accurate call stack of ui-block.** Provide informations such as call stack, function cost, execution times to solve the problem of ui-block quickly.\n- **Non-hack.** High compatibility to Android versions.\n- **More features.** Automatically covers multiple fluency indicators such as ui-block, startup time, activity switching, slow function detection.\n- **High-accuracy ANR detector.**  Detect ANRs accurately and give ANR trace file with high compatibility and high stability.\n\n#### SQLite Lint\n\n- **Easy-to-use.** Non-invasive.\n- **High applicability.** Regardless of the amount of data, you can discover SQLite performance problems during development and testing.\n- **High standards.** Detection algorithms based on best practices, make SQLite statements to the highest quality.\n- **May support multi-platform.** Implementing in C++ makes it possible to support multi-platform.\n\n#### IO Canary\n- **Easy-to-use.** Non-invasive.\n- **More feature.** Including performance of file IO and closeable leak.\n- **Compatible with Android P.**\n\n#### Battery Canary\n- **Easy-to-use.** Use out of box (unit tests as example).\n- **More feature.** Flexible extending with base and utils APIs.\n\n#### Memory Hook\n\n- A native memory leak detection tool for Android.\n- **Non-invasive.** It is based on PLT-hook([iqiyi/xHook](https://github.com/iqiyi/xHook)), so we do NOT need to recompile the native libraries.\n- **High performance.** we use WeChat-Backtrace for fast unwinding which supports both aarch64 and armeabi-v7a architectures.\n\n#### Pthread Hook\n\n- A Java and native thread leak detection and native thread stack space trimming tool for Android.\n- **Non-invasive.** It is based on PLT-hook([iqiyi/xHook](https://github.com/iqiyi/xHook)), so we do NOT need to recompile the native libraries.\n- It saves virtual memory overhead by trimming default stack size of native thread in half, which can reduce crashes caused by virtual memory insufficient under 32bit environment.\n\n#### WVPreAllocHook\n\n+ A tool for saving virtual memory overhead caused by WebView preloading when WebView is not actually used.

So we uploaded Matrix(since 0.8.0) to the MavenCentral repository.***\n\n1. Configure `MATRIX_VERSION` in gradle.properties.\n``` gradle\n  MATRIX_VERSION=2.1.0\n```\n\n2. Add `matrix-gradle-plugin` in your build.gradle:\n``` gradle \n  dependencies {\n      classpath (\"com.tencent.matrix:matrix-gradle-plugin:${MATRIX_VERSION}\") { changing = true }\n  }\n \n```\n3. Add dependencies to your app/build.gradle.\n\n``` gradle\n  dependencies {\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-android-lib\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-android-commons\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-trace-canary\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-resource-canary-android\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-resource-canary-common\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-io-canary\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-sqlite-lint-android-sdk\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-battery-canary\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-hooks\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-backtrace\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n  }\n  \n  apply plugin: 'com.tencent.matrix-plugin'\n  matrix {\n    trace {\n        enable = true\t//if you don't want to use trace canary, set false\n        baseMethodMapFile = \"${project.buildDir}/matrix_output/Debug.methodmap\"\n        blackListFile = \"${project.projectDir}/matrixTrace/blackMethodList.txt\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n4. Implement `PluginListener` to receive data processed by Matrix.\n\n``` java\n  public class TestPluginListener extends DefaultPluginListener {\n    public static final String TAG = \"Matrix.TestPluginListener\";\n    public TestPluginListener(Context context) {\n        super(context);\n        \n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onReportIssue(Issue issue) {\n        super.onReportIssue(issue);\n        MatrixLog.e(TAG, issue.toString());\n        \n        //add your code to process data\n    }\n}\n```\n\nMatrix gradle plugin could work with Android Gradle Plugin 3.5.0/4.0.0/4.1.0 currently.\n\n5. Implement `DynamicConfig` to change parameters of Matrix.\n``` java\n  public class DynamicConfigImplDemo implements IDynamicConfig {\n    public DynamicConfigImplDemo() {}\n\n    public boolean isFPSEnable() { return true;}\n    public boolean isTraceEnable() { return true; }\n    public boolean isMatrixEnable() { return true; }\n    public boolean isDumpHprof() {  return false;}\n\n    @Override\n    public String get(String key, String defStr) {\n        //hook to change default values\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int get(String key, int defInt) {\n      //hook to change default values\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public long get(String key, long defLong) {\n        //hook to change default values\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean get(String key, boolean defBool) {\n        //hook to change default values\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public float get(String key, float defFloat) {\n        //hook to change default values\n    }\n}\n```\n\n6. Init Matrix in the ```onCreate``` of your application. \n\n``` java \n  Matrix.Builder builder = new Matrix.Builder(application); // build matrix\n  builder.patchListener(new TestPluginListener(this)); // add general pluginListener\n  DynamicConfigImplDemo dynamicConfig = new DynamicConfigImplDemo(); // dynamic config\n  \n  // init plugin \n  IOCanaryPlugin ioCanaryPlugin = new IOCanaryPlugin(new IOConfig.Builder()\n                    .dynamicConfig(dynamicConfig)\n                    .build());\n  //add to matrix               \n  builder.plugin(ioCanaryPlugin);\n  \n  //init matrix\n  Matrix.init(builder.build());\n\n  // start plugin \n  ioCanaryPlugin.start();\n```\nFor more Matrix configurations, look at the [sample](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/tree/dev/samples/sample-android).\n\nNote:\n1. Since Matrix for Android has migrated to AndroidX since v0.9.0. You may need to add 'android.useAndroidX=true' flag to gradle.properties\n2. You can get more about Matrix output at the wiki [The output of Matrix](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/wiki/Matrix-Android--data-format); \n\n\n#### Battery Canary Usage\n\nInit BatteryCanary as the following codes:\n```java\nBatteryMonitorConfig config = new BatteryMonitorConfig.Builder()\n        .enable(JiffiesMonitorFeature.class)\n        .enableStatPidProc(true)\n        .greyJiffiesTime(30 * 1000L)\n        .setCallback(new BatteryMonitorCallback.BatteryPrinter())\n        .build();\n\nBatteryMonitorPlugin plugin = new BatteryMonitorPlugin(config);\n```\n\nFor detail usage, please reference showcase tests at `com.tencent.matrix.batterycanary.ApisTest` or `sample.tencent.matrix.battery.BatteryCanaryInitHelper`.\n\n#### Backtrace Component Usage\n\nHow to init backtrace component：\n```java\nWeChatBacktrace.instance().configure(getApplicationContext()).commit();\n```\n\nThen other components in Matrix could use Quikcen Backtrace to unwind stacktrace. See more configuration comments in 'WeChatBacktrace.Configuration'.\n\n#### APK Checker Usage\n\nAPK Checker can run independently in Jar ([matrix-apk-canary-2.1.0.jar](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/tencent/matrix/matrix-apk-canary/2.1.0/matrix-apk-canary-2.1.0.jar)）  mode, usage:\n\n\n```shell\njava -jar matrix-apk-canary-2.1.0.jar\nUsages: \n    --config CONFIG-FILE-PATH\nor\n    [--input INPUT-DIR-PATH] [--apk APK-FILE-PATH] [--unzip APK-UNZIP-PATH] [--mappingTxt MAPPING-FILE-PATH] [--resMappingTxt RESGUARD-MAPPING-FILE-PATH] [--output OUTPUT-PATH] [--format OUTPUT-FORMAT] [--formatJar OUTPUT-FORMAT-JAR] [--formatConfig OUTPUT-FORMAT-CONFIG (json-array format)] [Options]\n    \nOptions:\n-manifest\n     Read package info from the AndroidManifest.xml.\n-fileSize [--min DOWN-LIMIT-SIZE (KB)] [--order ORDER-BY ('asc'|'desc')] [--suffix FILTER-SUFFIX-LIST (split by ',')]\n     Show files whose size exceed limit size in order.\n-countMethod [--group GROUP-BY ('class'|'package')]\n     Count methods in dex file, output results group by class name or package name.\n-checkResProguard\n     Check if the resguard was applied.\n-findNonAlphaPng [--min DOWN-LIMIT-SIZE (KB)]\n     Find out the non-alpha png-format files whose size exceed limit size in desc order.\n-checkMultiLibrary\n     Check if there are more than one library dir in the 'lib'.\n-uncompressedFile [--suffix FILTER-SUFFIX-LIST (split by ',')]\n     Show uncompressed file types.\n-countR\n     Count the R class.\n-duplicatedFile\n     Find out the duplicated resource files in desc order.\n-checkMultiSTL  --toolnm TOOL-NM-PATH\n     Check if there are more than one shared library statically linked the STL.\n-unusedResources --rTxt R-TXT-FILE-PATH [--ignoreResources IGNORE-RESOURCES-LIST (split by ',')]\n     Find out the unused resources.\n-unusedAssets [--ignoreAssets IGNORE-ASSETS-LIST (split by ',')]\n     Find out the unused assets file.\n-unstrippedSo  --toolnm TOOL-NM-PATH\n     Find out the unstripped shared library file.\n```\n\nLearn more about [Matrix-APKChecker](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/wiki/Matrix-Android-ApkChecker) \n\n\n# Support\n\nAny problem?\n\n1.

Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/pulls)  [![WeChat Approved](https://img.shields.io/badge/Wechat%20Approved-2.1.0-red.svg)](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/wiki)\n\n**Matrix** 是一款微信研发并日常使用的应用性能接入框架，支持iOS, macOS和Android。\nMatrix 通过接入各种性能监控方案，对性能监控项的异常数据进行采集和分析，输出相应的问题分析、定位与优化建议，从而帮助开发者开发出更高质量的应用。\n\n# <a name='matrix_ios_cn'>Matrix for iOS/macOS </a>\n\nMatrix-iOS 当前工具监控范围包括：崩溃、卡顿和内存，包含以下三款插件：\n\n* **WCCrashBlockMonitorPlugin：** 基于 [KSCrash](https://github.com/kstenerud/KSCrash) 框架开发，具有业界领先的卡顿堆栈捕获能力，同时兼备崩溃捕获能力\n\n* **WCMemoryStatPlugin：** 一款性能极致的内存监控工具，能够全面捕获应用 OOM 时的内存分配以及调用堆栈情况\n\n* **WCFPSMonitorPlugin：** 一款 FPS 监控工具，当用户滑动界面时，记录主线程调用栈\n\n## 特性\n\n#### WCCrashBlockMonitorPlugin\n\n* 接入简单，代码无侵入\n* 通过检查 Runloop 运行状态判断应用是否卡顿，同时支持 iOS/macOS 平台\n* 增加耗时堆栈提取，卡顿线程快照日志中附加最近时间最耗时的主线程堆栈\n\n#### WCMemoryStatPlugin\n\n* 在应用运行期间获取对象存活以及相应的堆栈信息，在检测到应用 OOM 时进行上报\n\n## 使用方法\n\n#### 安装\n\n* **通过静态库安装**\n  1. 获取 Matrix 源码；\n  2. 打开命令行，在 `matrix/matrix-iOS` 代码目录下执行 `make` 进行编译生成静态库；编译完成后，iOS 平台的库在 `matrix/matrix-iOS/build_ios` 目录下，macOS 平台的库在 `matrix/matrix-iOS/build_macos` 目录下；\n  3. 工程引入静态库：\n    * iOS 平台：使用 `matrix/matrix-iOS/build_ios` 路径下的 `Matrix.framework`，将 `Matrix.framework` 以静态库的方式引入工程；\n    * macOS 平台：使用 `matrix/matrix-iOS/build_macos` 路径下的 `Matrix.framework`，将 `Matrix.framework` 以静态库的方式引入工程。\n  4. 添加头文件 `#import <Matrix/Matrix.h>`，就可以接入微信的性能探针工具了！\n\n\n#### 启动监控\n\n在以下地方：\n\n* 程序 `main` 函数入口；\n* `AppDelegate` 中的 `application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`；\n* 或者其他应用启动比较早的时间点。\n\n添加类似如下代码，启动插件：\n\n```\n#import <Matrix/Matrix.h>\n  \nMatrix *matrix = [Matrix sharedInstance];\nMatrixBuilder *curBuilder = [[MatrixBuilder alloc] init];\ncurBuilder.pluginListener = self; // pluginListener 回调 plugin 的相关事件\n    \nWCCrashBlockMonitorPlugin *crashBlockPlugin = [[WCCrashBlockMonitorPlugin alloc] init];    \n[curBuilder addPlugin:crashBlockPlugin]; // 添加卡顿和崩溃监控\n    \nWCMemoryStatPlugin *memoryStatPlugin = [[WCMemoryStatPlugin alloc] init];\n[curBuilder addPlugin:memoryStatPlugin]; // 添加内存监控功能\n\nWCFPSMonitorPlugin *fpsMonitorPlugin = [[WCFPSMonitorPlugin alloc] init];\n[curBuilder addPlugin:fpsMonitorPlugin]; // 添加 fps 监控功能\n    \n[matrix addMatrixBuilder:curBuilder];\n    \n[crashBlockPlugin start]; // 开启卡顿和崩溃监控\n[memoryStatPlugin start]; // 开启内存监控\n[fpsMonitorPlugin start]; // 开启 fps 监控\n```\n\n#### 接收回调获得监控数据\n\n设置 MatrixBuilder 对象中的 pluginListener，实现 MatrixPluginListenerDelegate。\n\n```\n// 设置 delegate\n\nMatrixBuilder *curBuilder = [[MatrixBuilder alloc] init];\ncurBuilder.pluginListener = <一个遵循 MatrixPluginListenerDelegate 的对象>; \n\n// MatrixPluginListenerDelegate\n\n- (void)onInit:(id<MatrixPluginProtocol>)plugin;\n- (void)onStart:(id<MatrixPluginProtocol>)plugin;\n- (void)onStop:(id<MatrixPluginProtocol>)plugin;\n- (void)onDestroy:(id<MatrixPluginProtocol>)plugin;\n- (void)onReportIssue:(MatrixIssue *)issue;\n```\n\n各个添加到 MatrixBuilder 的 plugin 会将对应的事件通过 pluginListener 回调。\n\n**重要：通过 `onReportIssue:` 获得 Matrix 处理后的数据，监控数据格式详见：[Matrix for iOS/macOS 数据格式说明](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/wiki/Matrix-for-iOS-macOS-%E6%95%B0%E6%8D%AE%E6%A0%BC%E5%BC%8F%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E)**\n\n## Demo\n\n至此，Matrix 已经集成到应用中并且开始收集崩溃、卡顿和爆内存数据，如仍有疑问，请查看示例：`samples/sample-iOS/MatrixDemo`\n\n\n# <a name='matrix_android_cn'>Matrix for Android </a>\n\nMatrix-android 当前监控范围包括：应用安装包大小，帧率变化，启动耗时，卡顿，慢方法，SQLite

在你项目根目录下的 gradle.properties 中配置要依赖的 Matrix 版本号，如：\n``` gradle\n  MATRIX_VERSION=2.1.0\n```\n\n2. 在你项目根目录下的 build.gradle 文件添加 Matrix 依赖，如：\n``` gradle \n  dependencies {\n      classpath (\"com.tencent.matrix:matrix-gradle-plugin:${MATRIX_VERSION}\") { changing = true }\n  }\n```\n\n3. 接着，在 app/build.gradle 文件中添加 Matrix 各模块的依赖，如：\n``` gradle\n  dependencies {\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-android-lib\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-android-commons\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-trace-canary\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-resource-canary-android\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-resource-canary-common\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-io-canary\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-sqlite-lint-android-sdk\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-battery-canary\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n    implementation group: \"com.tencent.matrix\", name: \"matrix-hooks\", version: MATRIX_VERSION, changing: true\n  }\n\n  apply plugin: 'com.tencent.matrix-plugin'\n  matrix {\n    trace {\n        enable = true\t//if you don't want to use trace canary, set false\n        baseMethodMapFile = \"${project.buildDir}/matrix_output/Debug.methodmap\"\n        blackListFile = \"${project.projectDir}/matrixTrace/blackMethodList.txt\"\n    }\n  }\n```\n\n目前 Matrix gradle plugin 支持 Android Gradle Plugin 3.5.0/4.0.0/4.1.0。\n\n4. 实现 PluginListener，接收 Matrix 处理后的数据, 如：\n``` java\n  public class TestPluginListener extends DefaultPluginListener {\n    public static final String TAG = \"Matrix.TestPluginListener\";\n    public TestPluginListener(Context context) {\n        super(context);\n        \n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public void onReportIssue(Issue issue) {\n        super.onReportIssue(issue);\n        MatrixLog.e(TAG, issue.toString());\n        \n        //add your code to process data\n    }\n}\n```\n\n5. 实现动态配置接口， 可修改 Matrix 内部参数. 在 sample-android 中 我们有个简单的动态接口实例[DynamicConfigImplDemo.java](samples/sample-android/app/src/main/java/sample/tencent/matrix/config/DynamicConfigImplDemo.java), 其中参数对应的 key 位于文件 [MatrixEnum](samples/sample-android/app/src/main/java/sample/tencent/matrix/config/MatrixEnum.java)中， 摘抄部分示例如下：\n``` java\n  public class DynamicConfigImplDemo implements IDynamicConfig {\n    public DynamicConfigImplDemo() {}\n\n    public boolean isFPSEnable() { return true;}\n    public boolean isTraceEnable() { return true; }\n    public boolean isMatrixEnable() { return true; }\n    public boolean isDumpHprof() {  return false;}\n\n    @Override\n    public String get(String key, String defStr) {\n        //hook to change default values\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public int get(String key, int defInt) {\n         //hook to change default values\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public long get(String key, long defLong) {\n        //hook to change default values\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public boolean get(String key, boolean defBool) {\n        //hook to change default values\n    }\n\n    @Override\n    public float get(String key, float defFloat) {\n        //hook to change default values\n    }\n}\n\n```\n6. 选择程序启动的位置对 Matrix 进行初始化，如在 Application 的继承类中， Init 核心逻辑如下：\n``` java \n  Matrix.Builder builder = new Matrix.Builder(application); // build matrix\n  builder.pluginListener(new TestPluginListener(this)); // add general pluginListener\n  DynamicConfigImplDemo dynamicConfig = new DynamicConfigImplDemo(); // dynamic config\n  \n  // init plugin \n  IOCanaryPlugin ioCanaryPlugin = new IOCanaryPlugin(new IOConfig.Builder()\n                    .dynamicConfig(dynamicConfig)\n                    .build());\n  //add to matrix               \n  builder.plugin(ioCanaryPlugin);\n  \n  //init matrix\n  Matrix.init(builder.build());\n\n  // start plugin \n  ioCanaryPlugin.start();\n```\n\n至此，Matrix就已成功集成到你的项目中，并且开始收集和分析性能相关异常数据，如仍有疑问，请查看 [示例](https://github.com/Tencent/Matrix/tree/dev/samples/sample-android/).\n\nPS：\n1. 从 v0.9.0 开始，Matrix for Android 迁移到了 AndroidX. 你可能需要添加 'android.useAndroidX=true' 标志到 gradle.properties 文件里。\n2. Matrix 分析后的输出字段的含义请查看 [Matrix 输出内容的含义解析](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/wiki/Matrix-Android--data-format)\n\n\n#### Battery Canary Usage\n\n相关初始化代码如下：\n```java\nBatteryMonitorConfig config = new BatteryMonitorConfig.Builder()\n        .enable(JiffiesMonitorFeature.class)\n        .enableStatPidProc(true)\n        .greyJiffiesTime(30 * 1000L)\n        .setCallback(new BatteryMonitorCallback.BatteryPrinter())\n        .build();\n\nBatteryMonitorPlugin plugin = new BatteryMonitorPlugin(config);\n```\n\n具体使用方式，请参考单元测试里相关用例的代码： `com.tencent.matrix.batterycanary.ApisTest` 或 `sample.tencent.matrix.battery.BatteryCanaryInitHelper`.\n\n#### Backtrace Component Usage\n\n如何初始化 backtrace 组件：\n```java\nWeChatBacktrace.instance().configure(getApplicationContext()).commit();\n```\n\n初始化后其他 Matrix 组件就可以使用 Quicken Backtrace 进行回溯。更多参数的配置请查看 WeChatBacktrace.Configuration 的接口注释。\n\n#### APK Checker\n\nAPK Check 以独立的 jar 包提供 ([matrix-apk-canary-2.1.0.jar](https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/com/tencent/matrix/matrix-apk-canary/2.1.0/matrix-apk-canary-2.1.0.jar)），你可以运行：\n\n```cmd\njava -jar matrix-apk-canary-2.1.0.jar\n```\n\n查看 Usages 来使用它。\n\n```\nUsages: \n    --config CONFIG-FILE-PATH\nor\n    [--input INPUT-DIR-PATH] [--apk APK-FILE-PATH] [--unzip APK-UNZIP-PATH] [--mappingTxt MAPPING-FILE-PATH] [--resMappingTxt RESGUARD-MAPPING-FILE-PATH] [--output OUTPUT-PATH] [--format OUTPUT-FORMAT] [--formatJar OUTPUT-FORMAT-JAR] [--formatConfig OUTPUT-FORMAT-CONFIG (json-array format)] [Options]\n    \nOptions:\n-manifest\n     Read package info from the AndroidManifest.xml.\n-fileSize [--min DOWN-LIMIT-SIZE (KB)] [--order ORDER-BY ('asc'|'desc')] [--suffix FILTER-SUFFIX-LIST (split by ',')]\n     Show files whose size exceed limit size in order.\n-countMethod [--group GROUP-BY ('class'|'package')]\n     Count methods in dex file, output results group by class name or package name.\n-checkResProguard\n     Check if the resguard was applied.\n-findNonAlphaPng [--min DOWN-LIMIT-SIZE (KB)]\n     Find out the non-alpha png-format files whose size exceed limit size in desc order.\n-checkMultiLibrary\n     Check if there are more than one library dir in the 'lib'.\n-uncompressedFile [--suffix FILTER-SUFFIX-LIST (split by ',')]\n     Show uncompressed file types.\n-countR\n     Count the R class.\n-duplicatedFile\n     Find out the duplicated resource files in desc order.\n-checkMultiSTL  --toolnm TOOL-NM-PATH\n     Check if there are more than one shared library statically linked the STL.\n-unusedResources --rTxt R-TXT-FILE-PATH [--ignoreResources IGNORE-RESOURCES-LIST (split by ',')]\n     Find out the unused resources.\n-unusedAssets [--ignoreAssets IGNORE-ASSETS-LIST (split by ',')]\n     Find out the unused assets file.\n-unstrippedSo  --toolnm TOOL-NM-PATH\n     Find out the unstripped shared library file.\n```\n\n由于篇幅影响，此次不再赘述，我们在 [Matrix-APKChecker](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/wiki/Matrix-Android-ApkChecker) 中进行了详细说明。\n\n\n# Support\n\n还有其他问题？\n\n1. 查看[示例](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/tree/master/samples)；\n2. 阅读[源码](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/tree/master/matrix)；\n3. 阅读 [Wiki](https://github.com/Tencent/matrix/wiki) 或 [FAQ](https://github.com/Tencent/Matrix/wiki/Matrix-%E5%B8%B8%E8%A7%81%E9%97%AE%E9%A2%98)；\n4. 联系我们。\n\n# 参与贡献\n\n关于 Matrix 分支管理、issue 以及 pr 规范，请阅读 [Matrix Contributing Guide](https://github.com/Tencent/Matrix/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)。\n\n[腾讯开源激励计划](https://opensource.tencent.com/contribution) 鼓励开发者的参与和贡献，期待你的加入。\n\n# License\n\nMatrix is under the BSD license.
