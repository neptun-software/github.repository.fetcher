I have open-sourced a very effective repo with project starter template: [Repo Link](https://github.com/janishar/data-analytics-project-template)\n\n[https://github.com/janishar/data-analytics-project-template](https://github.com/janishar/data-analytics-project-template)\n\n# About The Author\nYou can connect with me here:\n* [Janishar Ali](https://janisharali.com)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/janisharali)\n* [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@unusualcode)\n\n## If this repository helps you in anyway, show your love :heart: by putting a :star: on this project :v:\n\n### Deep Learning\nAn MIT Press book\nIan Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville\n\nThis is the most comprehensive book available on the deep learning and available as free html book for reading at http://www.deeplearningbook.org/\n\n**Comment on this book by Elon Musk**\n>Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject.\" -- Elon Musk, cochair of OpenAI; cofounder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX\n\n**This is not available as PDF download. So, I have taken the prints of the HTML content and binded into a flawless PDF version of the book, as suggested by the website itself**\n\n**http://www.deeplearningbook.org/ says:**\n>What is the best way to print the HTML format?\n\n>Printing seems to work best printing directly from the browser, using Chrome. Other browsers do not work as well.\n\n**This repository contains**\n1. The pdf version of the book which is available in html at http://www.deeplearningbook.org/\n2. The book is available in chapter wise PDFs as well as complete book in PDF.\n\n**Some useful links for this learning:**\n1. [Exercises](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/exercises.html)\n2. [Lecture Slides](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/lecture_slides.html)\n3. [External links](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/external.html)\n\n*If you like this book then buy a copy of it and keep it with you forever. This will help you and also support the authors and the people involved in the effort of bringing this beautiful piece of work to public. Buy it from amazon, It is not expensive ($72).
