Please read this page to help us better realize your goals.\n\n## Issues\nFeel free to open issues on just about anything related to Pinpoint. These can be anything from bug report to feature proposal. A few points to consider before opening a new issue:\n* Please make sure you've searched through the documentation and existing issues to see if what you're posting has already been addressed.\n* If your build fails, please take a look at [Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/naver/pinpoint) to check our current build status.\n* If something is not working, please be as detailed as possible in your description. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to provide you with a solution.\n* If something not directly related to Pinpoint is not working (such as HBase), try and see if it's something you can get fixed. Chances are, you might be much better equipped to solve the problem. Even if nothing works, being able to share everything you've tried with us will help resolve the issue a lot quicker.\n* For quick questions, or issues that aren't directly related to the code base, please consider posting them to [Pinpoint Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pinpoint_user).\n\n## Pull Requests\nApart from trivial fixes such as typo or formatting, all pull requests should have a corresponding issue associated with them. It is always helpful to know what people are working on, and different (often better) ideas may pop up while discussing them.\nPlease keep these in mind before you create a pull request:\n* Every new java file must have a copy of the license comment. You may copy this from an existing file.\n* Make sure you've tested your code thoroughly. For plugins, please try your best to include integration tests if possible.\n* Before submitting your code, make sure any changes introduced by your code does not break the build, or any tests.\n* Clean up your commit log into logical chunks of work to make it easier for us to figure out what and why you've changed something. (`git rebase -i` helps)\n* Please try best to keep your code updated against the master branch before creating a pull request.\n* Make sure you create the pull request against our master branch.\n* If you've created your own plugin, please take a look at [plugin contribution guideline](../../wiki/Pinpoint-Plugin-Developer-Guide#iii-plugin-contribution-guideline).\n\nPlease make sure you've signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNuUx0lkiapWF8LE0xQSVL-ZNheuy2LEIixyqCj9y5GsSzVQ/viewform?c=0&w=1) before contributing your code. This isn't a copyright - it gives us (Naver) permission to use and redistribute your code as part of the project.\n"

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

[Check-out our agent repository](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-c-agent).\n\n## About Pinpoint\n\n**Pinpoint** is an APM (Application Performance Management) tool for large-scale distributed systems written in Java / [PHP](https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-c-agent)/[PYTHON]((https://github.com/pinpoint-apm/pinpoint-c-agent)).\nInspired by [Dapper](http://research.google.com/pubs/pub36356.html \"Google Dapper\"),\nPinpoint provides a solution to help analyze the overall structure of the system and how components within them are interconnected by tracing transactions across distributed applications.\n\nYou should definitely check **Pinpoint** out If you want to\n\n* understand your *[application topology](https://pinpoint-apm.gitbook.io/pinpoint/want-a-quick-tour/overview)* at a glance\n* monitor your application in *Real-Time*\n* gain *code-level visibility* to every transaction\n* install APM Agents *without changing a single line of code*\n* have minimal impact on the performance (approximately 3% increase in resource usage)\n\n## Getting Started\n * [Quick-start guide](https://pinpoint-apm.gitbook.io/pinpoint/getting-started/quickstart) for simple test run of Pinpoint\n * [Installation guide](https://pinpoint-apm.gitbook.io/pinpoint/getting-started/installation) for further instructions.\n \n## Overview\nServices nowadays often consist of many different components, communicating amongst themselves as well as making API calls to external services. How each and every transaction gets executed is often left as a blackbox. Pinpoint traces transaction flows between these components and provides a clear view to identify problem areas and potential bottlenecks.<br/>\nFor a more intimate guide, please check out our *[Introduction to Pinpoint](https://pinpoint-apm.gitbook.io/pinpoint/#want-a-quick-tour)* video clip.\n\n* **ServerMap** - Understand the topology of any distributed systems by visualizing how their components are interconnected. Clicking on a node reveals details about the component, such as its current status, and transaction count.\n* **Realtime Active Thread Chart** - Monitor active threads inside applications in real-time.\n* **Request/Response Scatter Chart** - Visualize request count and response patterns over time to identify potential problems. Transactions can be selected for additional detail by **dragging over the chart**.\n\n  ![Server Map](doc/images/ss_server-map.png)\n\n* **CallStack** - Gain code-level visibility to every transaction in a distributed environment, identifying bottlenecks and points of failure in a single view.\n\n  ![Call Stack](doc/images/ss_call-stack.png)\n\n* **Inspector** - View additional details on the application such as CPU usage, Memory/Garbage Collection, TPS, and JVM arguments.\n\n  ![Inspector](doc/images/ss_inspector.png)\n\n* **URI-metric**\n  ![URI-Metric](doc/images/ss-uri-metric.png)\n\n*
