It plays a critical role in Netflix mid-tier infra.\n\nBuilding\n--------\nThe build requires `java8` because of some required libraries that are `java8` (`servo`), but the source and target\ncompatibility are still set to `1.7`. Note that tags should be checked out to perform a build.\n\nContributing\n------------\nFor any non-trivial change (or a large LoC-wise change), please open an issue first to make sure there's alignment on\nthe scope, the approach, and the viability.\n\nSupport\n----------\nCommunity-driven mostly, feel free to open an issue with your question, the maintainers are looking over these\nperiodically. Issues with the most minimal repro possible have the highest chance of being answered.\n\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\nPlease see [wiki](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki) for detailed documentation.\n"
