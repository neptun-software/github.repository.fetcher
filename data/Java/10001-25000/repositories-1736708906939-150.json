                              release-notes.asciidoc\n================================================================================\n[[release-3.0.5-final]]\n== *Release 3.0.5.Final* _(December 18th 2024)_\n\nSee the https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12439150[complete list of issues].\n\n=== Kafka compatibility\n\nThis release has been built against Kafka Connect 3.9.0 and has been tested with version 3.9.0 of the Kafka brokers.\nSee the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#upgrade[Kafka documentation] for compatibility with other versions of Kafka brokers.\n\n\n=== Upgrading\n\nBefore upgrading any connector, be sure to check the backward-incompatible changes that have been made since the release you were using.\n\nWhen you decide to upgrade one of these connectors to 3.0.5.Final from any earlier versions,\nfirst check the migration notes for the version you're using.\nGracefully stop the running connector, remove the old plugin files, install the 3.0.5.Final plugin files, and restart the connector using the same configuration.\nUpon restart, the 3.0.5.Final connectors will continue where the previous connector left off.\nAs one might expect, all change events previously written to Kafka by the old connector will not be modified.\n\nIf you are using our container images, then please do not forget to pull them fresh from https://quay.io/organization/debezium[Quay.io].\n\n\n=== Breaking changes\n\n[Placeholder for Breaking changes text] (https://issues.redhat.com/browse/DBZ-7856[DBZ-7856]).\n\n[Placeholder for Breaking

The following upgrade order must be maintained when existing connectors capture `INTERVAL` columns:\n\n1. Upgrade the Debezium Kafka Connect Postgres connector\n2. Upgrade the logical decoding plug-in installed in the database\n3. (Optionally) switch `interval.handling.mode` to string\n\nIn particular it should be avoided to upgrade the logical decoding plug-in before the connector, as this will cause no value to be exported for `INTERVAL` columns.\n\n\n### Fixes since 0.10.0.Final\n\n* Debezium fails to snapshot large databases [DBZ-685](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-685)\n* Connector Postgres runs out of disk space [DBZ-892](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-892)\n* Debezium-MySQL Connector Fails while parsing AWS RDS internal events [DBZ-1492](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1492)\n* MongoDB ExtractNewDocumentState SMT blocks heartbeat messages [DBZ-1513](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1513)\n* pgoutput string decoding depends on JVM default charset [DBZ-1532](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1532)\n* Whitespaces not stripped from table.whitelist [DBZ-1546](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1546)\n\n\n### Other changes since 0.10.0.Final\n\n* Upgrade to latest JBoss Parent POM [DBZ-675](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-675)\n* CheckStyle: Flag missing whitespace [DBZ-1341](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1341)\n* Upgrade to the latest Checkstyle plugin [DBZ-1355](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1355)\n* CheckStyle: no code after closing braces [DBZ-1391](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1391)\n* Add \"adopters\" file [DBZ-1460](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1460)\n* Add Google Analytics to Antora-published pages [DBZ-1526](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1526)\n* Create 0.10 RPM for postgres-decoderbufs [DBZ-1540](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1540)\n* Postgres documentation fixes [DBZ-1544](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1544)\n\n\n\n## 0.10.0.Final\nOctober 2nd, 2019 [Detailed release notes](https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12339267)\n\n### New features since 0.10.0.CR2\n\nNone\n\n\n### Breaking changes since 0.10.0.CR2\n\nNone\n\n\n### Fixes since 0.10.0.CR2\n\n* Debezium Postgres replication with pgoutput plugin sending events slowly for non-batched insertions [DBZ-1515](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1515)\n* ExtractNewRecordState access operation field before checking message format [DBZ-1517](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1517)\n\n\n### Other changes since 0.10.0.CR2\n\n* Go back to original PG 10 container image for testing [DBZ-1504](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1504)\n* Support delete propagation in end-to-end demo [DBZ-1506](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1506)\n* Update Unwrap/UnwrapMongoDB SMT demos to use latest Debezium and delete event support [DBZ-1516](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1516)\n\n\n## 0.10.0.CR2\nSeptember 26th, 2019 [Detailed release notes](https://issues.jboss.org/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12317320&version=12342807)\n\n### New features since 0.10.0.CR1\n\n* Allow user to customize key for DB tables through configuration [DBZ-1015](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1015)\n* Replace Custom Schema with Pluggable Serializers via KC Schema in Cassandra Connector [DBZ-1405](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1405)\n* Porting insert fields from source struct feature to ExtractNewDocumentState SMT [DBZ-1442](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1442)\n* Add column_id column to metadata section in messages in Kafka topic [DBZ-1483](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1483)\n\n\n### Breaking changes since 0.10.0.CR1\n\n* Change type of MicroDuration to int64 [DBZ-1497](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1497)\n* Convey information about unchanged TOAST column values [DBZ-1367](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1367)\n\n\n### Fixes since 0.10.0.CR1\n\n* Cannot use Avro for fields with dash in name [DBZ-1044](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1044)\n* Detection of unsupported include-unchanged-toast parameter is failing [DBZ-1399](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1399)\n* Possible issue with Debezium not properly shutting down PG connections during Connect rebalance [DBZ-1426](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1426)\n* Common error when PG connector cannot connect is confusing [DBZ-1427](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1427)\n* Postgres connector does not honor `publication.name` configuration [DBZ-1436](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1436)\n* Wrong interrupt handling [DBZ-1438](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1438)\n* CREATE DATABASE and TABLE statements do not support DEFAULT charset [DBZ-1470](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/DBZ-1470)\n* Avoid NPE at runtime in EventRouter when incorrect configuration is given.

          "content": "# Contributing to Debezium\n\nThe Debezium community welcomes anyone that wants to help out in any way, whether that includes reporting problems, helping with documentation, or contributing code changes to fix bugs, add tests, or implement new features. This document outlines the basic steps required to work with and contribute to the Debezium codebase.\n\n## Talk to us\n\nBefore doing any code changes,\nit's a good idea to reach out to us,\nso as to make sure there's a general consencus on the proposed change and the implementation strategy.\nYou can reach us here:\n\n* [User chat](https://debezium.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/302529-users)\n* [Developers chat](https://debezium.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/302533-dev) - Only for internal development subjects\n* [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/debezium)\n* [Jira](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/)\n\n## Install the tools\n\nThe following software is required to work with the Debezium codebase and build it locally:\n\n* [Git 2.2.1](https://git-scm.com) or later\n* JDK 11 or later, e.g. [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/)\n* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) 3.9.8\n* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) 1.9 or later\n\nSee the links above for installation instructions on your platform. You can verify the versions are installed and running:\n\n    $ git --version\n    $ javac -version\n    $ mvn -version\n    $ docker --version\n\n### GitHub account\n\nDebezium uses [GitHub](GitHub.com) for its primary code repository and for pull-requests, so if you don't already have a GitHub account you'll need to [join](https://github.com/join).\n\n### Jira account\n\nDebezium uses the [Red Hat Jira](https://issues.redhat.com/) instance for issue tracking.\nIf you don't have an account yet, you can create one for free by clicking \"Log In\" and then signing up with Red Hat's SSO service.\n\n## Working with the codebase\n\n### Fork the Debezium repository\n\nGo to the [Debezium repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium) and press the \"Fork\" button near the upper right corner of the page. When finished, you will have your own \"fork\" at `https://github.com/<your-username>/debezium`, and this is the repository to which you will upload your proposed changes and create pull requests. For details, see the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).\n\n### Clone your fork\n\nAt a terminal, go to the directory in which you want to place a local clone of the Debezium repository, and run the following commands to use HTTPS authentication:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/debezium.git\n\nIf you prefer to use SSH and have [uploaded your public key to your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/), you can instead use SSH:\n\n    $ git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/debezium.git\n\nThis will create a `debezium` directory, so change into that directory:\n\n    $ cd debezium\n\nThis repository knows about your fork, but it doesn't yet know about the official or [\"upstream\" Debezium repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium). Run the following commands:\n\n    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/debezium/debezium.git\n    $ git fetch upstream\n    $ git branch --set-upstream-to=upstream/main main\n\nNow, when you check the status using Git, it will compare your local repository to the *upstream* repository.\n\n### Get the latest upstream code\n\nYou will frequently need to get all the of the changes that are made to the upstream repository, and you can do this with these commands:\n\n    $ git fetch upstream\n    $ git pull upstream main\n\nThe first command fetches all changes on all branches, while the second actually updates your local `main` branch with the latest commits from the `upstream` repository.\n\n### Building locally\n\nTo build the source code locally, checkout and update the `main` branch:\n\n    $ git checkout main\n    $ git pull upstream main\n\nThen use Maven to compile everything, run all unit and integration tests, build all artifacts, and install all JAR, ZIP, and TAR files into your local Maven repository:\n\n    $ mvn clean install -Passembly\n\nIf you want to skip the integration tests (e.g., if you don't have Docker installed) or the unit tests, you can add `-DskipITs` and/or `-DskipTests` to that command:\n\n    $ mvn clean install -Passembly -DskipITs -DskipTests\n\n### Running and debugging tests\n\nA number of the modules use Docker during their integration tests to run a database. During development it's often desirable to start the Docker container and leave it running so that you can compile/run/debug tests repeatedly from your IDE. To do this, simply go into one of the modules (e.g., `cd debezium-connector-mysql`) and run the following command:\n\n    $ mvn docker:build docker:start\n\nThis will first force the build to create a new Docker image for the database container, and then will start a container named \"database\". You can then run any integration tests from your IDE, though all of our integration tests expect the database connection information to be passed in as system variables (like our Maven build does). For example, the MySQL connector integration tests expect something like `-Ddatabase.hostname=localhost -Ddatabase.port=3306` to be passed as arguments to your test.\n\nWhen your testing is complete, you can stop the Docker container by running:\n\n    $ mvn docker:stop\n\nor the following Docker commands:\n\n    $ docker stop database; docker rm database\n\n## Making changes\n\nEverything the community does with the codebase -- fixing bugs, adding features, making improvements, adding tests, etc. -- should be described by an issue in our [Jira](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ/) project. If no such issue exists for what you want to do, please create an issue with a meaningful and easy-to-understand description.\nIf you are going to work on a specific issue and it's your first contribution,\nplease add a short comment to the issue, so other people know you're working on it.\nIf you are contributing repeatedly, ask in our [chat room for developers](https://debezium.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/302533-dev) for the 'developer' Jira role so you can assign issues to yourself.\n\nBefore you make any changes, be sure to switch to the `main` branch and pull the latest commits on the `main` branch from the upstream repository. Also, it's probably good to run a build and verify all tests pass *before* you make any changes.\n\n    $ git checkout main\n    $ git pull upstream main\n    $ mvn clean install\n\nOnce everything builds, create a *topic branch* named appropriately (we recommend using the issue number, such as `DBZ-1234`):\n\n    $ git checkout -b DBZ-1234\n\nThis branch exists locally and it is there you should make all of your proposed changes for the issue. As you'll soon see, it will ultimately correspond to a single pull request that the Debezium committers will review and merge (or reject) as a whole. (Some issues are big enough that you may want to make several separate but incremental sets of changes. In that case, you can create subsequent topic branches for the same issue by appending a short suffix to the branch name.)\n\nYour changes should include changes to existing tests or additional unit and/or integration tests that verify your changes work. We recommend frequently running related unit tests (in your IDE or using Maven) to make sure your changes didn't break anything else, and that you also periodically run a complete build using Maven to make sure that everything still works:\n\n    $ mvn clean install\n\nFeel free to commit your changes locally as often as you'd like, though we generally prefer that each commit represent a complete and atomic change to the code. Often, this means that most issues will be addressed with a single commit in a single pull-request, but other more complex issues might be better served with a few commits that each make separate but atomic changes. (Some developers prefer to commit frequently and to ammend their first commit with additional changes. Other developers like to make multiple commits and to then squash them. How you do this is up to you. However, *never* change, squash, or ammend a commit that appears in the history of the upstream repository.) When in doubt, use a few separate atomic commits; if the Debezium reviewers think they should be squashed, they'll let you know when they review your pull request.\n\nCommitting is as simple as:\n\n    $ git commit .\n\nwhich should then pop up an editor of your choice in which you should place a good commit message. _*We do expect that all commit messages begin with a line starting with the Jira issue and ending with a short phrase that summarizes what changed in the commit.*_ For example:\n\n    DBZ-1234 Expanded the MySQL integration test and correct a unit test.\n\nIf that phrase is not sufficient to explain your changes, then the first line should be followed by a blank line and one or more paragraphs with additional details. For example:\n\n```\nDBZ-1235 Added support for ingesting data from PostgreSQL.\n\nThe new ingest library supports PostgreSQL 9.4 or later. It requires a small plugin to be installed\non the database server, and the database to be configured so that the ingest component can connect\nto the database and use logical decoding to read the transaction log. Several new unit tests and one\nintegration test were added.\n```\n\nAs an exception, commits for trivial documentation changes which don't warrant the creation of a Jira issue can be prefixed with `[docs]`, for example:\n\n```\n[docs] Typo fix in Postgres connector documentation\n```\n\nThe following commit message prefixes are reserved for internal usage by the Debezium CI infrastructure and should not be used in manually created commits: `[release]`, `[jenkins-jobs]`, `[maven-release-plugin]`, and `[ci]`.\n\n### Code Formatting\n\nThis project utilizes a set of code style rules that are automatically applied by the build process.  There are two ways in which you can apply these rules while contributing:\n\n1. If your IDE supports importing an Eclipse-based formatter file, navigate to your IDE's code format section and import the file `support/ide-configs/src/main/resources/eclipse/debezium-formatter.xml`.  It's recommended that when you import these styles, you may want to make sure these are only applicable only to the current project.\n\n2. If your IDE does not support importing the Eclipse-based formatter file or you'd rather tidy up the formatting after making your changes locally, you can run a project build to make sure that all code changes adhere to the project's desired style.  Instructions on how to run a build locally are provided below.\n\n3. With the command `mvn process-sources` the code style rules can be applied automatically.\n\nIn the event that a pull request is submitted with code style violations, continuous integration will fail the pull request build.  \n\nTo fix pull requests with code style violations, simply run the project's build locally and allow the automatic formatting happen.  Once the build completes, you will have some local repository files modified to fix the coding style which can be amended on your pull request.  Once the pull request is synchronized with the formatting changes, CI will rerun the build.\n\nTo run the build, navigate to the project's root directory and run:\n\n    $ mvn clean install\n\nIt might be useful to simply run a _validate_ check against the code instead of automatically applying code style changes.  If you want to simply run validation, navigate to the project's root directory and run:\n\n    $ mvn clean install -Dformat.formatter.goal=validate -Dformat.imports.goal=check     \n\nPlease note that when running _validate_ checks, the build will stop as soon as it encounters its first violation.  This means it is necessary to run the build multiple times until no violations are detected.\n\n### Rebasing\n\nIf its been more than a day or so since you created your topic branch, we recommend *rebasing* your topic branch on the latest `main` branch. This requires switching to the `main` branch, pulling the latest changes, switching back to your topic branch, and rebasing:\n\n    $ git checkout main\n    $ git pull upstream main\n    $ git checkout DBZ-1234\n    $ git rebase main\n\nIf your changes are compatible with the latest changes on `main`, this will complete and there's nothing else to do. However, if your changes affect the same files/lines as other changes have since been merged into the `main` branch, then your changes conflict with the other recent changes on `main`, and you will have to resolve them. The git output will actually tell you you need to do (e.g., fix a particular file, stage the file, and then run `git rebase --continue`), but if you have questions consult Git or GitHub documentation or spend some time reading about Git rebase conflicts on the Internet.\n\n### Documentation\n\nWhen adding new features such as e.g. a connector or configuration options, they must be documented accordingly in the Debezium [reference documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/).\nThe same applies when changing existing behaviors, e.g. type mappings, removing options etc.\n\nThe documentation is written using AsciiDoc/Antora and can be found in the Debezium [source code repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium/tree/main/documentation).\nAny documentation update should be part of the pull request you submit for the code change.\n\n### Creating a pull request\n\nOnce you're finished making your changes, your topic branch should have your commit(s) and you should have verified that your branch builds successfully. At this point, you can shared your proposed changes and create a pull request. To do this, first push your topic branch (and its commits) to your fork repository (called `origin`) on GitHub:\n\n    $ git push origin DBZ-1234\n\nThen, in a browser go to your forked repository, and you should see a small section near the top of the page with a button labeled \"Contribute\". GitHub recognized that you pushed a new topic branch to your fork of the upstream repository, and it knows you probably want to create a pull request with those changes. Click on the button, and a button \"Open pull request\" will apper. Click it and GitHub will present you the \"Comparing changes\" page, where you can view all changes that you are about to submit. With all revised, click in \"Create pull request\" and a short form will be given, that you should fill out with information about your pull request. The title should start with the Jira issue and end with a short phrase that summarizes the changes included in the pull request. (If the pull request contains a single commit, GitHub will automatically prepopulate the title and description fields from the commit message.)\n\nWhen completed, press the \"Create\" button and copy the URL to the new pull request. Go to the corresponding Jira issue and record the pull request by pasting the URL into the \"Pull request\" field. (Be sure to not overwrite any URLs that were already in this field; this is how a single issue is bound to multiple pull requests.) Also, please add a Jira comment with a clear description of what you changed. You might even use the commit message (except for the first line).\n\nAt this point, you can switch to another issue and another topic branch. The Debezium committers will be notified of your new pull request, and will review it in short order. They may ask questions or make remarks using line notes or comments on the pull request. (By default, GitHub will send you an email notification of such changes, although you can control this via your GitHub preferences.)\n\nIf the reviewers ask you to make additional changes, simply switch to your topic branch for that pull request:\n\n    $ git checkout DBZ-1234\n\nand then make the changes on that branch and either add a new commit or ammend your previous commits. When you've addressed the reviewers' concerns, push your changes to your `origin` repository:\n\n    $ git push origin DBZ-1234\n\nGitHub will automatically update the pull request with your latest changes, but we ask that you go to the pull request and add a comment summarizing what you did. This process may continue until the reviewers are satisfied.\n\nBy the way, please don't take offense if the reviewers ask you to make additional changes, even if you think those changes are minor. The reviewers have a broad understanding of the codebase, and their job is to ensure the code remains as uniform as possible, is of sufficient quality, and is thoroughly tested. When they believe your pull request has those attributes, they will merge your pull request into the official upstream repository.\n\nOnce your pull request has been merged, feel free to delete your topic branch both in your local repository:\n\n    $ git branch -d DBZ-1234\n\nand in your fork:\n\n    $ git push origin :DBZ-1234\n\n(This last command is a bit strange, but it basically is pushing an empty branch (the space before the `:` character) to the named branch. Pushing an empty branch is the same thing as removing it.)\n\n### Continuous Integration\n\nThe project currently builds its jobs in two environments:\n\n- GitHub Actions for pull requests: https://github.com/debezium/debezium/actions\n  - Tests run only against the current version of each supported database\n- Jenkins CI for tests matrix, deployment, release, etc - http://ci.hibernate.org/view/Debezium/\n  - Test run against all database versions supported by the individual connectors\n  - Test Kafka versions\n  - Deploy and release\n\n### Summary\n\nHere's a quick check list for a good pull request (PR):\n\n* Discussed and approved on Jira, chat or the mailing list\n* A Jira associated with your PR (include the Jira issue number in commit comment)\n* One feature/change per PR\n* No changes to code not directly related to your change (e.g. no formatting changes or refactoring to existing code, if you want to refactor/improve existing code that's a separate discussion and separate Jira issue)\n* New/changed features have been documented\n* A full build completes successfully\n* Do a rebase on upstream `main`\n\n## PR Handling (For committers)\n\n* No code changes without PR (unless it's trivial typo fixes and the like; just commit those)\n* Don't merge your own PRs, ensure four eyes principle (unless it's trivial changes, or a reviewer suggested to merge yourself after applying some suggestions)\n* Ensure there are no [\"Octocat\" commits](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-contribution-graphs-on-your-profile/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile)\n* During reviews, focus on the relevant parts (APIs, semantics, functional behavior, performance aspects, etc); de-focus on style and formatting (the latter is automated anyways)\n* Don't do force pushes to master/main branches (it's disabled for all repos)\n* Always apply PRs via rebasing instead of merges (there should be a linear commit history)\n* Optional: squash commits into one if there's lots of forth and back on a PR which isn't relevant for the history in the long run\n"

          "content": "# Debezium Documentation\n\nThe Debezium documentation in [documentation](https://github.com/debezium/debezium/tree/main/documentation) is built using the [Antora Framework](https://www.antora.org).\n\n## Antora Quickstart\n\nThe Antora framework is opinionated about its directory structure, which is why the folder layout is as follows:\n\n```\n  documentation\n  |    antora.yml\n  |\n  └─── modules\n       |\n       └─── ROOT\n            |    nav.adoc\n            |\n            └─── pages\n                 |\n                 └─── (content)\n```\n\n### Component descriptors\n\nThe Antora documentation system uses a concept called component descriptors.  Debezium makes use of a single component descriptor called `ROOT` since we want to document all features in a single section.  In the future if we find documenting connectors or certain features separately from others, we can look at using multiple component descriptor layouts, however for now we use the `ROOT` descriptor for this purpose.\n\n### Page content\n\nAll documentation content should be added under the `pages` directory and should use the extension `.adoc` for consistency.  The hierarchy used for pages under this point is mainly for organizational purposes for documentation writers.  If you wish to reference a specific `.adoc` from another file, the directory hierarchy will be used in the cross reference link however.\n\n### Navigation Pane\n\nThe Antora documentation layout uses a navigational pane on the left-side of the UI.  This navigation pane is driven by content found in the `nav.adoc` located inside the component descriptor's top-level directory.  This file must be **manually** maintained when a new topic is to be present in the left navigation layout.  You can see our current navigation pane layout [here](https://wwww.github.com/debezium/tree/main/documentation/modules/ROOT/nav.adoc).\n\n### Antora Configuration\n\nA component descriptor is identified by the existence of an `antora.yml` file located in the root of the component's documentation layout.  The most important aspect of this file pertains to the `version` attribute found in the file's contents:\n\n```\nname: debezium\ntitle: Debezium Documentation\nversion: `0.10`\nnav:\n  - modules/ROOT/nav.adoc\n```\n\nThe `name` attribute describes a path that will be appended to the Antora's base build path.  This allows differing components to output their documentation content separately.\n\nThe `title` attribute describes a UI friendly name for this component.  Since Debezium uses a single _ROOT_ component, all documentation will be located under the name `Debezium Documentation` in the UI.\n\nThe `nav` attribute describes an array of navigation AsciiDoc files uses to build the left navigation pane.  Debezium makes use of a single navigation file.\n\nThe `version` attribute is the most important aspect of this file.  This designates the naming convention to be used when referencing what _version_ this documentation represents.  This can be an actual version number as shown above, in which case it should be quoted.  Other examples could be things like `stable` or `latest`.\n\n**NOTE**: As of Antora 2.3, the `antora.yml` file can now define Asciidoc attributes, which are discussed below.\n\n### Attributes\n\nShould a documentation page need to reference attributes, e.g. version numbers, this can be accomplished in two ways:\n\n1. Defined in the `antora.yml` component descriptor in this repository.\n2. Defined in the Antora playbook files in the Debezium website repository.\n\nThe general rule is if an attribute changes frequently or is related to a specific version or subset of versions of Debezium, it likely belongs in the `antora.yml` file in this repository.  If the attribute changes infrequent or is not specific to a given version of Debezium, its easier to maintain that in the various playbook files in the Debezium website repository.\n\nLets say we need to add an attribute that points to our JIRA issue for issue links,\nthat would be an example of an attrbute that would be defined in the playbook.\nBut if we needed to add an attribute that points to a specific version of a Maven artifact or reference a specific version of a dependency,\nthat's more appropriate for the `antora.yml` component descriptor located in this repository.\n\nThe current `antora.yml` component descriptor looks similar to the following:\n```\nasciidoc:\n  attributes:\n    debezium-version: '1.1.0.Final'\n    debezium-kafka-version: '2.4.0'\n    debezium-docker-label: '1.1'\n    assemblies: '../assemblies'\n    modules: '../../modules'\n    mysql-connector-plugin-download: 'https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-mysql/1.1.0.Final/debezium-connector-mysql-1.1.0.Final-plugin.tar.gz'\n    mysql-version: '8.0'\n    strimzi-version: '0.13.0'\n```\n\nAttributes are defined by creating a nested yaml structure under `asciidoc.attributes` where the key-value attribute pairs are to be defined.\n\nThe playbook files in the website repository use the same layout, shown here:\n```\n# Global asciidoc attributes here, used across all versions of documentation\nasciidoc:\n  attributes:\n    prodname: 'Debezium'\n    context: 'debezium'\n    jira-url: 'https://issues.redhat.com'\n    # because of how handlebars templates work with page.attributes, this must be prefixed with \"page-\"\n    page-copyright-year: '2020'\n```\n\n**NOTE**: Given that the Debezium documentation is consumed downstream by other processes, do not define attributes in the `_attributes.adoc` file and use it as an include nor should you define attributes locally in a given .adoc file.\n\n## Contributing to the Documentation\n\nFollow these guidelines for contributing to the Debezium documentation.\n\n### Using AsciiDoc attributes\n\nAsciiDoc attributes are effectively like variables, enabling you to insert short snippets of text into the documentation.\nThey are typically used for abstracting content like version numbers, branding, and root URLs.\nFor example, to insert the contents of the `prodname` attribute (which currently resolves to `Debezium`), use the AsciiDoc syntax, `{prodname}`.\n\nWe recommend that you use the following attributes when contributing content to the Debezium documentation:\n\n* `{prodname}` instead of Debezium.\n\nSee the [Attributes](#attributes) section for more details.\n\n### Adding cross-references that link to other content\n\nThe Debezium Antora-based documentation uses two styles of links for creating cross-references to other content, _External_ and _Internal_.\n\n#### External links\n\nAn external link is one that points to a resource that is not included within one of the Debezium AsciiDoc files.\nTo link to an external resource, use the AsciiDoc `link` macro as in the following example:\n\n```\nlink:<scheme>://<host>/<path-to-resource>[<link-text>]\n```\n\nFor example:\n\n```\nlink:https://docs.antora.org/antora/latest/navigation/xrefs-and-link-text/[Antora linking documentation]\n```\n\n#### Internal links\n\nAn internal link is one that points to a resource that is included in one of the Debezium AsciiDoc files.\nThe target of an internal link is the anchor ID that is defined for the element that you want to link to.\nFor example, to link to a section header with the name _Custom connector_, the header must have an anchor ID defined on the line that precedes it, as in the following examples:\n\n```\n[id=\"custom-connector\"]\n== Custom connector\n```\n\n```\n[[schema-change-topic]]\n== Schema change topic\n```\n\nThe method that you use to construct the link depends on whether the link targets content that is in the same AsciiDoc file or in a different file.\n\n##### Links that target content within the same file\nTo link to content within the same file, use the AsciiDoc `xref` macro.\nTo use the `xref` macro, construct the link as in the following example:\n\n```\nxref:<anchorID>[<link-text>]\n```\nFor example,\n```\nxref:custom-connector[Custom connector]\n```\nAlthough the Antora framework that we use to publish the Debezium documentation can accept an empty `[<link-text>]` value, to enable the Debezium documentation to be consumed downstream in other frameworks, it's necessary to supply a `[<link-text>]` value.\n\n##### Links that target content in a different file\nTo link to Debezium content that is in a different file, construct the link according to the following format:\n\n```\n{link-prefix}:<content-category-attribute>#<anchorID>\n```\nFor example,\n\n```\n{link-prefix}:{link-outbox-event-router}#basic-outbox-configuration\n```\nIn the Antora-based documentation, the `{link-prefix}` attribute resolves to the `xref` macro, but when the content is reused in a downstream framework, it can contain a different value.\n\nSimilarly, in the Antora-based documentation, the `<content-category-attribute>` corresponds to the path to the targeted file, but when the content is rendered in a downstream framework, it can contain a different value. To determine which category attribute to use when linking to a different file, see the `link-*` attributes that are listed in the `asciidoc` section of the [`documentation/antora.yml`](/documentation/antora.yml) file.\n\nAlthough the preceding format is not required for the Antora-based documentation, it is required to enable the Debezium documentation to be consumed in other downstream frameworks.\n\n### Adding images\n\nTo add an image to the documentation:\n1. Add your image file to the `documentation/modules/ROOT/assets/images` directory.\n2. Reference the image using the syntax `image::MY_IMAGE.png[]` (or for an inline image, `image:MY_IMAGE.png[]`).\n\nAt build time, AsciiDoc reads the value of the standard `imagesdir` attribute to discover the location of images.\nThere is no need to set this attribute yourself, it is already defined for you.\nNote that if you view or render a _single_ AsciiDoc file, you will not be able to view the image.\nBecause of the way the images are organized (in combination with the `imagesdir` attribute), you can only see the images correctly rendered when you build the whole documentation set using Antora.\n\n### Best practices\n\nNote the following additional recommendations:\n\n* If your contribution also involves reformatting large amounts of text (modifying white space, line breaks, and so on), please make these reformatting updates in a _separate_ commit.\nIt is much easier for reviewers to focus on the technical changes in the content, if commits are not polluted by large amounts of trivial formatting changes.\n* Avoid long lines for the sake of simpler diffs;\ninstead of sticking to a hard character number limit,\nput one sentence or line of thought per line.\nIt's not a black-or-white rule, but it works surprisingly well after getting used to it.\nE.g. commas are a good indicator for moving to a new line.\n"

This software is released under version 2 of the GNU\n   General Public License (GPLv2), as set forth below, with the following\n   additional permissions:\n\n   This distribution of MySQL Connector/J 8.0 is distributed with certain\n   software that is licensed under separate terms, as designated in a\n   particular file or component or in the license documentation. Without\n   limiting your rights under the GPLv2, the authors of MySQL hereby grant\n   you an additional permission to link the program and your derivative\n   works with the separately licensed software that they have included\n   with the program.\n\n   Without limiting the foregoing grant of rights under the GPLv2 and\n   additional permission as to separately licensed software, this\n   Connector is also subject to the Universal FOSS Exception, version 1.0,\n   a copy of which is reproduced below and can also be found along with\n   its FAQ at http://oss.oracle.com/licenses/universal-foss-exception.\n\n   Copyright (c) 2017, 2019, Oracle and/or its affiliates.

A copy of the license is\nalso reproduced below. Unless required by applicable law or agreed\nto in writing, software distributed under the License is distributed\non an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,\neither express or implied. See the License for the specific language\ngoverning permissions and limitations under the License.\n\nGNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\nVersion 2, June 1991\n\nCopyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim\ncopies of this license document, but changing it is not\nallowed.\n\n                     Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,\nand (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to\ncopy, distribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,\nwe want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,\nso that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the\noriginal authors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\n    interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as\na special exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a\nversion number of this License, you may choose any version ever\npublished by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the\nauthor to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the\nFree Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we\nsometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the\ntwo goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free\nsoftware and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\nEITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED\nWARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.\nTHE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS\nWITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nPROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\n    published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of\n\n    the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA\n    02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details\n    type 'show w'. This is free software, and you are welcome\n    to redistribute it under certain conditions; type 'show c'\n    for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the\nappropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the\ncommands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and\n'show c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever\nsuits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the\n  program 'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written\n  by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,\nyou may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary\napplications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead of this License.\n\nThe Universal FOSS Exception, Version 1.0\n\n   In addition to the rights set forth in the other license(s) included in\n   the distribution for this software, data, and/or documentation\n   (collectively the \"Software\", and such licenses collectively with this\n   additional permission the \"Software License\"), the copyright holders\n   wish to facilitate interoperability with other software, data, and/or\n   documentation distributed with complete corresponding source under a\n   license that is OSI-approved and/or categorized by the FSF as free\n   (collectively \"Other FOSS\"). We therefore hereby grant the following\n   additional permission with respect to the use and distribution of the\n   Software with Other FOSS, and the constants, function signatures, data\n   structures and other invocation methods used to run or interact with\n   each of them (as to each, such software's \"Interfaces\"):\n    i. The Software's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the\n       license of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in\n       the Other FOSS in order to enable interoperability, without\n       requiring a change to the license of the Other FOSS other than as\n       to any Interfaces of the Software embedded therein. The Software's\n       Interfaces remain at all times under the Software License,\n       including without limitation as used in the Other FOSS (which upon\n       any such use also then contains a portion of the Software under the\n       Software License).\n   ii. The Other FOSS's Interfaces may, to the extent permitted by the\n       license of the Other FOSS, be copied into, used and distributed in\n       the Software in order to enable interoperability, without requiring\n       that such Interfaces be licensed under the terms of the Software\n       License or otherwise altering their original terms, if this does\n       not require any portion of the Software other than such Interfaces\n       to be licensed under the terms other than the Software License.\n   iii. If only Interfaces and no other code is copied between the\n       Software and the Other FOSS in either direction, the use and/or\n       distribution of the Software with the Other FOSS shall not be\n       deemed to require that the Other FOSS be licensed under the license\n       of the Software, other than as to any Interfaces of the Software\n       copied into the Other FOSS. This includes, by way of example and\n       without limitation, statically or dynamically linking the Software\n       together with Other FOSS after enabling interoperability using the\n       Interfaces of one or both, and distributing the resulting\n       combination under different licenses for the respective portions\n       thereof. For avoidance of doubt, a license which is OSI-approved or\n       categorized by the FSF as free, includes, for the purpose of this\n       permission, such licenses with additional permissions, and any\n       license that has previously been so approved or categorized as\n       free, even if now deprecated or otherwise no longer recognized as\n       approved or free. Nothing in this additional permission grants any\n       right to distribute any portion of the Software on terms other than\n       those of the Software License or grants any additional permission\n       of any kind for use or distribution of the Software in conjunction\n       with software other than Other FOSS.\n\nLicenses for Third-Party Components\n\n   The following sections contain licensing information for libraries that\n   we have included with the MySQL Connector/J 8.0 source and components\n   used to test MySQL Connector/J 8.0. Commonly used licenses referenced\n   herein can be found in Commonly Used Licenses.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it\nbecomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs\nmust be allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that\na free library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.\nIn this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library\nto free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control\ncompilation and installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\n\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\n\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended\nto apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms\nof the ordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.\nIt is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most\neffectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should\nhave at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full\nnotice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is numbered 2\nbecause it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.]\n\nPreamble\n\nThe licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to\nshare and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are\nintended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make\nsure the software is free for all its users.\n\nThis license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially\ndesignated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries\nwhose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our\nGeneral Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom\nto distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you\nwish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you\ncan change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that\nyou know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to\ndeny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These\nrestrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute\ncopies of the library, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a\nfee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must\nmake sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a\nprogram with the library, you must provide complete object files to the\nrecipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making\nchanges to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms\nso they know their rights.\n\nOur method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to\ncopy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\nAlso, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that\neveryone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the\nlibrary is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to\nknow that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems\nintroduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We\nwish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will\nindividually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program\ninto proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nMost GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU\nGeneral Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This\nlicense, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain\ndesignated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one;\nbe sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same\nas in the ordinary license.\n\nThe reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they\nblur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program\nand simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the\nlibrary, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to\nrunning a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and\nlegal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the\noriginal library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such.\n\nBecause of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public\nLicense for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because\nmost developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker\nconditions might promote sharing better.\n\nHowever, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of\nthose programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries\nthemselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit\ndevelopers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your\nfreedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are\nincorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards\nchanges in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the\nactual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster\ndevelopment of free libraries.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification\nfollow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the\nlibrary\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived\nfrom the library, while the latter only works together with the library.\n\nNote that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General\nPublic License rather than by this special one.\n\nTERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a\nnotice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may\nbe distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also\ncalled \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nA \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so\nas to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of\nthose functions and data) to form executables.\n\nThe \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has\nbeen distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means\neither the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to\nsay, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or\nwith modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.\n(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term\n\"modification\".)\n\n\"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source\ncode for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition\nfiles, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the\nlibrary.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered\nby this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program\nusing the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is\ncovered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library\n(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether\nthat is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses\nthe Library does.\n\n1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously\nand appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and\ndisclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this\nLicense and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this\nLicense along with the Library.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may\nat your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it,\nthus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such\nmodifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you\nalso meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating\nthat you changed the files and the date of any change.\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to\nall third parties under the terms of this License.\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table\nof data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,\nother than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must\nmake a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not\nsupply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs\nwhatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a\npurpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.\nTherefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or\ntable used by this function must be optional: if the application does not\nsupply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable\nsections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably\nconsidered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,\nand its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as\nseparate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole\nwhich is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be\non the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to\nthe entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\nrights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the\nright to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on\nthe Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\nthe Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or\ndistribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this\nLicense.\n\n3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License\ninstead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must\nalter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the\nordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License.\n(If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License\nhas appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not\nmake any other change in these notices.\n\nOnce this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy,\nso the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies\nand derivative works made from that copy.\n\nThis option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library\ninto a program that is not a library.\n\n4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete\ncorresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under\nthe terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software\ninterchange.\n\nIf distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code\nfrom the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,\neven though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the\nobject code.\n\n5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but\nis designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is\ncalled a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a\nderivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this\nLicense.\n\nHowever, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an\nexecutable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions\nof the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable\nis therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution\nof such executables.\n\nWhen a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is\npart of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of\nthe Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is\nespecially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if\nthe work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not\nprecisely defined by law.\n\nIf such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts\nand accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less\nin length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of\nwhether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object\ncode plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n\nOtherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the\nobject code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables\ncontaining that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are\nlinked directly with the Library itself.\n\n6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a\n\"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing\nportions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,\nprovided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's\nown use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.\n\nYou must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is\nused in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You\nmust supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays\ncopyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library\namong them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this\nLicense. Also, you must do one of these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work\n(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is\nan executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable\n\"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\nuser can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable\ncontaining the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes\nthe contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able\nto recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)\n    b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,\nfor a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.\n    c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a\ndesignated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified\nmaterials from the same place.\n    d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or\nthat you have already sent this user a copy.\n\nFor an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must\ninclude any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable\nfrom it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need\nnot include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself\naccompanies the executable.\n\nIt may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of\nother proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating\nsystem. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library\ntogether in an executable that you distribute.\n\n7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library\nside-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not\ncovered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided\nthat the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the\nother library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do\nthese two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on\nthe Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be\ndistributed under the terms of the Sections above.\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part\nof it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\naccompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library\nexcept as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to\ncopy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and\nwill automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties\nwho have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not\nhave their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\ncompliance.\n\n9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.\nHowever, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the\nLibrary or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you\ndo not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the\nLibrary (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of\nthis License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,\ndistributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.\n\n10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original\nlicensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to\nthese terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on\nthe recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not\nresponsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.\n\n11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse\nyou from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to\nsatisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other\npertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the\nLibrary at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit\nroyalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies\ndirectly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both\nit and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the\nLibrary.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and\nthe section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents\nor other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims;\nthis section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free\nsoftware distribution system which is implemented by public license\npractices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain\ncountries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original\ncopyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an\nexplicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so\nthat distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.\nIn such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the\nbody of this License.\n\n13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later\nversion\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of\nthat version or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.

Our decision will be guided by the two goals of\npreserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of\npromoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\nNO WARRANTY\n\n15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR\nTHE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE\nSTATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE\nLIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,\nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It also counts\n as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n the version number 2.1.]\n\n                            Preamble\n\n  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\nfreedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\nfree software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n\n  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\nspecially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\nFree Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\ncan use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\nthis license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\nstrategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\nnot price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\nyou have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\nfor this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\nit if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\nit in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\nthese things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\ndistributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\nrights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\nyou if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\nor for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\nyou.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\ncode.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\ncomplete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\nwith the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\nit.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n\n  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\nlibrary, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\npermission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n\n  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\nthere is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\nmodified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\nthat what they have is not the original version, so that the original\nauthor's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\nintroduced by others.\n\f\n  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\nany free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\neffectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\nrestrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\nany patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\nconsistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n\n  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\nordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\nis quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\nthis license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\nlibraries into non-free programs.\n\n  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\na shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\ncombined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\nGeneral Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\nentire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\nPublic License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\nthe library.\n\n  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\ndoes Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\nPublic License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\nof an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\nare the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\nlibraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\nspecial circumstances.\n\n  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\nencourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\na de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\nallowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\nlibrary does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\ncase, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\nsoftware only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n\n  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\nprograms enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\nfree software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\nnon-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\noperating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\nsystem.\n\n  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\nusers' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\nlinked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\nthat program using a modified version of the Library.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\nformer contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\nbe combined with the library in order to run.\n\f\n                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\nprogram which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\nother authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\nthis Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\nEach licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\n  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\nprepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n\n  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\nwhich has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\nLibrary\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\ncopyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\nportion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\nstraightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\nincluded without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n\n  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\ninterface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\nand installation of the library.\n\n  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\nsuch a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\non the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\nwriting it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\nand what the program that uses the Library does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\ncomplete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\nyou conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\nappropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\nall the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\nwarranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\nLibrary.\n\n  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\nand you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\nfee.\n\f\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.\n\n    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n    in the event an application does not supply such function or\n    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n    its purpose remains meaningful.\n\n    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n    application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n    root function must still compute square roots.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote\nit.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Library.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library\nwith the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\nLicense instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\nthis, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\nthat they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\ninstead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\nordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\nthat version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\nthese notices.\n\f\n  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\nthat copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\nsubsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n\n  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\nthe Library into a program that is not a library.\n\n  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\nderivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\nunder the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\nit with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\nmust be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\nmedium customarily used for software interchange.\n\n  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\nfrom a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\nsource code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\ndistribute the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\nLibrary, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\nlinked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\nwork, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\ntherefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n\n  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\ncreates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\ncontains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\nlibrary\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\nSection 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n\n  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\nthat is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\nderivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\nWhether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\nlinked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\nthreshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n\n  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\nstructure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\nfunctions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\nfile is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\nwork.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\nLibrary will still fall under Section 6.)\n\n  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\ndistribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\nAny executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\nwhether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n\f\n  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\nlink a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\nwork containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\nunder terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\nmodification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications.\n\n  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\nLibrary is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\nthis License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\nduring execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\ncopyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\ndirecting the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\nof these things:\n\n    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding\n    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever\n    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under\n    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked\n    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that\n    uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the\n    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified\n    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood\n    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the\n    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application\n    to use the modified definitions.)\n\n    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a\n    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,\n    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)\n    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if\n    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is\n    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.\n\n    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at\n    least three years, to give the same user the materials\n    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n    than the cost of performing this distribution.\n\n    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy\n    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above\n    specified materials from the same place.\n\n    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these\n    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.\n\n  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\nLibrary\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\nreproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\nthe materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\nnormally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\nwhich the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\nthe executable.\n\n  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\nrestrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\naccompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\nuse both them and the Library together in an executable that you\ndistribute.\n\f\n  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side-by-side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined\nlibrary, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on\nthe Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise\npermitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n\n    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work\n    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library\n    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the\n    Sections above.\n\n    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact\n    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining\n    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute\nthe Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any\nattempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or\ndistribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your\nrights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,\nor rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Library or works based on it.\n\n  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\nLibrary), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\nsubject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\nthis License.\n\f\n  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\nparticular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\nand the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\nan explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\nso that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\nexcluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\nwritten in the body of this License.\n\n  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\nversions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\nSuch new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\nbut may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that version or of any later version published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\nlicense version number, you may choose any version ever published by\nthe Free Software Foundation.\n\f\n  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\nwrite to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\ncopyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\nSoftware Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\ndecision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\nof all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\nand reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\nEXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\nOTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\nKIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\nLIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\nTHE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\nWRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\nAND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\nFOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\nCONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\nLIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\nRENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\nFAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\nSUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\nDAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries\n\n  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\neveryone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\nredistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\nordinary General Public License).\n\n  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.

You set up and configure Debezium to monitor your databases, and then your applications consume events for each row-level change made to the database. Only committed changes are visible, so your application doesn't have to worry about transactions or changes that are rolled back. Debezium provides a single model of all change events, so your application does not have to worry about the intricacies of each kind of database management system. Additionally, since Debezium records the history of data changes in durable, replicated logs, your application can be stopped and restarted at any time, and it will be able to consume all of the events it missed while it was not running, ensuring that all events are processed correctly and completely.\n\nMonitoring databases and being notified when data changes has always been complicated. Relational database triggers can be useful, but are specific to each database and often limited to updating state within the same database (not communicating with external processes). Some databases offer APIs or frameworks for monitoring changes, but there is no standard so each database's approach is different and requires a lot of knowledged and specialized code. It still is very challenging to ensure that all changes are seen and processed in the same order while minimally impacting the database.\n\nDebezium provides modules that do this work for you. Some modules are generic and work with multiple database management systems, but are also a bit more limited in functionality and performance. Other modules are tailored for specific database management systems, so they are often far more capable and they leverage the specific features of the system.\n\n## Basic architecture\n\nDebezium is a change data capture (CDC) platform that achieves its durability, reliability, and fault tolerance qualities by reusing Kafka and Kafka Connect. Each connector deployed to the Kafka Connect distributed, scalable, fault tolerant service monitors a single upstream database server, capturing all of the changes and recording them in one or more Kafka topics (typically one topic per database table). Kafka ensures that all of these data change events are replicated and totally ordered, and allows many clients to independently consume these same data change events with little impact on the upstream system. Additionally, clients can stop consuming at any time, and when they restart they resume exactly where they left off. Each client can determine whether they want exactly-once or at-least-once delivery of all data change events, and all data change events for each database/table are delivered in the same order they occurred in the upstream database.\n\nApplications that don't need or want this level of fault tolerance, performance, scalability, and reliability can instead use Debezium's *embedded connector engine* to run a connector directly within the application space. They still want the same data change events, but prefer to have the connectors send them directly to the application rather than persist them inside Kafka.\n\n## Common use cases\n\nThere are a number of scenarios in which Debezium can be extremely valuable, but here we outline just a few of them that are more common.\n\n### Cache invalidation\n\nAutomatically invalidate entries in a cache as soon as the record(s) for entries change or are removed. If the cache is running in a separate process (e.g., Redis, Memcache, Infinispan, and others), then the simple cache invalidation logic can be placed into a separate process or service, simplifying the main application. In some situations, the logic can be made a little more sophisticated and can use the updated data in the change events to update the affected cache entries.\n\n### Simplifying monolithic applications\n\nMany applications update a database and then do additional work after the changes are committed: update search indexes, update a cache, send notifications, run business logic, etc. This is often called \"dual-writes\" since the application is writing to multiple systems outside of a single transaction. Not only is the application logic complex and more difficult to maintain, dual writes also risk losing data or making the various systems inconsistent if the application were to crash after a commit but before some/all of the other updates were performed. Using change data capture, these other activities can be performed in separate threads or separate processes/services when the data is committed in the original database. This approach is more tolerant of failures, does not miss events, scales better, and more easily supports upgrading and operations.\n\n### Sharing databases\n\nWhen multiple applications share a single database, it is often non-trivial for one application to become aware of the changes committed by another application. One approach is to use a message bus, although non-transactional message busses suffer from the \"dual-writes\" problems mentioned above. However, this becomes very straightforward with Debezium: each application can monitor the database and react to the changes.\n\n### Data integration\n\nData is often stored in multiple places, especially when it is used for different purposes and has slightly different forms. Keeping the multiple systems synchronized can be challenging, but simple ETL-type solutions can be implemented quickly with Debezium and simple event processing logic.\n\n### CQRS\n\nThe [Command Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS)](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) architectural pattern uses a one data model for updating and one or more other data models for reading. As changes are recorded on the update-side, those changes are then processed and used to update the various read representations. As a result CQRS applications are usually more complicated, especially when they need to ensure reliable and totally-ordered processing. Debezium and CDC can make this more approachable: writes are recorded as normal, but Debezium captures those changes in durable, totally ordered streams that are consumed by the services that asynchronously update the read-only views. The write-side tables can represent domain-oriented entities, or when CQRS is paired with [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) the write-side tables are the append-only event log of commands.\n\n## Building Debezium\n\nThe following software is required to work with the Debezium codebase and build it locally:\n\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com) 2.2.1 or later\n* JDK 17 or later, e.g. [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/)\n* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) 1.9 or later\n* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) 3.9.8 or later  \n  (or invoke the wrapper with `./mvnw` for Maven commands)\n\nSee the links above for installation instructions on your platform. You can verify the versions are installed and running:\n\n    $ git --version\n    $ javac -version\n    $ mvn -version\n    $ docker --version\n\n### Why Docker?\n\nMany open source software projects use Git, Java, and Maven, but requiring Docker is less common. Debezium is designed to talk to a number of external systems, such as various databases and services, and our integration tests verify Debezium does this correctly. But rather than expect you have all of these software systems installed locally, Debezium's build system uses Docker to automatically download or create the necessary images and start containers for each of the systems. The integration tests can then use these services and verify Debezium behaves as expected, and when the integration tests finish, Debezium's build will automatically stop any containers that it started.\n\nDebezium also has a few modules that are not written in Java, and so they have to be required on the target operating system. Docker lets our build do this using images with the target operating system(s) and all necessary development tools.\n\nUsing Docker has several advantages:\n\n1. You don't have to install, configure, and run specific versions of each external services on your local machine, or have access to them on your local network. Even if you do, Debezium's build won't use them.\n1. We can test multiple versions of an external service. Each module can start whatever containers it needs, so different modules can easily use different versions of the services.\n1. Everyone can run complete builds locally. You don't have to rely upon a remote continuous integration server running the build in an environment set up with all the required services.\n1. All builds are consistent. When multiple developers each build the same codebase, they should see exactly the same results -- as long as they're using the same or equivalent JDK, Maven, and Docker versions. That's because the containers will be running the same versions of the services on the same operating systems. Plus, all of the tests are designed to connect to the systems running in the containers, so nobody has to fiddle with connection properties or custom configurations specific to their local environments.\n1. No need to clean up the services, even if those services modify and store data locally. Docker *images* are cached, so reusing them to start containers is fast and consistent. However, Docker *containers* are never reused: they always start in their pristine initial state, and are discarded when they are shutdown. Integration tests rely upon containers, and so cleanup is handled automatically.\n\n### Configure your Docker environment\n\nThe Docker Maven Plugin will resolve the docker host by checking the following environment variables:\n\n    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://10.1.2.2:2376\n    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cdk/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/.docker\n    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\n\nThese can be set automatically if using Docker Machine or something similar.\n\n#### Colima\nIn order to run testcontainers against [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) the env vars below should be set (assume we use `default` profile of colima)\n\n    colima start\n    export TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock\n    export TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE=\"0.0.0.0\"\n    export DOCKER_HOST=\"unix://${HOME}/.colima/default/docker.sock\"\n\n\n### Building the code\n\nFirst obtain the code by cloning the Git repository:\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/debezium/debezium.git\n    $ cd debezium\n\nThen build the code using Maven:\n\n    $ mvn clean verify\n\nThe build starts and uses several Docker containers for different DBMSes. Note that if Docker is not running or configured, you'll likely get an arcane error -- if this is the case, always verify that Docker is running, perhaps by using `docker ps` to list the running containers.\n\n### Don't have Docker running locally for builds?\n\nYou can skip the integration tests and docker-builds with the following command:\n\n    $ mvn clean verify -DskipITs\n\n### Building just the artifacts, without running tests, CheckStyle, etc.\n\nYou can skip all non-essential plug-ins (tests, integration tests, CheckStyle, formatter, API compatibility check, etc.) using the \"quick\" build profile:\n\n    $ mvn clean verify -Dquick\n\nThis provides the fastest way for solely producing the output artifacts, without running any of the QA related Maven plug-ins.\nThis comes in handy for producing connector JARs and/or archives as quickly as possible, e.g. for manual testing in Kafka Connect.\n\n### Running tests of the Postgres connector using the wal2json or pgoutput logical decoding plug-ins\n\nThe Postgres connector supports three logical decoding plug-ins for streaming changes from the DB server to the connector: decoderbufs (the default), wal2json, and pgoutput.\nTo run the integration tests of the PG connector using wal2json, enable the \"wal2json-decoder\" build profile:\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl :debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder\n    \nTo run the integration tests of the PG connector using pgoutput, enable the \"pgoutput-decoder\" and \"postgres-10\" build profiles:\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl :debezium-connector-postgres -Ppgoutput-decoder,postgres-10\n\nA few tests currently don't pass when using the wal2json plug-in.\nLook for references to the types defined in `io.debezium.connector.postgresql.DecoderDifferences` to find these tests.\n\n### Running tests of the Postgres connector with specific Apicurio Version\nTo run the tests of PG connector using wal2json or pgoutput logical decoding plug-ins with a specific version of Apicurio, a test property can be passed as:\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder \n          -Ddebezium.test.apicurio.version=1.3.1.Final\n\nIn absence of the property the stable version of Apicurio will be fetched.\n\n### Running tests of the Postgres connector against an external database, e.g. Amazon RDS\nPlease note if you want to test against a *non-RDS* cluster, this test requires `<your user>` to be a superuser with not only `replication` but permissions\nto login to `all` databases in `pg_hba.conf`.  It also requires `postgis` packages to be available on the target server for some of the tests to pass.\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder \\\n         -Ddocker.skip.build=true -Ddocker.skip.run=true -Dpostgres.host=<your PG host> \\\n         -Dpostgres.user=<your user> -Dpostgres.password=<your password> \\\n         -Ddebezium.test.records.waittime=10\n\nAdjust the timeout value as needed.\n\nSee [PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS](debezium-connector-postgres/RDS.md) for details on setting up a database on RDS to test against.\n\n### Running tests of the Oracle connector using Oracle XStream\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-oracle -Poracle-xstream,oracle-tests -Dinstantclient.dir=<path-to-instantclient>\n\n### Running tests of the Oracle connector with a non-CDB database\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-oracle -Poracle-tests -Dinstantclient.dir=<path-to-instantclient> -Ddatabase.pdb.name=\n\n### Running the tests for MongoDB with oplog capturing from an IDE\n\nWhen running the test without maven, please make sure you pass the correct parameters to the execution. Look for the correct parameters in `.github/workflows/mongodb-oplog-workflow.yml` and\nappend them to the JVM execution parameters, prefixing them with `debezium.test`. As the execution will happen outside of the lifecycle execution, you need to start the MongoDB container manually\nfrom the MongoDB connector directory\n\n    $ mvn docker:start -B -am -Passembly -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -Dformat.skip=true -Drevapi.skip -Dcapture.mode=oplog -Dversion.mongo.server=3.6 -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.cli.transfer.Slf4jMavenTransferListener=warn -Dmaven.wagon.http.pool=false -Dmaven.wagon.httpconnectionManager.ttlSeconds=120 -Dcapture.mode=oplog -Dmongo.server=3.6\n\nThe relevant portion of the line will look similar to the following:\n\n    java -ea -Ddebezium.test.capture.mode=oplog -Ddebezium.test.version.mongo.server=3.6 -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dconnector.mongodb.members.auto.discover=false -Dconnector.mongodb.name=mongo1 -DskipLongRunningTests=true [...]\n\n## Contributing\n\nThe Debezium community welcomes anyone that wants to help out in any way, whether that includes reporting problems, helping with documentation, or contributing code changes to fix bugs, add tests, or implement new features.

のための低遅延データストリーミングプラットフォームを提供するオープンソースプロジェクトです。データベースを監視するようにDebezium をセットアップ・設定すると、データベース上で実行された各行レベルの変更をアプリケーションで利用する事ができます。コミットされた変更だけが見えるため、アプリケーションでトランザクションやロールバックされた変更について悩む必要はありません。Debezium は全ての変更について単一のモデルを提供するので、アプリケーションは様々な種類のデータベースソフトウェアの複雑さを気にする必要がありません。更に、Debezium は変更データキャプチャを永続的で複製されたログに記録します。変更データキャプチャを処理するアプリケーションはいつでも停止・再開することができ、その場合でも停止中に発生したイベントは全て再開したタイミングで処理されるため、全てのイベントが正しく完全に処理されることが保証されます。\n\nデータベースを監視して、変更された場合に通知することは、いつの時代も複雑なタスクでした。リレーショナルデータベースのトリガーは便利ですが、各データベースソフトウェアに固有で、データベース内のテーブルを更新する事に制限されています（他のプロセスと通信できません）。いくつかのデータベースは変更を監視するための API やフレームワークを提供していますが、標準化された方法は無くて、多くの知識と特殊化されたコードを必要とします。それをしてもなお、データベースに与える影響を最小限にしながら、データベースに適用された順番を保ちながら全ての変更を取得することは難しい作業です。\n\nDebezium はこのような作業を行うためのモジュールを提供します。いくつかのモジュールは汎用のもので複数のデータベースソフトウェアで動作しますが、機能は制限され、パフォーマンスは低いです。他のモジュールはそれぞれのデータベースソフトウェアに合わせて作られており、各ソフトウェアに固有の機能を使うことで高い能力を持っています。\n\n## 基本的なアーキテクチャ\n\nDebezium は、Kafka と Kafka Connect を再利用する事で、永続性、信頼性および耐障害性を達成した変更データキャプチャ (Change Data Capture; CDC) のプラットフォームです。Kafka Connect 上の分散されて、スケーラブルで、耐障害性のあるサービスに展開された各コネクタが、それぞれ1つのデータベースサーバーを監視して、全ての変更を取得し、1つまたは複数の Kafka topic に保存します（典型的には、データベーステーブル毎に1つの topic を利用）。Kafka は、これらのデータが更新されたイベントを順序を保ったままレプリケーションして、上流サーバーへの影響を押さえて、このイベントを複数のクライアントが冪等に利用 (consume) することを可能にしてくれます。更に、クライアントは任意のタイミングで処理を止めて、またその場所から再開することができます。各クライアントは全てのデータ変更イベントを『正確に1回』または『少なくとも1回』のどちらで受け取るのかを決めることができて、各データベース/テーブルのデータ変更イベントは、データベースで起こったのと同じ順番で配送されます。\n\nこのレベルの耐障害性・パフォーマンス・スケーラビリティおよび信頼性を必要としない、あるいは求めないアプリケーションは、代わりに Debeium の *embedded connector engine* を直接アプリケーション内で実行する事もできます。変更イベントの中身は同じですが、Kafka での永続化を経由せずに、connector が直接アプリケーションにイベントを送信することになります。\n\n## よくある利用例\n\nDebezium が非常に価値あるものとなる状況は多くあります。ここでは、一般的なものをいくつか紹介します。\n\n\n### キャッシュの無効化\n\nキャッシュエントリーの record が変更・削除された時に、自動的にキャッシュエントリーを無効にできます。キャッシュが別のプロセス（例えば Redis, Memcache, Infinispan など）で実装されている場合、シンプルなキャッシュの無効化ロジックを別のプロセスやサービスとして切り出す事ができるので、主なアプリケーションをシンプルにできます。場合によっては、ロジックを洗煉させて、変更イベントの中にある更新後のデータを利用して関係のあるキャッシュエントリーを更新しておくこともできます。\n\n### モノリシックアプリケーションをシンプルに\n\n多くのアプリケーションは、データベースを更新してコミットした後に追加の作業を実行します: 検索 Index を更新する、キャッシュをアップデートする、通知を送る、ビジネスロジックを実行する、などです。アプリケーションが単一のトランザクションの枠を越えて複数のシステムに書き込みを行う事から、これらはよく『デュアルライト (dual-writes)』と呼ばれます。アプリケーションのロジックを複雑にして変更を難しくする以外にも、デュアルライトには問題点があります。それは、アプリケーションが一部のデータだけをコミットして残りの更新中にクラッシュした場合に、データを失ったりシステムが全体として不整合になるリスクがあることです。変更データキャプチャを利用することで、これら他の処理はオリジナルのデータベースでコミットされた後に、別のスレッドや別のプロセス・サービスで実行することができます。このアプローチは耐障害性に優れており、イベントを失う事無く、スケーラブルで、アップグレードや運用オペレーションを簡単にサポートできます。\n\n### データベースの共有\n\n複数のアプリケーションが1つのデータベースを共有する場合に、あるアプリケーションが他のアプリケーションによってコミットされた変更を知るのは容易ではありません。1つのアプローチはメッセージバスを使うことですが、トランザクションの範囲外にあるメッセージバスは先ほど触れたデュアルライトと同じ問題に行き当たります。しかし、 Debezium を使えばこの問題は非常に簡単に解決します、それぞれのアプリケーションはデータベースの変更を監視してイベントに反応することができます。\n\n### データの統合\n\nデータは複数の場所に保存されることが多く、特にそれぞれが異なる目的・少し異なる形態で保存されていることもあります。複数のシステムを同期するのは難しいことですが、単純な ETL に基づいた解決策は Debezium と簡単なイベント処理ロジックで素早く実装する事ができます。\n\n### コマンドクエリ責任分離\n\nコマンドクエリ責任分離 ([Command Query Responsibility Separation; CQRS](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html)) はデータの更新と読み取りに異なるデータモデルを利用するアーキテクチャパターンです。変更は更新側で記録された後、様々な読み取り表現を更新するのに活用されることになります。結果として、特に信頼性と処理の順序を保つ必要がある場合において、 CQRS アプリケーションはより複雑になります。Debezium と変更データキャプチャはこの問題を解決してくれます：書き込みを通常通り保存するだけで、Debezium が変更を失われないように、順序付けされたストリームとしてキャプチャするので、コンシューマはこれを非同期に読み取って読み取り専用ビューの更新に使う事ができます。書き込み側のテーブル上でドメイン指向のエンティティを表現することもできますし、 CQRS が [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) と共に使われる場合、書き込み側のテーブルはコマンドの追記専用のログであったりします。\n\n## Debezium をビルドするには\n\nDebezium のコードベースでを編集・ビルドする為には以下に示すソフトウェアが必要です。\n\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com) 2.2.1 or later\n* JDK 11 or later, e.g. [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/)\n* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) 3.9.8\n* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) 1.9 or later\n\nインストール手順については上記のリンクを参照して下さい。インストールされているバージョンを確認する為には以下のコマンドを実行します:\n\n    $ git --version\n    $ javac -version\n    $ mvn -version\n    $ docker --version\n\n### Docker が必要な理由\n\n多くのオープンソースソフトウェアプロジェクトが Git, Java そして Maven を必須としていますが、Docker が必要なのは一般的ではありません。これには理由があります。Debezium は様々な種類のデータベースソフトウェアやサービスといった、多くの外部システムと連携して動くソフトウェアで、結合テストはこれが正しく動くことを確認します。しかしこれらのシステムがローカルにインストールされている事を期待するのではなく、Debezium のビルドシステムは Docker を使って自動的に必要なイメージをダウンロードまたは作成して、コンテナをスタートします。結合テストで Debezium の挙動が期待通りかを確認したら、Debezium のビルドシステムはテスト終了後にコンテナを自動的に終了します。\n\nまた、Debezium はいくつかの Java 以外の言語で書かれたモジュールも持っていて、それらをビルドするのにはターゲットとなるOSが必要になります。Docker を使う事で、ビルドはこれらの OS のイメージと必要な開発ツールを使うことができます。\n\nDocker の利用にはいくつもの利点があります\n\n1. 外部サービスの特定のバージョンをインストール・設定・実行する手間が省けます。もしローカルにインストールされているバージョンがあっても、Debezium のビルドはそれを利用しません。\n1. 外部サービスの複数のバージョンをテストすることができます。それぞれのモジュールは必要な時にいつでも起動する事ができて、異なるモジュールが別々のバージョンを必要としても問題ありません。\n1. 全てのユーザーが完全なビルドをローカルで実行できます。必要な外部サービスを全てインストールしたリモートの CI サーバーに頼る必要がありません。\n1. 全てのビルドが一貫性のある状態になります。複数の開発者が同じコードをビルドしたときに同じ結果が得られるということです（同じ JDK, Maven そして Docker バージョンを使う限り）。コンテナは同じOS上で同じバージョンのサービスを実行しているためです。すべてのテストは、コンテナ内で稼働しているシステムに接続するように設計されており、接続プロパティやローカル環境に特有のカスタム構成をいじる必要はありません。\n1. サービスがデータを変更・保存した場合にも、サーバーをクリーンアップする必要がありません。Docker *image* はキャッシュされ、コンテナの起動を高速化するために再利用されます。しかし、Docker *containers* が再利用される事は無く、常に初期状態で起動して、終了時に破棄されます。結合テストはコンテナに依存しているため、初期化は自動的に行われているのです。\n\n\n### Docker 環境のセットアップ\n\nDocker Maven Plugin は Docker host を以下の環境変数を探す事によって解決します。\n\n    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://10.1.2.2:2376\n    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cdk/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/.docker\n    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\n\nこれらは Docker Machine や同種の何かを利用している場合には自動的に設定されています。\n\n### コードのビルド\n\nまずは Git repository を clone してコードを取得します\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/debezium/debezium.git\n    $ cd debezium\n\nビルドには Maven を利用します\n\n    $ mvn clean verify\n\nこのビルドは異なるデータベースソフトウェアのためにいくつかの Docker container を開始します。Docker が起動していない・設定されていない場合、恐らく難解なエラーが表示されます —— そのような場合は、常にDockerが起動していることを確認してください。 \n\n### ビルドのために Docker を実行したくない場合\n\n結合テストや Docker build は以下のコマンドでスキップできます。\n\n    $ mvn clean verify -DskipITs\n\n### テストや CheckStyle を行わずに成果物だけをビルドする\n\n`quick` ビルドプロファイルを利用する事で、必須ではない plugin (tests, integration tests, CheckStyle, formatter, API compatibility check, etc.) をスキップすることができます\n\n    $ mvn clean verify -Dquick\n\nこれは、品質保証に関連した Maven plugin の実行せずに、ビルド結果だけを生成する一番速い方法です。これは connector JAR やアーカイブをできるだけ速く出力したい場合に便利です。特に、Kafka Connect を手動テストする場合などに利用できます。\n\n### 論理デコードプラグインとして、wal2json または pgoutput を利用して Postgres connector をテストする  \n\nPostgres connector は、データベースの変更ストリームを論理デコードする3つの異なるプラグインをサポートしています： decoderbufs （デフォルト）, wal2json, および pgoutput です。Postgres connector を wal2json を使ってテストしたい場合、\"wal2json-decoder\" ビルドプロファイルを指定します。 \n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl :debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder\n\npgoutput を利用してテストするには、 \"pgoutput-decoder\" と \"postgres-10\" ビルドプロファイルを有効にします:\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl :debezium-connector-postgres -Ppgoutput-decoder,postgres-10\n\nいくつかのテストは、wal2json プラグインを利用した場合パスしません。そのようなクラスは `io.debezium.connector.postgresql.DecoderDifferences` クラスへの参照から見つける事ができます。\n\n### 特定の Apicurio バージョンで Postgres connector をテストする\n\nwal2json または pgoutput 論理デコードプラグインを使う場合、Apicurio のバージョンを選択する事ができます:\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder \n          -Ddebezium.test.apicurio.version=1.3.1.Final\n\nこのプロパティが存在しない場合、安定バージョンの Apicurio が利用されます\n\n### 外部データベースを利用して Postgres connector をテストする（例：Amazon RDS）\n\n*RDS ではない* cluster に対してテストを実行したい場合、テストのユーザー名 (`<your user>`)として `replication` 権限だけでなく `pg_hba.conf` で全てのデータベースにログインできる権限を持ったスーパーユーザーを指定する必要があります。また、いくつかのテストのために、サーバー上で `postgis` パッケージが必要です。\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder \\\n         -Ddocker.skip.build=true -Ddocker.skip.run=true -Dpostgres.host=<your PG host> \\\n         -Dpostgres.user=<your user> -Dpostgres.password=<your password> \\\n         -Ddebezium.test.records.waittime=10\n\n必要に応じてタイムアウト値も調整してください。\n\nRDS データベースを設定してテストする方法ついて詳しくは [PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS](debezium-connector-postgres/RDS.md) をご覧下さい。\n\n\n### Oracle XStream を利用して Oracle connector をテストする\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-oracle -Poracle-xstream,oracle-tests -Dinstantclient.dir=<path-to-instantclient>\n\n### non-CDB データベースで Oracle connector をテストする\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-oracle -Poracle-tests -Dinstantclient.dir=<path-to-instantclient> -Ddatabase.pdb.name=\n\n## Contributing\n\nDebezium コミュニティは、問題の報告、文書作成の支援、バグ修正、テストの追加、新機能の実装のためのコード変更の貢献など、全ての形の支援を歓迎します。詳細は [CONTRIBUTE.md](CONTRIBUTE.md)

Debezium은 모든 변경 이벤트에 대한 단일 모델을 제공하기에 여러 종류의 데이터베이스 관리의 복잡성에 대해서 고민할 필요가 없습니다. 추가로, Debezium은 데이터 변경 내역을 영구적으로 보관하는 복제 로그에 기록하기 때문에 애플리케이션을 언제든지 재시작해도 중지된 기간 동안 누락된 모든 이벤트를 완벽하게 처리합니다.\n\n데이터가 변경되는 것에 대해  알림을 받거나 모니터링하는 것은 복잡하고 어렵습니다. 관계형 데이터베이스의 트리거 기능을 활용할 수도 있지만, 데이터베이스마다 다르고 간혹 동일 데이터베이스내의 업데이트 상태로 제한됩니다.(외부 프로세스와 통신하지 않음) 특정 데이터베이스는 변경 사항 모니터링을 위한 API나 프레임워크를 제공하지만, 표준이 없기 때문에 각 데이터베이스마다 접근 방식이 다르고 각각 다른 코드가 필요합니다. 따라서 데이터베이스에 미치는 영향을 최소화하면서 모든 변경 사항을 동일한 순서로 확인하고 처리한다는 것은 매우 어려운 일입니다.\n\nDebezium은 위 작업을 수행하는 모듈을 제공합니다. 일부 모듈은 여러 데이터베이스 관리 시스템과 함께 작동되지만 기능 및 성능 관점에서 제한적입니다. 다른 모듈은 특정 데이터베이스 관리 시스템에 맞게 최적화되어 훨씬 더 성능이 뛰어나고 시스템의 특정 기능을 활용하는 경우가 많습니다.\n\n## 기본 아키텍처\n\nDebezium은 Kafka 및 Kafka Connect를 재사용하여 내구성, 안정성 및 내결함성 품질을 달성하는 CDC(Change Data Capture) 플랫폼입니다.\n\n확장 가능한 분산형 내결함성 서비스에 배포된 각 커넥터는 단일 업스트림 데이터베이스 서버를 모니터링하여 모든 변경 사항을 캡쳐하고 하나 이상의 Kafka 토픽(일반적으로 데이터베이스 테이블당 하나의 토픽)에 기록합니다. Kafka는 모든 데이터 변경 이벤트가 복제되고 완전히 정렬되도록 보장하며, 많은 클라이언트가 업스트림 시스템에 거의 영향을 주지 않고 데이터 변경 이벤트를 독립적으로 사용할 수 있도록 지원합니다.\n\n또한, 클라이언트는 언제든지 소비(Consuming)를 중단할 수 있고 다시 시작하면 중단했던 위치에서 다시 시작됩니다. 각 클라이언트는 모든 데이터 변경 이벤트를 정확히 한 번 전송(exactly-once)할지 아니면 최소한 한 번 전송(at-least-once)할지 결정할 수 있으며, 각 데이터베이스/테이블의 모든 데이터 변경 이벤트는 데이터베이스에서 보낸 것과 동일한 순서로 전달됩니다.\n\nKafka를 통한 내결함성, 성능, 확장성 및 안정성이 필요하지 않거나 커넥터가 직접 애플리케이션으로 전송하는 것을 원한다면, 애플리케이션 내부에서 Debezium 임베디드 커넥터 엔진을 사용하여 직접 커넥터를 실행할 수 있습니다.\n\n## 일반적인 활용 사례\n\nDebezium을 유용하게 활용할 수 있는 여러 시나리오가 있지만, 여기서는 일반적인 몇 가지 시나리오에 대해서 간략히 설명합니다.\n\n### 캐시 무효화\n\n레코드가 변경되거나 제거되면 즉시 캐시를 자동으로 무효화합니다. 캐시가 분리된 프로세스(Redis, Memcache, Infinispan등)에서 실행 중인 경우에는 캐시 무효화 로직을 배치하여 해결할 수 있습니다. 경우에 따라 변경된 이벤트의 업데이트된 데이터를 사용하여 캐시 항목을 업데이트할 수 있습니다.\n\n### 모놀리식 애플리케이션 단순화\n\n많은 애플리케이션이 데이터베이스에 변경 사항이 커밋된 후 검색 인덱스 업데이트, 캐시 업데이트, 알림 전송, 비즈니스 로직 실행등과 같은 추가 작업을 수행합니다. 단일 트랙잭션을 위해 외부의 여러 시스템에도 업데이트하기 때문에 이런 행위를  `이중 쓰기`라고 부릅니다. 커밋 후 다른 모든 업데이트가 수행되기 전에 충돌이 발생할 경우 이중 쓰기는 데이터를 손실하거나 다른 시스템의 일관성을 유지하지 못할 위험이 있습니다. 그리고 이런 상황에 대처하기 위해 애플리케이션 로직이 복잡하게되기에 유지보수가 어렵게 됩니다.\n\nCDC(Change Data Capture)를 사용하면 데이터가 오리지널 데이터베이스에서 커밋될 때 별도의 스레드 또는 프로세스/서비스에서 작업을 수행할 수 있습니다. 이 접근 방식은 장애를 더 잘 견디고, 이벤트를 놓치지 않으며, 확장성이 뛰어나고, 업그레이드 및 운영을 보다 쉽게 지원합니다.\n\n### 데이터베이스 공유\n\n여러 애플리케이션이 단일 데이터베이스를 공유하는 경우, 하나의 애플리케이션이 다른 애플리케이션에서 커밋한 변경 사항을 인식하는 것이 필요한 사항이 발생합니다. 한가지 접근법은 메시지 버스를 사용하는 것이지만, `이중 쓰기`의 문제에서 자유롭지 못합니다. Debezium을 사용하면 각 애플리케이션이 데이터베이스를 모니터링하고 변경사항에 대응하는 것이 매우 간단해집니다.\n\n### 데이터 통합\n\n데이터는 다른 용도로 사용되는 경우가 있으며, 형태가 다를 경우 여러 위치에 저장되는 경우가 많습니다. 여러 시스템을 동기화 상태로 유지하는 것은 어려울 수 있지만 Debezium을 이용하면 간단하게 이벤트 처리 로직을 빠르게 구현할 수 있습니다.\n\n### CQRS\n\n[Command Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS)](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) 아키텍처 패턴은 업데이트를 위해 하나의 데이터 모델을 사용하고 데이터를 읽기 위해 하나 이상의 데이터 모델을 사용합니다. 일반적으로 CQRS을 이용해 애플리케이션을 구현하는 것은 복잡하며 특히, 신뢰할 수 있고 완전히 정렬된 처리를 보장해야 할 경우 더욱 복잡해집니다. 하지만 Debezium을 사용하면 더 쉽게 처리할 수 있습니다. 쓰기쪽은 정상적으로 기록하고 읽기는 Debezium을 통해 비동기 방식으로 업데이트하도록 하여 변경 사항을 캡처합니다. 쓰기쪽 테이블은 도메인 지향 엔티티를 나타낼 수 있으며, CQRS [이벤트 소싱](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)과 쌍을 이루는 경우 쓰기쪽 테이블은 명령 전용 추가 이벤트 로그가 됩니다.\n\n## Debezium 빌드 하기\n\n아래의 소프트웨어는 로컬에서 Debezium을 빌드하기 위해 필요합니다.\n\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com) 2.2.1 버전 이상\n* JDK 17 버전 이상, 예) [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/)\n* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) 또는 [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) 1.9 버전 이상\n* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) 3.9.8 버전 이상  \n  (or invoke the wrapper with `./mvnw` for Maven commands)\n\n각 소프트웨어를 설치하기 위해서는 위의 링크의 지침을 확인하세요. 아래의 명령어를 통해 설치되었는지 확인할 수 있습니다.\n\n    $ git --version\n    $ javac -version\n    $ mvn -version\n    $ docker --version\n\n### 왜 도커인가?\n\n많은 오픈 소스 프로젝트에서 Git, Java 및 Maven을 사용하지만 도커를 요구하는 것은 일반적이지 않습니다. Debezium은 다양한 데이터베이스 및 여러 외부 시스템과 통신하도록 설계되었으며, 통합 테스트를 통해 Debezium이 올바르게 작동되는지 확인합니다. 테스트를 위해 필요한 모든 소프트웨어 시스템이 로컬에 설치되어 있을 것으로 예상하는 대신 Debezium의 빌드 시스템은 도커를 사용하여 필요한 이미지를 자동으로 다운로드 하거나 생성하고 각 시스템에 대한 컨테이너를 동작 시킵니다. 이를 기반으로 통합 테스트를 통해 Debezium이 예상대로 작동하는지 확인할 수 있으며 통합 테스트가 완료되면 Debezium의 빌드 스크립트가 구동중인 모든 컨테이너를 자동으로 중지합니다.\n\n또한 Debezium에는 Java로 작성되지 않은 몇 개의 모듈이 있기에 특정 OS가 필요합니다. 도커를 사용하면 특정 OS와 필요한 모든 개발 도구가 포함된 이미지를 사용하여 빌드를 수행할 수 있습니다.\n \n도커를 사용하면 다음과 같은 이점이 있습니다.\n1. 각 외부 서비스의 특정 버전을 로컬 컴퓨터에 설치, 구성하여 실행할 필요가 없으며 로컬 네트워크에서 해당 서비스에 접근할 필요가 없기에 Debezium에서는 도커를 이용합니다.\n1. 여러 버전의 외부 서비스를 테스트할 수 있습니다. 각 모듈은 필요한 모든 컨테이너를 시작할 수 있기에 서로 다른 모듈이 서로 다른 버전의 서비스를 쉽게 사용할 수 있게 됩니다.\n1. 모든 사용자가 로컬에서 전체 빌드를 실행할 수 있습니다. 설정된 환경에서 빌드를 실행하는 원격 CI 서버에 의존할 필요가 없습니다.\n1. 모든 빌드가 동일하게 동작됩니다. 여러 개발자가 동일한 코드를 빌드할 경우 JDK, Maven 및 Docker 버전을 동일하게 사용하면 동일한 결과를 볼 수 있습니다. 이는 컨테이너가 동일한 운영체제에서 동일한 버전의 서비스를 실행하기 때문입니다. 또한 모든 테스트는 컨테이너에서 실행중인 시스템에 연결하도록 설계되었기에 자신의 로컬 환경과 연관된 설정 및 구성을 수정할 필요가 없습니다.\n1. 서비스에 의해 데이터가 수정되고 로컬에 저장되더라도 서비스를 초기화 할 필요가 없습니다. 도커 이미지는 캐시되기에 다시 빠르게 작업할 수 있습니다. 하지만 도커 컨테이너는 재사용되지 않습니다. 도커 컨테이너는 항상 초기 상태로 시작되며 종료시 삭제됩니다. 통합 테스트는 컨테이너에 의존하기에 항상 자동으로 초기화됩니다.\n\n### 도커 환경 구성\n\n도커 메이븐 플러그인은 아래의 변수를 사용하여 도커 호스트를 확인합니다.\n\n    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://10.1.2.2:2376\n    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cdk/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/.docker\n    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\n\n도커 머신 및 유사한 것을 사용하는 경우 자동으로 설정할 수 있습니다.\n\n### 코드 작성\n\nGit 리포지토리를 복제하여 코드를 가져옵니다.\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/debezium/debezium.git\n    $ cd debezium\n\n그 후 메이븐을 사용하여 코드를 빌드합니다.\n\n    $ mvn clean verify\n\n빌드시 다양한 DBMS에 대해 여러 개의 도커 컨테이너를 사용합니다. 도커가 실행중이 아니거나 구성되지 않은 경우에는 오류가 발생할 수 있습니다. 이 경우 도커가 실행중인지 확인해야 합니다. `docker ps` 명령어를 사용하여 도커가 실행중인지 확인하세요.\n\n### 로컬에서 도커를 사용하여 빌드를 하지 않습니까?\n\n아래의 명령어를 사용하여 통합 테스트 및 도커 빌드를 건너뛸 수 있습니다.\n\n    $ mvn clean verify -DskipITs\n\n### 테스트, 체크스타일 및 기타 작업을 수행하지 않고 아티팩트만 빌드\n\n“quick” 빌드 프로파일을 사용하여 필수가 아닌 모든 플러그인(테스트, 통합 테스트, 체크스타일, 포맷터, API 호환성 검사등)을 건너뛸 수 있습니다.\n\n    $ mvn clean verify -Dquick\n\n위의 옵션을 사용하면 QA관련 메이븐 플러그인을 실행하지 않고 아웃푹 아티팩트만 빠르게 생성할 수 있습니다. 이 기능은 커넥터 JAR 및 아카이브를 빨리 생성할 때 매우 유용합니다. (예: 카프카 커넥터를 수동 테스트 할 경우)\n\n### wal2json 또는 pgoutput 논리 디코딩 플러그인을 사용하여 Postgres 커넥터 테스트 수행\n\nPostgres 커넥터는 DB서버에서 커넥터로 변경 사항을 스트리밍하기 위한 세 가지 논리 디코딩 플러그인(decoderbufs(디폴트), wal2json, pgoutput)을 지원합니다. wal2json을 사용하여 PG 커넥터의 통합 테스트를 수행하려면 `wal2json-decoder` 빌드 프로파일을 사용합니다.\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl :debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder\n    \npgoutput을 사용하여 PG 커넥터의 통합 테스트를 수행하려면 `pgoutput-decoder` 및 `postgres-10` 빌드 프로파일을 활성화 해야 합니다.\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl :debezium-connector-postgres -Ppgoutput-decoder,postgres-10\n\nwal2json 플러그인을 사용할 때 현재 일부 테스트를 통과하지 못합니다.\n\n이런 부분에 대해서는 `io.debezium.connector.postgresql.DecoderDifferences`에 정의된 유형에 대해 참조하세요.\n\n### 특정 Apicurio 버전으로 Postgres 커넥터 테스트 수행\n\n특정 버전의 Apicurio에서 wal2json 또는 pgoutput 논리 디코딩 플러그인을 사용하여 PG 커넥터 테스트를 수행하려면 테스트 속성을 아래와 같이 전달 해야 합니다.\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder \n          -Ddebezium.test.apicurio.version=1.3.1.Final\n\n속성이 없으면 안정적인 버전의 Apicurio를 가져옵니다.\n\n### 외부 데이터베이스에 대한 Postgres 커넥터 수행 (예: Amazon RDS)\n\nRDS 클러스터를 사용하지 않은 상황에 대해 테스트하려면 해당 유저가 복제뿐만 아니라 `pg_hda.conf`의 모든 데이터베이스에 로그인할 수 있는 권한을 가진 슈퍼유저여야 합니다. 또한 대상 서버에서 postgis 패키지를 사용할 수 있어야 테스트를 수행할 수 있습니다.\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder \\\n         -Ddocker.skip.build=true -Ddocker.skip.run=true -Dpostgres.host=<your PG host> \\\n         -Dpostgres.user=<your user> -Dpostgres.password=<your password> \\\n         -Ddebezium.test.records.waittime=10\n\n필요에 따라 타임아웃 값을 조정합니다.\n테스트할 RDS 데이터베이스 설정에 대한 자세한 내용은 [PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS](debezium-connector-postgres/RDS.md)를 참고하세요.\n\n### 오라클 XStream을 사용하여 오라클 커넥터 테스트 수행\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-oracle -Poracle,xstream -Dinstantclient.dir=<path-to-instantclient>\n\n### non-CDB 데이터베이스에서 오라클 커넥터 테스트 수행\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-oracle -Poracle -Dinstantclient.dir=<path-to-instantclient> -Ddatabase.pdb.name=\n\n### IDE에서 몽고DB oplog 캡처를 사용하여 몽고DB 테스트 수행\n\n메이븐 없이 테스트를 실행할 때는 올바른 매개 변수를 전달했는지 확인해야 합니다. `.github/workflows/mongodb-oplog-workflow.yml`에서 올바른 매개 변수를 찾아서 JVM 실행 매개 변수에 추가하고 `debezium.test`를 접두사로 추가한 후, 몽고DB 커넥터 디렉토리에서 수동으로 몽고DB 컨테이너를 시작해야 합니다\n\n    $ mvn docker:start -B -am -Passembly -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -Dformat.skip=true -Drevapi.skip -Dcapture.mode=oplog -Dversion.mongo.server=3.6 -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.cli.transfer.Slf4jMavenTransferListener=warn -Dmaven.wagon.http.pool=false -Dmaven.wagon.httpconnectionManager.ttlSeconds=120 -Dcapture.mode=oplog -Dmongo.server=3.6\n\n해당 부분은 아래의 명령어와 유사합니다.\n\n    java -ea -Ddebezium.test.capture.mode=oplog -Ddebezium.test.version.mongo.server=3.6 -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dconnector.mongodb.members.auto.discover=false -Dconnector.mongodb.name=mongo1 -DskipLongRunningTests=true [...]\n\n## 기여 하기\n\nDebezium 커뮤니티는 문제점 보고, 문서 지원, 버그 수정, 테스트 또는 새로운 기능 구현을 위한 코드 변경등 어떤 방식으로든 도움을 주고 싶어하는 모든 사람을 환영합니다. 자세한 내용은 이 [문서](CONTRIBUTE.md)를 참조하세요.\n \n모든 Debezium 기여자에게 큰 감사를 드립니다!\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/debezium/debezium/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contributors-img.web.app/image?repo=debezium/debezium\" />\n</a>\n"

capture,CDC)提供了一个低延迟的流式处理平台。你可以安装并且配置Debezium去监控你的数据库，然后你的应用就可以消费对数据库的每一个行级别(row-level)的更改。只有已提交的更改才是可见的，所以你的应用不用担心事务(transaction)或者更改被回滚(roll back)。Debezium为所有的数据库更改事件提供了一个统一的模型，所以你的应用不用担心每一种数据库管理系统的错综复杂性。另外，由于Debezium用持久化的、有副本备份的日志来记录数据库数据变化的历史，因此，你的应用可以随时停止再重启，而不会错过它停止运行时发生的事件，保证了所有的事件都能被正确地、完全地处理掉。\n\n监控数据库，并且在数据变动的时候获得通知一直是很复杂的事情。关系型数据库的触发器可以做到，但是只对特定的数据库有效，而且通常只能更新数据库内的状态(无法和外部的进程通信)。一些数据库提供了监控数据变动的API或者框架，但是没有一个标准，每种数据库的实现方式都是不同的，并且需要大量特定的知识和理解特定的代码才能运用。确保以相同的顺序查看和处理所有更改，同时最小化影响数据库仍然非常具有挑战性。\n\nDebezium提供了模块为你做这些复杂的工作。一些模块是通用的，并且能够适用多种数据库管理系统，但在功能和性能方面仍有一些限制。另一些模块是为特定的数据库管理系统定制的，所以他们通常可以更多地利用数据库系统本身的特性来提供更多功能。\n\n## Debezium基础架构\n\nDebezium是一个捕获数据更改(CDC)平台，并且利用Kafka和Kafka Connect实现了自己的持久性、可靠性和容错性。每一个部署在Kafka Connect分布式的、可扩展的、容错性的服务中的connector监控一个上游数据库服务器，捕获所有的数据库更改，然后记录到一个或者多个Kafka topic(通常一个数据库表对应一个kafka topic)。Kafka确保所有这些数据更改事件都能够多副本并且总体上有序(Kafka只能保证一个topic的单个分区内有序)，这样，更多的客户端可以独立消费同样的数据更改事件而对上游数据库系统造成的影响降到很小(如果N个应用都直接去监控数据库更改，对数据库的压力为N，而用debezium汇报数据库更改事件到kafka，所有的应用都去消费kafka中的消息，可以把对数据库的压力降到1)。另外，客户端可以随时停止消费，然后重启，从上次停止消费的地方接着消费。每个客户端可以自行决定他们是否需要exactly-once或者at-least-once消息交付语义保证，并且所有的数据库或者表的更改事件是按照上游数据库发生的顺序被交付的。\n \n对于不需要或者不想要这种容错级别、性能、可扩展性、可靠性的应用，他们可以使用内嵌的Debezium connector引擎来直接在应用内部运行connector。这种应用仍需要消费数据库更改事件，但更希望connector直接传递给它，而不是持久化到Kafka里。\n## 常见使用场景\n\nDebezium有很多非常有价值的使用场景，我们在这儿仅仅列出几个更常见的使用场景。\n\n### 缓存失效(Cache invalidation)\n\n在缓存中缓存的条目(entry)在源头被更改或者被删除的时候立即让缓存中的条目失效。如果缓存在一个独立的进程中运行(例如Redis，Memcache，Infinispan或者其他的)，那么简单的缓存失效逻辑可以放在独立的进程或服务中，从而简化主应用的逻辑。在一些场景中，缓存失效逻辑可以更复杂一点，让它利用更改事件中的更新数据去更新缓存中受影响的条目。\n### 简化单体应用(Simplifying monolithic applications)\n\n许多应用更新数据库，然后在数据库中的更改被提交后，做一些额外的工作：更新搜索索引，更新缓存，发送通知，运行业务逻辑，等等。这种情况通常称为双写(dual-writes)，因为应用没有在一个事务内写多个系统。这样不仅应用逻辑复杂难以维护，而且双写容易丢失数据或者在一些系统更新成功而另一些系统没有更新成功的时候造成不同系统之间的状态不一致。使用捕获更改数据技术(change data capture,CDC)，在源数据库的数据更改提交后，这些额外的工作可以被放在独立的线程或者进程(服务)中完成。这种实现方式的容错性更好，不会丢失事件，容易扩展，并且更容易支持升级。\n\n### 共享数据库(Sharing databases)\n\n 当多个应用共用同一个数据库的时候，一个应用提交的更改通常要被另一个应用感知到。一种实现方式是使用消息总线，尽管非事务性(non-transactional)的消息总线总会受上面提到的双写(dual-writes)影响。但是，另一种实现方式，即Debezium，变得很直接：每个应用可以直接监控数据库的更改，并且响应更改。\n\n### 数据集成(Data integration)\n\n数据通常被存储在多个地方，尤其是当数据被用于不同的目的的时候，会有不同的形式。保持多系统的同步是很有挑战性的，但是可以通过使用Debezium加上简单的事件处理逻辑来实现简单的ETL类型的解决方案。\n\n### 命令查询职责分离(CQRS)\n\n在命令查询职责分离 [Command Query Responsibility Separation (CQRS)](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) 架构模式中，更新数据使用了一种数据模型，读数据使用了一种或者多种数据模型。由于数据更改被记录在更新侧(update-side)，这些更改将被处理以更新各种读展示。所以CQRS应用通常更复杂，尤其是他们需要保证可靠性和全序(totally-ordered)处理。Debezium和CDC可以使这种方式更可行：写操作被正常记录，但是Debezium捕获数据更改，并且持久化到全序流里，然后供那些需要异步更新只读视图的服务消费。写侧(write-side)表可以表示面向领域的实体(domain-oriented entities)，或者当CQRS和 [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html) 结合的时候，写侧表仅仅用做追加操作命令事件的日志。\n\n## Building Debezium\n\n使用Debezium代码库并在本地配置它需要以下软件：\n\n* [Git](https://git-scm.com) 2.2.1 or later\n* JDK 17 or later, e.g. [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/)\n* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) 3.9.8\n* [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) 1.9 or later\n\n有关平台上的安装说明，请参阅上面的链接。您可以通过以下指令查看安装版本\n\n    $ git --version\n    $ javac -version\n    $ mvn -version\n    $ docker --version\n\n### 为什么选用 Docker?\n\n许多开源软件项目使用Git、Java和Maven，但需要Docker的情况不太常见。Debezium被设计用来与许多外部系统进行通信，比如各种数据库和服务，我们的集成测试验证了Debezium成功地做到了这一点。但Debezium的构建系统使用Docker自动下载或创建必要的镜像，并为每个系统启动容器，而不是期望您在本地安装所有这些软件系统。然后，集成测试可以使用这些服务并验证Debezium的行为是否符合预期，当集成测试完成时，Debezium将自动停止它启动的所有容器.\n\nDebezium还有一些不是用Java编写的模块，而且这些模块在目标操作系统上是必须的。通过Docker，我们可以使用带有目标操作系统以及所有必要开发工具的镜像来构建它们。\n\n使用Docker有几个优点：\n\n\n1. 不需要在本地计算机上安装、配置和运行每个所依赖的外部服务的特定版本，也不必在本地网络上访问它们。即使配置了，Debezium也不会用到它们。\n2. 我们可以测试外部服务的多个版本。每个模块可以启动它需要的任何容器，因此不同的模块可以轻松地使用不同版本的服务。\n3. 每个人都可以在本地运行完整的构建。 不必依赖安装了所有必需服务的远程CI服务器来运行构建。\n4. 所有构建都是一致的。当多个开发人员各自构建相同的代码库时，他们应该看到完全相同的结果——只要他们使用相同或等效的JDK、Maven和Docker版本。 这是因为容器将在相同的操作系统上运行相同版本的服务。另外，所有的测试都被设计为连接运行在容器中的系统，因此没有人需要修改连接属性或特定于其本地环境的自定义配置。\n5. 不需要清理服务, 即使这些服务在本地修改和存储数据. Docker *镜像* 是可缓存的, 重用镜像可以快速启动容器并保持一致性, 但是Docker *容器* 永远不会被重用：它们总是在初始状态下启动，在关闭时丢弃。集成测试依赖容器，因此会自动清理容器。\n\n### 配置Docker环境\n\nDocker Maven插件通过检查以下环境变量来解析Docker主机：\n\n    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://10.1.2.2:2376\n    export DOCKER_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cdk/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/.docker\n    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1\n\n使用Docker Machine或类似软件时会自动设置这些环境变量。\n### 项目编译\n\n首先从Git仓库获取代码：\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/debezium/debezium.git\n    $ cd debezium\n\n然后用maven构建项目\n\n    $ mvn clean install\n\n这行命令会启动构建，并为不同的dbms使用不同的Docker容器。注意，如果未运行或未配置Docker，可能会出现奇怪的错误——如果遇到这种情况，一定要检查Docker是否正在运行，比如可以使用`Docker ps`列出运行中的容器。\n\n### 本地没有Docker?\n\n可以使用以下命令跳过集成测试和docker的构建：\n\n    $ mvn clean install -DskipITs\n\n### 仅构建工件（artifacts），不运行测试、代码风格检查等其他插件\n\n可以使用“quick“构建选项来跳过所有非必须的插件，例如测试、集成测试、代码风格检查、格式化、API兼容性检查等：\n\n    $ mvn clean verify -Dquick\n\n这行命令是构建工件（artifacts）最快的方法，但它不会运行任何与质量保证（QA）相关的Maven插件。这在需要尽快构建connector jar包、归档时可以派上用场，比如需要在Kafka Connect中进行手动测试。\n\n### 使用wal2json或 pgoutput logical decoding plug-ins 运行Postgres connector的测试\n\nPostgres connector支持三个用于从数据库服务器捕获流式数据更改的逻辑解码插件：decoderbufs（默认）、wal2json以及pgoutput。运行PG connector的集成测试时，如果要使用wal2json，需要启用“wal2json decoder”构建配置：\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl :debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder\n    \n要使用pgoutput，需要启用“pgoutput decoder”和“postgres-10”构建配置：\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl :debezium-connector-postgres -Ppgoutput-decoder,postgres-10\n\n在使用wal2json插件时，一些测试目前无法通过。 通过查找`io.debezium.connector.postgresql.DecoderDifferences`中定义的类型的引用，可以找到这些测试。\n\n### 使用指定Apicurio版本运行Postgres connector测试\n\n如果要使用带有指定版本Apicurio的wal2json或pgoutput逻辑解码插件运行PG connector测试，可以像这样传递测试参数：\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder -Ddebezium.test.apicurio.version=1.3.1.Final\n\n如果没有设置该参数，将自动获取并设置该参数为Apicurio的稳定版本。\n\n### 对外部数据库运行Postgres connector测试, 例如：Amazon RDS\n如果要对非RDS集群进行测试，请注意`<your user>`必须是超级用户，不仅要具有`复制`权限，还要有登录`pg_hba.conf`中`所有`数据库的权限。还要求目标服务器上必须有`postgis`包，才能通过某些测试。\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-postgres -Pwal2json-decoder \\\n         -Ddocker.skip.build=true -Ddocker.skip.run=true -Dpostgres.host=<your PG host> \\\n         -Dpostgres.user=<your user> -Dpostgres.password=<your password> \\\n         -Ddebezium.test.records.waittime=10\n\n超时时间可以根据需要进行调整。\n\n有关在RDS上设置要测试的数据库的详细信息，请参阅 [PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS](debezium-connector-postgres/RDS.md) \n\n### 使用Oracle XStream运行Oracle connector测试\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-oracle -Poracle-xstream,oracle-tests -Dinstantclient.dir=<path-to-instantclient>\n\n### 使用非CDB数据库运行Oracle connector测试\n\n    $ mvn clean install -pl debezium-connector-oracle -Poracle-tests -Dinstantclient.dir=<path-to-instantclient> -Ddatabase.pdb.name=\n\n### 使用IDE中的oplog捕获运行MongoDB测试\n\n不使用maven运行测试时，需要确保传递了正确的执行参数。可以在`.github/workflows/mongodb-oplog-workflow.yml`中查正确参数，添加`debezium.test`前缀后，再将这些参数添加到JVM执行参数之后。由于测试运行在Maven生命周期之外，还需要手动启动MongoDB connector目录下的MongoDB镜像:\n\n    $ mvn docker:start -B -am -Passembly -Dcheckstyle.skip=true -Dformat.skip=true -Drevapi.skip -Dcapture.mode=oplog -Dversion.mongo.server=3.6 -Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.log.org.apache.maven.cli.transfer.Slf4jMavenTransferListener=warn -Dmaven.wagon.http.pool=false -Dmaven.wagon.httpconnectionManager.ttlSeconds=120 -Dcapture.mode=oplog -Dmongo.server=3.6\n\n执行测试命令行的相关部分应该如下：\n\n    java -ea -Ddebezium.test.capture.mode=oplog -Ddebezium.test.version.mongo.server=3.6 -Djava.awt.headless=true -Dconnector.mongodb.members.auto.discover=false -Dconnector.mongodb.name=mongo1 -DskipLongRunningTests=true [...]\n\n\n## 贡献源码(Contributing)\n\nDebezium社区欢迎所有愿意提供帮助的人，无论是报告问题，帮助撰写文档，还是提供代码用于修复错误、添加测试或实现新功能。有关详细信息，请参阅本[文档](CONTRIBUTE.md)。\n\n非常感谢所有Debezium贡献者！\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/debezium/debezium/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contributors-img.web.app/image?repo=debezium/debezium\" />\n</a>\n"

          "content": "# Releasing Debezium\n\nThe Debezium project uses Maven for its build system, relying up on the _release_ plugin to most of the work.\n\nThe release process is automated by means of a parameterized [Jenkins job](https://github.com/debezium/debezium/blob/main/jenkins-jobs/release.yaml),\nthat takes the required information as an input (release version etc.)\nand performs most of the required tasks.\nRefer to [Automated release](#automated-release) below for the details.\n\nThe following describes the individual steps of the release process,\nwhich may be useful for updating the automated pipeline or in case a manual release is necessary.\n\n## Preparations\n\nThese steps must be executed for both manual and automated releases.\n\n### Configure Debezium versions in Jira\n\nStart off from the [__Releases__](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=released-unreleased)\npage of the Debezium Jira project.\n\nFirst, rename the current version (e.g. `1.7-next`) to the new version that\nwill be released (e.g. `1.7.0.Beta1`). All issues previously assigned to the old\n_next_ version are now set to the version of the release.  \nThen create a new `next` version, e.g. `1.7-next`.\n\n### Verify Jira issues\n\nAll issues planned for this release must be resolved.\nIf not, they have to either be re-planned to another release or rejected.\nUse JQL query to find offending issues\n```\nproject=DBZ AND fixVersion=<VERSION> AND status NOT IN ('Resolved', 'Closed')\n```\n\nor navigate to the specific release on the [_Releases_](https://issues.redhat.com/projects/DBZ?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=released-unreleased)\npage. \n\nAlso make sure that each issue is assigned to a component (\"mysql-connector\" etc.).\n\n### Update the changelog and breaking changes\n\nCreate two branches for pull requests to add changelogs (and release announcement) for this\nmain repository and the [`debezium.github.io` repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io).\nThe change log should be updated with all relevant info on new features, bug fixes and breaking changes and\ncan be generated with the `Release Notes` tool in JIRA on the version's detail page.\n\n* https://github.com/debezium/debezium/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\n* https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io/blob/develop/_data/releases/1.7/1.7.0.Beta1.yml\n* https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io/blob/develop/releases/1.7/release-notes.asciidoc\n* https://github.com/debezium/debezium.github.io/blob/develop/_data/releases/1.7/series.yml\n\nJIRA issues that break backwards compatability for existing consumers, should be marked with the \"add-to-upgrade-guide\" label.\nSearch for them using [this query](https://issues.redhat.com/issues/?jql=labels%20%3D%20add-to-upgrade-guide) and describe the\nimplications and required steps for upgrading in the changelog on the website.\n\n### Update antora.yml and series.yml\n\nThe `antora.yml` file in the `main` branch always has the following values:\n\n```yaml\nversion: 'master'\ndisplay_version: 'nightly'\nprerelease: true\n```\n\nDuring the release process, the `antora.yml` file needs to be updated depending on what type of release is being done.\n\n#### New release series\n\nIf the release is the first of a new release series, i.e. 2.1.0.Alpha1, then a new branch of `2.1` is being created.\nIn this scenario, the `antora.yml` file on the `2.1` branch must reflect the correct major/minor version numbers.\nThis means that the above contents from `main` should now read as follows.  \n\n```yaml\nversion: '2.1'\ndisplay_version: '2.1'\nprerelease: true\n```\n\nPlease note that in this case, the `prerelease` designation should be left as `true`.\nThis designator is important as it controls what version of the documentation is the canonical URL reference for searches as well as the order of the versions in the documentation version drop-down list.\n\n#### First \"Final\" release of a series\n\nIf the release is the first final version of a series, i.e. 2.1.0.Final, then the `antora.yml` file on the `2.1` branch will require one additional update.\nDuring this special release, the `prerelease` designator needs to be changed from `true` to `false`.\nAs an example, the 2.1 release Alpha1 YAML file would look like this upon the first Final release:\n\n```yaml\nversion: '2.1'\ndisplay_version: '2.1'\nprerelease: false\n```\n\nWhen a release moves from being a _prerelease_ to not being one, this advances what version is considered the \"stable\" canonical URL for documentation.\nSo following our example, the first 2.1.0.Final release transitions the canonical URL reference, \"/stable\", from pointing to the 2.0.x documentation to that of the 2.1.0.Final documentation.\n\n`series.yml` holds metadata for the `Tested Versions` section on the Debezium [Releases](https://debezium.io/releases/)\nsite and should be updated when dependencies were updated with the new release.\n\nNow either proceed at [Manual release](#manual-release) or [Automated release](#automated-release).\n\n## Manual release\n\nYou can skip to [Automated release](#automated-release) when using the Jenkins CI/CD Release pipeline for the rest of the release process.\n\n### Start with the correct branch\n\nMake sure that you are on the correct branch that is to be released, and that your local Git repository has all of the most recent commits. For example, to release from the `main` branch on the remote repository named `upstream`:\n\n    $ git checkout main\n    $ git pull upstream main\n\nThen make sure that you have no local uncommitted changes:\n\n    $ git status\n\nThis should report:\n\n    On branch master\n    Your branch is up-to-date with 'upstream/master'.\n    nothing to commit, working directory clean\n\nOnly if this is the case can you proceed with the release.\n\n### Update versions and tag\n\nOnce the codebase is in a state that is ready to be released, use the following command to automatically update the POM to use the release number, commit the changes to your local Git repository, tag that commit, and then update the POM to use snapshot versions and commit to your local Git repository:\n\n    $ mvn release:clean release:prepare\n\nThis will prompt for several inputs:\n\n* The release version for each of the modules; answer each with the _major.minor.patch_ version number, such as `0.2.0`.\n* The SCM release tag or label; answer with `v<releaseVersion>`, or `v0.2.0`.\n* The new development version for each of the modules; answer each with the next _major.minor_ snapshot version, such as `0.3-SNAPSHOT`.\n\nThe build then proceeds to:\n\n1. automatically update the POMs to use the release number;\n2. update the POMs with the release version;\n3. perform a build with the updated POMs using the `release`, `assembly`, and `docs` profiles;\n4. commit the changes to your local Git repository;\n5. tag that commit with the label you supplied;\n6. update the POMs to use the new development version you supplied; and\n7. commit the changes to your local Git repository.\n\n_Note: our child module POMs do not specify the version, but instead inherit the version from the parent POM. This results in Maven output that shows several of the steps are sometimes skipped. This is normal._\n\nYou can look at the Git history to verify the changes:\n\n    $ git log --pretty=oneline --decorate --graph --abbrev-commit\n\nwhich should show the most recent commits first. The first two lines should look something like:\n\n    * 6749518 (HEAD, upstream/master, master) [maven-release-plugin] prepare for next development iteration\n    * d5bbb11 (tag: v0.2.0) [maven-release-plugin] prepare release v0.2.0\n\nfollowed by commits made prior to the release. The second line shows the commit from step 4 and includes the tag, while the first line shows the subsequent commit from step 7.\n\nAlso point the `development_docs` branch to the release tag:\n\n    $ git checkout development_docs\n    $ git merge <release tag>\n\n### Push to GitHub\n\nIf the release was successfully prepared, the next step is to push the commits and the tag to the Debezium upstream repository.\n\n    $ git push upstream --follow-tags\n\nNote that if you check for local changes using `git status`, you will see a handful of untracked files, including multiple `pom.xml.releaseBackup` files and a `release.properties` file. These are used by the Maven release plugin, so leave them for the next step in the release process.\n\nAt this point, the code on the branch in the [official Debezium repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium) has been modified and a tag has been created for the release, and we know that the code on the tag successfully builds. Now we're ready to actually perform the release.\n\n### Perform the release\n\nNow that the [official Debezium repository](https://github.com/debezium/debezium) has a tag with the code that we want to release, the next step is to actually build and release what we tagged:\n\n    $ mvn release:perform\n\nThis performs the following steps:\n\n1. check out the tagged code from the official Debezium repository;\n2. run a full build of that code to create all of the release artifacts;\n3. push those artifacts into a staging repository at Maven Central; and\n4. close the staging repository\n\nAt this point, the staging repository contains all the artifacts for the release, and we need to check that they are valid. The staging repository has already been _closed_ (meaning nothing more can be pushed to the staging repository), but it hasn't yet been _released_ (when its contents get uploaded into Maven Central).\n\nBefore we _release_ the staging repository, we first need to review and verify the artifacts.\n\n#### Reviewing the staged artifacts\n\nGo to Sonatype's Nexus Repository Manager at https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/ and log in with an account that has privilege to release Debezium artifacts. In the left hand panel, click on the \"Staging Repositories\". Then type \"debezium\" in the search box to locate the staging repository, which should be _closed_ but not _released_.\n\nSelect the staging repository to see the details, including the staging repository's URL, in the lower portion of the window. Briefly navigate the staged repository contents to verify all modules exist and have the proper versions. You can even look at the POM files or view the details of a file (including its SHA1 and MD5 hash values) using this tool.\n\nBefore continuing, using this lower frame of the window to collect the following pieces of information:\n\n* In the \"Summary\" tab, locate the URL of the staging repository, which might look something like this: `https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/iodebezium-1002`\n* In the \"Content\" tab, navigate to, select, and obtain the MD5 hash of the `...-plugin.tar.gz` file for each connector. (Do _not_ select the `...-plugin.tar.gz.md5` file, since the Repository Manager does not show the contents of the file.)\n\n#### Validating the staged artifacts\n\nAt this time, the best way to verify the staged artifacts are valid is to locally update the [Debezium container images](https://github.com/debezium/container-images) used in the [Debezium tutorial](https://debezium.io/docs/tutorial) to use the latest connector plugins, and then to run through the tutorial using those locally-built container images.\n\nThis [GitHub repository](https://github.com/debezium/container-images) with the container images contains separate Dockerfiles for each major and minor release of Debezium. Start by checking out and getting the latest commits from the [Debezium container images](https://github.com/debezium/container-images) repository and creating a topic branch (using an appropriate branch name):\n\n    $ git checkout master\n    $ git pull upstream master\n    $ git checkout -b <branch-name>\n\nFor Debezium patch releases, we simply update the Dockerfiles that correspond to the minor release's parent. For example, when 0.2 was released, we created new container images by copying and updating the images from 0.1. However, when 0.2.1 was released, we simply updated the 0.2 container images.\n\nCurrently, the only container image that contains Debezium code is the [Connect service image](https://github.com/debezium/container-images/connect), which means this is the only Dockerfile that you will need to change to point to the Maven staging repository. To do this, edit the Dockerfile for the Connect service, and:\n\n* change the `DEBEZIUM_VERSION` environment variable value to match the _major.minor.patch_ version number for the release (e.g., `0.2.1`)\n* temporarily replace the Maven Central repository URL with that URL of the staging repository created in [Perform the Release](#perform-the-release), which again looks something like `https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/iodebezium-1002`.\n* update the MD5 literal string used to check the `...-plugin.tar.gz` file\n\nAfter all of the Docker files have been created or updated, go to the top of your local Git repository and run the following command to build the container images:\n\n    $ ./build-debezium.sh 0.2\n\nor using the correct Debezium version. After this successfully builds the images, run through the tutorial, being sure to use the same container image label (e.g., `0.2`) that you just built.\n\nWhen the tutorial can be successfully run with the new version, edit the Dockerfile for the Connect service to again use the official Maven Central repository URL.\n\nIt is also necessary to update the Connect snapshot(nightly) image with a new development version. Edit `snapshot/Dockerfile` and set `DEBEZIUM_VERSION` environment variable to a new development version, e.g. `0.6.0-SNAPSHOT`.\n\nNow you can commit the changes locally\n\n    $ git commit -m \"Updated container images for release 0.2.1\" .\n    $ git push origin <branch-name>\n\nand create a new pull request (or if rerunning the release process update your existing pull request), but do not merge the pull request yet.\n\nIf you discover any problems, log issues for the problems and fix them in the code base. Then start this process over from the beginning (though you can force-update the changes to your still-unmerged pull request for the container images.\n\n#### Updating the Java version\n\nIf you need to update the base container image for the JDK to use a different JDK version, then:\n\n1. create a new folder under `jdk8` for the new Java versoin by copying the folder for the most recent existing JDK version,\n2. edit the Dockerfile to use the specific version of the JDK and save the file,\n3. run the `./build-java.sh` script to locally build the new `debezium/jdk:<version>` container image,\n4. update all of the container images for Zookeeper, Kafka, and Debezium services to use the new base image,\n5. re-run the `./build-debezium.sh <version>` command to make sure everything builds,\n6. commit the changes locally and add to your still-unmerged pull request.\n\n### Releasing the artifacts\n\nOnce you have verified that the artifacts in the staging repository are acceptable, the next step is to _release_ the staging repository so that its artfacts are then pushed into the Maven Central repository.\n\nGo back to Sonatype's Nexus Repository Manager at https://s01.oss.sonatype.org/ and log in with an account that has privilege to release Debezium artifacts. In the left hand panel, click on the \"Staging Repositories\". Then type \"debezium\" in the search box to locate the closed staging repository that you've verified.\n\nSelect the staging repository (by checking the box) and press the \"Release\" button. Enter a description in the dialog box, and press \"OK\" to release the artifacts to Maven Central. You may need to press the \"Refresh\" button a few times until the staging repository disappears.\n\nIt may take some time for the artifacts to actually be [visible in Maven Central search](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22io.debezium%22) or [directly in Maven Central](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-core/).\n\n### Merge your pull request to update the container images\n\nOnly after the artifacts are available on Maven Central can you merge the pull request for the Debezium container images. As soon as your changes are merged, Docker Hub will automatically build and deploy the container images that were previously configured. If you've just released a patch release and only updated existing container images, then you can proceed to [updating the documentation and blog](#update-the-documentation-and-blog).\n\nOtherwise, for major and minor releases your pull request should have added new container images, and you need to log into [Debezium's Docker Hub organization](https://hub.docker.com/r/debezium/) and add/update the build settings for each of the affected images.\n\nWith every release the container image for PostgreSQL needs to be updated as well.\nFirst create a tag in the [postgres-decoderbufs](https://github.com/debezium/postgres-decoderbufs) repository:\n\n    $ git tag v<%version%> && git push upstream v<%version%>\n\nThen update the Debezium version referenced in the [Postgres Docker file](https://github.com/debezium/container-images/blob/main/postgres/9.6/Dockerfile#L22)\nand push that commit which will cause the image to be re-published on Docker Hub automatically.\n\n### Reconfigure Docker Hub builds\n\nIf a new version of container images is going to be added it is necessary in Docker Hub build settings to\n\n* add a new build for each image with new version\n* remove builds for obsolete versions\n* update `nightly` and `latest` build tags\n* update rules the creates micro tags\n\n### Close Jira issues\n\nClose all issues relesed with this version. The affected issues can be found using JQL query\n```\nproject=DBZ AND fixVersion=<VERSION> AND status='Resolved'\n```\nThen mark release in Jira as *Released* using `Release` action.\n\n### Documentation post-release changes\n\nAfter the release, the `antora.yml` file should be changed so that the `version` attribute references `master` once more.\n\n### Update the documentation and blog\n\nUpdate the documentation on the [Debezium website](https://debezium.io) by following the [instructions for changing the website](https://debezium.io/docs/contribute/#website).\nThis typically involves updating the documentation (look for pending pull requests tagged as \"Merge after next release\") and writing a blog post to announce the release.\nThen, create a pull request with your changes and wait for a committer to approve and merge your changes.\n\nWhen the blog post is available, use the [Debezium Twitter account](https://twitter.com/debezium) to announce the release by linking to the blog post.\n\n## Automated release\n\nThere are few manual steps to be completed before the execution:\n\n* Verify the Maven Central [status](https://status.maven.org/) is green\n* Update [the changelog](#update-the-changelog)\n* Update [configuration](#reconfigure-docker-hub-builds) for Docker Hub builds\n\nTo perform a release automatically, invoke the Jenkins job on the release infrastructure. Two parameters are requested:\n\n* `RELEASE_VERSION` - a version to be released in format x.y.z (e.g. `1.7.0.Beta1`)\n* `DEVELOPMENT_VERSION` - next development version in format x.y.z-SNAPSHOT (e.g. `1.7.0-SNAPSHOT`)\n"
