In general, follow\n  the same coding style as the code that you are modifying.\n- For Intellij you can import our code style settings xml: [`druid_intellij_formatting.xml`](\n  https://github.com/apache/druid/raw/master/dev/druid_intellij_formatting.xml).\n- For Eclipse you can import our code style settings xml: [`eclipse_formatting.xml`](\n  https://github.com/apache/druid/raw/master/dev/eclipse_formatting.xml).\n- Do add/update documentation appropriately for the change you are making.\n- If you are introducing a new feature you may want to first write about your idea\n  for feedback to [dev@druid.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@druid.apache.org). Or create an issue\n  using \"Feature/Change\" template. Non-trivial features should include unit tests covering the new functionality. Open\n  a \"Proposal\" issue for large changes.\n- Bugfixes should include a unit test or integration test reproducing the issue.\n- Do not use author tags/information in the code.\n- Try to keep pull requests short and submit separate ones for unrelated\n  features, but feel free to combine simple bugfixes/tests into one pull request.\n- If you are adding or updating a dependency, be sure to update the version, license, or notice information in\n  [licenses.yaml](https://github.com/apache/druid/blob/master/licenses.yaml) as appropriate to help ease\n  LICENSE and NOTICE management for ASF releases.\n\nYou can find more developers' resources in [`dev/`](dev) directory.\n\n## GitHub Workflow\n\n1. Fork the apache/druid repository into your GitHub account\n\n    <https://github.com/apache/druid/fork>\n\n2. Clone your fork of the GitHub repository\n\n    ```sh\n    git clone git@github.com:<username>/druid.git\n    ```\n\n    replace `<username>` with your GitHub username.\n\n3. Add a remote to keep up with upstream changes\n\n    ```sh\n    git remote add upstream https://github.com/apache/druid.git\n    ```\n\n    If you already have a copy, fetch upstream changes\n\n    ```sh\n    git fetch upstream master\n    ```\n\n4. Create a feature branch to work in\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout -b feature-xxx remotes/upstream/master\n    ```\n\n5. _Before submitting a pull request_ periodically rebase your changes\n    (but don't do it when a pull request is already submitted)\n\n    ```sh\n    git pull --rebase upstream master\n    ```\n\n6. Before submitting a pull request, combine (\"squash\") related commits into a single one\n\n    ```sh\n    git rebase -i upstream/master\n    ```\n\n    This will open your editor and allow you to re-order commits and merge them:\n    - Re-order the lines to change commit order (to the extent possible without creating conflicts)\n    - Prefix commits using `s` (squash) or `f` (fixup) to merge extraneous commits.\n\n7. Submit a pull-request\n\n    ```sh\n    git push origin feature-xxx\n    ```\n\n    Go to your Druid fork main page\n\n    ```txt\n    https://github.com/<username>/druid\n    ```\n\n    If you recently pushed your changes GitHub will automatically pop up a\n    `Compare & pull request` button for any branches you recently pushed to. If you\n    click that button it will automatically offer you to submit your pull-request\n    to the apache/druid repository.\n\n    - Give your pull-request a meaningful title.\n    - In the description, explain your changes and the problem they are solving.\n\n8. Addressing code review comments\n\n    Address code review comments by committing changes and pushing them to your feature\n    branch.\n\n    ```sh\n    git push origin feature-xxx\n    ```\n\n### If your pull request shows conflicts with master\n\n  If your pull request shows conflicts with master, merge master into your feature branch:\n  \n  ```sh\n  git merge upstream/master\n  ```\n  \n  and resolve the conflicts. After resolving conflicts, push your branch again:\n  \n  ```sh\n  git push origin feature-xxx\n  ```\n\n  _Avoid rebasing and force pushes after submitting a pull request,_ since these make it\n  difficult for reviewers to see what you've changed in response to their reviews. The Druid\n  committer that merges your change will rebase and squash it into a single commit before\n  committing it to master.\n\n## Release notes\n\nRelease notes are the way that Druid users will learn about your fix or improvement. What does a user need to know? The key is to identify the user impact. Give it your best shot! Druid committers will review and edit your notes.\n\nHere's a non-exhaustive list of the type of changes that have user impact and need release notes:\n\n- Changes what the user sees in the UI.\n- Changes any action that the user takes (in the UI, in the API, in configuration, in install, etc.)\n- Changes the results of any query, ingestion, or task.\n- Changes performance (preferably making things faster).\n- Adds, deprecates, or removes features.\n- Anything that changes install, configuration, or operation of Druid.\n\nAn example of a change that doesn't need a release note is fixing a flakey test.\n\nUse these tips when writing your release note:\n\n**Summarize your change.** Describe the user impacting parts of your change, but try to be as concise as you can.\n\n**Be accurate, clear, and concise.** If you can't tick all of these off, the order of priority is accurate > clear > concise.\n\n**WIIFM - what's in it for me?** Spell out why the user should care. A release note shouldn't be like a stand-up update that focuses on the details of code changes.\n\n**Give enough context.** Make sure there's enough detail for users to do something with the information if they need to. For example, include the property they need to set and link to the documentation when possible.\n\n**You don't need to be formal and impersonal.** Speak directly to the user (\"You can...\"). Avoid passive voice (“X has been added”).\n\n### Example release notes\n\n| Template                                        | Examples |\n|-------------------------------------------------|----------|\n| New: You can now…                           | New: You can now upload CSV files with a single header row for batch ingestion. Set the `inferSchemaFromHeader` property of your ingestion spec to `true` to enable this feature. For more information, see [TITLE](/path/to/doc-file.md#anchor).|\n| Fixed: X no longer does Y when Z.               | Fixed: Multi-value string array expressions no longer give flattened results when used in  groupBy queries.         |\n| Changed: X now does Y. Previously, X did Z. | Changed: The first/last string aggregator now only compares based on values. Previously, the first/last string aggregator’s values were compared based on the `_time` column first and then on values.         |\n| Improved: Better / Increased / Updated etc. | Improved: You can now perform Kinesis ingestion even if there are empty shards. Previously, all shards had to have at least one record. |\n| Improved: Better / Increased / Updated etc. | Improved: Java 11 is fully supported and is no longer experimental. Java 17 support is improved.         |\n| Deprecated: Removed / Will remove X. | Deprecated: Support for ZooKeeper X.Y will be removed in the next release, so consider upgrading ZooKeeper. For information about how to upgrade ZooKeeper, see the ZooKeeper documentation.        |\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Help! I merged changes from upstream and cannot figure out how to resolve conflicts when rebasing\n\nNever fear! If you occasionally merged upstream/master, here is another way to squash your changes into a single commit:\n\n1. First, rename your existing branch to something else, e.g. `feature-xxx-unclean`\n\n    ```sh\n    git branch -m feature-xxx-unclean\n    ```\n\n2. Checkout a new branch with the original name `feature-xxx` from upstream. This branch will supersede our old one.\n\n    ```sh\n    git checkout -b feature-xxx upstream/master\n    ```\n\n3. Then merge your changes in your original feature branch `feature-xxx-unclean` and create a single commit.\n\n    ```sh\n    git merge --squash feature-xxx-unclean\n    git commit\n    ```\n\n4. You can now submit this new branch and create or replace your existing pull request.\n\n    ```sh\n    git push origin [--force] feature-xxx:feature-xxx\n    ```\n"

Apache Druid\n\nDruid is a high performance real-time analytics database. Druid's main value add is to reduce time to insight and action.\n\nDruid is designed for workflows where fast queries and ingest really matter. Druid excels at powering UIs, running operational (ad-hoc) queries, or handling high concurrency. Consider Druid as an open source alternative to data warehouses for a variety of use cases. The [design documentation](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/architecture.html) explains the key concepts.\n\n### Getting started\n\nYou can get started with Druid with our [local](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/quickstart.html) or [Docker](http://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/tutorials/docker.html) quickstart.\n\nDruid provides a rich set of APIs (via HTTP and [JDBC](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html#jdbc)) for loading, managing, and querying your data.\nYou can also interact with Druid via the built-in [web console](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/operations/web-console.html) (shown below).\n\n#### Load data\n\n[![data loader Kafka](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/65819337-054eac80-e1d0-11e9-8842-97b92d8c6159.gif)](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/index.html)\n\nLoad [streaming](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/index.html#streaming) and [batch](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/index.html#batch) data using a point-and-click wizard to guide you through ingestion setup. Monitor one off tasks and ingestion supervisors.\n\n#### Manage the cluster\n\n[![management](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/65819338-08499d00-e1d0-11e9-80fe-faee9e9468cb.gif)](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/data-management.html)\n\nManage your cluster with ease. Get a view of your [datasources](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/architecture.html), [segments](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/segments.html), [ingestion tasks](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/ingestion/tasks.html), and [services](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/design/processes.html) from one convenient location. All powered by [SQL systems tables](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html#metadata-tables), allowing you to see the underlying query for each view.\n\n#### Issue queries\n\n[![query view combo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/177816/65819341-0c75ba80-e1d0-11e9-9730-0f2d084defcc.gif)](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html)\n\nUse the built-in query workbench to prototype [DruidSQL](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/sql.html) and [native](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/querying/querying.html) queries or connect one of the [many tools](https://druid.apache.org/libraries.html) that help you make the most out of Druid.\n\n### Documentation\n\nSee the [latest documentation](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/) for the documentation for the current official release. If you need information on a previous release, you can browse [previous releases documentation](https://druid.apache.org/docs/).\n\nMake documentation and tutorials updates in [`/docs`](https://github.com/apache/druid/tree/master/docs) using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) or extended Markdown [(MDX)](https://mdxjs.com/). Then, open a pull request.\n\nTo build the site locally, you need Node 16.14 or higher and to install Docusaurus 2 with `npm|yarn install`  in the `website` directory. Then you can run `npm|yarn start` to launch a local build of the docs.\n\nIf you're looking to update non-doc pages like Use Cases, those files are in the [`druid-website-src`](https://github.com/apache/druid-website-src/tree/master) repo.\n\n### Community\n\nVisit the official project [community](https://druid.apache.org/community/) page to read about getting involved in contributing to Apache Druid, and how we help one another use and operate Druid.\n\n* Druid users can find help in the [`druid-user`](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/druid-user) mailing list on Google Groups, and have more technical conversations in `#troubleshooting` on Slack.\n* Druid development discussions take place in the [`druid-dev`](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@druid.apache.org) mailing list ([dev@druid.apache.org](https://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@druid.apache.org)).  Subscribe by emailing [dev-subscribe@druid.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@druid.apache.org).  For live conversations, join the `#dev` channel on Slack.\n\nCheck out the official [community](https://druid.apache.org/community/) page for details of how to join the community Slack channels.\n\nFind articles written by community members and a calendar of upcoming events on the [project site](https://druid.apache.org/) - contribute your own events and articles by submitting a PR in the [`apache/druid-website-src`](https://github.com/apache/druid-website-src/tree/master/_data) repository.\n\n### Building from source\n\nPlease note that JDK 11 or JDK 17 is required to build Druid.\n\nSee the latest [build guide](https://druid.apache.org/docs/latest/development/build.html) for instructions on building Apache Druid from source.\n\n### Contributing\n\nPlease follow the [community guidelines](https://druid.apache.org/community/) for contributing.\n\nFor instructions on setting up IntelliJ [dev/intellij-setup.md](dev/intellij-setup.md)\n\n### License\n\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\n"

More information about Druid\ncan be found on https://druid.apache.org.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nYou can find the documentation for {THIS_OR_THE_LATEST} Druid release on the project website https://druid.apache.org/docs/{DRUIDVERSION}/.\n\nYou can get started with Druid with our quickstart at https://druid.apache.org/docs/{DRUIDVERSION}/tutorials/quickstart.html.\n\n\nBuild from Source\n-----------------\nYou can build Apache Druid directly from source.\n\nPrerequisites:\n  JDK 8, 8u92+\n  Maven version 3.x\n\n\nThe basic command to build Druid from source is:\n\n    mvn clean install\n\n\nThis will run static analysis, unit tests, compile classes, and package the projects into JARs. It will not generate the\nsource or binary distribution tarball.\n\nIn addition to the basic stages, you may also want to add the following profiles and properties:\n\n  -Pdist           - Distribution profile: Generates the binary distribution tarball by pulling in core extensions and\n                     dependencies and packaging the files as 'distribution/target/apache-druid-x.x.x-bin.tar.gz'\n  -Papache-release - Apache release profile: Generates GPG signature and checksums, and builds the source distribution\n                     tarball as `distribution/target/apache-druid-x.x.x-src.tar.gz`\n  -Prat            - Apache Rat profile: Runs the Apache Rat license audit tool\n  -DskipTests      - Skips unit tests (which reduces build time)\n\nPutting these together, if you wish to build the source and binary distributions with signatures and checksums, audit\nlicenses, and skip the unit tests, you would run:\n\n    mvn clean install -Papache-release,dist,rat -DskipTests\n\n\nCommunity\n---------\nCommunity support is available on the druid-user mailing list druid-user@googlegroups.com also available at\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/druid-user.\n\nDevelopment discussions occur on dev@druid.apache.org (archive available at\nhttps://lists.apache.org/list.html?dev@druid.apache.org), which you can subscribe to by emailing\ndev-subscribe@druid.apache.org.\n\n\nContributing\n------------\nIf you find any bugs, please file a GitHub issue at https://github.com/apache/druid/issues.\n\nIf you wish to contribute, please follow the guidelines listed at https://druid.apache.org/community/.\n"

Directly in the environment. (Simplest and best.) We support a fixed set of variables:\n#    <need the list>\n# 2. For ad-hoc use, as var=value pairs in a file with the same name as the\n#    test catagory, in the home folder under ~/druid-it. Example:\n#    BatchIndex.env. Use this to hold credentials and other info which you must\n#    pass into tests when running locally.\n# 3. A file given by the OVERRIDE_ENV environment variable. That is, OVERRIDE_ENV holds\n#    the path to a file of var=value pairs. Historically, this file was created by a\n#    build environment such as Github Actions. However, it is actually simpler just to use\n#    option 1: just set the values in the environment and let Linux pass them through to\n#    this script.\n# 4.
