All users should migrate to\n`androidx.media3` (which contains the same ExoPlayer code). See\n[the migration guide](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media3/getting-started/migration-guide)\nfor more details, including a script to help with the migration.\n\nThis release corresponds to the\n[AndroidX Media3 1.1.1 release](https://github.com/androidx/media/releases/tag/1.1.1).\n\n*   Common Library:\n    *   Remove accidentally added `multidex` dependency from all modules\n        ([#499](https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/499)).\n*   ExoPlayer:\n    *   Fix issue in `PlaybackStatsListener` where spurious `PlaybackStats` are\n        created after the playlist is cleared.\n    *   Add additional fields to Common Media Client Data (CMCD) logging:\n        streaming format (sf), stream type (st), version (v), top birate (tb),\n        object duration (d), measured throughput (mtp) and object type (ot)\n        ([#8699](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8699)).\n*   Audio:\n    *   Fix a bug where `Player.getState()` never transitioned to `STATE_ENDED`\n        when playing very short files\n        ([#538](https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/538)).\n*   Audio Offload:\n    *   Prepend Ogg ID Header and Comment Header Pages to bitstream for\n        offloaded Opus playback in accordance with RFC 7845.\n*   Video:\n    *   H.265/HEVC: Fix parsing SPS short and long term reference picture info.\n*   Text:\n    *   CEA-608: Change cue truncation logic to only consider visible text.\n        Previously indent and tab offset were included when limiting the cue\n        length to 32 characters (which was technically correct by the spec)\n        ([#11019](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/11019)).\n*   IMA extension:\n    *   Bump IMA SDK version to 3.30.3.\n\n### 2.19.0 (2023-07-05)\n\nThis release corresponds to the\n[AndroidX Media3 1.1.0 release](https://github.com/androidx/media/releases/tag/1.1.0).\n\n*   Common Library:\n    *   Add suppression reason for unsuitable audio route and play when ready\n        change reason for suppressed too long.\n        ([#15](https://github.com/androidx/media/issues/15)).\n    *   Add commands to Player:\n        *   `COMMAND_GET_METADATA`\n        *   `COMMAND_SET_PLAYLIST_METADATA`\n        *   `COMMAND_SET_DEVICE_VOLUME_WITH_FLAGS`\n        *   `COMMAND_ADJUST_DEVICE_VOLUME_WITH_FLAGS`\n    *   Add overloaded methods to Player which allow users to specify volume\n        flags:\n        *   `void setDeviceVolume(int, int)`\n        *   `void increaseDeviceVolume(int)`\n        *   `void decreaseDeviceVolume(int)`\n        *   `void setDeviceMuted(boolean, int)`\n    *   Add `Builder` for `DeviceInfo` and deprecate existing constructor.\n    *   Add `DeviceInfo.routingControllerId` to specify the routing controller\n        ID for remote playbacks.\n    *   Add `Player.replaceMediaItem(s)` as a shortcut to adding and removing\n        items at the same position\n        ([#8046](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8046)).\n*   ExoPlayer:\n    *   Allow ExoPlayer to have control of device volume methods only if\n        explicitly opted in. Use\n        `ExoPlayer.Builder.setDeviceVolumeControlEnabled` to have access to:\n        *   `getDeviceVolume()`\n        *   `isDeviceMuted()`\n        *   `setDeviceVolume(int)` and `setDeviceVolume(int, int)`\n        *   `increaseDeviceVolume(int)` and `increaseDeviceVolume(int, int)`\n        *   `decreaseDeviceVolume(int)` and `decreaseDeviceVolume(int, int)`\n    *   Add `FilteringMediaSource` that allows to filter available track types\n        from a `MediaSource`.\n    *   Add support for including Common Media Client Data (CMCD) in the\n        outgoing requests of adaptive streaming formats DASH, HLS, and\n        SmoothStreaming. The following fields, `br`, `bl`, `cid`, `rtp`, and\n        `sid`, have been incorporated\n        ([#8699](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8699)). API\n        structure and API methods:\n        *   CMCD logging is disabled by default, use\n            `MediaSource.Factory.setCmcdConfigurationFactory(CmcdConfiguration.Factory\n            cmcdConfigurationFactory)` to enable it.\n        *   All keys are enabled by default, override\n            `CmcdConfiguration.RequestConfig.isKeyAllowed(String key)` to filter\n            out which keys are logged.\n        *   Override `CmcdConfiguration.RequestConfig.getCustomData()` to enable\n            custom key logging.\n    *   Add additional action to manifest of main demo to make it easier to\n        start the demo app with a custom `*.exolist.json` file\n        ([#439](https://github.com/androidx/media/pull/439)).\n    *   Add `ExoPlayer.setVideoEffects()` for using `Effect` during video\n        playback.\n    *   Update `SampleQueue` to store `sourceId` as a `long` rather than an\n        `int`. This changes the signatures of public methods\n        `SampleQueue.sourceId` and `SampleQueue.peekSourceId`.\n    *   Add parameters to `LoadControl` methods `shouldStartPlayback` and\n        `onTracksSelected` that allow associating these methods with the\n        relevant `MediaPeriod`.\n    *   Change signature of\n        `ServerSideAdInsertionMediaSource.setAdPlaybackStates(Map<Object,\n        AdPlaybackState>)` by adding a timeline parameter that contains the\n        periods with the UIDs used as keys in the map. This is required to avoid\n        concurrency issues with multi-period live streams.\n    *   Deprecate `EventDispatcher.withParameters(int windowIndex, @Nullable\n        MediaPeriodId mediaPeriodId, long mediaTimeOffsetMs)` and\n        `BaseMediaSource.createEventDispatcher(..., long mediaTimeOffsetMs)`.\n        The variant of the methods without the `mediaTimeOffsetUs` can be called\n        instead. Note that even for the deprecated variants, the offset is not\n        anymore added to `startTimeUs` and `endTimeUs` of the `MediaLoadData`\n        objects that are dispatched by the dispatcher.\n    *   Rename `ExoTrackSelection.blacklist` to `excludeTrack` and\n        `isBlacklisted` to `isTrackExcluded`.\n    *   Fix inconsistent behavior between `ExoPlayer.setMediaItem(s)` and\n        `addMediaItem(s)` when called on an empty playlist.\n*   Transformer:\n    *   Remove `Transformer.Builder.setMediaSourceFactory(MediaSource.Factory)`.\n        Use `ExoPlayerAssetLoader.Factory(MediaSource.Factory)` and\n        `Transformer.Builder.setAssetLoaderFactory(AssetLoader.Factory)`\n        instead.\n    *   Remove `Transformer.startTransformation(MediaItem,\n        ParcelFileDescriptor)`.\n    *   Fix a bug where transformation could get stuck (leading to muxer\n        timeout) if the end of the video stream was signaled at the moment when\n        an input frame was pending processing.\n    *   Query codecs via `MediaCodecList` instead of using\n        `findDecoder/EncoderForFormat` utilities, to expand support.\n    *   Remove B-frame configuration in `DefaultEncoderFactory` because it\n        doesn't work on some devices.\n*   Track selection:\n    *   Add\n        `DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters.allowInvalidateSelectionsForRendererCapabilitiesChange`\n        which is disabled by default.

ExoPlayer will forward playback events and\n        performance data to the platform, which helps to provide system\n        performance and debugging information on the device. This data may also\n        be collected by Google\n        [if sharing usage and diagnostics data is enabled](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6078260)\n        by the user of the device. Apps can opt-out of contributing to platform\n        diagnostics for ExoPlayer with\n        `ExoPlayer.Builder.setUsePlatformDiagnostics(false)`.\n    *   Fix bug that tracks are reset too often when using `MergingMediaSource`,\n        for example when side-loading subtitles and changing the selected\n        subtitle mid-playback\n        ([#10248](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/10248)).\n    *   Stop detecting 5G-NSA network type on API 29 and 30. These playbacks\n        will assume a 4G network.\n    *   Disallow passing `null` to\n        `MediaSource.Factory.setDrmSessionManagerProvider` and\n        `MediaSource.Factory.setLoadErrorHandlingPolicy`. Instances of\n        `DefaultDrmSessionManagerProvider` and `DefaultLoadErrorHandlingPolicy`\n        can be passed explicitly if required.\n    *   Add `MediaItem.RequestMetadata` to represent metadata needed to play\n        media when the exact `LocalConfiguration` is not known. Also remove\n        `MediaMetadata.mediaUrl` as this is now included in `RequestMetadata`.\n    *   Add `Player.Command.COMMAND_SET_MEDIA_ITEM` to enable players to allow\n        setting a single item.\n*   Track selection:\n    *   Flatten `TrackSelectionOverrides` class into `TrackSelectionParameters`,\n        and promote `TrackSelectionOverride` to a top level class.\n    *   Rename `TracksInfo` to `Tracks` and `TracksInfo.TrackGroupInfo` to\n        `Tracks.Group`. `Player.getCurrentTracksInfo` and\n        `Player.Listener.onTracksInfoChanged` have also been renamed to\n        `Player.getCurrentTracks` and `Player.Listener.onTracksChanged`. This\n        includes 'un-deprecating' the `Player.Listener.onTracksChanged` method\n        name, but with different parameter types.\n    *   Change `DefaultTrackSelector.buildUponParameters` and\n        `DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters.buildUpon` to return\n        `DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters.Builder` instead of the deprecated\n        `DefaultTrackSelector.ParametersBuilder`.\n    *   Add\n        `DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters.constrainAudioChannelCountToDeviceCapabilities`\n        which is enabled by default. When enabled, the `DefaultTrackSelector`\n        will prefer audio tracks whose channel count does not exceed the device\n        output capabilities. On handheld devices, the `DefaultTrackSelector`\n        will prefer stereo/mono over multichannel audio formats, unless the\n        multichannel format can be\n        [Spatialized](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/Spatializer)\n        (Android 12L+) or is a Dolby surround sound format. In addition, on\n        devices that support audio spatialization, the `DefaultTrackSelector`\n        will monitor for changes in the\n        [Spatializer properties](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/Spatializer.OnSpatializerStateChangedListener)\n        and trigger a new track selection upon these. Devices with a\n        `television`\n        [UI mode](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources#UiModeQualifier)\n        are excluded from these constraints and the format with the highest\n        channel count will be preferred. To enable this feature, the\n        `DefaultTrackSelector` instance must be constructed with a `Context`.\n*   Video:\n    *   Rename `DummySurface` to `PlaceholderSurface`.\n    *   Add AV1 support to the `MediaCodecVideoRenderer.getCodecMaxInputSize`.\n*   Audio:\n    *   Use LG AC3 audio decoder advertising non-standard MIME type.\n    *   Change the return type of `AudioAttributes.getAudioAttributesV21()` from\n        `android.media.AudioAttributes` to a new `AudioAttributesV21` wrapper\n        class, to prevent slow ART verification on API < 21.\n    *   Query the platform (API 29+) or assume the audio encoding channel count\n        for audio passthrough when the format audio channel count is unset,\n        which occurs with HLS chunkless preparation\n        ([10204](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/10204)).\n    *   Configure `AudioTrack` with channel mask\n        `AudioFormat.CHANNEL_OUT_7POINT1POINT4` if the decoder outputs 12\n        channel PCM audio\n        ([#10322](#https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/10322).\n*   DRM\n    *   Ensure the DRM session is always correctly updated when seeking\n        immediately after a format change\n        ([10274](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/10274)).\n*   Text:\n    *   Change `Player.getCurrentCues()` to return `CueGroup` instead of\n        `List<Cue>`.\n    *   SSA: Support `OutlineColour` style setting when `BorderStyle == 3` (i.e.\n        `OutlineColour` sets the background of the cue)\n        ([#8435](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8435)).\n    *   CEA-708: Parse data into multiple service blocks and ignore blocks not\n        associated with the currently selected service number.\n    *   Remove `RawCcExtractor`, which was only used to handle a Google-internal\n        subtitle format.\n*   Extractors:\n    *   Add support for AVI\n        ([#2092](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2092)).\n    *   Matroska: Parse `DiscardPadding` for Opus tracks.\n    *   MP4: Parse bitrates from `esds` boxes.\n    *   Ogg: Allow duplicate Opus ID and comment headers\n        ([#10038](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/10038)).\n*   UI:\n    *   Fix delivery of events to `OnClickListener`s set on `StyledPlayerView`\n        and `PlayerView`, in the case that `useController=false`\n        ([#9605](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9605)). Also fix\n        delivery of events to `OnLongClickListener` for all view configurations.\n    *   Fix incorrectly treating a sequence of touch events that exit the bounds\n        of `StyledPlayerView` and `PlayerView` before `ACTION_UP` as a click\n        ([#9861](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9861)).\n    *   Fix `PlayerView` accessibility issue where tapping might toggle playback\n        rather than hiding the controls\n        ([#8627](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8627)).\n    *   Rewrite `TrackSelectionView` and `TrackSelectionDialogBuilder` to work\n        with the `Player` interface rather than `ExoPlayer`. This allows the\n        views to be used with other `Player` implementations, and removes the\n        dependency from the UI module to the ExoPlayer module. This is a\n        breaking change.\n    *   Don't show forced text tracks in the `PlayerView` track selector, and\n        keep a suitable forced text track selected if \"None\" is selected\n        ([#9432](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9432)).\n*   DASH:\n    *   Parse channel count from DTS `AudioChannelConfiguration` elements.

Use `Player.Listener.onTracksChanged(Tracks)`\n        instead.\n    *   Remove `Player.getCurrentTrackGroups` and\n        `Player.getCurrentTrackSelections`. Use `Player.getCurrentTracks`\n        instead. You can also continue to use `ExoPlayer.getCurrentTrackGroups`\n        and `ExoPlayer.getCurrentTrackSelections`, although these methods remain\n        deprecated.\n    *   Remove `DownloadHelper`\n        `DEFAULT_TRACK_SELECTOR_PARAMETERS_WITHOUT_VIEWPORT` and\n        `DEFAULT_TRACK_SELECTOR_PARAMETERS` constants. Use\n        `getDefaultTrackSelectorParameters(Context)` instead when possible, and\n        `DEFAULT_TRACK_SELECTOR_PARAMETERS_WITHOUT_CONTEXT` otherwise.\n    *   Remove constructor `DefaultTrackSelector(ExoTrackSelection.Factory)`.\n        Use `DefaultTrackSelector(Context, ExoTrackSelection.Factory)` instead.\n    *   Remove `Transformer.Builder.setContext`.

This fixes a crash when resuming playback\n        after backgrounding the app with an active track override\n        ([#9718](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9718)).\n    *   Amend logic in `AdaptiveTrackSelection` to allow a quality increase\n        under sufficient network bandwidth even if playback is very close to the\n        live edge ([#9784](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9784)).\n*   Video:\n    *   Fix decoder fallback logic for Dolby Vision to use a compatible\n        H264/H265 decoder if needed.\n*   Audio:\n    *   Fix decoder fallback logic for Dolby Atmos (E-AC3-JOC) to use a\n        compatible E-AC3 decoder if needed.\n    *   Change `AudioCapabilities` APIs to require passing explicitly\n        `AudioCapabilities.DEFAULT_AUDIO_CAPABILITIES` instead of `null`.\n    *   Allow customization of the `AudioTrack` buffer size calculation by\n        injecting an `AudioTrackBufferSizeProvider` to `DefaultAudioSink`\n        ([#8891](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8891)).\n    *   Retry `AudioTrack` creation if the requested buffer size was > 1MB\n        ([#9712](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9712)).\n*   Extractors:\n    *   Fix incorrect parsing of H.265 SPS NAL units\n        ([#9719](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9719)).\n    *   Parse Vorbis Comments (including `METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE`) in Ogg Opus\n        and Ogg Vorbis files.\n*   Text:\n    *   Add a `MediaItem.SubtitleConfiguration.id` field which is propagated to\n        the `Format.id` field of the subtitle track created from the\n        configuration\n        ([#9673](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9673)).\n    *   Add basic support for WebVTT subtitles in Matroska containers\n        ([#9886](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9886)).\n    *   Prevent `Cea708Decoder` from reading more than the declared size of a\n        service block.\n*   DRM:\n    *   Remove `playbackLooper` from `DrmSessionManager.(pre)acquireSession`.\n        When a `DrmSessionManager` is used by an app in a custom `MediaSource`,\n        the `playbackLooper` needs to be passed to `DrmSessionManager.setPlayer`\n        instead.\n*   Ad playback / IMA:\n    *   Add support for\n        [IMA Dynamic Ad Insertion (DAI)](https://support.google.com/admanager/answer/6147120)\n        ([#8213](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8213)).\n    *   Add a method to `AdPlaybackState` to allow resetting an ad group so that\n        it can be played again\n        ([#9615](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9615)).\n    *   Enforce playback speed of 1.0 during ad playback\n        ([#9018](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9018)).\n    *   Fix issue where an ad group that failed to load caused an immediate\n        playback reset\n        ([#9929](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9929)).\n*   UI:\n    *   Fix the color of the numbers in `StyledPlayerView` rewind and\n        fastforward buttons when using certain themes\n        ([#9765](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9765)).\n    *   Correctly translate playback speed strings\n        ([#9811](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9811)).\n*   DASH:\n    *   Support the `forced-subtitle` track role\n        ([#9727](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9727)).\n    *   Stop interpreting the `main` track role as `C.SELECTION_FLAG_DEFAULT`.\n    *   Fix base URL exclusion logic for manifests that do not declare the DVB\n        namespace ([#9856](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9856)).\n    *   Support relative `MPD.Location` URLs\n        ([#9939](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9939)).\n*   HLS:\n    *   Use chunkless preparation by default to improve start up time. If your\n        renditions contain muxed closed-caption tracks that are **not** declared\n        in the master playlist, you should add them to the master playlist to be\n        available for playback, or turn off chunkless preparation with\n        `HlsMediaSource.Factory.setAllowChunklessPreparation(false)`.\n    *   Support key-frame accurate seeking in HLS\n        ([#2882](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2882)).\n    *   Correctly populate `Format.label` for audio only HLS streams\n        ([#9608](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9608)).\n*   RTSP:\n    *   Provide a client API to override the `SocketFactory` used for any server\n        connection ([#9606](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/9606)).\n    *   Prefer DIGEST authentication method over BASIC if both are present\n        ([#9800](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9800)).\n    *   Handle when RTSP track timing is not available\n        ([#9775](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9775)).\n    *   Ignore invalid RTP-Info header values\n        ([#9619](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9619)).\n*   Transformer:\n    *   Increase required min API version to 21.\n    *   `TransformationException` is now used to describe errors that occur\n        during a transformation.\n    *   Add `TransformationRequest` for specifying the transformation options.\n    *   Allow multiple listeners to be registered.\n    *   Fix Transformer being stuck when the codec output is partially read.\n    *   Fix potential NPE in `Transformer.getProgress` when releasing the muxer\n        throws.\n    *   Add a demo app for applying transformations.\n    *   The transformer module is no longer included by depending on\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer`. To continue using transformer,\n        add an additional dependency on\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer:exoplayer-transformer`.\n*   MediaSession extension:\n    *   By default, `MediaSessionConnector` now clears the playlist on stop.\n        Apps that want the playlist to be retained can call\n        `setClearMediaItemsOnStop(false)` on the connector.\n*   Cast extension:\n    *   Fix bug that prevented `CastPlayer` from calling `onIsPlayingChanged`\n        correctly ([#9792](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9792)).\n    *   Support audio metadata including artwork with\n        `DefaultMediaItemConverter`\n        ([#9663](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9663)).\n*   FFmpeg extension:\n    *   Make `build_ffmpeg.sh` depend on LLVM's bin utils instead of GNU's\n        ([#9933](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9933)).\n*   Android 12 compatibility:\n    *   Upgrade the Cast extension to depend on\n        `com.google.android.gms:play-services-cast-framework:20.1.0`. Earlier\n        versions of `play-services-cast-framework` are not compatible with apps\n        targeting Android 12, and will crash with an `IllegalArgumentException`\n        when creating `PendingIntent`s\n        ([#9528](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9528)).\n*   Remove deprecated symbols:\n    *   Remove `Player.EventListener`.

Use\n        `MediaSourceFactory.setDrmSessionManagerProvider` instead.\n    *   Remove `MediaSourceFactory.setStreamKeys`. Use\n        `MediaItem.Builder.setStreamKeys` instead.\n    *   Remove `MediaSourceFactory.createMediaSource(Uri)`. Use\n        `MediaSourceFactory.createMediaSource(MediaItem)` instead.\n    *   Remove `setTag` from `DashMediaSource`, `HlsMediaSource` and\n        `SsMediaSource`. Use `MediaItem.Builder.setTag` instead.\n    *   Remove `DashMediaSource.setLivePresentationDelayMs(long, boolean)`. Use\n        `MediaItem.Builder.setLiveConfiguration` and\n        `MediaItem.LiveConfiguration.Builder.setTargetOffsetMs` to override the\n        manifest, or `DashMediaSource.setFallbackTargetLiveOffsetMs` to provide\n        a fallback value.\n    *   Remove `(Simple)ExoPlayer.setThrowsWhenUsingWrongThread`. Opting out of\n        the thread enforcement is no longer possible.\n    *   Remove `ActionFile` and `ActionFileUpgradeUtil`. Use ExoPlayer 2.16.1 or\n        before to use `ActionFileUpgradeUtil` to merge legacy action files into\n        `DefaultDownloadIndex`.\n    *   Remove `ProgressiveMediaSource.setExtractorsFactory`. Use\n        `ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory(DataSource.Factory, ExtractorsFactory)`\n        constructor instead.\n    *   Remove `ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory.setTag` and\n        `ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory.setCustomCacheKey`. Use\n        `MediaItem.Builder.setTag` and `MediaItem.Builder.setCustomCacheKey`\n        instead.\n    *   Remove `DefaultRenderersFactory(Context, @ExtensionRendererMode int)`\n        and `DefaultRenderersFactory(Context, @ExtensionRendererMode int, long)`\n        constructors. Use the `DefaultRenderersFactory(Context)` constructor,\n        `DefaultRenderersFactory.setExtensionRendererMode`, and\n        `DefaultRenderersFactory.setAllowedVideoJoiningTimeMs` instead.\n    *   Remove all public `CronetDataSource` constructors. Use\n        `CronetDataSource.Factory` instead.\n*   Change the following `IntDefs` to `@Target(TYPE_USE)` only. This may break\n    the compilation of usages in Kotlin, which can be fixed by moving the\n    annotation to annotate the type (`Int`).\n    *   `@AacAudioObjectType`\n    *   `@Ac3Util.SyncFrameInfo.StreamType`\n    *   `@AdLoadException.Type`\n    *   `@AdtsExtractor.Flags`\n    *   `@AmrExtractor.Flags`\n    *   `@AspectRatioFrameLayout.ResizeMode`\n    *   `@AudioFocusManager.PlayerCommand`\n    *   `@AudioSink.SinkFormatSupport`\n    *   `@BinarySearchSeeker.TimestampSearchResult.Type`\n    *   `@BufferReplacementMode`\n    *   `@C.BufferFlags`\n    *   `@C.ColorRange`\n    *   `@C.ColorSpace`\n    *   `@C.ColorTransfer`\n    *   `@C.CryptoMode`\n    *   `@C.Encoding`\n    *   `@C.PcmEncoding`\n    *   `@C.Projection`\n    *   `@C.SelectionReason`\n    *   `@C.StereoMode`\n    *   `@C.VideoOutputMode`\n    *   `@CacheDataSource.Flags`\n    *   `@CaptionStyleCompat.EdgeType`\n    *   `@DataSpec.Flags`\n    *   `@DataSpec.HttpMethods`\n    *   `@DecoderDiscardReasons`\n    *   `@DecoderReuseResult`\n    *   `@DefaultAudioSink.OutputMode`\n    *   `@DefaultDrmSessionManager.Mode`\n    *   `@DefaultTrackSelector.SelectionEligibility`\n    *   `@DefaultTsPayloadReaderFactory.Flags`\n    *   `@EGLSurfaceTexture.SecureMode`\n    *   `@EbmlProcessor.ElementType`\n    *   `@ExoMediaDrm.KeyRequest.RequestType`\n    *   `@ExtensionRendererMode`\n    *   `@Extractor.ReadResult`\n    *   `@FileTypes.Type`\n    *   `@FlacExtractor.Flags` (in `com.google.android.exoplayer2.ext.flac`\n        package)\n    *   `@FlacExtractor.Flags` (in\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer2.extractor.flac` package)\n    *   `@FragmentedMp4Extractor.Flags`\n    *   `@HlsMediaPlaylist.PlaylistType`\n    *   `@HttpDataSourceException.Type`\n    *   `@IllegalClippingException.Reason`\n    *   `@IllegalMergeException.Reason`\n    *   `@LoadErrorHandlingPolicy.FallbackType`\n    *   `@MatroskaExtractor.Flags`\n    *   `@Mp3Extractor.Flags`\n    *   `@Mp4Extractor.Flags`\n    *   `@NotificationUtil.Importance`\n    *   `@PlaybackException.FieldNumber`\n    *   `@PlayerNotificationManager.Priority`\n    *   `@PlayerNotificationManager.Visibility`\n    *   `@PlayerView.ShowBuffering`\n    *   `@Renderer.State`\n    *   `@RendererCapabilities.AdaptiveSupport`\n    *   `@RendererCapabilities.Capabilities`\n    *   `@RendererCapabilities.DecoderSupport`\n    *   `@RendererCapabilities.FormatSupport`\n    *   `@RendererCapabilities.HardwareAccelerationSupport`\n    *   `@RendererCapabilities.TunnelingSupport`\n    *   `@SampleStream.ReadDataResult`\n    *   `@SampleStream.ReadFlags`\n    *   `@StyledPlayerView.ShowBuffering`\n    *   `@SubtitleView.ViewType`\n    *   `@TextAnnotation.Position`\n    *   `@TextEmphasisSpan.MarkFill`\n    *   `@TextEmphasisSpan.MarkShape`\n    *   `@Track.Transformation`\n    *   `@TrackOutput.SampleDataPart`\n    *   `@Transformer.ProgressState`\n    *   `@TsExtractor.Mode`\n    *   `@TsPayloadReader.Flags`\n    *   `@WebvttCssStyle.FontSizeUnit`\n\n### 2.16.1 (2021-11-18)\n\n*   Core Library:\n    *   Fix track selection issue where overriding one track group did not\n        disable other track groups of the same type\n        ([#9675](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9675)).\n    *   Fix track selection issue where a mixture of non-empty and empty track\n        overrides is not applied correctly\n        ([#9649](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9649)).\n    *   Add protected method `DefaultRenderersFactory.getCodecAdapterFactory()`\n        so that subclasses of `DefaultRenderersFactory` that override\n        `buildVideoRenderers()` or `buildAudioRenderers()` can access the codec\n        adapter factory and pass it to `MediaCodecRenderer` instances they\n        create.\n    *   Propagate ICY header fields `name` and `genre` to\n        `MediaMetadata.station` and `MediaMetadata.genre` respectively so that\n        they reach the app via `Player.Listener.onMediaMetadataChanged()`\n        ([#9677](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9677)).\n    *   Remove null keys from `DefaultHttpDataSource#getResponseHeaders`.\n*   Extractors:\n    *   WAV: Add support for RF64 streams\n        ([#9543](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9543)).\n*   DASH:\n    *   Add parsed essential and supplemental properties to the `Representation`\n        ([#9579](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9579)).\n*   HLS:\n    *   Correctly populate `Format.label` for audio only HLS streams\n        ([#9608](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9608)).\n\n### 2.16.0 (2021-11-04)\n\n*   Core Library:\n    *   Deprecate `SimpleExoPlayer`. All functionality has been moved to\n        `ExoPlayer` instead. `ExoPlayer.Builder` can be used instead of\n        `SimpleExoPlayer.Builder`.\n    *   Add track selection methods to the `Player` interface, for example,\n        `Player.getCurrentTracksInfo` and `Player.setTrackSelectionParameters`.\n        These methods can be used instead of directly accessing the track\n        selector.\n    *   Enable MediaCodec asynchronous queueing by default on devices with API\n        level >= 31. Add methods in `DefaultMediaCodecRendererFactory` and\n        `DefaultRenderersFactory` to force enable or force disable asynchronous\n        queueing ([6348](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/6348)).\n    *   Remove final dependency on `jcenter()`.\n    *   Fix `mediaMetadata` being reset when media is repeated\n        ([#9458](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9458)).\n    *   Adjust `ExoPlayer` `MediaMetadata` update priority, such that values\n        input through the `MediaItem.MediaMetadata` are used above media derived\n        values.\n    *   Move `com.google.android.exoplayer2.device.DeviceInfo` to\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer2.DeviceInfo`.\n    *   Move `com.google.android.exoplayer2.drm.DecryptionException` to\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer2.decoder.CryptoException`.\n    *   Move `com.google.android.exoplayer2.upstream.cache.CachedRegionTracker`\n        to `com.google.android.exoplayer2.upstream.CachedRegionTracker`.\n    *   Move `Player.addListener(EventListener)` and\n        `Player.removeListener(EventListener)` out of `Player` into subclasses.\n*   Android 12 compatibility:\n    *   Keep `DownloadService` started and in the foreground whilst waiting for\n        requirements to be met on Android 12. This is necessary due to new\n        [foreground service launch restrictions](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/foreground-services).\n        `DownloadService.getScheduler` will not be called on Android 12 devices.\n    *   Disable platform transcoding when playing content URIs on Android 12.\n    *   Add `ExoPlayer.setVideoChangeFrameRateStrategy` to allow disabling of\n        calls from the player to `Surface.setFrameRate`. This is useful for\n        applications wanting to call `Surface.setFrameRate` directly from\n        application code with Android 12's `Surface.CHANGE_FRAME_RATE_ALWAYS`.\n    *   Upgrade the WorkManager extension to depend on\n        `androidx.work:work-runtime:2.7.0`. Earlier versions of `work-runtime`\n        are not compatible with apps targeting Android 12, and will crash with\n        an `IllegalArgumentException` when creating `PendingIntent`s\n        ([#9181](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9181)).\n*   Video:\n    *   Fix bug in `MediaCodecVideoRenderer` that resulted in re-using a\n        released `Surface` when playing without an app-provided `Surface`\n        ([#9476](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9476)).\n*   DRM:\n    *   Log an error (instead of throwing `IllegalStateException`) when calling\n        `DefaultDrmSession#release()` on a fully released session\n        ([#9392](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9392)).\n*   UI:\n    *   `SubtitleView` no longer implements `TextOutput`. `SubtitleView`\n        implements `Player.Listener`, so can be registered to a player with\n        `Player.addListener`.\n    *   Fix initial timestamp display in `PlayerControlView`\n        ([#9524](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9254)).\n    *   Fix capitalization of languages in the track selector\n        ([#9452](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9452)).\n*   Extractors:\n    *   MP4: Correctly handle HEVC tracks with pixel aspect ratios other than 1.\n    *   MP4: Add support for Dolby TrueHD (only for unfragmented streams)\n        ([#9496](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9496)).\n    *   MP4: Avoid throwing `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException` when parsing\n        invalid `colr` boxes produced by some device cameras\n        ([#9332](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9332)).\n    *   MP4: Parse HDR static metadata from the `clli` and `mdcv` boxes.\n    *   TS: Correctly handle HEVC tracks with pixel aspect ratios other than 1.\n    *   TS: Map stream type 0x80 to H262\n        ([#9472](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9472)).\n*   Downloads and caching:\n    *   Modify `DownloadService` behavior when `DownloadService.getScheduler`\n        returns `null`, or returns a `Scheduler` that does not support the\n        requirements for downloads to continue.

Use identically named\n        constants in `C` instead.\n    *   Remove `C.MSG_*` constants. Use identically named constants in\n        `Renderer` instead, except for `C.MSG_SET_SURFACE`, which is replaced\n        with `Renderer.MSG_SET_VIDEO_OUTPUT`.\n    *   Remove `DeviceListener`. Use `Player.Listener` instead.\n    *   Remove `CacheDataSourceFactory`. Use `CacheDataSource.Factory` instead.\n    *   Remove `CacheDataSinkFactory`.

Use\n        `HttpDataSource.Factory.setDefaultRequestProperties` instead.\n    *   Remove `GvrAudioProcessor` and the GVR extension, which has been\n        deprecated since 2.11.0.\n    *   Remove `DownloadService.onDownloadChanged` and\n        `DownloadService.onDownloadRemoved`. Instead, use\n        `DownloadManager.addListener` to register a listener directly to the\n        `DownloadManager` returned through `DownloadService.getDownloadManager`.\n    *   Remove `Player.getCurrentStaticMetadata`,\n        `Player.Listener.onStaticMetadataChanged` and\n        `Player.EVENT_STATIC_METADATA_CHANGED`. Use `Player.getMediaMetadata`,\n        `Player.Listener.onMediaMetadataChanged` and\n        `Player.EVENT_MEDIA_METADATA_CHANGED` for convenient access to\n        structured metadata, or access the raw static metadata directly from the\n        `TrackSelection#getFormat()`.\n    *   Remove `ControlDispatcher` and `DefaultControlDispatcher`. Operations\n        can be customized by using a `ForwardingPlayer`, or when configuring the\n        player (for example by using\n        `ExoPlayer.Builder.setSeekBackIncrementMs`).\n\n### 2.15.1 (2021-09-20)\n\n*   Core Library:\n    *   Fix track selection in `StyledPlayerControlView` when using\n        `ForwardingPlayer`.\n    *   Fix `FlagSet#equals` on API levels below 24.\n    *   Fix `NullPointerException` being thrown from `CacheDataSource` when\n        reading a fully cached resource with `DataSpec.position` equal to the\n        resource length.\n    *   Fix a bug when [depending on ExoPlayer locally](README.md#locally) with\n        a relative path\n        ([#9403](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9403)).\n    *   Better handle invalid seek requests.

Such content\n        is malformed and should be re-encoded.\n    *   Improve support for truncated Ogg streams\n        ([#7608](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7608)).\n    *   Add support for MP4 H263 atom type\n        ([#9158](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9158)).\n    *   Fix issue around TS synchronization when reading a file's duration\n        ([#9100](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/9100)).\n*   HLS:\n    *   Fix issue where playback of a live event could become stuck rather than\n        transitioning to `STATE_ENDED` when the event ends\n        ([#9067](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9067)).\n    *   Fix issue where a new initialization segment, as specified by an\n        `EXT-X-MAP` tag in a media playlist, would not be loaded when\n        encountered during playback\n        ([#9004](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9004)).\n    *   Forward the `FRAME-RATE` value from the master playlist to renditions.\n        ([#8960](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8960)).\n    *   Fix issue where HLS events would start at positions greater than\n        specified by an `EXT-X-START` tag when placed in a playlist\n        ([#9037](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9037)).\n*   Ad playback:\n    *   Use the content URI when auto-generating an ad ID (in addition to the\n        media ID and ad tag URI)\n        ([#9106](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9106).\n*   DRM:\n    *   Allow repeated provisioning in `DefaultDrmSession(Manager)`.\n    *   Fix a crash due to `DefaultDrmSessionManager.release()` incorrectly\n        releasing too many keep-alive `DefaultDrmSession` references, resulting\n        in `DefaultDrmSession.release()` throwing an `IllegalStateException`\n        ([#9193](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9193)).\n*   Metadata:\n    *   Fix handling of emsg messages with an unset duration\n        ([#9123](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9123)).\n*   UI:\n    *   Add `PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE` when creating broadcast intents in\n        `PlayerNotificationManager`. This is required by a\n        [behaviour change](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/behavior-changes-12#pending-intent-mutability)\n        in Android 12.\n    *   Fix focusability of `StyledPlayerView` and `StyledPlayerControlView`\n        popup menus on API levels prior to 26\n        ([#9061](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9061)).\n    *   Fix progress bar flickering immediately after the user seeks\n        ([#9049](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/9049)).\n    *   Fix `StyledPlayerView` and `StyledPlayerControlView` popup menu items\n        not expanding to occupy the full width of the popup\n        ([#9086](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9086)).\n    *   Don't propagate `AttributeSet` from `SubtitleView` constructor into\n        `CanvasSubtitleOutput`. Just passing the `Context` is enough, and\n        ensures programmatic changes to the `SubtitleView` will propagate down.\n*   RTSP:\n    *   Fix session description (SDP) parsing to use a HashMap-like behaviour\n        for duplicated attributes.\n        ([#9014](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9014)).\n    *   Allow using absolute URI in the control attribute in a media description\n        ([#9183](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/9183)).\n    *   Allow the timeout to be customised via\n        `RtspMediaSource.Factory.setTimeoutMs`.\n\n### 2.14.1 (2021-06-11)\n\n*   Core Library:\n    *   Fix gradle config to allow specifying a relative path for\n        `exoplayerRoot` when [depending on ExoPlayer locally](README.md#locally)\n        ([#8927](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8927)).\n    *   Update `MediaItem.Builder` javadoc to discourage calling setters that\n        will be (currently) ignored if another setter is not also called.\n*   Extractors:\n    *   Add support for MPEG-H 3D Audio in MP4 extractors\n        ([#8860](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/8860)).\n*   Video:\n    *   Fix bug that could cause `CodecException: Error 0xffffffff` to be thrown\n        from `MediaCodec.native_setSurface` in use cases that involve both\n        swapping the output `Surface` and a mixture of secure and non-secure\n        content being played\n        ([#8776](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8776)).\n*   HLS:\n    *   Use the `PRECISE` attribute in `EXT-X-START` to select the default start\n        position.\n    *   Fix a bug where skipping into spliced-in chunks triggered an assertion\n        error ([#8937](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8937)).\n*   DRM:\n    *   Keep secure `MediaCodec` instances initialized when disabling (but not\n        resetting) `MediaCodecRenderer`. This helps re-use secure decoders in\n        more contexts, which avoids the 'black flash' caused by detaching a\n        `Surface` from a secure decoder on some devices\n        ([#8842](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8842)). It will also\n        result in DRM license refresh network requests while the player is\n        stopped if `Player#setForegroundMode` is true.\n    *   Fix issue where offline keys were unnecessarily (and incorrectly)\n        restored into a session before being released. This call sequence is\n        explicitly disallowed in OEMCrypto v16.\n*   UI:\n    *   Keep subtitle language features embedded (e.g. rubies & tate-chu-yoko)\n        in `Cue.text` even when `SubtitleView#setApplyEmbeddedStyles()` is\n        `false`.\n    *   Fix `NullPointerException` in `StyledPlayerView` that could occur after\n        calling `StyledPlayerView.setPlayer(null)`\n        ([#8985](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8985)).\n*   RTSP:\n    *   Add support for RTSP basic and digest authentication\n        ([#8941](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8941)).\n    *   Enable using repeat mode and playlist with RTSP\n        ([#8994](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8994)).\n    *   Add `RtspMediaSource.Factory` option to set the RTSP user agent.\n    *   Add `RtspMediaSource.Factory` option to force using TCP for streaming.\n*   GL demo app:\n    *   Fix texture transformation to avoid green bars shown on some videos\n        ([#8992](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8992)).\n\n### 2.14.0 (2021-05-13)\n\n*   Core Library:\n    *   Move `Player` components to `ExoPlayer`. For example\n        `Player.VideoComponent` is now `ExoPlayer.VideoComponent`.\n    *   The most used methods of `Player`'s audio, video, text and metadata\n        components have been added directly to `Player`.\n    *   Add `Player.getAvailableCommands`, `Player.isCommandAvailable` and\n        `Listener.onAvailableCommandsChanged` to query which commands that can\n        be executed on the player.\n    *   Add a `Player.Listener` interface to receive all player events.\n        Component listeners and `EventListener` have been deprecated.\n    *   Add `Player.getMediaMetadata`, which returns a combined and structured\n        `MediaMetadata` object. Changes to metadata are reported to\n        `Listener.onMediaMetadataChanged`.\n    *   `Player.setPlaybackParameters` no longer accepts null, use\n        `PlaybackParameters.DEFAULT` instead.\n    *   Report information about the old and the new playback positions to\n        `Listener.onPositionDiscontinuity`. Add `DISCONTINUITY_REASON_SKIP` and\n        `DISCONTINUITY_REASON_REMOVE` as discontinuity reasons, and rename\n        `DISCONTINUITY_REASON_PERIOD_TRANSITION` to\n        `DISCONTINUITY_REASON_AUTO_TRANSITION`. Remove\n        `DISCONTINUITY_REASON_AD_INSERTION`, for which\n        `DISCONTINUITY_REASON_AUTO_TRANSITION` is used instead\n        ([#6163](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/6163),\n        [#4768](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4768)).\n    *   Deprecate `ExoPlayer.Builder`. Use `SimpleExoPlayer.Builder` instead.\n    *   Move `Player.getRendererCount` and `Player.getRendererType` to\n        `ExoPlayer`.\n    *   Use an empty string instead of the URI if the media ID is not explicitly\n        set with `MediaItem.Builder.setMediaId(String)`.\n    *   Remove `MediaCodecRenderer.configureCodec()` and add\n        `MediaCodecRenderer.getMediaCodecConfiguration()`. The new method is\n        called just before the `MediaCodec` is created and returns the\n        parameters needed to create and configure the `MediaCodec` instance.\n        Applications can override `MediaCodecRenderer.onCodecInitialized()` to\n        be notified after a `MediaCodec` is initialized, or they can inject a\n        custom `MediaCodecAdapter.Factory` if they want to control how the\n        `MediaCodec` is configured.\n    *   Promote `AdaptiveTrackSelection.AdaptationCheckpoint` to `public`\n        visibility to allow Kotlin subclasses of\n        `AdaptiveTrackSelection.Factory`\n        ([#8830](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8830)).\n    *   Fix bug when transitions from content to ad periods called\n        `onMediaItemTransition` by mistake.\n    *   `AdsLoader.AdViewProvider` and `AdsLoader.OverlayInfo` have been renamed\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer2.ui.AdViewProvider` and\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer2.ui.AdOverlayInfo` respectively.\n    *   `CaptionStyleCompat` has been moved to the\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer2.ui` package.\n    *   `DebugTextViewHelper` has been moved from the `ui` package to the `util`\n        package.\n*   RTSP:\n    *   Initial support for RTSP playbacks\n        ([#55](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/55)).\n*   Downloads and caching:\n    *   Fix `CacheWriter` to correctly handle cases where the request `DataSpec`\n        extends beyond the end of the underlying resource. Caching will now\n        succeed in this case, with data up to the end of the resource being\n        cached. This behaviour is enabled by default, and so the\n        `allowShortContent` parameter has been removed\n        ([#7326](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7326)).\n    *   Fix `CacheWriter` to correctly handle `DataSource.close` failures, for\n        which it cannot be assumed that data was successfully written to the\n        cache.\n*   DRM:\n    *   Prepare DRM sessions (and fetch keys) ahead of the playback position\n        ([#4133](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4133)).\n    *   Only dispatch DRM session acquire and release events once per period\n        when playing content that uses the same encryption keys for both audio &\n        video tracks. Previously, separate acquire and release events were\n        dispatched for each track in each period.\n    *   Include the session state in DRM session-acquired listener methods.\n*   UI:\n    *   Add `PlayerNotificationManager.Builder`, with the ability to specify\n        which group the notification should belong to.\n    *   Remove `setUseSensorRotation` from `PlayerView` and `StyledPlayerView`.\n        Instead, cast the view returned by `getVideoSurfaceView` to\n        `SphericalGLSurfaceView`, and then call `setUseSensorRotation` on the\n        `SphericalGLSurfaceView` directly.\n*   Analytics:\n    *   Add `onAudioCodecError` and `onVideoCodecError` to `AnalyticsListener`.\n*   Video:\n    *   Add `Player.getVideoSize()` to retrieve the current size of the video\n        stream. Add `Listener.onVideoSizeChanged(VideoSize)` and deprecate\n        `Listener.onVideoSizeChanged(int, int, int, float)`.\n*   Audio:\n    *   Report unexpected audio discontinuities to\n        `AnalyticsListener.onAudioSinkError`\n        ([#6384](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/6384)).\n    *   Allow forcing offload for gapless content even if gapless playback is\n        not supported.\n    *   Allow fall back from DTS-HD to DTS when playing via passthrough.\n*   Text:\n    *   Fix overlapping lines when using `SubtitleView.VIEW_TYPE_WEB`.\n    *   Parse SSA/ASS underline & strikethrough info in `Style:` lines\n        ([#8435](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8435)).\n    *   Ensure TTML `tts:textAlign` is correctly propagated from `<p>` nodes to\n        child nodes.\n    *   Support TTML `ebutts:multiRowAlign` attributes.\n*   Allow the use of Android platform extractors through\n    [MediaParser](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaParser).\n    Only supported on API 30+.\n    *   You can use platform extractors for progressive media by passing\n        `MediaParserExtractorAdapter.FACTORY` when creating a\n        `ProgressiveMediaSource.Factory`.\n    *   You can use platform extractors for HLS by passing\n        `MediaParserHlsMediaChunkExtractor.FACTORY` when creating a\n        `HlsMediaSource.Factory`.\n    *   You can use platform extractors for DASH by passing a\n        `DefaultDashChunkSource` that uses `MediaParserChunkExtractor.FACTORY`\n        when creating a `DashMediaSource.Factory`.\n*   Cast extension:\n    *   Trigger `onMediaItemTransition` event for all reasons except\n        `MEDIA_ITEM_TRANSITION_REASON_REPEAT`.\n*   MediaSession extension:\n    *   Remove dependency on `exoplayer-core`, relying only `exoplayer-common`\n        instead. To achieve this, `TimelineQueueEditor` uses a new\n        `MediaDescriptionConverter` interface, and no longer relies on\n        `ConcatenatingMediaSource`.\n*   Remove deprecated symbols:\n    *   Remove `ExoPlayerFactory`. Use `SimpleExoPlayer.Builder` instead.\n    *   Remove `Player.DefaultEventListener`. Use `Player.Listener` instead.\n    *   Remove `ExtractorMediaSource`. Use `ProgressiveMediaSource` instead.\n    *   Remove `DefaultMediaSourceEventListener`. Use `MediaSourceEventListener`\n        instead.\n    *   Remove `DashManifest` constructor. Use the remaining constructor with\n        `programInformation` and `serviceDescription` set to `null` instead.\n    *   Remove `CryptoInfo.getFrameworkCryptoInfoV16`. Use\n        `CryptoInfo.getFrameworkCryptoInfo` instead.\n    *   Remove `NotificationUtil.createNotificationChannel(Context, String, int,\n        int)`. Use `createNotificationChannel(Context, String, int, int, int)`\n        instead.\n    *   Remove `PlayerNotificationManager.setNotificationListener`. Use\n        `PlayerNotificationManager.Builder.setNotificationListener` instead.\n    *   Remove `PlayerNotificationManager.NotificationListener`\n        `onNotificationStarted(int, Notification)` and\n        `onNotificationCancelled(int)`. Use `onNotificationPosted(int,\n        Notification, boolean)` and `onNotificationCancelled(int, boolean)`\n        instead.\n    *   Remove `DownloadNotificationUtil`.

A\n        warning will be logged by `SingleSampleMediaPeriod` whenever a load\n        error is treated as though the end of the stream has been reached.\n    *   Time out on release to prevent ANRs if an underlying platform call is\n        stuck ([#4352](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4352)).\n    *   Time out when detaching a surface to prevent ANRs if the underlying\n        platform call is stuck\n        ([#5887](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/5887)).\n    *   Fix bug where `AnalyticsListener` callbacks could arrive in the wrong\n        order ([#8048](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8048)).\n*   Media transformation:\n    *   Add a new `transformer` module for converting media streams. The\n        initially available transformations are changing the container format,\n        removing tracks, and slow motion flattening.\n*   Low latency live streaming:\n    *   Support low-latency DASH (also known as ULL-CMAF) and Apple's\n        low-latency HLS extension.\n    *   Add `LiveConfiguration` to `MediaItem` to define live offset and\n        playback speed adjustment parameters. The same parameters can be set on\n        `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` to apply for all `MediaItems`.\n    *   Add `LivePlaybackSpeedControl` to control playback speed adjustments\n        during live playbacks. Such adjustments allow the player to stay close\n        to the live offset. `DefaultLivePlaybackSpeedControl` is provided as a\n        default implementation.\n    *   Add `targetLiveOffsetUs` parameter to `LoadControl.shouldStartPlayback`.\n*   Extractors:\n    *   Populate codecs string for H.264/AVC in MP4, Matroska and FLV streams to\n        allow decoder capability checks based on codec profile and level\n        ([#8393](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8393)).\n    *   Populate codecs string for H.265/HEVC in MP4, Matroska and MPEG-TS\n        streams to allow decoder capability checks based on codec profile and\n        level ([#8393](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8393)).\n    *   Add support for playing JPEG motion photos\n        ([#5405](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/5405)).\n    *   Handle sample size mismatches between raw audio `stsd` information and\n        `stsz` fixed sample size in MP4 extractors.\n    *   Fix Vorbis private codec data parsing in the Matroska extractor\n        ([#8496](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8496)).\n*   Track selection:\n    *   Move `Player.getTrackSelector` to the `ExoPlayer` interface.\n    *   Move the mutable parts of `TrackSelection` into an `ExoTrackSelection`\n        subclass.\n    *   Allow parallel adaptation of video and audio\n        ([#5111](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/5111)).\n    *   Simplify enabling tunneling with `DefaultTrackSelector`.\n        `ParametersBuilder.setTunnelingAudioSessionId` has been replaced with\n        `ParametersBuilder.setTunnelingEnabled`. The player's audio session ID\n        will be used, and so a tunneling specific ID is no longer needed.\n    *   Add additional configuration parameters to `DefaultTrackSelector`.\n        `DefaultTrackSelector.ParametersBuilder` now includes:\n        *   `setPreferredVideoMimeType`, `setPreferredVideoMimeTypes`,\n            `setPreferredAudioMimeType` and `setPreferredAudioMimeTypes` for\n            specifying preferred video and audio MIME type(s)\n            ([#8320](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8320)).\n        *   `setPreferredAudioLanguages` and `setPreferredTextLanguages` for\n            specifying multiple preferred audio and text languages.\n        *   `setPreferredAudioRoleFlags` for specifying preferred audio role\n            flags.\n    *   Forward `Timeline` and `MediaPeriodId` to `TrackSelection.Factory`.\n*   DASH:\n    *   Support low-latency DASH playback (`availabilityTimeOffset` and\n        `ServiceDescription` tags)\n        ([#4904](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4904)).\n    *   Improve logic for determining whether to refresh the manifest when a\n        chunk load error occurs in a live streams that contains EMSG data\n        ([#8408](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8408)).\n*   HLS:\n    *   Support playlist delta updates, blocking playlist reloads and rendition\n        reports.\n    *   Support low-latency HLS playback (`EXT-X-PART` and preload hints)\n        ([#5011](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/5011)).\n*   UI:\n    *   Improve `StyledPlayerControlView` button animations.\n    *   Miscellaneous fixes for `StyledPlayerControlView` in minimal mode.\n*   DRM:\n    *   Fix playback failure when switching from PlayReady protected content to\n        Widevine or Clearkey protected content in a playlist.\n    *   Add `ExoMediaDrm.KeyRequest.getRequestType`\n        ([#7847](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7847)).\n    *   Drop key and provision responses if `DefaultDrmSession` is released\n        while waiting for the response. This prevents harmless log messages of\n        the form: `IllegalStateException: sending message to a Handler on a dead\n        thread` ([#8328](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8328)).\n    *   Allow apps to fully customize DRM behaviour for each `MediaItem` by\n        passing a `DrmSessionManagerProvider` to `MediaSourceFactory`\n        ([#8466](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8466)).\n*   Analytics:\n    *   Add an `onEvents` callback to `Player.EventListener` and\n        `AnalyticsListener`. When one or more player states change\n        simultaneously, `onEvents` is called once after all of the callbacks\n        associated with the individual state changes.\n    *   Pass a `DecoderReuseEvaluation` to `AnalyticsListener`'s\n        `onVideoInputFormatChanged` and `onAudioInputFormatChanged` methods. The\n        `DecoderReuseEvaluation` indicates whether it was possible to re-use an\n        existing decoder instance for the new format, and if not then the\n        reasons why.\n*   Video:\n    *   Fall back to AVC/HEVC decoders for Dolby Vision streams with level 10 to\n        13 ([#8530](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8530)).\n    *   Fix VP9 format capability checks on API level 23 and earlier. The\n        platform does not correctly report the VP9 level supported by the\n        decoder in this case, so we estimate it based on the decoder's maximum\n        supported bitrate.\n*   Audio:\n    *   Fix handling of audio session IDs\n        ([#8190](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8190)).\n        `SimpleExoPlayer` now generates an audio session ID on construction,\n        which can be immediately queried by calling\n        `SimpleExoPlayer.getAudioSessionId`. The audio session ID will only\n        change if application code calls `SimpleExoPlayer.setAudioSessionId`.\n    *   Replace `onAudioSessionId` with `onAudioSessionIdChanged` in\n        `AudioListener` and `AnalyticsListener`. Note that\n        `onAudioSessionIdChanged` is called in fewer cases than\n        `onAudioSessionId` was called, due to the improved handling of audio\n        session IDs as described above.\n    *   Retry playback after some types of `AudioTrack` error.\n    *   Create E-AC3 JOC passthrough `AudioTrack` instances using the maximum\n        supported channel count (instead of assuming 6 channels) from API 29.\n*   Text:\n    *   Add support for the SSA `primaryColour` style attribute\n        ([#8435](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8435)).\n    *   Fix CEA-708 sequence number discontinuity handling\n        ([#1807](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1807)).\n    *   Fix CEA-708 handling of unexpectedly small packets\n        ([#1807](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1807)).\n*   Data sources:\n    *   For `HttpDataSource` implementations, default to using the user agent of\n        the underlying network stack.\n    *   Deprecate `HttpDataSource.Factory.getDefaultRequestProperties`.\n        `HttpDataSource.Factory.setDefaultRequestProperties` instead.\n    *   Add `DefaultHttpDataSource.Factory` and deprecate\n        `DefaultHttpDataSourceFactory`.\n*   Metadata retriever:\n    *   Parse Google Photos HEIC and JPEG motion photo metadata.\n*   IMA extension:\n    *   Add support for playback of ads in playlists\n        ([#3750](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3750)).\n    *   Add `ImaAdsLoader.Builder.setEnableContinuousPlayback` for setting\n        whether to request ads for continuous playback.\n    *   Upgrade IMA SDK dependency to 3.22.0. This fixes leaking of the ad view\n        group ([#7344](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7344),\n        [#8339](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8339)).\n    *   Fix a bug that could cause the next content position played after a seek\n        to snap back to the cue point of the preceding ad, rather than the\n        requested content position.\n    *   Fix a regression that caused an ad group to be skipped after an initial\n        seek to a non-zero position. Unsupported VPAID ads will still be\n        skipped, but only after the preload timeout rather than instantly\n        ([#8428](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8428),\n        [#7832](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7832)).\n    *   Fix a regression that caused a short ad followed by another ad to be\n        skipped due to playback being stuck buffering waiting for the second ad\n        to load ([#8492](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8492)).\n*   FFmpeg extension:\n    *   Link the FFmpeg library statically, saving 350KB in binary size on\n        average.\n*   OkHttp extension:\n    *   Add `OkHttpDataSource.Factory` and deprecate `OkHttpDataSourceFactory`.\n*   Cronet extension:\n    *   Add `CronetDataSource.Factory` and deprecate `CronetDataSourceFactory`.\n    *   Support setting the user agent on `CronetDataSource.Factory` and\n        `CronetEngineWrapper`.\n*   MediaSession extension:\n    *   Support `setPlaybackSpeed(float)` and disable it by default. Use\n        `MediaSessionConnector.setEnabledPlaybackActions(long)` to enable\n        ([#8229](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/8229)).\n*   Remove deprecated symbols:\n    *   `AdaptiveMediaSourceEventListener`.

The new\n            methods for playlist manipulation are `setMediaItem(s)`,\n            `addMediaItem(s)`, `moveMediaItem(s)`, `removeMediaItem(s)` and\n            `clearMediaItems`. The playlist can be queried using\n            `getMediaItemCount` and `getMediaItemAt`. This API should be used\n            instead of `ConcatenatingMediaSource` in most cases. Learn more by\n            reading\n            [this blog post](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/a-top-level-playlist-api-for-exoplayer-abe0a24edb55).\n        *   Add `getCurrentMediaItem` for getting the currently playing item in\n            the playlist.\n        *   Add `EventListener.onMediaItemTransition` to report when playback\n            transitions from one item to another in the playlist.\n        *   Add `play` and `pause` convenience methods. They are equivalent to\n            `setPlayWhenReady(true)` and `setPlayWhenReady(false)` respectively.\n        *   Add `getCurrentLiveOffset` for getting the offset of the current\n            playback position from the live edge of a live stream.\n        *   Add `getTrackSelector` for getting the `TrackSelector` used by the\n            player.\n        *   Add `AudioComponent.setAudioSessionId` to set the audio session ID.\n            This method is also available on `SimpleExoPlayer`.\n        *   Remove `PlaybackParameters.skipSilence`, and replace it with\n            `AudioComponent.setSkipSilenceEnabled`. This method is also\n            available on `SimpleExoPlayer`. An\n            `AudioListener.onSkipSilenceEnabledChanged` callback is also added.\n        *   Add `TextComponent.getCurrentCues` to get the current cues. This\n            method is also available on `SimpleExoPlayer`. The current cues are\n            no longer automatically forwarded to a `TextOutput` when it's added\n            to a `SimpleExoPlayer`.\n        *   Add `Player.DeviceComponent` to query and control the device volume.\n            `SimpleExoPlayer` implements this interface.\n        *   Deprecate and rename `getPlaybackError` to `getPlayerError` for\n            consistency.\n        *   Deprecate and rename `onLoadingChanged` to `onIsLoadingChanged` for\n            consistency.\n        *   Deprecate `EventListener.onPlayerStateChanged`, replacing it with\n            `EventListener.onPlayWhenReadyChanged` and\n            `EventListener.onPlaybackStateChanged`.\n        *   Deprecate `EventListener.onSeekProcessed` because seek changes now\n            happen instantly and listening to `onPositionDiscontinuity` is\n            sufficient.\n    *   `ExoPlayer`:\n        *   Add `setMediaSource(s)` and `addMediaSource(s)` to `ExoPlayer`, for\n            adding `MediaSource` instances directly to the playlist.\n        *   Add `ExoPlayer.setPauseAtEndOfMediaItems` to let the player pause at\n            the end of each media item\n            ([#5660](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/5660)).\n        *   Allow passing `C.TIME_END_OF_SOURCE` to `PlayerMessage.setPosition`\n            to send a `PlayerMessage` at the end of a stream.\n    *   `SimpleExoPlayer`:\n        *   `SimpleExoPlayer` implements the new `MediaItem` based playlist API,\n            using a `MediaSourceFactory` to convert `MediaItem` instances to\n            playable `MediaSource` instances. A `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` is\n            used by default. `Builder.setMediaSourceFactory` allows setting a\n            custom factory.\n        *   Update [APK shrinking guide](https://exoplayer.dev/shrinking.html)\n            to explain how shrinking works with the new `MediaItem` and\n            `DefaultMediaSourceFactory` implementations\n            ([#7937](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7937)).\n        *   Add additional options to `Builder` that were previously only\n            accessible via setters.\n        *   Add opt-in to verify correct thread usage with\n            `setThrowsWhenUsingWrongThread(true)`\n            ([#4463](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4463)).\n    *   `Format`:\n        *   Add a `Builder` and deprecate all `create` methods and most\n            `Format.copyWith` methods.\n        *   Split `bitrate` into `averageBitrate` and `peakBitrate`\n            ([#2863](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2863)).\n    *   `LoadControl`:\n        *   Add a `playbackPositionUs` parameter to `shouldContinueLoading`.\n        *   Set the default minimum buffer duration in `DefaultLoadControl` to\n            50 seconds (equal to the default maximum buffer), and treat audio\n            and video the same.\n    *   Add a `MetadataRetriever` API for retrieving track information and\n        static metadata for a media item\n        ([#3609](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3609)).\n    *   Attach an identifier and extra information to load error events passed\n        to `LoadErrorHandlingPolicy`\n        ([#7309](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7309)).\n        `LoadErrorHandlingPolicy` implementations should migrate to implementing\n        the non-deprecated methods of the interface.\n    *   Add an option to `MergingMediaSource` to adjust the time offsets between\n        the merged sources\n        ([#6103](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/6103)).\n    *   Move `MediaSourceEventListener.LoadEventInfo` and\n        `MediaSourceEventListener.MediaLoadData` to be top-level classes in\n        `com.google.android.exoplayer2.source`.\n    *   Move `SimpleDecoderVideoRenderer` and `SimpleDecoderAudioRenderer` to\n        `DecoderVideoRenderer` and `DecoderAudioRenderer` respectively, and\n        generalize them to work with `Decoder` rather than `SimpleDecoder`.\n    *   Deprecate `C.MSG_*` constants, replacing them with constants in\n        `Renderer`.\n    *   Split the `library-core` module into `library-core`, `library-common`\n        and `library-extractor`. The `library-core` module has an API dependency\n        on both of the new modules, so this change should be transparent to\n        developers including ExoPlayer using Gradle dependencies.\n    *   Add a dependency on Guava.\n*   Video:\n    *   Pass frame rate hint to `Surface.setFrameRate` on Android 11.\n    *   Fix incorrect aspect ratio when transitioning from one video to another\n        with the same resolution, but a different pixel aspect ratio\n        ([#6646](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/6646)).\n*   Audio:\n    *   Add experimental support for power efficient playback using audio\n        offload.\n    *   Add support for using framework audio speed adjustment instead of\n        ExoPlayer's implementation\n        ([#7502](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7502)). This option\n        can be set using\n        `DefaultRenderersFactory.setEnableAudioTrackPlaybackParams`.\n    *   Add an event for the audio position starting to advance, to make it\n        easier for apps to determine when audio playout started\n        ([#7577](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7577)).\n    *   Generalize support for floating point audio.\n        *   Add an option to `DefaultAudioSink` for enabling floating point\n            output. This option can also be set using\n            `DefaultRenderersFactory.setEnableAudioFloatOutput`.\n        *   Add floating point output capability to `MediaCodecAudioRenderer`\n            and `LibopusAudioRenderer`, which is enabled automatically if the\n            audio sink supports floating point output and if it makes sense for\n            the content being played.\n        *   Enable the floating point output capability of `FfmpegAudioRenderer`\n            automatically if the audio sink supports floating point output and\n            if it makes sense for the content being played. The option to\n            manually enable floating point output has been removed, since this\n            now done with the generalized option on `DefaultAudioSink`.\n    *   In `MediaCodecAudioRenderer`, stop passing audio samples through\n        `MediaCodec` when playing PCM audio or encoded audio using passthrough\n        mode.\n    *   Reuse audio decoders when transitioning through playlists of gapless\n        audio, rather than reinstantiating them.\n    *   Check `DefaultAudioSink` supports passthrough, in addition to checking\n        the `AudioCapabilities`\n        ([#7404](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7404)).\n*   Text:\n    *   Many of the changes described below improve support for Japanese\n        subtitles. Read\n        [this blog post](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/improved-japanese-subtitle-support-7598fee12cf4)\n        to learn more.\n    *   Add a WebView-based output option to `SubtitleView`. This can display\n        some features not supported by the existing Canvas-based output such as\n        vertical text and rubies.

The tag of\n        the current window can be retrieved with `Player.getCurrentTag`.\n*   UI:\n    *   Add support for displaying error messages and a buffering spinner in\n        `PlayerView`.\n    *   Add support for listening to `AspectRatioFrameLayout`'s aspect ratio\n        update ([#3736](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3736)).\n    *   Add `PlayerNotificationManager` for displaying notifications reflecting\n        the player state.\n    *   Add `TrackSelectionView` for selecting tracks with\n        `DefaultTrackSelector`.\n    *   Add `TrackNameProvider` for converting track `Format`s to textual\n        descriptions, and `DefaultTrackNameProvider` as a default\n        implementation.\n*   Track selection:\n    *   Reworked `MappingTrackSelector` and `DefaultTrackSelector`.\n    *   `DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters` now implements `Parcelable`.\n    *   Added UI components for track selection (see above).\n*   Audio:\n    *   Support extracting data from AMR container formats, including both\n        narrow and wide band\n        ([#2527](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2527)).\n    *   FLAC:\n    *   Sniff FLAC files correctly if they have ID3 headers\n        ([#4055](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4055)).\n    *   Supports FLAC files with high sample rate (176400 and 192000)\n        ([#3769](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3769)).\n    *   Factor out `AudioTrack` position tracking from `DefaultAudioSink`.\n    *   Fix an issue where the playback position would pause just after playback\n        begins, and poll the audio timestamp less frequently once it starts\n        advancing ([#3841](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3841)).\n    *   Add an option to skip silent audio in `PlaybackParameters`\n        ([#2635](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2635)).\n    *   Fix an issue where playback of TrueHD streams would get stuck after\n        seeking due to not finding a syncframe\n        ([#3845](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3845)).\n    *   Fix an issue with eac3-joc playback where a codec would fail to\n        configure ([#4165](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4165)).\n    *   Handle non-empty end-of-stream buffers, to fix gapless playback of\n        streams with encoder padding when the decoder returns a non-empty final\n        buffer.\n    *   Allow trimming more than one sample when applying an elst audio edit via\n        gapless playback info.\n    *   Allow overriding skipping/scaling with custom `AudioProcessor`s\n        ([#3142](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3142)).\n*   Caching:\n    *   Add release method to the `Cache` interface, and prevent multiple\n        instances of `SimpleCache` using the same folder at the same time.\n    *   Cache redirect URLs\n        ([#2360](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2360)).\n*   DRM:\n    *   Allow multiple listeners for `DefaultDrmSessionManager`.\n    *   Pass `DrmSessionManager` to `ExoPlayerFactory` instead of\n        `RendererFactory`.\n    *   Change minimum API requirement for CBC and pattern encryption from 24 to\n        25 ([#4022](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4022)).\n    *   Fix handling of 307/308 redirects when making license requests\n        ([#4108](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4108)).\n*   HLS:\n    *   Fix playlist loading error propagation when the current selection does\n        not include all of the playlist's variants.\n    *   Fix SAMPLE-AES-CENC and SAMPLE-AES-CTR EXT-X-KEY methods\n        ([#4145](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4145)).\n    *   Preeptively declare an ID3 track in chunkless preparation\n        ([#4016](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4016)).\n    *   Add support for multiple #EXT-X-MAP tags in a media playlist\n        ([#4164](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4182)).\n    *   Fix seeking in live streams\n        ([#4187](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4187)).\n*   IMA extension:\n    *   Allow setting the ad media load timeout\n        ([#3691](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3691)).\n    *   Expose ad load errors via `MediaSourceEventListener` on\n        `AdsMediaSource`, and allow setting an ad event listener on\n        `ImaAdsLoader`. Deprecate the `AdsMediaSource.EventListener`.\n*   Add `AnalyticsListener` interface which can be registered in\n    `SimpleExoPlayer` to receive detailed metadata for each ExoPlayer event.\n*   Optimize seeking in FMP4 by enabling seeking to the nearest sync sample\n    within a fragment. This benefits standalone FMP4 playbacks, DASH and\n    SmoothStreaming.\n*   Updated default max buffer length in `DefaultLoadControl`.\n*   Fix ClearKey decryption error if the key contains a forward slash\n    ([#4075](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4075)).\n*   Fix crash when switching surface on Huawei P9 Lite\n    ([#4084](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4084)), and Philips\n    QM163E ([#4104](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4104)).\n*   Support ZLIB compressed PGS subtitles.\n*   Added `getPlaybackError` to `Player` interface.\n*   Moved initial bitrate estimate from `AdaptiveTrackSelection` to\n    `DefaultBandwidthMeter`.\n*   Removed default renderer time offset of 60000000 from internal player. The\n    actual renderer timestamp offset can be obtained by listening to\n    `BaseRenderer.onStreamChanged`.\n*   Added dependencies on checkerframework annotations for static code analysis.\n\n### 2.7.3 (2018-04-04)\n\n*   Fix ProGuard configuration for Cast, IMA and OkHttp extensions.\n*   Update OkHttp extension to depend on OkHttp 3.10.0.\n\n### 2.7.2 (2018-03-29)\n\n*   Gradle: Upgrade Gradle version from 4.1 to 4.4 so it can work with Android\n    Studio 3.1 ([#3708](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3708)).\n*   Match codecs starting with \"mp4a\" to different Audio MimeTypes\n    ([#3779](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3779)).\n*   Fix ANR issue on Redmi 4X and Redmi Note 4\n    ([#4006](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4006)).\n*   Fix handling of zero padded strings when parsing Matroska streams\n    ([#4010](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4010)).\n*   Fix \"Decoder input buffer too small\" error when playing some FLAC streams.\n*   MediaSession extension: Omit fast forward and rewind actions when media is\n    not seekable ([#4001](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/4001)).\n\n### 2.7.1 (2018-03-09)\n\n*   Gradle: Replaced 'compile' (deprecated) with 'implementation' and 'api'.\n    This may lead to build breakage for applications upgrading from previous\n    version that rely on indirect dependencies of certain modules. In such\n    cases, application developers need to add the missing dependency to their\n    gradle file. You can read more about the new dependency configurations\n    [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/gradle-plugin-3-0-0-migration.html#new_configurations).\n*   HlsMediaSource: Make HLS periods start at zero instead of the epoch.\n    Applications that rely on HLS timelines having a period starting at the\n    epoch will need to update their handling of HLS timelines. The program date\n    time is still available via the informational\n    `Timeline.Window.windowStartTimeMs` field\n    ([#3865](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3865),\n    [#3888](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3888)).\n*   Enable seeking in MP4 streams where duration is set incorrectly in the track\n    header ([#3926](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3926)).\n*   Video: Force rendering a frame periodically in `MediaCodecVideoRenderer` and\n    `LibvpxVideoRenderer`, even if it is late.\n\n### 2.7.0 (2018-02-19)\n\n*   Player interface:\n    *   Add optional parameter to `stop` to reset the player when stopping.\n    *   Add a reason to `EventListener.onTimelineChanged` to distinguish between\n        initial preparation, reset and dynamic updates.\n    *   Add `Player.DISCONTINUITY_REASON_AD_INSERTION` to the possible reasons\n        reported in `Eventlistener.onPositionDiscontinuity` to distinguish\n        transitions to and from ads within one period from transitions between\n        periods.\n    *   Replaced `ExoPlayer.sendMessages` with `ExoPlayer.createMessage` to\n        allow more customization of the message. Now supports setting a message\n        delivery playback position and/or a delivery handler\n        ([#2189](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2189)).\n    *   Add `Player.VideoComponent`, `Player.TextComponent` and\n        `Player.MetadataComponent` interfaces that define optional video, text\n        and metadata output functionality. New `getVideoComponent`,\n        `getTextComponent` and `getMetadataComponent` methods provide access to\n        this functionality.\n*   Add `ExoPlayer.setSeekParameters` for controlling how seek operations are\n    performed. The `SeekParameters` class contains defaults for exact seeking\n    and seeking to the closest sync points before, either side or after\n    specified seek positions. `SeekParameters` are not currently supported when\n    playing HLS streams.\n*   DefaultTrackSelector:\n    *   Replace `DefaultTrackSelector.Parameters` copy methods with a builder.\n    *   Support disabling of individual text track selection flags.\n*   Buffering:\n    *   Allow a back-buffer of media to be retained behind the current playback\n        position, for fast backward seeking. The back-buffer can be configured\n        by custom `LoadControl` implementations.\n    *   Add ability for `SequenceableLoader` to re-evaluate its buffer and\n        discard buffered media so that it can be re-buffered in a different\n        quality.\n    *   Allow more flexible loading strategy when playing media containing\n        multiple sub-streams, by allowing injection of custom\n        `CompositeSequenceableLoader` factories through\n        `DashMediaSource.Factory`, `HlsMediaSource.Factory`,\n        `SsMediaSource.Factory`, and `MergingMediaSource`.\n    *   Play out existing buffer before retrying for progressive live streams\n        ([#1606](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1606)).\n*   UI:\n    *   Generalized player and control views to allow them to bind with any\n        `Player`, and renamed them to `PlayerView` and `PlayerControlView`\n        respectively.\n    *   Made `PlayerView` automatically apply video rotation when configured to\n        use `TextureView`\n        ([#91](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/91)).\n    *   Made `PlayerView` play button behave correctly when the player is ended\n        ([#3689](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3689)), and call a\n        `PlaybackPreparer` when the player is idle.\n*   DRM: Optimistically attempt playback of DRM protected content that does not\n    declare scheme specific init data in the manifest. If playback of clear\n    samples without keys is allowed, delay DRM session error propagation until\n    keys are actually needed\n    ([#3630](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3630)).\n*   DASH:\n    *   Support in-band Emsg events targeting the player with scheme id\n        `urn:mpeg:dash:event:2012` and scheme values \"1\", \"2\" and \"3\".\n    *   Support EventStream elements in DASH manifests.\n*   HLS:\n    *   Add opt-in support for chunkless preparation in HLS. This allows an HLS\n        source to finish preparation without downloading any chunks, which can\n        significantly reduce initial buffering time\n        ([#3149](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3149)). More details\n        can be found\n        [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/faster-hls-preparation-f6611aa15ea6).\n    *   Fail if unable to sync with the Transport Stream, rather than entering\n        stuck in an indefinite buffering state.\n    *   Fix mime type propagation\n        ([#3653](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3653)).\n    *   Fix ID3 context reuse across segment format changes\n        ([#3622](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3622)).\n    *   Use long for media sequence numbers\n        ([#3747](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3747))\n    *   Add initial support for the EXT-X-GAP tag.\n*   Audio:\n    *   Support TrueHD passthrough for rechunked samples in Matroska files\n        ([#2147](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2147)).\n    *   Support resampling 24-bit and 32-bit integer to 32-bit float for high\n        resolution output in `DefaultAudioSink`\n        ([#3635](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/pull/3635)).\n*   Captions:\n    *   Basic support for PGS subtitles\n        ([#3008](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3008)).\n    *   Fix handling of CEA-608 captions where multiple buffers have the same\n        presentation timestamp\n        ([#3782](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3782)).\n*   Caching:\n    *   Fix cache corruption issue\n        ([#3762](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3762)).\n    *   Implement periodic check in `CacheDataSource` to see whether it's\n        possible to switch to reading/writing the cache having initially\n        bypassed it.\n*   IMA extension:\n    *   Fix the player getting stuck when an ad group fails to load\n        ([#3584](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3584)).\n    *   Work around loadAd not being called beore the LOADED AdEvent arrives\n        ([#3552](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3552)).\n    *   Handle asset mismatch errors\n        ([#3801](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3801)).\n    *   Add support for playing non-Extractor content MediaSources in the IMA\n        demo app ([#3676](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3676)).\n    *   Fix handling of ad tags where ad groups are out of order\n        ([#3716](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3716)).\n    *   Fix handling of ad tags with only preroll/postroll ad groups\n        ([#3715](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3715)).\n    *   Propagate ad media preparation errors to IMA so that the ads can be\n        skipped.\n    *   Handle exceptions in IMA callbacks so that can be logged less verbosely.\n*   New Cast extension. Simplifies toggling between local and Cast playbacks.\n*   `EventLogger` moved from the demo app into the core library.\n*   Fix ANR issue on the Huawei P8 Lite, Huawei Y6II, Moto C+, Meizu M5C, Lenovo\n    K4 Note and Sony Xperia E5.\n    ([#3724](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3724),\n    [#3835](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3835)).\n*   Fix potential NPE when removing media sources from a\n    DynamicConcatenatingMediaSource\n    ([#3796](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3796)).\n*   Check `sys.display-size` on Philips ATVs\n    ([#3807](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3807)).\n*   Release `Extractor`s on the loading thread to avoid potentially leaking\n    resources when the playback thread has quit by the time the loading task has\n    completed.\n*   ID3: Better handle malformed ID3 data\n    ([#3792](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3792)).\n*   Support 14-bit mode and little endianness in DTS PES packets\n    ([#3340](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3340)).\n*   Demo app: Add ability to download not DRM protected content.\n\n### 2.6.1 (2017-12-15)\n\n*   Add factories to `ExtractorMediaSource`, `HlsMediaSource`, `SsMediaSource`,\n    `DashMediaSource` and `SingleSampleMediaSource`.\n*   Use the same listener `MediaSourceEventListener` for all MediaSource\n    implementations.\n*   IMA extension:\n    *   Support non-ExtractorMediaSource ads\n        ([#3302](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3302)).\n    *   Skip ads before the ad preceding the player's initial seek position\n        ([#3527](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3527)).\n    *   Fix ad loading when there is no preroll.\n    *   Add an option to turn off hiding controls during ad playback\n        ([#3532](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3532)).\n    *   Support specifying an ads response instead of an ad tag\n        ([#3548](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3548)).\n    *   Support overriding the ad load timeout\n        ([#3556](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3556)).\n*   DASH: Support time zone designators in ISO8601 UTCTiming elements\n    ([#3524](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3524)).\n*   Audio:\n    *   Support 32-bit PCM float output from `DefaultAudioSink`, and add an\n        option to use this with `FfmpegAudioRenderer`.\n    *   Add support for extracting 32-bit WAVE files\n        ([#3379](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3379)).\n    *   Support extraction and decoding of Dolby Atmos\n        ([#2465](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2465)).\n    *   Fix handling of playback parameter changes while paused when followed by\n        a seek.\n*   SimpleExoPlayer: Allow multiple audio and video debug listeners.\n*   DefaultTrackSelector: Support undefined language text track selection when\n    the preferred language is not available\n    ([#2980](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2980)).\n*   Add options to `DefaultLoadControl` to set maximum buffer size in bytes and\n    to choose whether size or time constraints are prioritized.\n*   Use surfaceless context for secure `DummySurface`, if available\n    ([#3558](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3558)).\n*   FLV: Fix playback of live streams that do not contain an audio track\n    ([#3188](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3188)).\n*   CEA-608: Fix handling of row count changes in roll-up mode\n    ([#3513](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/3513)).\n*   Prevent period transitions when seeking to the end of a period when paused\n    ([#2439](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/2439)).\n\n### 2.6.0 (2017-11-03)\n\n*   Removed \"r\" prefix from versions.

It includes significant API\nand architectural changes, new features and many bug fixes. You can read about\nsome of the motivations behind ExoPlayer 2.x\n[here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-why-what-and-when-74fd9cb139#.am7h8nytm).\n\n*   Root package name changed to `com.google.android.exoplayer2`. The library\n    structure and class names have also been sanitized. Read more\n    [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-new-package-and-class-names-ef8e1d9ba96f#.lv8sd4nez).\n*   Key architectural changes:\n    *   Late binding between rendering and media source components. Allows the\n        same rendering components to be re-used from one playback to another.\n        Enables features such as gapless playback through playlists and DASH\n        multi-period support.\n    *   Improved track selection design. More details can be found\n        [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-track-selection-2b62ff712cc9#.n00zo76b6).\n    *   LoadControl now used to control buffering and loading across all\n        playback types.\n    *   Media source components given additional structure. A new MediaSource\n        class has been introduced. MediaSources expose Timelines that describe\n        the media they expose, and can consist of multiple MediaPeriods. This\n        enables features such as seeking in live playbacks and DASH multi-period\n        support.\n    *   Responsibility for loading the initial DASH/SmoothStreaming/HLS manifest\n        is promoted to the corresponding MediaSource components and is no longer\n        the application's responsibility.\n    *   Higher level abstractions such as SimpleExoPlayer have been added to the\n        library. These make the library easier to use for common use cases. The\n        demo app is halved in size as a result, whilst at the same time gaining\n        more functionality. Read more\n        [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-improved-demo-app-d97171aaaaa1).\n    *   Enhanced library support for implementing audio extensions. Read more\n        [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-new-audio-features-cfb26c2883a#.ua75vu4s3).\n    *   Format and MediaFormat are replaced by a single Format class.\n*   Key new features:\n    *   Playlist support. Includes support for gapless playback between playlist\n        items and consistent application of LoadControl and TrackSelector\n        policies when transitioning between items\n        ([#1270](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1270)).\n    *   Seeking in live playbacks for DASH and SmoothStreaming\n        ([#291](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/291)).\n    *   DASH multi-period support\n        ([#557](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/557)).\n    *   MediaSource composition allows MediaSources to be concatenated into a\n        playlist, merged and looped. Read more\n        [here](https://medium.com/google-exoplayer/exoplayer-2-x-mediasource-composition-6c285fcbca1f#.zfha8qupz).\n    *   Looping support (see above)\n        ([#490](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/490)).\n    *   Ability to query information about all tracks in a piece of media\n        (including those not supported by the device)\n        ([#1121](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1121)).\n    *   Improved player controls.\n    *   Support for PSSH in fMP4 moof atoms\n        ([#1143](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1143)).\n    *   Support for Opus in Ogg\n        ([#1447](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1447)).\n    *   CacheDataSource support for standalone media file playbacks (mp3, mp4\n        etc).\n    *   FFMPEG extension (for audio only).\n*   Key bug fixes:\n    *   Removed unnecessary secondary requests when playing standalone media\n        files ([#1041](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/1041)).\n    *   Fixed playback of video only (i.e. no audio) live streams\n        ([#758](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/758)).\n    *   Fixed silent failure when media buffer is too small\n        ([#583](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/583)).\n    *   Suppressed \"Sending message to a Handler on a dead thread\" warnings\n        ([#426](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/426)).\n\n# Legacy release notes\n\nNote: Since ExoPlayer V1 is still being maintained alongside V2, there is some\noverlap between these notes and the notes above. r2.0.0 followed from r1.5.11,\nand hence it can be assumed that all changes in r1.5.11 and earlier are included\nin all V2 releases.
