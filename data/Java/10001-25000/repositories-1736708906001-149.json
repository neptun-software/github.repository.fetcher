CAS is an\nenterprise multilingual identity provider and single sign-on solution for the web and attempts to \nbe a comprehensive platform for your authentication and authorization needs.\n\nCAS is an open and well-documented authentication protocol. The primary implementation of the protocol is an open-source Java server\ncomponent by the same name hosted here, with support for a plethora of additional authentication protocols and features such a SAML2, OpenID Connect, MFA \nand many many more.\n\n## Contributions\n\n[![Contributing Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributions-guide-green.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)][contribute]\n[![Open Pull Requests](https://img.shields.io/github/issues-pr/apereo/cas.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)][contribute]\n\n- [How to contribute][contribute]\n\nIf you have already identified an enhancement or a bug, it is STRONGLY recommended that you submit a pull request to address the case.\nThere is no need for special ceremony to create separate issues. The pull request IS the issue and it will be tracked and tagged as such.\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/apereo/cas/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=apereo/cas\" alt=\"Contributors\"/>\n</a>\n\n## Documentation [![Javadoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/Documentation-Javadoc-ff69b4.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=readme)][casjavadocs]\n\n| Version                                                                                    | Reference                                        |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|\n| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Development-WIP-blue.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github) | [Link](https://apereo.github.io/cas/development) |\n| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/7.1.x-Current-green.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)  | [Link](https://apereo.github.io/cas/7.1.x)       |\n| ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/7.0.x-Current-green.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)  | [Link](https://apereo.github.io/cas/7.0.x)       |\n\nAdditional resources are available as follows:\n\n- [Apereo Blog][blog]\n- [Release Notes][releasenotes]\n- [Support][cassupport]\n- [Maintenance Policy][maintenance]\n- [Release Schedule][releaseschedule]\n\n## Getting Started\n\n[![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/org.apereo.cas/cas-server-webapp?style=for-the-badge&logo=apachemaven)][casmavencentral]\n[![GitHub Releases](https://img.shields.io/github/release/apereo/cas.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)][githubreleases]\n\nIt is recommended to deploy CAS locally using the [WAR Overlay method][overlay].

If your /bin/sh is\n#       noncompliant, but you have some other compliant shell such as ksh or\n#       bash, then to run this script, type that shell name before the whole\n#       command line, like:\n#\n#           ksh Gradle\n#\n#       Busybox and similar reduced shells will NOT work, because this script\n#       requires all of these POSIX shell features:\n#         * functions;\n#         * expansions «$var», «${var}», «${var:-default}», «${var+SET}»,\n#           «${var#prefix}», «${var%suffix}», and «$( cmd )»;\n#         * compound commands having a testable exit status, especially «case»;\n#         * various built-in commands including «command», «set», and «ulimit».\n#\n#   Important for patching:\n#\n#   (2) This script targets any POSIX shell, so it avoids extensions provided\n#       by Bash, Ksh, etc; in particular arrays are avoided.\n#\n#       The \"traditional\" practice of packing multiple parameters into a\n#       space-separated string is a well documented source of bugs and security\n#       problems, so this is (mostly) avoided, by progressively accumulating\n#       options in \"$@\", and eventually passing that to Java.\n#\n#       Where the inherited environment variables (DEFAULT_JVM_OPTS, JAVA_OPTS,\n#       and GRADLE_OPTS) rely on word-splitting, this is performed explicitly;\n#       see the in-line comments for details.\n#\n#       There are tweaks for specific operating systems such as AIX, CygWin,\n#       Darwin, MinGW, and NonStop.\n#\n#   (3) This script is generated from the Groovy template\n#       https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/HEAD/platforms/jvm/plugins-application/src/main/resources/org/gradle/api/internal/plugins/unixStartScript.txt\n#       within the Gradle project.\n#\n#       You can find Gradle at https://github.com/gradle/gradle/.\n#\n##############################################################################\n\n# Attempt to set APP_HOME\n\n# Resolve links: $0 may be a link\napp_path=$0\n\n# Need this for daisy-chained symlinks.\nwhile\n    APP_HOME=${app_path%\"${app_path##*/}\"}  # leaves a trailing /; empty if no leading path\n    [ -h \"$app_path\" ]\ndo\n    ls=$( ls -ld \"$app_path\" )\n    link=${ls#*' -> '}\n    case $link in             #(\n      /*)   app_path=$link ;; #(\n      *)    app_path=$APP_HOME$link ;;\n    esac\ndone\n\n# This is normally unused\n# shellcheck disable=SC2034\nAPP_BASE_NAME=${0##*/}\n# Discard cd standard output in case $CDPATH is set (https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/25036)\nAPP_HOME=$( cd -P \"${APP_HOME:-./}\" > /dev/null && printf '%s\\n' \"$PWD\" ) || exit\n\n# Use the maximum available, or set MAX_FD != -1 to use that value.\nMAX_FD=maximum\n\nwarn () {\n    echo \"$*\"\n} >&2\n\ndie () {\n    echo\n    echo \"$*\"\n    echo\n    exit 1\n} >&2\n\n# OS specific support (must be 'true' or 'false').\ncygwin=false\nmsys=false\ndarwin=false\nnonstop=false\ncase \"$( uname )\" in                #(\n  CYGWIN* )         cygwin=true  ;; #(\n  Darwin* )         darwin=true  ;; #(\n  MSYS* | MINGW* )  msys=true    ;; #(\n  NONSTOP* )        nonstop=true ;;\nesac\n\nCLASSPATH=$APP_HOME/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar\n\n\n# Determine the Java command to use to start the JVM.\nif [ -n \"$JAVA_HOME\" ] ; then\n    if [ -x \"$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\" ] ; then\n        # IBM's JDK on AIX uses strange locations for the executables\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/jre/sh/java\n    else\n        JAVACMD=$JAVA_HOME/bin/java\n    fi\n    if [ ! -x \"$JAVACMD\" ] ; then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is set to an invalid directory: $JAVA_HOME\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nelse\n    JAVACMD=java\n    if ! command -v java >/dev/null 2>&1\n    then\n        die \"ERROR: JAVA_HOME is not set and no 'java' command could be found in your PATH.\n\nPlease set the JAVA_HOME variable in your environment to match the\nlocation of your Java installation.\"\n    fi\nfi\n\n# Increase the maximum file descriptors if we can.\nif ! \"$cygwin\" && ! \"$darwin\" && ! \"$nonstop\" ; then\n    case $MAX_FD in #(\n      max*)\n        # In POSIX sh, ulimit -H is undefined.
