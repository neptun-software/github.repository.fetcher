The expected behavior was highly ambiguous when paired with other scale types and canvas transformations. For the vast majority of cases, ImageView.ScaleType should be sufficient. For remaining cases, you may apply transformations to Canvas and use `LottieDrawable#draw` directly. \n* Added support for the \"Rounded Corners\" effect on Shape and Rect layers ([#1953](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1953))\n* Prior to 5.0, LottieAnimationView would _always_ call [setLayerType](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#setLayerType(int,%20android.graphics.Paint)) with either [HARDWARE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#LAYER_TYPE_HARDWARE) or [SOFTWARE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#LAYER_TYPE_SOFTWARE). In the hardware case, this would case Android to allocate a dedicated hardware buffer for the animation that had to be uploaded to the GPU separately. In the software case, LottieAnimationView would rely on View's internal [drawing cache](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View#isDrawingCacheEnabled()).\n\n    This has a few disadvantages:\n\n  * The hardware/software distinction happened at the LottieAnimationView level. That means that consumers of LottieDrawable (such as lottie-compose) had no way to\n          choose a render mode.\n  * Dedicated memory for Lottie was _always_ allocated. In the software case, it would be a bitmap that is the size of the LottieAnimationView and in the hardware case, it was a dedicated hardware layer.\n  \n  Benefits as a result of this change:\n\n  * Reduced memory consumption. In the hardware case, no new memory is allocated. In the software case, Lottie will create a bitmap that is the intersection of your View/Composition bounds mapped with the drawing transformation which often yields a surface are that is smaller than the entire LottieAnimationView.\n  * lottie-compose now supports setting a RenderMode.\n  * Custom uses of LottieDrawable now support setting a RenderMode via [setRenderMode](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/c5b8318c7cf205e95db143955acbfc69f86bc339/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieDrawable.java#L329).\n* Lottie can now render outside of its composition bounds. To allow this with views such as LottieAnimationView, set `clipToCompositionBounds` to false on `LottieDrawable` or `LottieAnimationView` and `clipChildren` to false on the parent view. For Compose, use the `clipToCompositionBounds` parameter.\n* Prior to 5.0, LottieAnimationView handled all animation controls when the view's visibility or attach state changed. This worked fine for consumers of LottieAnimationView. However, custom uses of LottieDrawable were prone to leaking infinite animators if they did not properly handle cancelling animations correctly. This opens up the possibility for unexpected behavior and increased battery drain. Lottie now behaves more like animated drawables in the platform and moves this logic into the Drawable via its [setVisible](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/drawable/Drawable#setVisible(boolean,%20boolean)) API. This should lead to no explicit behavior changes if you are using LottieAnimationView. However, if you are using LottieDrawable directly and were explicitly pausing/cancelling animations on lifecycle changes, you may want to cross check your expected behavior with that of LottieDrawable after this update. This change also resolved a long standing bug when Lottie is used in RecyclerViews due to the complex way in which RecyclerView handles View lifecycles ([#1495](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1495)).\n  [#1981](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1981)\n* Add an API [setClipToCompositionBounds](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/c5b8318c7cf205e95db143955acbfc69f86bc339/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieDrawable.java#L218) on LottieAnimationView, LottieDrawable, and the LottieAnimation composable to prevent Lottie from clipping animations to the composition bounds.\n* Add an API to always render dynamically set bitmaps at the original animation bounds. Previously, dynamically set bitmaps would be rendered at their own size anchored to the top left\n  of the original bitmap. This meant that if you wanted to supply a lower resolution bitmap to save memory, it would render smaller. The default behavior remains the same but you can\n  enable [setMaintainOriginalImageBounds](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/blob/c5b8318c7cf205e95db143955acbfc69f86bc339/lottie/src/main/java/com/airbnb/lottie/LottieDrawable.java#L264) to be able to supply lower resolution bitmaps ([#1706](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1706)).\n* Add support for `LottieProperty.TEXT` to use dynamic properties for text.

If you were using JsonObjects, switch to Strings (#959).\n* Made LottieTask.EXECUTOR public and static so tests can set it.\n* Allow layer names to be stripped from JSON if desired.\n* Allow returning null from LottieValueCallbacks to fall back to the default value.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Allow text stroke width to be a double (#940).\n\n# 2.6.0\n### Features and Improvements\n* Added support for loading an image from a url directly. See LottieCompositionFactory for more information.\n* Added support for loading an animation from a zip file that contains the json as well as images.\n    * URLs supports zip files as well as json files.\n* Deprecated `LottieComposition.Factory` in favor of LottieCompositionFactory.\n    * The new factory methods make it easier to catch exceptions by separating out success and\n      failure handlers. Previously, catching exceptions was impossible and would crash your app.\n    * All APIs now have a mandatory cacheKey that uses an LRU cache rather than a strong/weak ref cache.\n    * If the same animation is fetched multiple times in parallel, the same task will be returned.\n      This will be massively helpful for animations that are loaded in a list.\n    * InputStreams are now always closed even if you use the old APIs. Please be aware if you were\n      using this while upgrading.\n* Added support for miter limit.\n* [Sample App] Added the ability to load a file from assets.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Fixed a timing issue when there was time stretch on a masked layer.\n* Fixed support for Android P.\n* Make a best-effort attempt at rendering shapes in which the number of vertices changes rather than crashing.\n* Fixed a bug in which the inner radius animation of a polystar wouldn't update.\n\n# 2.5.7\n* Reapply min/max frame once composition is loaded (#827).\n* Fixed a bug that would ignore setting minFrame to 0 before the composition was set (#820).\n* Prevented Lottie from drawing a recycled bitmap (#828).\n\n# 2.5.6\n* Added support for targeting Android P\n* Fixed a potential dangling Choreographer callback ([#775](https://githubcom/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/775))\n\n# 2.5.5\n* Fixed end times for layers/animations. Before, if the layer/animation out frame was 20, it would fully render frame 20. This is incorrect. The last rendered frame should be 19.999... in this case. This should make Lottie reflect After Effects more accurately. However, if you are getting the frame in onAnimationEnd or onAnimationRepeat, it will be one less than it used to be.\n* Added support for base64 encoded images directly in the json instead of the filename. They are 33% larger than their equivalent image file but enables you to have images with a single file.\n* Fixed a lint error about KeyPath visibility.\n* A few min/max progress bug fixes.\n* Prevent autoPlay from starting before the animation was attached to the window. This caused animations in a RecyclerView to start playing before they were on screen.\n\n# 2.5.4\n* You can now call playAnimation() from onAnimationEnd\n* Min/Max frames are clipped to the composition start/end\n* setProgress takes into account start and end frame\n\n\n# 2.5.2\n### Features and Improvements\n* Totally new sample app!\n    * Rebuilt from the ground up.\n    * Lottiefiles integration\n    * Render times per layer\n    * Can open zip files with images from lottiefiles, even with qr scanning.\n    * Change speed\n# Bugs Fixed\n* Fixed a regression with ellipse direction\n\n# 2.5.1\n### Features and Improvements\n* Removed framerate restriction introduced in 2.5.0 that caused Lottie to attempt to render at the After Effects framerate. This caused animations to appear unexpectedly janky in most cases.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Many minor bug fixes around setting min/max frames\n* Removed @RestrictTo on LottieValueCallback\n* Improved thread safety of animation listeners\n* Fixed looping when the animation speed is reversed\n\n\n# 2.5.0\n### Features and Improvements\n* Added the ability to dynamically change properties at runtime. See [docs](http://airbnb.io/lottie/android/dynamic.html) for more info. This feature removed the existing APIs for\nchanging the color dynamically with a color filter. Refer to the docs for migration info from\nexisting ColorFilter APIs.\n* Added a setRepeatMode and setRepeatCount (Thanks Fabio Nuno!).\n* Completely overhauled json deserialization. Deserializing a composition takes half as long and\ncan deserialize much larger json files (tested 50mb) without ooming.\n* Overhauled the underlying time animator. It now:\n    * More accurately handles setFrame/getFrame/minFrame/maxFrame APIs. There were cases where they\n    could be off by one before.\n    * Renders at the fps specified by After Effects.\n    * Added docs and clearer rules around animatedValue and animatedFraction in animator callbacks.\n* API to remove all animator listeners.\n* Adhere to the Animatable interface.\n* Bumped the minSdk from 14 to 16 to use Choreographer in the animator mentioned above.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Fixed a bug that made it difficult to chain animations in onAnimationEnd callbacks.\n* Fixed a regression with unknown masks modes.\n* Fixed a crash trying to recycle a null bitmap.\n* Fixed a bug when an opacity animation time interpolator was >1.\n\n# 2.3.1\n### Features and Improvements\n* Expose `LottieComposition#getImages()` to aid in preloading images.\n* Added support for text baseline.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Prevented a crash when setting min frame > previous max frame.\n* Fixed some bugs in subtract masks.\n* Fixed some animation clamping when an animation was longer than its parent and time stretched.\n* Stopped applying time stretch to a layer transform.\n\n\n# 2.3.0\n### Features and Improvements\n* Animator fixes:\n    * Previously, some usages of lottie animator apis/api listeners would cause unexpected\n    behavior, especially calling apis from listener callbacks.\n    * This is breaking change if you use `playAnimation(start, end)`. It has been removed in\n    favor of explicit methods for `setMinFrame/Progress`, `setMaxFrame/Progress` and\n    `setMinAndMaxFrame/Progress` followed by an explicit call to `playAnimation` or\n    `resumeAnimation`.\n    * `reverseAnimation` and `resumeReverseAnimation` apis have been removed in favor of\n    `play` and `resume` with `speed` < 0.\n    * If you have created hack around these limitations or complex animator chaining, please test\n     your animations after updating.\n* Set an animation from R.raw (res/raw) if you want static references to your animation files.\nThis can help prevent mismatches between api calls and file names. Thanks @cyrilmottier!\n* Support for ellipse direction.\n* Expose image directory name if set from bodymovin.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Fixed a bug with animations that use both mattes and time stretch.\n* Fixed a few keyframe issues where keyframe start/end values would be off by 1 frame.\n\n# 2.2.5\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Call onAnimationEnd when system animations are disabled.\n\n# 2.2.4\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Improved the reliability of scaling and using ImageView scale types.\n* Fixed a clipping issue with precomps.\n* Fixed an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds crash in the interpolator cache.\n\n# 2.2.3\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Fixed some issues with progress and resume\n* Fixed a StackOverflowErrors when animations are disabled\n* Fixed a NPE in Keyframe.Factory\n\n# 2.2.1\n### Features and Improvements\n* Text now supports opacity.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Fixed a couple of couple of concurrency crashes.\n* Fixed a crash when animations are disabled.\n* Fixed a crash for letters with no shapes.\n\n\n# 2.2.0\n### Features and Improvements\n* Added `play(startFrame, endFrame)` and `play(startProgress, endProgress)`.\n* Added the ability to set a minimum and maximum frame/progress for a given animation.\n* Made WeakRef the default cache strategy.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Cancel loading animations when non-Lottie animations are set.\n\n# 2.1.2\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Reduced memory footprint.\n* Allowed animations with masks and mattes to scale larger than their view.\n* Respect hardware acceleration when async loading a composition.\n* Fixed a gradient point counting issue.\n* Fixed a trim path issue.\n\n# 2.1.0\n### Features and Improvements\n* Added support for animated text (glyphs and fonts)\n* Enabled text to be set dynamically\n* Added support for repeaters\n* Added support for time stretching\n* Added support for work area (trimming start and end frames)\n* Added support for mask opacity\n* Migrated the sample app to Kotlin\n* Added a real time render performance graph in the sample app\n* Added many systrace markers to improve performance tracking\n\n# 2.0.0\n### Features and Improvements\n* Increased version number.\n* New animations from lottiefiles in the sample app.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Minor trim path fix.\n* Minor gradient caching fix.\n\n# 2.0.0-rc2\n### Features and Improvements\n* Paste json into the sample app.\n* Update a bitmap asset dynamically.\n* Set scale from xml.\n### Bugs Fixed\n* Resume no longer restarts the animation.\n* More lenient crashes and getCallback() checks.\n* Fewer addUpdateListener calls.\n* Fix cache strategy when it and the animation is set from xml.\n\n# 2.0.0-rc1\n### Features and Improvements\n* Set a color filter with xml\n#### Bugs Fixed\n* Prevent a rare crash when used from React Native.\n* Apply transformation to gradient fills.\n* Clip precomps to their bounds.\n* Prevent a crash with certain extreme keyframe values.\n* Fix the sample app for pre-lollipop.\n* Fix some pre-lollipop rendering bugs.\n\n\n# 2.0.0-beta4\n### Features and Improvements\n* Added support to load an animation by scanning a qr code with a url to the json.

This allows Lottie to redraw without triggering a recomposition every time progress updates. For more information, refer to the Compose [phase docs](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/phases). The existing API will exist as deprecated for one more release but will then be removed. For the vast majority of use cases:\n\n```kotlin\nLottieAnimation(composition, progress)\n```\nwill become:\n\n```kotlin\nLottieAnimation(composition, { progress })\n```\n\nor\n\n```kotlin\nLottieAnimation(\n  composition = composition,\n  progress = { progress }\n)\n```\n[#2078](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/2078).\n\n# 5.1.1\n* Add support for completable animations in tests ([#2051](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/2051))\n\n# 5.0.0\n* You can tell Lottie to render the full animation even if it extends beyond the original composition bounds by setting `clipToCompositionBounds` to false.\n* Add support for dynamic text via `LottieProperty.TEXT` and the existing dynamic property APIs ([#1995](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/issues/1995))\n* Respect Android system animator scale (include 0 for modes like battery saver) ([#2000](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/2000))\n* Added support for loading animations via content provider URIs (LottieCompositionSpec.ContentProvider) ([#1982](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1982))\n* Fixed dynamic gradient properties ([#1969](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1969)).\n* Prevent infinite animations from hanging espresso tests by using the same mechanism as androidx animations ([#1987](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1987))\n* Set the merge paths property before the composition to avoid building the composition layer with the wrong merge paths value and triggering a second rebuilt ([#1997](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1997))\n\n# 4.2.0\n* [BREAKING CHANGE] LottieAnimation will now default to the composition size rather than `fillMaxSize()` ([#1892](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1892))\n* Improved the performance of loading and parsing animations ([#1891](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1891))\n\n# 4.1.0\n* No changes\n\n# 4.0.0\n* Upgrade to Compose 1.0\n* Made LottieCompositionSpec an inline class([#1855](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1855))\n\n# 1.0.0-rc02-1\n* Upgrade to Compose rc02\n* Add support for ContentScale and Alignment just like the Image composable ([#1844](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1844))\n* Automatically load fonts if possible and allow setting fonts via dynamic properties ([#1842](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1842))\n* Add LottieCancellationBehavior support to animateLottieCompositionAsState ([#1846](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1846))\n* Allow custom cache keys/cache skipping ([#1847](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1847))\n* Always respect LottieClipSpec ([#1848](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1848))\n\n\n# 1.0.0-rc01-1\n## Breaking Changes\n`LottieAnimation` now takes a progress float instead of driving the animation internally.\nThe driving of animations has been split into a new `LottieAnimatable` class and\n`animateLottieCompositionAsState` function. These are analogous to Jetpack's `Animatable` and\n`animate*AsState` functions.\nProperties that pertain to the animation such as speed, repeat count, and the new clip spec are part of\n`animateLottieComposition` whereas properties that are related to rendering such as enabling merge paths\nand setting an image asset delegate are on the `LottieAnimation` composable.\n\n`lottieComposition` has also been renamed `rememberLottieComposition`.\n\nThere are overloaded version of `LottieAnimation` that merge the properties for convenience. Please\nrefer to the docs for `LottieAnimation`, `LottieAnimatable`, `animateLottieCompositionAsState`\nand `rememberLottieComposition` for more information.\n* Added the ability to clip the progress bounds of an animation.\n* Added the ability to set and control dynamic properties.\n* Removed the existing imageAssetDelegate parameter and moved imageAssetsFolder to rememberLottieComposition.\n  Images are now loaded from assets or decoded from the base64 string embedded in the json file during parsing\n  and on the IO thread pool rather than upon first render on the main thread during animations. If you want to\n  supply your own animations, call `composition.images[\"your_image_id\"].bitmap = yourBitmap`. This lets you control\n  exactly how and when the bitmaps get created and set. The previous implementation of calling a callback on every\n  frame encouraged the incorrect behavior of doing IO tasks during the animation hot path. Check out ImagesExamplesPage.kt\n  for usage.\n\n# 1.0.0-beta07-1\n* Compatible with Jetpack Compose Beta 07\n\n# 1.0.0-beta03-1\n* Update versioning scheme to match the underlying Compose version\n* Compatible with Jetpack Compose Beta 03\n* Added support for images ([#1766](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1766))\n* Added the ability to control whether merge paths are enabled or not ([#1744](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1744))\n* Swapped modifier application order to follow Compose guidelines (and support setting specific sizes) ([#1765](https://github.com/airbnb/lottie-android/pull/1765))\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha07-SNAPSHOT\n* Add flag for merge paths to LottieAnimationState\n* Compatible with Jetpack Compose Beta 02\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha06\n* Compatible with Jetpack Compose Alpha 12\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha05\n* Jetpack Compose Alpha 9\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha04\n* Jetpack Compose Alpha 8\n\n# 1.0.0-alpha01\n* Initial release of Lottie Compose\n* Compatible with Jetpack Compose alpha 6\n* Built with Lottie 3.5.0\n* Wraps the existing renderer with Jetpack Compose friendly APIs.\n* For up to date docs on how to use it, check out the [docs](http://airbnb.io/lottie/#/android-compose).\n"

          "content": "# Code of Conduct\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nA primary goal of Lottie is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\n\nWe invite all those who participate in Lottie to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.\n\n## 2. Open Source Citizenship\n\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\n\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\n\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n\n## 3. Expected Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\n*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.\n*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n*   Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n## 4. Unacceptable Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:\n\n*   Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.\n*   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\n*   Posting or threatening to post other peopleâ€™s personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n*   Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\n*   Inappropriate photography or recording.\n*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someoneâ€™s consent before touching them.\n*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\n*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\n*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n*   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n\n## 6. Reporting Guidelines\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. .\n\n\n\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n\n## 7. Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify The  New York Times with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\n\n\n\n## 8. Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venuesâ€“online and in-personâ€“as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\n\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n\n## 9.
