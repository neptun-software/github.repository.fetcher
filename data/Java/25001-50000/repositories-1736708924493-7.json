For the packages installable inside the app, see [termux/termux-packages](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages).\n\nQuick how-to about Termux package management is available at [Package Management](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Package-Management). It also has info on how to fix **`repository is under maintenance or down`** errors when running `apt` or `pkg` commands.\n\n**We are looking for Termux Android application maintainers.**\n\n***\n\n**NOTICE: Termux may be unstable on Android 12+.** Android OS will kill any (phantom) processes greater than 32 (limit is for all apps combined) and also kill any processes using excessive CPU. You may get `[Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter]` message in the terminal without actually exiting the shell process yourself. Check the related issue [#2366](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366), [issue tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/205156966), [phantom cached and empty processes docs](https://github.com/agnostic-apollo/Android-Docs/blob/master/en/docs/apps/processes/phantom-cached-and-empty-processes.md) and [this TLDR comment](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366#issuecomment-1237468220) on how to disable trimming of phantom and excessive cpu usage processes. A proper docs page will be added later. An option to disable the killing should be available in Android 12L or 13, so upgrade at your own risk if you are on Android 11, specially if you are not rooted.\n\n***\n\n## Contents\n- [Termux App and Plugins](#termux-app-and-plugins)\n- [Installation](#installation)\n- [Uninstallation](#uninstallation)\n- [Important Links](#important-links)\n- [Debugging](#debugging)\n- [For Maintainers and Contributors](#for-maintainers-and-contributors)\n- [Forking](#forking)\n##\n\n\n\n## Termux App and Plugins\n\nThe core [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app) app comes with the following optional plugin apps.\n\n- [Termux:API](https://github.com/termux/termux-api)\n- [Termux:Boot](https://github.com/termux/termux-boot)\n- [Termux:Float](https://github.com/termux/termux-float)\n- [Termux:Styling](https://github.com/termux/termux-styling)\n- [Termux:Tasker](https://github.com/termux/termux-tasker)\n- [Termux:Widget](https://github.com/termux/termux-widget)\n##\n\n\n\n## Installation\n\nLatest version is `v0.118.1`.\n\n**NOTICE: It is highly recommended that you update to `v0.118.0` or higher ASAP for various bug fixes, including a critical world-readable vulnerability reported [here](https://termux.github.io/general/2022/02/15/termux-apps-vulnerability-disclosures.html). See [below](#google-play-store-experimental-branch) for information regarding Termux on Google Play.**\n\nTermux can be obtained through various sources listed below for **only** Android `>= 7` with full support for apps and packages.\n\nSupport for both app and packages was dropped for Android `5` and `6` on [2020-01-01](https://www.reddit.com/r/termux/comments/dnzdbs/end_of_android56_support_on_20200101/) at `v0.83`, however it was re-added just for the app *without any support for package updates* on [2022-05-24](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/2740) via the [GitHub](#github) sources. Check [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-on-android-5-or-6) for the details.\n\nThe APK files of different sources are signed with different signature keys. The `Termux` app and all its plugins use the same [`sharedUserId`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element) `com.termux` and so all their APKs installed on a device must have been signed with the same signature key to work together and so they must all be installed from the same source. Do not attempt to mix them together, i.e do not try to install an app or plugin from `F-Droid` and another one from a different source like `GitHub`. Android Package Manager will also normally not allow installation of APKs with different signatures and you will get errors on installation like `App not installed`, `Failed to install due to an unknown error`, `INSTALL_FAILED_UPDATE_INCOMPATIBLE`, `INSTALL_FAILED_SHARED_USER_INCOMPATIBLE`, `signatures do not match previously installed version`, etc. This restriction can be bypassed with root or with custom roms.\n\nIf you wish to install from a different source, then you must **uninstall any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs** from your device first, then install all new APKs from the same new source. Check [Uninstallation](#uninstallation) section for details. You may also want to consider [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux) before the uninstallation so that you can restore it after re-installing from Termux different source.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, *\"bootstrap\"* refers to the minimal packages that are shipped with the `termux-app` itself to start a working shell environment. Its zips are built and released [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/releases).\n\n### F-Droid\n\nTermux application can be obtained from `F-Droid` from [here](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/).\n\nYou **do not** need to download the `F-Droid` app (via the `Download F-Droid` link) to install Termux. You can download the Termux APK directly from the site by clicking the `Download APK` link at the bottom of each version section.\n\nIt usually takes a few days (or even a week or more) for updates to be available on `F-Droid` once an update has been released on `GitHub`. The `F-Droid` releases are built and published by `F-Droid` once they [detect](https://gitlab.com/fdroid/fdroiddata/-/blob/master/metadata/com.termux.yml) a new `GitHub` release. The Termux maintainers **do not** have any control over the building and publishing of the Termux apps on `F-Droid`. Moreover, the Termux maintainers also do not have access to the APK signing keys of `F-Droid` releases, so we cannot release an APK ourselves on `GitHub` that would be compatible with `F-Droid` releases.\n\nThe `F-Droid` app often may not notify you of updates and you will manually have to do a pull down swipe action in the `Updates` tab of the app for it to check updates. Make sure battery optimizations are disabled for the app, check https://dontkillmyapp.com/ for details on how to do that.\n\nOnly a universal APK is released, which will work on all supported architectures. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be `~180MB`. `F-Droid` does [not support](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/pull/1904) architecture specific APKs.\n\n### GitHub\n\nTermux application can be obtained on `GitHub` either from [`GitHub Releases`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases) for version `>= 0.118.0` or from [`GitHub Build Action`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/actions/workflows/debug_build.yml?query=branch%3Amaster+event%3Apush) workflows. **For android `>= 7`, only install `apt-android-7` variants. For android `5` and `6`, only install `apt-android-5` variants.**\n\nThe APKs for `GitHub Releases` will be listed under `Assets` drop-down of a release. These are automatically attached when a new version is released.\n\nThe APKs for `GitHub Build` action workflows will be listed under `Artifacts` section of a workflow run. These are created for each commit/push done to the repository and can be used by users who don't want to wait for releases and want to try out the latest features immediately or want to test their pull requests. Note that for action workflows, you need to be [**logged into a `GitHub` account**](https://github.com/login) for the `Artifacts` links to be enabled/clickable. If you are using the [`GitHub` app](https://github.com/mobile), then make sure to open workflow link in a browser like Chrome or Firefox that has your GitHub account logged in since the in-app browser may not be logged in.\n\nThe APKs for both of these are [`debuggable`](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug) and are compatible with each other but they are not compatible with other sources.\n\nBoth universal and architecture specific APKs are released. The APK and bootstrap installation size will be `~180MB` if using universal and `~120MB` if using architecture specific. Check [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2153) for details.\n\n**Security warning**: APK files on GitHub are signed with a test key that has been [shared with community](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks). This IS NOT an official developer key and everyone can use it to generate releases for own testing. Be very careful when using Termux GitHub builds obtained elsewhere except https://github.com/termux/termux-app. Everyone is able to use it to forge a malicious Termux update installable over the GitHub build. Think twice about installing Termux builds distributed via Telegram or other social media. If your device get caught by malware, we will not be able to help you.\n\nThe [test key](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/app/testkey_untrusted.jks) shall not be used to impersonate @termux and can't be used for this anyway. This key is not trusted by us and it is quite easy to detect its use in user generated content.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Keystore information</summary>\n\n```\nAlias name: alias\nCreation date: Oct 4, 2019\nEntry type: PrivateKeyEntry\nCertificate chain length: 1\nCertificate[1]:\nOwner: CN=APK Signer, OU=Earth, O=Earth\nIssuer: CN=APK Signer, OU=Earth, O=Earth\nSerial number: 29be297b\nValid from: Wed Sep 04 02:03:24 EEST 2019 until: Tue Oct 26 02:03:24 EEST 2049\nCertificate fingerprints:\n         SHA1: 51:79:55:EA:BF:69:FC:05:7C:41:C7:D3:79:DB:BC:EF:20:AD:85:F2\n         SHA256: B6:DA:01:48:0E:EF:D5:FB:F2:CD:37:71:B8:D1:02:1E:C7:91:30:4B:DD:6C:4B:F4:1D:3F:AA:BA:D4:8E:E5:E1\nSignature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA (disabled)\nSubject Public Key Algorithm: 2048-bit RSA key\nVersion: 3\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Google Play Store **(Experimental branch)**\n\nThere is currently a build of Termux available on Google Play for Android 11+ devices, with extensive adjustments in order to pass policy requirements there. This is under development and has missing functionality and bugs (see [here](https://github.com/termux-play-store/) for status updates) compared to the stable F-Droid build, which is why most users who can should still use F-Droid or GitHub build as mentioned above.\n\nCurrently, Google Play will try to update installations away from F-Droid ones. Updating will still fail as [sharedUserId](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/manifest-element#uid) has been removed. A planned 0.118.1 F-Droid release will fix this by setting a higher version code than used for the PlayStore app. Meanwhile, to prevent Google Play from attempting to download and then fail to install the Google Play releases over existing installations, you can open the Termux apps pages on Google Play and then click on the 3 dots options button in the top right and then disable the Enable auto update toggle. However, the Termux apps updates will still show in the PlayStore app updates list.\n\nIf you want to help out with testing the Google Play build (or cannot install Termux from other sources), be aware that it's built from a separate repository (https://github.com/termux-play-store/) - be sure to report issues [there](https://github.com/termux-play-store/termux-issues/issues/new/choose), as any issues encountered might very well be specific to that repository.\n\n## Uninstallation\n\nUninstallation may be required if a user doesn't want Termux installed in their device anymore or is switching to a different [install source](#installation). You may also want to consider [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux) before the uninstallation.\n\nTo uninstall Termux completely, you must uninstall **any and all existing Termux or its plugin app APKs** listed in [Termux App and Plugins](#termux-app-and-plugins).\n\nGo to `Android Settings` -> `Applications` and then look for those apps. You can also use the search feature if it’s available on your device and search `termux` in the applications list.\n\nEven if you think you have not installed any of the plugins, it's strongly suggested to go through the application list in Android settings and double-check.\n##\n\n\n\n## Important Links\n\n### Community\nAll community links are available [here](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Community).\n\nThe main ones are the following.\n\n- [Termux Reddit community](https://reddit.com/r/termux)\n- [Termux User Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#termux_termux:gitter.im) ([Gitter](https://gitter.im/termux/termux))\n- [Termux Dev Matrix Channel](https://matrix.to/#/#termux_dev:gitter.im) ([Gitter](https://gitter.im/termux/dev))\n- [Termux X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/termuxdevs)\n- [Termux Support Email](mailto:support@termux.dev)\n\n### Wikis\n\n- [Termux Wiki](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/)\n- [Termux App Wiki](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki)\n- [Termux Packages Wiki](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki)\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- [FAQ](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/FAQ)\n- [Termux File System Layout](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-file-system-layout)\n- [Differences From Linux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Differences_from_Linux)\n- [Package Management](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Package_Management)\n- [Remote Access](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Remote_Access)\n- [Backing up Termux](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Backing_up_Termux)\n- [Terminal Settings](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Terminal_Settings)\n- [Touch Keyboard](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Touch_Keyboard)\n- [Android Storage and Sharing Data with Other Apps](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Internal_and_external_storage)\n- [Android APIs](https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Termux:API)\n- [Moved Termux Packages Hosting From Bintray to IPFS](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/issues/6348)\n- [Running Commands in Termux From Other Apps via `RUN_COMMAND` intent](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/RUN_COMMAND-Intent)\n- [Termux and Android 10](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Termux-and-Android-10)\n\n\n### Terminal\n\n<details>\n<summary></summary>\n\n### Terminal resources\n\n- [XTerm control sequences](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html)\n- [vt100.net](https://vt100.net/)\n- [Terminal codes (ANSI and terminfo equivalents)](https://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes)\n\n### Terminal emulators\n\n- VTE (libvte): Terminal emulator widget for GTK+, mainly used in gnome-terminal.

The `Log Level` defaults to `Normal` and log level `Verbose` currently logs additional information. Its best to revert log level to `Normal` after you have finished debugging since private data may otherwise be passed to `logcat` during normal operation and moreover, additional logging increases execution time.\n\nThe plugin apps **do not execute the commands themselves** but send execution intents to `Termux` app, which has its own log level which can be set in `Termux` app settings -> `Termux` -> `Debugging` -> `Log Level`. So you must set log level for both `Termux` and the respective plugin app settings to get all the info.\n\nOnce log levels have been set, you can run the `logcat` command in `Termux` app terminal to view the logs in realtime (`Ctrl+c` to stop) or use `logcat -d > logcat.txt` to take a dump of the log. You can also view the logs from a PC over `ADB`. For more information, check official android `logcat` guide [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat).\n\nMoreover, users can generate termux files `stat` info and `logcat` dump automatically too with terminal's long hold options menu `More` -> `Report Issue` option and selecting `YES` in the prompt shown to add debug info. This can be helpful for reporting and debugging other issues. If the report generated is too large, then `Save To File` option in context menu (3 dots on top right) of `ReportActivity` can be used and the file viewed/shared instead.\n\nUsers must post complete report (optionally without sensitive info) when reporting issues. Issues opened with **(partial) screenshots of error reports** instead of text will likely be automatically closed/deleted.\n\n##### Log Levels\n\n- `Off` - Log nothing.\n- `Normal` - Start logging error, warn and info messages and stacktraces.\n- `Debug` - Start logging debug messages.\n- `Verbose` - Start logging verbose messages.\n##\n\n\n\n## For Maintainers and Contributors\n\nThe [termux-shared](termux-shared) library was added in [`v0.109`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/tag/v0.109). It defines shared constants and utils of the Termux app and its plugins. It was created to allow for the removal of all hardcoded paths in the Termux app. Some of the termux plugins are using this as well and rest will in future. If you are contributing code that is using a constant or a util that may be shared, then define it in `termux-shared` library if it currently doesn't exist and reference it from there. Update the relevant changelogs as well. Pull requests using hardcoded values **will/should not** be accepted. Termux app and plugin specific classes must be added under `com.termux.shared.termux` package and general classes outside it. The [`termux-shared` `LICENSE`](termux-shared/LICENSE.md) must also be checked and updated if necessary when contributing code. The licenses of any external library or code must be honoured.\n\nThe main Termux constants are defined by [`TermuxConstants`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java) class. It also contains information on how to fork Termux or build it with your own package name. Changing the package name will require building the bootstrap zip packages and other packages with the new `$PREFIX`, check [Building Packages](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/Building-packages) for more info.\n\nCheck [Termux Libraries](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries) for how to import termux libraries in plugin apps and [Forking and Local Development](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development) for how to update termux libraries for plugins.\n\nThe `versionName` in `build.gradle` files of Termux and its plugin apps must follow the [semantic version `2.0.0` spec](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) in the format `major.minor.patch(-prerelease)(+buildmetadata)`. When bumping `versionName` in `build.gradle` files and when creating a tag for new releases on GitHub, make sure to include the patch number as well, like `v0.1.0` instead of just `v0.1`. The `build.gradle` files and `attach_debug_apks_to_release` workflow validates the version as well and the build/attachment will fail if `versionName` does not follow the spec.\n\n### Commit Messages Guidelines\n\nCommit messages **must** use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) spec so that chagelogs as per the [Keep a Changelog](https://github.com/olivierlacan/keep-a-changelog) spec can automatically be generated by the [`create-conventional-changelog`](https://github.com/termux/create-conventional-changelog) script, check its repo for further details on the spec. **The first letter for `type` and `description` must be capital and description should be in the present tense.** The space after the colon `:` is necessary. For a breaking change, add an exclamation mark `!` before the colon `:`, so that it is highlighted in the chagelog automatically.\n\n```\n<type>[optional scope]: <description>\n\n[optional body]\n\n[optional footer(s)]\n```\n\n**Only the `types` listed below must be used exactly as they are used in the changelog headings.** For example, `Added: Add foo`, `Added|Fixed: Add foo and fix bar`, `Changed!: Change baz as a breaking change`, etc. You can optionally add a scope as well, like `Fixed(terminal): Fix some bug`. **Do not use anything else as type, like `add` instead of `Added`, etc.**\n\n- **Added** for new features.\n- **Changed** for changes in existing functionality.\n- **Deprecated** for soon-to-be removed features.\n- **Removed** for now removed features.\n- **Fixed** for any bug fixes.\n- **Security** in case of vulnerabilities.\n##\n\n\n\n## Forking\n\n- Check [`TermuxConstants`](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/blob/master/termux-shared/src/main/java/com/termux/shared/termux/TermuxConstants.java) javadocs for instructions on what changes to make in the app to change package name.\n- You also need to recompile bootstrap zip for the new package name. Check [building bootstrap](https://github.com/termux/termux-packages/wiki/For-maintainers#build-bootstrap-archives), [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/1983) and [here](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2081#issuecomment-865280111).\n- Currently, not all plugins use `TermuxConstants` from `termux-shared` library and have hardcoded `com.termux` values and will need to be manually patched.\n- If forking termux plugins, check [Forking and Local Development](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/wiki/Termux-Libraries#forking-and-local-development) for info on how to use termux libraries for plugins.\n"
