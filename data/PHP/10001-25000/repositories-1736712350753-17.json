          "content": "# Bagisto Contribution Guide\n\n**BUGS:**\n\nTo encourage active collaboration, Bagisto encourages pull requests, not just bug reports. \"Bug reports\" may also be sent in the form of a pull request containing a negative test.\n\nHowever, when filing a bug report, your issue should contain a title and a clear description of the issue. You should also include as much relevant information as possible and a code sample that demonstrates the issue. The goal of a bug report is to make it easy for yourself - and others - to replicate the bug and develop a fix.\n\nRemember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will collaborate with you on solving it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.\n\n**Projects that you can contribute in:**\n\n1. Bagisto\n\n2. Bagisto docs\n\n3. Laravel-aliexpress-dropship\n\n4. Laravel-aliexpress-dropship-chrome-extension\n\n5. Bagisto-custom-style-extension\n\n**Core development ideas or discussion:**\n\nIf you propose a new feature, please implement at least some of the code needed to complete the quality.\n\nInformal discussion regarding bugs, new features, and implementation of existing features occurs in the comments of the issues filed using feature template.\n\n**Which branch you should target?**\n\nAll bug fixes should be sent to the latest staging branch, i.e. development branch. Bug fixes should never be sent to the master branch unless they fix features that exist only in the upcoming release.\n\nMinor features fully backwards compatible with the current Laravel release may be sent to the latest stable branch.\n\nMajor new features should always be sent to the master branch, which contains the upcoming Bagisto release.\n\n**Compiling assets:**\n\nIf you are submitting a change that will affect a compiled file, such as most of the files in admin/resources/assets/sass or admin/resources/assets/js of the Bagisto repository, do not commit the compiled files. Due to their large size, they cannot realistically be reviewed by a maintainer. This could be exploited as a way to inject malicious code into Bagisto. To defensively prevent this, all compiled files will be generated and committed by Bagisto maintainers.\n\n**Code style:**\n\nBagisto follows PSR-2 for coding standards and PSR-4 as of Laravel for autoloading standards.\n\n**PHPDoc:**\n\nBelow is an example of a valid Bagisto doc block. Note that the @param attribute is followed by two spaces, the argument type, two more spaces, and finally, the variable name:\n  ``` php\n    /**\n    * Register a service with CoreServiceProvider.\n    *\n    * @param  string|array  $loader\n    * @param  \\Closure|string|null  $concrete\n    * @param  bool  $shared\n    * @return void\n    * @throws \\Exception\n    */\n    protected function registerFacades($loader, $concrete = null, $shared = false)\n    {\n        //\n    }\n  ```\n"

Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately preceding sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS IS\" BASIS and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU. This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to anyone for any indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.\n\n   9. Acceptance and Termination. If, at any time, You expressly assented to this License, that assent indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions. If You distribute or communicate copies of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 1, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without honoring these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations (including 'fair use' or 'fair dealing'). This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to honor the conditions in Section 1(c).\n\n  10. Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or hardware.\n\n  11. Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction.

Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n\n  16. Modification of This License. This License is Copyright (C) 2005 Lawrence Rosen. Permission is granted to copy, distribute, or communicate this License without modification. Nothing in this License permits You to modify this License as applied to the Original Work or to Derivative Works. However, You may modify the text of this License and copy, distribute or communicate your modified version (the \"Modified License\") and apply it to other original works of authorship subject to the following conditions: (i) You may not indicate in any way that your Modified License is the \"Open Software License\" or \"OSL\" and you may not use those names in the name of your Modified License; (ii) You must replace the notice specified in the first paragraph above with the notice \"Licensed under <insert your license name here>\" or with a notice of your own that is not confusingly similar to the notice in this License; and (iii) You may not claim that your original works are open source software unless your Modified License has been approved by Open Source Initiative (OSI) and You comply with its license review and certification process.\n"

However, as some of these alterations occur in lesser-known sections of Bagisto, only a fraction of them may impact your application.\n\n### Updating Dependencies\n\n**Impact Probability: High**\n\n#### PHP 8.2.0 Required\n\nLaravel now requires PHP 8.1.0 or greater.\n\n#### curl 7.34.0 Required\n\nLaravel's HTTP client now requires curl 7.34.0 or greater.\n\n#### Composer Dependencies\n\nThere is no dependency needed to be updated at for this upgrade.\n\n<div class=\"content-list\" markdown=\"1\">\n</div>\n\n\n\n<a name=\"Admin\"></a>\n### Admin\n\n<a name=\"the-system-config-update\"></a>\n#### The System Configuration Updates\n\n**Impact Probability: Medium**\n\n1: The tax configuration has been relocated to the sales configuration, and the respective path for retrieving configuration values has been updated accordingly.\n\n```diff\n- core()->getConfigData('taxes.catalogue.pricing.tax_inclusive')\n+ core()->getConfigData('sales.taxes.calculation.product_prices')\n\n+ core()->getConfigData('sales.taxes.calculation.shipping_prices')\n\n- core()->getConfigData('taxes.catalogue.default_location_calculation.country')\n+ core()->getConfigData('sales.taxes.default_destination_calculation.country')\n\n- core()->getConfigData('taxes.catalogue.default_location_calculation.state')\n+ core()->getConfigData('sales.taxes.default_destination_calculation.state')\n\n- core()->getConfigData('taxes.catalogue.default_location_calculation.postcode')\n+ core()->getConfigData('sales.taxes.default_destination_calculation.postcode')\n```\n\n2: The `repository` option has been replaced with `options`. Now, you can use `options` as shown below to populate select field options from the database.\n\n```diff\n'key'    => 'sales.taxes.categories',\n'name'   => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.taxes.categories.title',\n'info'   => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.taxes.categories.title-info',\n'sort'   => 1,\n'fields' => [\n    [\n        'name'       => 'shipping',\n        'title'      => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.taxes.categories.shipping',\n        'type'       => 'select',\n        'default'    => 0,\n-       'repository' => '\\Webkul\\Tax\\Repositories\\TaxCategoryRepository@getConfigOptions',\n+       'options'    => '\\Webkul\\Tax\\Repositories\\TaxCategoryRepository@getConfigOptions',\n}\n```\n\n3. The Inventory Stock Options configuration has been relocated to the Order Settings configuration, and the respective path for retrieving configuration values has been updated accordingly\n\n```diff\n- core()->getConfigData('catalog.inventory.stock_options.back_orders')\n+ core()->getConfigData('sales.order_settings.stock_options.back_orders')\n```\n\n4. The product storefront search mode configuration `core()->getConfigData('catalog.products.storefront.search_mode')` has been replaced with the following configurations, and the corresponding paths for retrieving configuration values have been updated:\n\n\n```diff\n- core()->getConfigData('catalog.products.storefront.search_mode')\n\n+ core()->getConfigData('catalog.products.search.engine')\n+ core()->getConfigData('catalog.products.search.admin_mode')\n+ core()->getConfigData('catalog.products.search.storefront_mode')\n```\n\n`core()->getConfigData('catalog.products.search.engine')` represents the search engine for products. If \"Elastic Search\" is selected, elastic indexing will be enabled. The other two configurations (`catalog.products.search.admin_mode` and `catalog.products.search.storefront_mode`) will function relative to this configuration.\n\n5: The `locale_based` setting in the sales shipping origin configuration has been updated to support multiple locale values.\n\n```diff\n[\n    'key'    => 'sales.shipping.origin',\n    'name'   => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.shipping.origin.title',\n    'info'   => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.shipping.origin.title-info',\n    'sort'   => 0,\n    'fields' => [\n        [\n            'name'          => 'city',\n            'title'         => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.shipping.origin.city',\n            'type'          => 'text',\n            'validation'    => 'required',\n            'channel_based' => true,\n-           'locale_based'  => false,\n+           'locale_based'  => true,\n        ], [\n            'name'          => 'address',\n            'title'         => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.shipping.origin.street-address',\n            'type'          => 'text',\n            'validation'    => 'required',\n            'channel_based' => true,\n-           'locale_based'  => false,\n+           'locale_based'  => true,\n        ], [\n            'name'          => 'zipcode',\n            'title'         => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.shipping.origin.zip',\n            'type'          => 'text',\n            'validation'    => 'required',\n            'channel_based' => true,\n-           'locale_based'  => false,\n+           'locale_based'  => true,\n        ], [\n            'name'          => 'store_name',\n            'title'         => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.shipping.origin.store-name',\n            'type'          => 'text',\n            'channel_based' => true,\n-           'locale_based'  => false,\n+           'locale_based'  => true,\n        ], [\n            'name'          => 'bank_details',\n            'title'         => 'admin::app.configuration.index.sales.shipping.origin.bank-details',\n            'type'          => 'textarea',\n            'channel_based' => true,\n-           'locale_based'  => false,\n+           'locale_based'  => true,\n        ],\n    ],\n]\n```\n\nIf you are migrating your existing store to this version, please save the configuration values again, as previously saved values will no longer work.\n\n6. The Allow Guest Checkout configuration has been relocated to the Sales configuration under Checkout, and the respective path for retrieving configuration values has been updated accordingly\n\n```diff\n- core()->getConfigData('catalog.products.guest_checkout.allow_guest_checkout')\n+ core()->getConfigData('sales.checkout.shopping_cart.allow_guest_checkout')\n```\n\n7. The Wishlist Option configuration has been relocated to the Customer configuration under Setting, and the respective path for retrieving configuration values has been updated accordingly\n\n```diff\n- core()->getConfigData('general.content.shop.wishlist_option')\n+ core()->getConfigData('customer.settings.wishlist.wishlist_option')\n```\n\n8. The `locale_based` and `channel_based` settings in the customer products settings configuration have been updated to no longer be locale- or channel-based.\n\n```diff\n[\n    'key'    => 'catalog.products.settings',\n    'name'   => 'admin::app.configuration.index.general.content.settings.title',\n    'info'   => 'admin::app.configuration.index.general.content.settings.title-info',\n    'sort'   => 1,\n    'fields' => [\n        [\n            'name'          => 'compare_option',\n            'title'         => 'admin::app.configuration.index.general.content.settings.compare-options',\n            'type'          => 'boolean',\n            'default'       => 1,\n-           'locale_based'  => true,\n-           'channel_based' => true,\n        ], [\n            'name'          => 'image_search',\n            'title'         => 'admin::app.configuration.index.general.content.settings.image-search-option',\n            'type'          => 'boolean',\n            'default'       => 1,\n-           'locale_based'  => true,\n-           'channel_based' => true,\n        ],\n    ],\n]\n```\n\n9. The `locale_based` and `channel_based` settings in the customer settings wishlist configuration have been updated to no longer be locale- or channel-based.\n\n```diff\n[\n    'key'    => 'customer.settings.wishlist',\n    'name'   => 'Wishlist',\n    'info'   => 'Enable or disable the wishlist option.',\n    'sort'   => 2,\n    'fields' => [\n        [\n            'name'    => 'wishlist_option',\n            'title'   => 'Allow Wishlist option',\n            'type'    => 'boolean',\n            'default' => 1,\n-           'locale_based'  => true,\n-           'channel_based' => true,\n        ],\n    ],\n]\n```\n\n10. The Back Order configuration has been relocated to the Catalog Inventory under Stock Options, and the respective path for retrieving configuration values has been updated accordingly\n\n```diff\n- core()->getConfigData('sales.order_settings.stock_options.back_orders')\n+ core()->getConfigData('catalog.inventory.stock_options.back_orders')\n```\n\n11. The `channel_based` settings in the customer settings wishlist configuration have been updated to no longer be locale- or channel-based.\n\n```diff\n[\n    'key'    => 'catalog.inventory.stock_options',\n    'name'   => 'Product Stock Options',\n    'info'   => 'Product Stock Options',\n    'sort'   => 1,\n    'fields' => [\n        [\n            'name'          => 'back_orders',\n            'title'         => 'Allow Back Orders',\n            'type'          => 'boolean',\n            'default'       => false,\n-           'channel_based' => true,\n        ],\n    ],\n]\n```\n\n10. The Invoice Slip Design Logo configuration has been relocated to the Sales Invoice Setting under PDF Print Outs, and the respective path for retrieving configuration values has been updated accordingly\n\n```diff\n- core()->getConfigData('sales.invoice_settings.invoice_slip_design.logo')\n+ core()->getConfigData('sales.invoice_settings.pdf_print_outs.logo')\n```\n\n\n<a name=\"renamed-admin-api-routes-names\"></a>\n#### Renamed Admin API Route Names\n\n**Impact Probability: Low**\n\n1. In the `packages/Webkul/Admin/src/Routes/sales-routes.php` route file, route names and controller methods have been renamed to provide clearer and more meaningful representations.\n\n```diff\n- Route::post('update-qty/{order_id}', 'updateQty')->name('admin.sales.refunds.update_qty');\n+ Route::post('update-totals/{order_id}', 'updateTotals')->name('admin.sales.refunds.update_totals');\n```\n\n<a name=\"admin-event-updates\"></a>\n#### Admin Event Updates\n\n**Impact Probability: High**\n\n#### Admin Event Inside Head Updated\n\n1. The event that was previously added in Admin has now been updated in the new format. You can now directly add your own custom elements inside the <head> tag.\n\n```diff\n+ {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.layout.head.before') !!}\n\n- {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.layout.head') !!}\n+ {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.layout.head.after') !!}\n```\n\n<a name=\"renamed-admin-view-render-event-names\"></a>\n#### Renamed Admin View Render Event Names\n\n**Impact Probability: Low**\n\n1. The View render event names have been updated for consistency in the `packages/Webkul/Admin/src/Resources/views/dashboard/index.blade.php` blade file.\n\n```diff\n- {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.dashboard.overall_detailes.before') !!}\n+ {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.dashboard.overall_details.before') !!}\n\n- {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.dashboard.overall_detailes.after') !!}\n+ {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.dashboard.overall_details.after') !!}\n\n- {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.dashboard.todays_detailes.before') !!}\n+ {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.dashboard.todays_details.before') !!}\n\n- {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.dashboard.todays_detailes.after') !!}\n+ {!! view_render_event('bagisto.admin.dashboard.todays_details.after') !!}\n```\n\n<a name=\"repository-update-method-signature-updated\"></a>\n\n#### Repository Update Method Signature Updated\n\n1. We have updated the signature of the `update` method in the `Repositories` class to streamline its functionality and improve code clarity. The method previously accepted three arguments, but the third argument, `$attribute`, is no longer necessary. The updated method signature is as follows:\n\n```diff\n- public function update(array $data, $id, $attribute = 'id')\n+ public function update(array $data, $id)\n```\n\n2. We have updated the signature of the `update` method in the `ProductRepository` to improve its functionality and provide greater flexibility in specifying which attributes should be updated. The method previously accepted three arguments, but the third argument, `$attribute`, has been modified to `$attributes`, which now accepts an array of attributes to be updated. The updated method signature is as follows:\n\n```diff\n- public function update(array $data, $id, $attribute = 'id')\n+ public function update(array $data, $id, $attributes = [])\n\n```\n\n<a name=\"optimize-the-configuration-section\"></a>\n\n#### Optimize The Configuration Section\n\nWe are removing the `packages/Webkul/Core/src/Tree.php` file and also removing the `CoreConfigField` trait from `CoreConfigRepository.php` file. Its important methods have been moved into `packages/Webkul/Core/src/SystemConfig/ItemField.php` because the `ItemField.php` file is responsible for each field of configuration items.\n\n```diff\n-<?php\n-\n-namespace Webkul\\Core;\n-\n-use Illuminate\\Support\\Facades\\Request;\n-\n-class Tree\n-{\n-    /**\n-     * Contains tree item\n-     *\n-     * @var array\n-     */\n-    public $items = [];\n-\n-    /**\n-     * Contains acl roles\n-     *\n-     * @var array\n-     */\n-    public $roles = [];\n-\n-    /**\n-     * Contains current item route\n-     *\n-     * @var string\n-     */\n-    public $current;\n-\n-    /**\n-     * Contains current item key\n-     *\n-     * @var string\n-     */\n-    public $currentKey;\n-\n-    /**\n-     * Create a new instance.\n-     *\n-     * @return void\n-     */\n-    public function __construct()\n-    {\n-        $this->current = Request::url();\n-    }\n-\n-    /**\n-     * Shortcut method for create a Config with a callback.\n-     * This will allow you to do things like fire an event on creation.\n-     *\n-     * @param  callable  $callback  Callback to use after the Config creation\n-     * @return object\n-     */\n-    public static function create($callback = null)\n-    {\n-        $tree = new Tree();\n-\n-        if ($callback) {\n-            $callback($tree);\n-        }\n-\n-        return $tree;\n-    }\n-\n-    /**\n-     * Add a Config item to the item stack\n-     *\n-     * @param  string  $item\n-     * @return void\n-     */\n-    public function add($item, $type = '')\n-    {\n-        $item['children'] = [];\n-\n-        if ($type == 'menu') {\n-            $item['url'] = route($item['route'], $item['params'] ??

We have updated the `shipping_rates` method to return a HasMany object instead of a HasManyThrough object, as shipping rates are now directly associated with the cart.\n\n```diff\n- public function shipping_rates(): \\Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Relations\\HasManyThrough\n- {\n-     return $this->hasManyThrough(CartShippingRateProxy::modelClass(), CartAddressProxy::modelClass(), 'cart_id', 'cart_address_id');\n- }\n+ public function shipping_rates(): \\Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Relations\\HasMany\n+ {\n+     return $this->hasMany(CartShippingRateProxy::modelClass());\n+ }\n```\n\n<a name=\"removed-cart-traits\"></a>\n#### Removed Cart Traits\n\n**Impact Probability: Low**\n\nAll methods from the following traits have been relocated to the `Webkul\\Checkout\\Cart` class, and the traits have been removed.\n\n<div class=\"content-list\" markdown=\"1\">\n\n- `Webkul\\Checkout\\Traits\\CartCoupons` trait\n- `Webkul\\Checkout\\Traits\\CartTools` trait\n- `Webkul\\Checkout\\Traits\\CartValidators` trait\n\n</div>\n\n<a name=\"the-cart-class\"></a>\n#### The `Webkul\\Checkout\\Cart` class\n\n**Impact Probability: High**\n\n1. The `initCart` method now accepts an optional `Webkul\\Customer\\Models\\Customer` model instance and initializes the cart based on this parameter.\n\n```diff\n- public function initCart()\n+ public function initCart(?CustomerContract $customer = null): void\n\n```\n\n2. The `getCart` method now exclusively returns the cart itself, meaning it will no longer retrieve the current cart.\n\n3. We have updated the `addProduct` method to accept the `Webkul\\Product\\Models\\Product` model instance as the first parameter instead of the product ID.\n\n```diff\n\n- public function addProduct($productId, $data)\n+ public function addProduct(ProductContract $product, array $data): Contracts\\Cart|\\Exception\n\n```\n\n4. We've renamed the `create` method to `createCart`\n\n```diff\n- public function create($data)\n+ public function createCart(array $data): ?Contracts\\Cart\n```\n\n5. The `emptyCart` method has been renamed to `removeCart`, and it now accepts a cart model instance.\n\n```diff\n- public function emptyCart()\n+ public function removeCart(Contracts\\Cart $cart): void\n```\n\n6. We have introduced a new method called `refreshCart`. This method retrieves a refreshed cart instance from the database.\n\n```diff\n+ public function refreshCart(): void\n```\n\n7. The `putCart` method previously found in CartTools has been eliminated. It is now managed within the setCart method in the `Webkul\\Checkout\\Cart` class.\n\n```diff\n- public function putCart($cart)\n```\n\n8. We've enhanced the mergeCart method to now accept an instance of the `Webkul\\Customer\\Models\\Customer` model. Previously, we merged the guest cart with the logged-in customer's cart by fetching the current customer within this method. However, it now directly accepts the `Webkul\\Customer\\Models\\Customer` model instance.\n\n```diff\n- public function mergeCart(): void\n+ public function mergeCart(CustomerContract $customer): void\n```\n\n9. The `saveCustomerDetails` method has been renamed to `setCustomerPersonnelDetails`\n\n```diff\n- public function saveCustomerDetails(): void\n+ public function setCustomerPersonnelDetails(): void\n```\n\n10. We have removed the following methods and relocated the cart data transformation to a separate resource class named `Webkul\\Sales\\Transformers\\OrderResource`.\n\n```diff\n- public function prepareDataForOrder(): array\n\n- public function prepareDataForOrderItem(): array\n\n- public function toArray(): array\n```\n\n11. The `collectTotals` method now returns a self instance instead of void, allowing for chaining multiple methods with the Cart facade.\n\n```diff\n- public function collectTotals(): void\n+ public function collectTotals(): self\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"datagrid\"></a>\n### DataGrid\n\n<a name=\"the-datagrid-class\"></a>\n#### The `Webkul\\DataGrid\\DataGrid` Class\n\n**Impact Probability: Medium**\n\n1. We have made some of the methods in this class protected. Here are the methods, please have a look.\n\n```diff\n- public function validatedRequest(): array\n+ protected function validatedRequest(): array\n\n- public function processRequestedFilters(array $requestedFilters)\n+ protected function processRequestedFilters(array $requestedFilters)\n\n- public function processRequestedSorting($requestedSort)\n+ protected function processRequestedSorting($requestedSort)\n\n- public function processRequestedPagination($requestedPagination): LengthAwarePaginator\n+ protected function processRequestedPagination($requestedPagination): LengthAwarePaginator\n\n- public function processRequest(): void\n+ protected function processRequest(): void\n\n- public function sanitizeRow($row): \\stdClass\n+ protected function sanitizeRow($row): \\stdClass\n\n- public function formatData(): array\n+ protected function formatData(): array\n\n- public function prepare(): void\n+ protected function prepare(): void\n```\n\n2. We have deprecated the 'toJson' method. Instead of 'toJson', please use the 'process' method.\n\n```diff\n- app(AttributeDataGrid::class)->toJson();\n+ datagrid(AttributeDataGrid::class)->process();\n```\n\n3. The setExportFile method will now only accept the file format:\n\n```diff\n- public function setExportFile($records, $format = 'csv') \n+ public function setExportFile($format = 'csv')\n```\n\n<a name=\"the-column-class\"></a>\n#### The `Webkul/DataGrid/src/Column` Class\n\n**Impact Probability: Medium**\n\n1. The `Column` class has undergone a change in how it stores the fully qualified column name. The property name and its access level have been modified.\n\n```diff\n- public $databaseColumnName;\n+ protected $columnName;\n\n- public string $index;\n+ protected string $index;\n\n- public string $label;\n+ protected string $label;\n\n- public string $type;\n+ protected string $type;\n\n- public bool $searchable = false;\n+ protected bool $searchable = false;\n\n- public bool $filterable = false,\n+ protected bool $filterable = false;\n\n- public bool $sortable = false,\n+ protected bool $sortable = false;\n\n- public mixed $closure = null,\n+ protected mixed $closure = null;\n```\n\n2. The setDatabaseColumnName method has been renamed to setColumnName  and the getDatabaseColumnName method has been renamed to geDatabaseColumnName.\n\n```diff\n- public function setDatabaseColumnName(mixed $databaseColumnName = null)\n+ public function setColumnName(mixed $columnName): void\n\n- public function getDatabaseColumnName(): mixed\n+ public function getColumnName(): mixed\n```\n\n3. The `getRangeOptions` method has been removed from `Column` class and its functionality is now managed by the `DateRangeOptionEnum` class located in `Webkul/DataGrid/src/Enums/DateRangeOptionEnum.php` through the `options`  method.\n\n```diff\n- public function getRangeOptions(string $format = 'Y-m-d'): array\n+ public static function options(string $format = 'Y-m-d H:i:s'): array\n```\n\n4. The following methods have been removed from the backend and their functionalities are now managed from the front end:\n\n```diff\n- public function setFormInputType(string $formInputType): void\n\n- public function getFormInputType(): ?string\n\n- public function setFormOptions(array $formOptions): void\n\n- public function getFormOptions(): ?array\n\n- public function getBooleanOptions(): array\n```\n\n5. The `Column` class constructor now accepts a single array of properties instead of individual parameters.\n\n```diff\n- public function __construct(\n-    public string $index,\n-    public string $label,\n-    public string $type,\n-    public ?array $options = null,\n-    public bool $searchable = false,\n-    public bool $filterable = false,\n-    public bool $sortable = false,\n-    public mixed $closure = null,\n- ) {\n-      $this->init();\n- }\n+ public function __construct(array $column)\n+ {\n+   $this->init($column);\n+ }\n```\n\n6. The column types are now updated The available column types are now defined as follows:`string`, `integer`, `float`, `boolean`, `date`, `datetime`, `aggregate`.\nAnd the available FilterType `filterable_type` are now defined as follows: `dropdown`,`date_range`,`datetime_range`.   \n\n```diff\n- $this->addColumn([\n-    'index'      => 'attribute_family',\n-    'label'      => trans('admin::app.catalog.products.index.datagrid.attribute-family'),\n-    'type'       => 'dropdown',\n-    'options'    => [\n-        'type' => 'basic',\n-        'params' => [\n-            'options' => $this->attributeFamilyRepository->all(['name as label', 'id as value'])->toArray(),\n-        ],\n-    ],\n-    'searchable' => false,\n-    'filterable' => true,\n-    'sortable'   => false,\n- ]); \n+ $this->addColumn([\n+    'index'              => 'attribute_family',\n+    'label'              => trans('admin::app.catalog.products.index.datagrid.attribute-family'),\n+    'type'               => 'string',\n+    'filterable'         => true,\n+    'filterable_type'    => 'dropdown',\n+    'filterable_options' => $this->attributeFamilyRepository->all(['name as label', 'id as value'])->toArray(),\n+ ]);\n```\n\n7. By default, the properties `searchable`, `filterable`, and `sortable` will be false if you need to activate them, set them to `true`.\n\n<a name=\"the-datagrid-export-class\"></a>\n#### The `Webkul\\Admin\\Exports\\DataGridExport` Class\n\n**Impact Probability: Medium**\n\n1. This class will now accept the full DataGrid instance instead of the records to enhance the export features:\n\n```diff\n- public function __construct(protected $gridData = [])\n+ public function __construct(protected DataGrid $datagrid)\n```\n\n\n\n<a name=\"notification\"></a>\n### Notification\n\n<a name=\"the-notification-repository\"></a>\n#### The `Webkul\\Notification\\Repositories\\NotificationRepository` Repository\n\n**Impact Probability: Medium**\n\n1.

We have enhanced the `search` method to accept two arguments. The first argument is an array containing the search parameters (e.g., category_id, etc.), while the second argument is an array containing the options.\n\n```diff\n- public function search($categoryId, $options)\n+ public function search(array $params, array $options): array\n```\n\n2.  We've enhanced the `getFilters` method to now accept an array of parameters, as request parameters will originate from the search method itself.\n\n```diff\n- public function getFilters()\n+ public function getFilters(array $params): array\n```\n\n<a name=\"the-product-repository\"></a>\n#### The `Webkul\\Product\\Repositories\\ProductRepository` Repository\n\n**Impact Probability: Medium**\n\n1. We've made revisions to the `getAll` method to allow for optional search parameters.\n\n```diff\n- public function getAll()\n+ public function getAll(array $params = [])\n```\n\nPreviously, this method returned only active products. Now, it returns all products by default. To retrieve active products, you need to pass `status` and `visible_individually` as `1`. Additionally, you can pass `channel_id` to filter products specific to a channel. You can also specify the search engine by using `setSearchEngine` and passing either `database` or `elastic`.\n\n```diff\n- $products = $this->productRepository->getAll();\n\n+ $products = $this->productRepository\n+     ->setSearchEngine('database')\n+     ->getAll(array_merge(request()->query(), [\n+         'channel_id'           => core()->getCurrentChannel()->id,\n+         'status'               => 1,\n+         'visible_individually' => 1,\n+     ]));\n```\n\n2. We've made revisions to the `searchFromDatabase` method to allow for optional search parameters.\n\n```diff\n- public function searchFromDatabase()\n+ public function searchFromDatabase(array $params = [])\n```\n\n3. We've made revisions to the `searchFromElastic` method to allow for optional search parameters.\n\n```diff\n- public function searchFromElastic()\n+ public function searchFromElastic(array $params = [])\n```\n\n<a name=\"the-product-type-class\"></a>\n#### The Product Types Classes Updates\n\nIf you've implemented your own product type or overridden existing type classes, you'll need to update the following methods to include inclusive tax management.\n\n**Impact Probability: Low**\n\n1: The `evaluatePrice` and `getTaxInclusiveRate` methods have been removed. Please update your `getProductPrices` method accordingly to no longer use these methods.\n\n```diff\n- public function evaluatePrice($price)\n\n- public function getTaxInclusiveRate($totalPrice)\n```\n\n2: Please update your `prepareForCart` and `validateCartItem` methods to include the `*_incl_tax` columns for managing inclusive tax calculation for your product type. You can refer to the `Webkul\\Product\\Type\\AbstractType` class and adjust your class accordingly.\n\n<a name=\"the-configurable-type-class\"></a>\n#### The `Webkul\\Product\\Type\\Configurable` Class\n\n**Impact Probability: High**\n\n1. We've removed the following methods from the `Webkul\\Product\\Type\\Configurable` class as we no longer support default configurable variants.\n\n```diff\n- public function getDefaultVariant()\n\n- public function getDefaultVariantId()\n\n- public function setDefaultVariantId()\n\n- public function updateDefaultVariantId()\n```\n\n<a name=\"the-elastic-indexing\"></a>\n#### The product Elastic Search indexing\n\n**Impact Probability: Medium**\n\nPreviously, Elastic Search was used only on the frontend and not in the admin section. For large catalogs, this caused the Product datagrid to be very slow. To address this issue, we have now introduced Elastic Search in the admin section as well.\n\nTo make Elastic Search compatible with the admin section, some changes were necessary. Previously, only active products were indexed in Elastic Search. Now, all products are indexed with additional keys/information.\n\nPlease run the following command to refresh the Elastic Search indices:\n\n\n```diff\nphp artisan indexer:index

The `create` method has been removed. Previously, it was overridden to set product_id and product_type for the polymorphic relation between `Webkul\\Sales\\Models\\OrderItem` and `Webkul\\Product\\Models\\Product`.

However, you can still access these methods as static methods using the `Webkul\\Tax\\Facades\\Tax` facade.\n\n```diff\n- public static function isTaxInclusive(): bool\n+ public function isInclusiveTaxProductPrices(): bool\n\n- public static function getTaxRatesWithAmount(object $that, bool $asBase = false): array\n+ public function getTaxRatesWithAmount(object $that, bool $asBase = false): array\n\n- public static function getTaxTotal(object $that, bool $asBase = false): float\n\n- public static function getDefaultAddress()\n+ public function getDefaultAddress(): object\n\n- public static function isTaxApplicableInCurrentAddress($taxCategory, $address, $operation)\n+ public function isTaxApplicableInCurrentAddress($taxCategory, $address, $operation): void\n```\n\n2: The new class for handling shipping tax inclusion now includes two additional methods: `isInclusiveTaxShippingPrices` and `getShippingOriginAddress`.\n\n```diff\n+ public function isInclusiveTaxShippingPrices(): bool\n\n+ public function getShippingOriginAddress(): object\n```\n"
