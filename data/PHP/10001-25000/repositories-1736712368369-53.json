Statutory Consumer Rights\n\n### 10.1 CONSUMERS IN AUSTRALIA\n\nIf you acquire the October CMS Software license as a “consumer”, nothing in this EULA will exclude, limit or modify any rights and guarantees conferred on you by legislation, including the Australian Consumer Law (ACL) in the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (‘Statutory Rights’). If the Company is in breach of any such Statutory Rights, then the Company’s liability shall be limited (at the Company’s option) to:\n\n10.1.1 In case of products supplied to you, to resupplying, replacing or paying the cost of resupplying or replacing the product in respect of which the breach occurred;\n\n10.1.2 In case of services supplied to you, to resupply the service or to pay the cost of resupplying the service in respect of which the breach occurred.\n\nUnless expressly specified otherwise in this EULA, you agree that the Company’s liability for the October CMS Software is governed solely by this EULA and the Australian Consumer Law.\n\n### 10.1 CONSUMERS OUTSIDE OF AUSTRALIA\n\nIf you are deemed a “consumer” by statutory law in your country of residence, you may enjoy some legal rights under your local law which prohibit the exclusions, modification or limitations of certain liabilities from applying to you, and where such prohibition exists in your country of residence, any such limitations or exclusions will only apply to you to the extent it is permitted by your local law.\n\nYou agree that apart from the application of your statutory consumer rights, the Company’s liability for the October CMS Software is governed solely by this EULA.\n\n<a name=\"Disclaimer-of-Warranties\"></a>\n## 11. Disclaimer of Warranties\n\nSUBJECT TO YOUR STATUTORY RIGHTS AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 10 ABOVE, THE COMPANY PROVIDES THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE TO YOU “AS IS” AND “WITH ALL FAULTS”.\n\nEXCLUDING ANY EXPRESS WARRANTIES OFFERED IN THIS EULA, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE COMPANY, ITS EMPLOYEES, DIRECTORS, CONTRACTORS, AFFILIATES (“THE COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS”) DISCLAIM ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE OR USAGE IN TRADE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE: WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS; WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE; OR THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO RECTIFY ANY ERRORS, BUGS, SECURITY VULNERABILITIES. NO OBLIGATION, WARRANTIES OR LIABILITY SHALL ARISE OUT OF ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE. NO VERBAL OR WRITTEN COMMUNICATION RECEIVED FROM THE COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS, WHETHER MARKETING, PROMOTIONAL OR TECHNICAL SUPPORT, SHALL CREATE ANY WARRANTIES THAT ARE NOT EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THIS EULA.\n\nALTHOUGH THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY RELEASES UPDATES FOR THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE THAT MAY INCLUDE FIXES FOR KNOWN VULNERABILITIES, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THERE MAY BE VULNERABILITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET IDENTIFIED AND THEREFORE CANNOT ADDRESS. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR TAKING ALL THE PRECAUTIONS AND SAFEGUARDS NECESSARY TO PROTECT YOUR WEBSITE AND DATA FROM ANY EXTERNAL ATTACKS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO KEEPING YOUR OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE INSTALLATION CURRENT AND UP TO DATE.\n\nSOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n<a name=\"Limitation-of-Liability\"></a>\n## 12. Limitation of Liability\n\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD-PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS (ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED), LOSS OF SAVINGS (ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED), LOSS OF OPPORTUNITY, LOSS OF REPUTATION, LOSS OF GOODWILL OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE INSTALLATION, USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE, WHETHER ARISING FROM ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF THE COMPANY WAS PREVIOUSLY ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE LICENSEE SHALL BE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR DETERMINING THE SUITABILITY OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE AND ALL RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS USE.\n\nIN NO EVENT WILL THE COMPANY’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ANY CLAIMS CONNECTED WITH THIS EULA OR THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE, INCLUDING THOSE ARISING FROM ANY BREACH OF CONTRACT OR NEGLIGENCE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID BY YOU TO THE COMPANY FOR THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE DATE WHEN THE CLAIM FIRST AROSE.\n\nNOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE FOREGOING, NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL LIMIT EITHER PARTY’S LIABILITY FOR ANY FRAUD OR LIABILITY THAT CANNOT BE LIMITED BY LAW.\n\n<a name=\"Waiver\"></a>\n## 13. Waiver\n\nYOU HEREBY RELEASE THE COMPANY AND ITS OFFICERS FROM ALL UNKNOWN RISKS ARISING OUT OF OR ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE. IF YOU ARE A RESIDENT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, U.S.A., YOU EXPRESSLY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, OR OTHER SIMILAR LAW APPLICABLE TO YOU, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR OR RELEASED PARTY. ”\n\n**YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND THE WAIVER SET FORTH ABOVE REFLECT A REASONABLE AND FAIR ALLOCATION OF RISK BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY AND THAT THESE PROVISIONS FORM AN ESSENTIAL BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE OCTOBER CMS SOFTWARE TO YOU ON AN ECONOMICALLY REASONABLE BASIS WITHOUT THESE LIMITATIONS.**\n\n<a name=\"Indemnification\"></a>\n## 14. Indemnification\n\n14.1 The Company will defend or settle any claims against you that allege that the October CMS Software as supplied to you for installation and use in accordance with this EULA and Documentation infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party provided that:\n\n14.1.1 You immediately notify the Company of any such claim that relates to this indemnity;\n\n14.1.2 The Company has the sole right to control the defence or settlement of such claim; and\n\n14.1.3 You provide the Company with all reasonable assistance in relation to the defence.\n\n14.2 For any claims of infringement of intellectual property mentioned in Section 14.1, the Company reserves the right to:\n\n14.2.1 Modify or replace the Licensed Software to make it non-infringing provided such modification or replacement does not substantively change the functionality of the Licensed Software; or\n\n14.2.2 Acquire at its own expense the right for you to continue the use of the Licensed Software; or\n\n14.2.3 Terminate the Project license and direct you to cease the use of the Licensed Software. In such cases, the Company will provide you with a full refund of the License Fees paid by you for the Licensed Software in the preceding 12 months. Please note that where the Company directs you to cease the use of the October CMS Software due to a third party claim of infringement, you are under a legal obligation to immediately cease such use.\n\nUnless otherwise provided by law, this Section 14 sets out your exclusive remedies for any infringement of intellectual property claims made by a third party against you and nothing in this EULA will create any obligations on the Company to offer greater indemnity.

It was born out of frustration with existing systems. We feel building websites has become a convoluted and confusing process that leaves developers unsatisfied. We want to turn you around to the simpler side and get back to basics.\n\nOctober's mission is to show the world that web development is not rocket science.\n\n[![Build Status](https://github.com/octobercms/library/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://octobercms.com/)\n[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/october/rain)](https://docs.octobercms.com/)\n[![Version](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/october/october)](https://octobercms.com/changelog)\n[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/october/october/license.svg)](./LICENSE.md)\n\n> *Please note*: October is open source but it is not free software. A license with a small fee is required for each website you build with October CMS.\n\n## Installing October\n\nInstructions on how to install October can be found at the [installation guide](https://docs.octobercms.com/3.x/setup/installation.html).\n\n### Quick Start Installation\n\nIf you have composer installed, run this in your terminal to install October CMS from command line.
