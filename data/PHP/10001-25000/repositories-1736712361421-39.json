Depending on your app, this may or may not make a significant difference.  Updating your config file to a specific DateInterval will add specificity and insulate you from the TTL change in Laravel 5.8.\n\nRefs:\n\nhttps://laravel-news.com/cache-ttl-change-coming-to-laravel-5-8\nhttps://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/fd6eb89b62ec09df1ffbee164831a827e83fa61d\n\n## 2.29.0 - 2018-12-15\n\n- Fix bound `saved` event from firing on all subsequent models when calling assignRole or givePermissionTo on unsaved models. However, it is preferable to save the model first, and then add roles/permissions after saving. See #971.\n\n## 2.28.2 - 2018-12-10\n\n- Use config settings for cache reset in migration stub\n\n## 2.28.1 - 2018-12-07\n\n- Remove use of Cache facade, for Lumen compatibility\n\n## 2.28.0 - 2018-11-30\n\n- Rename `getCacheKey` method in HasPermissions trait to `getPermissionCacheKey` for clearer specificity.\n\n## 2.27.0 - 2018-11-21\n\n- Add ability to specify a cache driver for roles/permissions caching\n\n## 2.26.2 - 2018-11-20\n\n- Added the ability to reset the permissions cache via an Artisan command:\n- `php artisan permission:cache-reset`\n\n## 2.26.1 - 2018-11-19\n\n- minor update to de-duplicate code overhead\n- numerous internal updates to cache tests infrastructure\n\n## 2.26.0 - 2018-11-19\n\n- Substantial speed increase by caching the associations between models and permissions\n\n### NOTES:\n\nThe following changes are not \"breaking\", but worth making the updates to your app for consistency.\n\n1. Config file: The `config/permission.php` file changed to move cache-related settings into a sub-array. **You should review the changes and merge the updates into your own config file.** Specifically the `expiration_time` value has moved into a sub-array entry, and the old top-level entry is no longer used.\n2. See the original config file here:\n3. https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/blob/main/config/permission.php\n4. \n5. Cache Resets: If your `app` or `tests` are clearing the cache by specifying the cache key, **it is better to use the built-in forgetCachedPermissions() method** so that it properly handles tagged cache entries. Here is the recommended change:\n6. \n\n```diff\n- app()['cache']->forget('spatie.permission.cache');\n+ $this->app->make(\\Spatie\\Permission\\PermissionRegistrar::class)->forgetCachedPermissions();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n1. Also this is a good time to point out that now with v2.25.0 and v2.26.0 most permission-cache-reset scenarios may no longer be needed in your app, so it's worth reviewing those cases, as you may gain some app speed improvement by removing unnecessary cache resets.\n\n## 2.25.0 - 2018-11-07\n\n- A model's `roles` and `permissions` relations (respectively) are now automatically reloaded after an Assign/Remove role or Grant/Revoke of permissions. This means there's no longer a need to call `-&amp;gt;fresh()` on the model if the only reason is to reload the role/permission relations. (That said, you may want to call it for other reasons.)\n- Added support for passing id to HasRole()\n\n## 2.24.0 - 2018-11-06\n\n- Fix operator used on RoleOrPermissionMiddleware, and avoid throwing PermissionDoesNotExist if invalid permission passed\n- Auto-reload model role relation after using AssignRole\n- Avoid empty permission creation when using the CreateRole command\n\n## 2.23.0 - 2018-10-15\n\n- Avoid unnecessary queries of user roles when fetching all permissions\n\n## 2.22.1 - 2018-10-15\n\n- Fix Lumen issue with Route helper added in 2.22.0\n\n## 2.22.0 - 2018-10-11\n\n- Added `Route::role()` and `Route::permission()` middleware helper functions\n- Added new `role_or_permission` middleware to allow specifying \"or\" combinations\n\n## 2.21.0 - 2018-09-29\n\n- Revert changes from 2.17.1 in order to support Lumen 5.7\n\n## 2.20.0 - 2018-09-19\n\n- It will sync roles/permissions to models that are not persisted, by registering a `saved` callback.\n- (It would previously throw an Integrity constraint violation QueryException on the pivot table insertion.)\n\n## 2.19.2 - 2018-09-19\n\n- add `@elserole` directive:\n- Usage:\n\n```php\n@role('roleA')\n // user hasRole 'roleA'\n@elserole('roleB')\n // user hasRole 'roleB' but not 'roleA'\n@endrole\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n## 2.19.1 - 2018-09-14\n\n- Spark-related fix to accommodate missing guard[providers] config\n\n## 2.19.0 - 2018-09-10\n\n- Add ability to pass in IDs or mixed values to `role` scope\n- Add `@unlessrole`/`@endunlessrole` Blade directives\n\n## 2.18.0 - 2018-09-06\n\n- Expanded CLI `permission:create-role` command to create optionally create-and-link permissions in one command. Also now no longer throws an error if the role already exists.\n\n## 2.17.1 - 2018-08-28\n\n- Require laravel/framework instead of illuminate/* starting from ~5.4.0\n- Removed old dependency for illuminate/database@~5.3.0 (Laravel 5.3 is not supported)\n\n## 2.17.0 - 2018-08-24\n\n- Laravel 5.7 compatibility\n\n## 2.16.0 - 2018-08-20\n\n- Replace static Permission::class and Role::class with dynamic value (allows custom models more easily)\n- Added type checking in hasPermissionTo and hasDirectPermission\n\n## 2.15.0 - 2018-08-15\n\n- Make assigning the same role or permission twice not throw an exception\n\n## 2.14.0 - 2018-08-13\n\n- Allow using another key name than `model_id` by defining new `columns` array with `model_morph_key` key in config file. This improves UUID compatibility as discussed in #777.\n\n## 2.13.0 - 2018-08-02\n\n- Fix issue with null values passed to syncPermissions & syncRoles\n\n## 2.12.2 - 2018-06-13\n\n- added hasAllPermissions method\n\n## 2.12.1 - 2018-04-23\n\n- Reverted 2.12.0.

2018-04-15\n\n- changes the type-hinted Authenticatable to Authorizable in the PermissionRegistrar.\n- (Previously it was expecting models to implement the Authenticatable contract; but really that should have been Authorizable, since that's where the Gate functionality really is.)\n\n## 2.9.2 - 2018-03-12\n\n- Now findOrCreate() exists for both Roles and Permissions\n- Internal code refactoring for future dev work\n\n## 2.9.1 - 2018-02-23\n\n- Permissions now support passing integer id for sync, find, hasPermissionTo and hasDirectPermissionTo\n\n## 2.9.0 - 2018-02-07\n\n- add compatibility with Laravel 5.6\n- Allow assign/sync/remove Roles from Permission model\n\n## 2.8.2 - 2018-02-07\n\n- Allow a collection containing a model to be passed to role/permission scopes\n\n## 2.8.1 -

2018-01-02\n\n- REVERTED: Dynamic permission_id and role_id columns according to tables name\n- NOTE: This Dynamic field naming was a breaking change, so we've removed it for now.\n\nBEST NOT TO USE v2.7.7 if you've changed tablenames in the config file.\n\n## 2.7.7 - 2017-12-31\n\n- updated `HasPermissions::getStoredPermission` to allow a collection to be returned, and to fix query when passing multiple permissions\n- Give and revoke multiple permissions\n- Dynamic permission_id and role_id columns according to tables name\n- Add findOrCreate function to Permission model\n- Improved Lumen support\n- Allow guard name to be null for find role by id\n\n## 2.7.6 -

You can support us by [buying one of our paid products](https://spatie.be/open-source/support-us).\n\nWe highly appreciate you sending us a postcard from your hometown, mentioning which of our package(s) you are using. You'll find our address on [our contact page](https://spatie.be/about-us).

His original code\ncan be found [in this repo on GitHub](https://github.com/laracasts/laravel-5-roles-and-permissions-demo).\n\nSpecial thanks to [Alex Vanderbist](https://github.com/AlexVanderbist) who greatly helped with `v2`, and to [Chris Brown](https://github.com/drbyte) for his longtime support  helping us maintain the package.\n\nAnd a special thanks to [Caneco](https://twitter.com/caneco) for the logo ✨\n\n## Alternatives\n\n- [Povilas Korop](https://twitter.com/@povilaskorop) did an excellent job listing the alternatives [in an article on Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com/two-best-roles-permissions-packages). In that same article, he compares laravel-permission to [Joseph Silber](https://github.com/JosephSilber)'s [Bouncer]((https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer)), which in our book is also an excellent package.\n- [santigarcor/laratrust](https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust) implements team support\n- [ultraware/roles](https://github.com/ultraware/roles) (archived) takes a slightly different approach to its features.\n- [zizaco/entrust](https://github.com/zizaco/entrust) offers some wildcard pattern matching\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT).
