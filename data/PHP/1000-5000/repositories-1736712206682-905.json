Update your `bootstrap/app.php` with:\n\n  ```php\n  <?php\n\n  use Illuminate\\Foundation\\Application;\n  use Illuminate\\Foundation\\Configuration\\Exceptions;\n  use Illuminate\\Foundation\\Configuration\\Middleware;\n  use Sentry\\Laravel\\Integration;\n  \n  return Application::configure(basePath: dirname(__DIR__))\n      ->withRouting(\n          web: __DIR__.'/../routes/web.php',\n          commands: __DIR__.'/../routes/console.php',\n          health: '/up',\n      )\n      ->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware) {\n          //\n      })\n      ->withExceptions(function (Exceptions $exceptions) {\n          Integration::handles($exceptions);\n      })->create();\n    ```\n\n  If you plan to perform up-time checks against the new Laravel 11 `/up` health URL, ignore this transaction in your `config/sentry.php` file, as not doing so could consume a substantial amount of your performance unit quota.\n\n  ```php\n  // @see: https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/php/guides/laravel/configuration/options/#ignore-transactions\n  'ignore_transactions' => [\n      // Ignore Laravel's default health URL\n      '/up',\n  ],\n  ```\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Set `queue.publish` spans as the parent of `queue.process` spans [(#850)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/850)\n\n- Consider all `http_*` SDK options from the Laravel client in the test command [(#859)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/859)\n\n## 4.2.0\n\nThe Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Laravel SDK v4.2.0.\n\n### Features\n\n- Add new spans, measuring the time taken to queue a job [(#833)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/833)\n\n- Add support for `failure_issue_threshold` & `recovery_threshold` for `sentryMonitor()` method on scheduled commands [(#838)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/838)\n\n- Automatically flush metrics when the application terminates [(#841)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/841)\n\n- Add support for the W3C traceparent header [(#834)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/834)\n\n- Improve `php artisan sentry:test` to show internal log messages by default [(#842)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/842)\n\n## 4.1.2\n\nThe Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Laravel SDK v4.1.2.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix unable to set `callable` for `integrations` option [(#826)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/826)\n\n- Fix performance traces not being collected for Laravel Lumen unless missing routes are reported [(#822)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/822)\n\n- Fix configuration options for queue job tracing not applying correctly [(#820)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/820)\n\n### Misc\n\n- Allow newer versions of `symfony/psr-http-message-bridge` dependency [(#829)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/829)\n\n## 4.1.1\n\nThe Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Laravel SDK v4.1.1.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fix missing `sentryMonitor()` macro when command is called outside the CLI environment [(#812)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/812)\n\n- Don't call `terminating()` in Lumen apps below 9.1.4 [(#815)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/815)\n\n## 4.1.0\n\nThe Sentry SDK team is happy to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Laravel SDK v4.1.0.\n\n### Features\n\n- Capture SQL query bindings (parameters) in SQL query spans [(#804)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/804)\n\n  To enable this feature, update your `config/sentry.php` file or set the `SENTRY_TRACE_SQL_BINDINGS_ENABLED` environment variable to `true`.\n\n  ```php\n  'tracing' => [\n      'sql_bindings' => true,\n  ],\n  ```\n\n### Misc\n\n- Unify backtrace origin span attributes [(#803)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/803)\n- Add `ignore_exceptions` & `ignore_transactions` to default config [(#802)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/802)\n\n## 4.0.0\n\nThe Sentry SDK team is thrilled to announce the immediate availability of Sentry Laravel SDK v4.0.0.\n\n### Breaking Change\n\nThis version adds support for the underlying [Sentry PHP SDK v4.0](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php).\nPlease refer to the PHP SDK [sentry-php/UPGRADE-4.0.md](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/blob/master/UPGRADE-4.0.md) guide for a complete list of breaking changes.\n\n- This version exclusively uses the [envelope endpoint](https://develop.sentry.dev/sdk/envelopes/) to send event data to Sentry.\n\n  If you are using [sentry.io](https://sentry.io), no action is needed.\n  If you are using an on-premise/self-hosted installation of Sentry, the minimum requirement is now version `>= v20.6.0`.\n\n- You need to have `ext-curl` installed to use the SDK.\n\n- The `IgnoreErrorsIntegration` integration was removed. Use the `ignore_exceptions` option instead.\n\n  ```php\n  // config/sentry.php\n\n  'ignore_exceptions' => [BadThingsHappenedException::class],\n  ```\n\n  This option performs an [`is_a`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.is-a.php) check now, so you can also ignore more generic exceptions.\n\n### Features\n\n- Enable distributed tracing for outgoing HTTP client requests [(#797)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/797)\n\n  This feature is only available on Laravel >= 10.14.\n  When making a request using the Laravel `Http` facade, we automatically attach the `sentry-trace` and `baggage` headers.\n\n  This behaviour can be controlled by setting `trace_propagation_targets` in your `config/sentry.php` file.\n\n  ```php\n  // config/sentry.php\n\n  // All requests will contain the tracing headers. This is the default behaviour.\n  'trace_propagation_targets' => null,\n\n  // To turn this feature off completely, set the option to an empty array.\n  'trace_propagation_targets' => [],\n\n  // To only attach these headers to some requests, you can allow-list certain hosts.\n  'trace_propagation_targets' => [\n      'examlpe.com',\n      'api.examlpe.com',\n  ],\n  ```\n\n  Please make sure to remove any custom code that injected these headers previously.\n  If you are using the `Sentry\\Tracing\\GuzzleTracingMiddleware` provided by our underlying PHP SDK, you must also remove it.\n\n- Add support for Laravel Livewire 3 [(#798)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/pull/798)\n\n  The SDK now creates traces and breadcrumbs for Livewire 3 as well.\n  Both the class-based and Volt usage are supported.\n\n  ```php\n  // config/sentry.php\n\n  'breadcrumbs' => [\n      // Capture Livewire components in breadcrumbs\n      'livewire' => true,\n  ],\n  'tracing' => [\n      // Capture Livewire components as spans\n      'livewire' => true,\n  ],\n  ```\n\n- Add new fluent APIs [(#1601)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/pull/1601)\n\n  ```php\n  // Before\n  $spanContext = new SpanContext();\n  $spanContext->setDescription('myFunction');\n  $spanContext->setOp('function');\n\n  // After\n  $spanContext = (new SpanContext())\n      ->setDescription('myFunction');\n      ->setOp('function');\n  ```\n\n- Simplify the breadcrumb API [(#1603)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/pull/1603)\n\n  ```php\n  // Before\n  \\Sentry\\addBreadcrumb(\n      new \\Sentry\\Breadcrumb(\n          \\Sentry\\Breadcrumb::LEVEL_INFO,\n          \\Sentry\\Breadcrumb::TYPE_DEFAULT,\n          'auth',                // category\n          'User authenticated',  // message (optional)\n          ['user_id' => $userId] // data (optional)\n      )\n  );\n\n  // After\n  \\Sentry\\addBreadcrumb(\n      category: 'auth',\n      message: 'User authenticated', // optional\n      metadata: ['user_id' => $userId], // optional\n      level: Breadcrumb::LEVEL_INFO, // set by default\n      type: Breadcrumb::TYPE_DEFAULT, // set by default\n  );\n  ```\n\n- New default cURL HTTP client [(#1589)](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-php/pull/1589)\n\n### Misc\n\n- The abandoned package `php-http/message-factory` was removed.\n"

Please also ask in our [Sentry Community on Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Ww9hbqr) before submitting a new issue. There is a ton of great people in our Discord community ready to help you!\n\nIf you feel that you can fix or implement it yourself, please read on to learn how to submit your changes.\n\n## Submitting changes\n\n- Setup the development environment.\n- Clone the `sentry-laravel` repository and prepare necessary changes.\n- Add tests for your changes to `tests/`.\n- Run tests and make sure all of them pass.\n- Submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.\n- Make sure to update the `CHANGELOG.md` file below the `Unreleased` heading.\n\nWe will review your pull request as soon as possible.\nThank you for contributing!\n\n## Development environment\n\n### Requirements\n\nMake sure that you have PHP 7.2+ installed. Version 7.4 or higher is required to run style checkers. On macOS, we recommend using brew to install PHP. For Windows, we recommend an official PHP.net release.\n\nYou may use [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make) to take advantage of the provided [Makefile](Makefile).\n\n### Clone the repository\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:getsentry/sentry-laravel.git\n```\n\n### Install the dependencies\n\nDependencies are managed through [Composer](https://getcomposer.org).\n\n```bash\ncomposer install\n```\n\n### Running tests\n\nTests can be run via [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de).\n\n```bash\ncomposer tests\n```\n\n### Static analysis\n\nStatic analysis can be run via [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org).\n\n```bash\ncomposer phpstan\n```\n\n### Code style\n\nThe code is automatically formatted through [php-cs-fixer](https://cs.symfony.com).\n\n```bash\ncomposer cs-fix\n```\n\n## Releasing a new version\n\n(only relevant for Sentry employees)\n\nPrerequisites:\n\n- All changes that should be released must be in the `master` branch.\n- Every commit should follow the [Commit Message Format](https://develop.sentry.dev/commit-messages#commit-message-format) convention.\n\nManual Process:\n\n- Update CHANGELOG.md with the version to be released. Example commit: https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-laravel/commit/0c0aabd4976905e279c9e49193265dd51856c219.\n- On GitHub in the `sentry-laravel` repository go to \"Actions\" select the \"Release\" workflow.\n- Click on \"Run workflow\" on the right side and make sure the `master` branch is selected.\n- Set \"Version to release\" input field. Here you decide if it is a major, minor or patch release. (See \"Versioning Policy\" below)\n- Click \"Run Workflow\"\n\nThis will trigger [Craft](https://github.com/getsentry/craft) to prepare everything needed for a release. (For more information see [craft prepare](https://github.com/getsentry/craft#craft-prepare-preparing-a-new-release)) At the end of this process, a release issue is created in the [Publish](https://github.com/getsentry/publish) repository. (Example release issue: https://github.com/getsentry/publish/issues/815)\n\nNow one of the persons with release privileges (most probably your engineering manager) will review this Issue and then add the `accepted` label to the issue.\n\nThere are always two persons involved in a release.\n\nIf you are in a hurry and the release should be out immediately there is a Slack channel called `#proj-release-approval` where you can see your release issue and where you can ping people to please have a look immediately.\n\nWhen the release issue is labeled `accepted` [Craft](https://github.com/getsentry/craft) is triggered again to publish the release to all the right platforms. (See [craft publish](https://github.com/getsentry/craft#craft-publish-publishing-the-release) for more information). At the end of this process, the release issue on GitHub will be closed and the release is completed! Congratulations!\n\nThere is a sequence diagram visualizing all this in the [README.md](https://github.com/getsentry/publish) of the `Publish` repository.\n\n### Versioning Policy\n\nThis project follows [semver](https://semver.org), with three additions:\n\n- Semver says that major version `0` can include breaking changes at any time. Still, it is common practice to assume that only `0.x` releases (minor versions) can contain breaking changes while `0.x.y` releases (patch versions) are used for backwards-compatible changes (bugfixes and features). This project also follows that practice.\n\n- All undocumented APIs are considered internal. They are not part of this contract.\n\n- Certain features (e.g. integrations) may be explicitly called out as \"experimental\" or \"unstable\" in the documentation. They come with their own versioning policy described in the documentation.\n\nWe recommend pinning your version requirements against `1.x.*` or `1.x.y`.\nEither one of the following is fine:\n\n```json\n\"sentry/sentry\": \"^1.0\",\n\"sentry/sentry\": \"^1\",\n```\n\nA major release `N` implies the previous release `N-1` will no longer receive updates. We generally do not backport bugfixes to older versions unless they are security relevant. However, feel free to ask for backports of specific commits on the bug tracker.\n\n## Commit message format guidelines\n\nSee the documentation on commit messages here:\n\nhttps://develop.sentry.dev/commit-messages/#commit-message-format\n"

There is a ton of great people in our Discord community ready to help you!\n\n## Resources\n\n- [![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/documentation-sentry.io-green.svg)](https://docs.sentry.io/quickstart/)\n- [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/621778831602221064)](https://discord.gg/Ww9hbqr)\n- [![Stack Overflow](https://img.shields.io/badge/stack%20overflow-sentry-green.svg)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/sentry)\n- [![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/getsentry?label=getsentry&style=social)](https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=getsentry)\n\n## License\n\nLicensed under the MIT license, see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).\n"
