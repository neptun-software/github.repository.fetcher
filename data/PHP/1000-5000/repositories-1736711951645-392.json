I will review each carefully to make sure it is in line with\n the direction I want the package to continue in. This might mean that some pull requests are not accepted, or might stay\n unmerged until a place for them can be determined.\n\n## Testing\n- [ ] After making your changes, make sure the tests still pass.\n- [ ] When adding new functionality, also add new tests.\n- [ ] When fixing errors write and satisfy new unit tests that replicate the issue.\n- [ ] Make sure there are no build errors on our CI server (https://ci.genealabs.com/build-status/view/8)\n- [ ] All code must past PHPCS and PHPMD PSR2 validation.\n\n## Submitting changes\nWhen submitting a pull request, it is important to make sure to complete the following:\n- [ ] Add a descriptive header that explains in a single sentence what problem the PR solves.\n- [ ] Add a detailed description with animated screen-grab GIFs visualizing how it works.\n- [ ] Explain why you think it should be implemented one way vs. another, highlight performance improvements, etc.\n\n## Coding conventions\nStart reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:\n- indent using four spaces (soft tabs)\n- use Blade for all views\n- avoid logic in views, put it in controllers or service classes\n- ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`), and around hash arrows.\n- this is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.\n- emphasis readability of code over patterns to reduce mental debt\n- always add an empty line around structures (if statements, loops, etc.)\n\nThanks!\nMike Bronner, GeneaLabs\n"

If you'd like to support this, and our other packages, please consider [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/mikebronner).\n\nWe thank the following sponsors for their generosity, please take a moment to check them out:\n\n- [LIX](https://lix-it.com)\n\n## Impetus\nI created this package in response to a client project that had complex, nested\nforms with many `<select>`'s that resulted in over 700 database queries on one\npage. I needed a package that abstracted the caching process out of the model\nfor me, and one that would let me cache custom queries, as well as cache model\nrelationships. This package is an attempt to address those requirements.\n\n## Features\n-   automatic, self-invalidating relationship (only eager-loading) caching.\n-   automatic, self-invalidating model query caching.\n-   automatic use of cache tags for cache providers that support them (will\n    flush entire cache for providers that don't).\n\n## Cache Drivers\nThis package is best suited for taggable cache drivers:\n```diff\n+ Redis\n+ MemCached\n+ APC\n+ Array\n```\n\nIt will not work with non-taggable drivers:\n```diff\n- Database\n- File\n- DynamoDB\n```\n\n## Requirements\n- PHP 7.3+\n- Laravel 8.0+\n    ```diff\n    - Please note that prior Laravel versions are not supported and the package\n    - versions that are compatible with prior versions of Laravel contain bugs.\n    - Please only use with the versions of Laravel noted above to be compatible.\n    ```\n\n### Possible Package Conflicts\nAny packages that override `newEloquentModel()` from the `Model` class will\nlikely conflict with this package. Of course, any packages that implement their\nown Querybuilder class effectively circumvent this package, rendering them\nincompatible.\n\nThe following are packages we have identified as conflicting:\n- [grimzy/laravel-mysql-spatial](https://github.com/grimzy/laravel-mysql-spatial)\n- [fico7489/laravel-pivot](https://github.com/fico7489/laravel-pivot)\n- [chelout/laravel-relationship-events](https://github.com/chelout/laravel-relationship-events)\n- [spatie/laravel-query-builder](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-query-builder)\n- [dwightwatson/rememberable](https://github.com/dwightwatson/rememberable)\n- [kalnoy/nestedset](https://github.com/lazychaser/laravel-nestedset)\n\n### Things That Don't Work Currently\nThe following items currently do no work with this package:\n```diff\n- caching of lazy-loaded relationships, see #127. Currently lazy-loaded belongs-to relationships are cached. Caching of other relationships is in the works.\n- using select() clauses in Eloquent queries, see #238 (work-around discussed in the issue)\n- using transactions. If you are using transactions, you will likely have to manually flush the cache, see [issue #305](https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-model-caching/issues/305).\n```\n\n[![installation guide cover](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1791050/36356190-fc1982b2-14a2-11e8-85ed-06f8e3b57ae8.png)](https://vimeo.com/256318402)\n\n## Installation\nBe sure to not require a specific version of this package when requiring it:\n```\ncomposer require genealabs/laravel-model-caching\n```\n\n### Gotchas If Using With Lumen\nThe following steps need to be figured out by you and implemented in your Lumen\napp. Googling for ways to do this provided various approaches to this.\n\n1. Register the package to load in Lumen:\n    ```php\n    $app->register(GeneaLabs\\LaravelModelCaching\\Providers\\Service::class);\n    ```\n2. Make sure your Lumen app can load config files.\n3. Publish this package's config file to the location your app loads config\n   files from.\n\n## Upgrade Notes\n### 0.6.0\nThe environment and config variables for disabling this package have changed.\n- If you have previously published the config file, publish it again, and adjust as necessary:\n  ```sh\n  php artisan modelCache:publish --config\n  ```\n\n- If you have disabled the package in your .env file, change the entry from `MODEL_CACHE_DISABLED=true` to `MODEL_CACHE_ENABLED=false`.\n\n### 0.5.0\nThe following implementations have changed (see the respective sections below):\n- model-specific cache prefix\n\n## Configuration\n### Recommended (Optional) Custom Cache Store\nIf you would like to use a different cache store than the default one used by\nyour Laravel application, you may do so by setting the `MODEL_CACHE_STORE`\nenvironment variable in your `.env` file to the name of a cache store configured\nin `config/cache.php` (you can define any custom cache store based on your\nspecific needs there). For example:\n```\nMODEL_CACHE_STORE=redis2\n```\n\n## Usage\nFor best performance a taggable cache provider is recommended (redis,\nmemcached). While this is optional, using a non-taggable cache provider will\nmean that the entire cache is cleared each time a model is created, saved,\nupdated, or deleted.\n\nFor ease of maintenance, I would recommend adding a `BaseModel` model that\nuses `Cachable`, from which all your other models are extended. If you\ndon't want to do that, simply extend your models directly from `CachedModel`.\n\nHere's an example `BaseModel` class:\n\n```php\n<?php namespace App;\n\nuse GeneaLabs\\LaravelModelCaching\\Traits\\Cachable;\n\nabstract class BaseModel\n{\n    use Cachable;\n    //\n}\n```\n\n### Multiple Database Connections\n__Thanks to @dtvmedia for suggestion this feature. This is actually a more robust\nsolution than cache-prefixes.__\n\nKeeping keys separate for multiple database connections is automatically handled.\nThis is especially important for multi-tenant applications, and of course any\napplication using multiple database connections.\n\n### Optional Cache Key Prefix\nThanks to @lucian-dragomir for suggesting this feature! You can use cache key\nprefixing to keep cache entries separate for multi-tenant applications. For this\nit is recommended to add the Cachable trait to a base model, then set the cache\nkey prefix config value there.\n\nHere's is an example:\n```php\n<?php namespace GeneaLabs\\LaravelModelCaching\\Tests\\Fixtures;\n\nuse GeneaLabs\\LaravelModelCaching\\Traits\\Cachable;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Model;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Relations\\BelongsTo;\nuse Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Relations\\BelongsToMany;\n\nclass BaseModel extends Model\n{\n    use Cachable;\n\n    protected $cachePrefix = \"test-prefix\";\n}\n```\n\nThe cache prefix can also be set in the configuration to prefix all cached\nmodels across the board:\n```php\n    'cache-prefix' => 'test-prefix',\n```\n\n### Exception: User Model\nI would not recommend caching the user model, as it is a special case, since it\nextends `Illuminate\\Foundation\\Auth\\User`. Overriding that would break functionality.\nNot only that, but it probably isn't a good idea to cache the user model anyway,\nsince you always want to pull the most up-to-date info on it.\n\n### Experimental: Cache Cool-down In Specific Models\nIn some instances, you may want to add a cache invalidation cool-down period.\nFor example you might have a busy site where comments are submitted at a high\nrate, and you don't want every comment submission to invalidate the cache. While\nI don't necessarily recommend this, you might experiment it's effectiveness.\n\nTo use it, it must be enabled in the model (or base model if you want to use it on multiple or all models):\n```php\nclass MyModel extends Model\n{\n    use Cachable;\n\n    protected $cacheCooldownSeconds = 300; // 5 minutes\n\n    // ...\n}\n```\n\nAfter that it can be implemented in queries:\n```php\n(new Comment)\n    ->withCacheCooldownSeconds(30) // override default cooldown seconds in model\n    ->get();\n```\n\nor:\n```php\n(new Comment)\n    ->withCacheCooldownSeconds() // use default cooldown seconds in model\n    ->get();\n```\n\n### Disabling Caching of Queries\nThere are two methods by which model-caching can be disabled:\n1. Use `->disableCache()` in a query-by-query instance.\n2. Set `MODEL_CACHE_ENABLED=false` in your `.env` file.\n3. If you only need to disable the cache for a block of code, or for non-\n    eloquent queries, this is probably the better option:\n    ```php\n    $result = app(\"model-cache\")->runDisabled(function () {\n        return (new MyModel)->get(); // or any other stuff you need to run with model-caching disabled\n    });\n    ```\n\n**Recommendation: use option #1 in all your seeder queries to avoid pulling in\ncached information when reseeding multiple times.**\nYou can disable a given query by using `disableCache()` anywhere in the query chain. For example:\n```php\n$results = $myModel->disableCache()->where('field', $value)->get();\n```\n\n### Manual Flushing of Specific Model\nYou can flush the cache of a specific model using the following artisan command:\n```sh\nphp artisan modelCache:clear --model=App\\Model\n```\n\nThis comes in handy when manually making updates to the database. You could also\ntrigger this after making updates to the database from sources outside your\nLaravel app.\n\n## Summary\n**That's all you need to do. All model queries and relationships are now\ncached!**\n\nIn testing this has optimized performance on some pages up to 900%! Most often\nyou should see somewhere around 100% performance increase.\n\n## Commitment to Quality\nDuring package development I try as best as possible to embrace good design and development practices, to help ensure that this package is as good as it can\nbe. My checklist for package development includes:\n\n-   ✅ Achieve as close to 100% code coverage as possible using unit tests.\n-   ✅ Eliminate any issues identified by SensioLabs Insight and Scrutinizer.\n-   ✅ Be fully PSR1, PSR2, and PSR4 compliant.\n-   ✅ Include comprehensive documentation in README.md.\n-   ✅ Provide an up-to-date CHANGELOG.md which adheres to the format outlined\n    at <https://keepachangelog.com>.\n-   ✅ Have no PHPMD or PHPCS warnings throughout all code.\n\n## Contributing\nPlease observe and respect all aspects of the included Code of Conduct <https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-model-caching/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>.\n\n### Reporting Issues\nWhen reporting issues, please fill out the included template as completely as\npossible. Incomplete issues may be ignored or closed if there is not enough\ninformation included to be actionable.\n\n### Submitting Pull Requests\nPlease review the Contribution Guidelines <https://github.com/GeneaLabs/laravel-model-caching/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>.\nOnly PRs that meet all criterium will be accepted.\n\n## If you ❤️ open-source software, give the repos you use a ⭐️.\nWe have included the awesome `symfony/thanks` composer package as a dev\ndependency. Let your OS package maintainers know you appreciate them by starring\nthe packages you use. Simply run composer thanks after installing this package.\n(And not to worry, since it's a dev-dependency it won't be installed in your\nlive environment.)\n"
