          "content": "# Contributing\n\nContributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.\n\nPlease read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.\n\n## Etiquette\n\nThis project is open source, and as such, the maintainers give their free time to build and maintain the source code\nheld within. They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would be\nextremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.\n\nPlease be considerate towards maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show the\nworld that developers are civilized and selfless people.\n\nIt's the duty of the maintainer to ensure that all submissions to the project are of sufficient\nquality to benefit the project. Many developers have different skillsets, strengths, and weaknesses. Respect the maintainer's decision, and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.\n\n## Viability\n\nWhen requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether it might be useful to others. Open\nsource projects are used by many developers, who may have entirely different needs to your own. Think about\nwhether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.\n\n## Procedure\n\nBefore filing an issue:\n\n- Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.\n- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.\n- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.\n- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.\n\nBefore submitting a pull request:\n\n- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.\n- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIf the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.\n\n- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).\n\n- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.\n\n- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.\n\n- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.\n\n- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.\n\n- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.\n\n**Happy coding**!\n"

If you would like you explicitly define where your models are located, you can publish the configuration file using the following command.\n\n```bash\nphp artisan vendor:publish --provider=BeyondCode\\\\ErdGenerator\\\\ErdGeneratorServiceProvider\n```\n\nIf you're using Lumen and you want to customize the config, you'll need to copy the config file from the vendor directory:\n\n```bash\ncp ./vendor/beyondcode/laravel-er-diagram-generator/config/config.php config/erd-generator.php\n```\n\n## Generating Diagrams\n\nYou can generate entity relation diagrams using the provided artisan command:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan generate:erd\n```\n\nThis will generate a file called `graph.png`.\n\nYou can also specify a custom filename:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan generate:erd output.png\n```\n\nOr use one of the other [output formats](https://www.graphviz.org/doc/info/output.html), like SVG:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan generate:erd output.svg --format=svg\n```\n\n## Customization\n\nPlease take a look at the published `erd-generator.php` configuration file for all available customization options.\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some examples taken from the [Laravel.io](https://laravel.io) codebase.\n\n![Using Database Schema](https://beyondco.de/github/erd-generator/schema.png)\n\n![Customized](https://beyondco.de/github/erd-generator/customized.png)\n\n### Testing\n\n``` bash\ncomposer test\n```\n\n### Changelog\n\nPlease see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information what has changed recently.\n\n## Contributing\n\nPlease see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n### Security\n\nIf you discover any security related issues, please email marcel@beyondco.de instead of using the issue tracker.\n\n## Credits\n\n- [Marcel Pociot](https://github.com/mpociot)\n- [All Contributors](../../contributors)\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT). Please see [License File](LICENSE.md) for more information.\n"
