Different people have different perspectives on issues. Frustration cannot turn into a personal attack. It is important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Also remember that with a world-wide community, English may not be the native language of everyone and since all communication happens via text, it's impossible to read what mood the other is in.\n\n•  Be collaborative\n\nBOINC is a complex whole made of many parts. Cooperation between teams, that each have their own goal and vision is essential. For the whole to be more than the sum of its parts, each part must make an effort to understand the whole.\n\n•  Ask for help when unsure\n\nNobody is expected to be perfect in this community. Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so questions are encouraged. Those who answer should be responsive and helpful.\n\n•  Be patient\n\nNot everyone has the same level of expertise in language or coding, so be patient if an explanation needs to be given.\n\n•  Value decisiveness, clarity and consensus\n\nSocial and technical disagreements should not be left to fester, leaving others uncertain of the agreed direction. The strength of the BOINC community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that that viewpoint is wrong.\n\n•  Resolve issues\n\nDon't forget that it is human to err and that blaming each other isn't productive. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes. Participants in the project should try to resolve disagreements constructively. When it is impossible to reach an agreement, follow the [process outlined in the Governance document](https://github.com/BOINC/boinc-policy/blob/master/Governance.md#5-decision-processes) to come to a solution.\n\n\nWe also adhere to the Github community guidelines, please see https://help.github.com/articles/github-community-guidelines/\n\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

Additional Definitions.\n\n  As used herein, \"this License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, and the \"GNU GPL\" refers to version 3 of the GNU\nGeneral Public License.\n\n  \"The Library\" refers to a covered work governed by this License,\nother than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.\n\n  An \"Application\" is any work that makes use of an interface provided\nby the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.\nDefining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode\nof using an interface provided by the Library.\n\n  A \"Combined Work\" is a work produced by combining or linking an\nApplication with the Library.  The particular version of the Library\nwith which the Combined Work was made is also called the \"Linked\nVersion\".\n\n  The \"Minimal Corresponding Source\" for a Combined Work means the\nCorresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code\nfor portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are\nbased on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Application Code\" for a Combined Work means the\nobject code and/or source code for the Application, including any data\nand utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the\nApplication, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.\n\n  1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License\nwithout being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.\n\n  2. Conveying Modified Versions.\n\n  If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a\nfacility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application\nthat uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the\nfacility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified\nversion:\n\n   a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to\n   ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the\n   function or data, the facility still operates, and performs\n   whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or\n\n   b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of\n   this License applicable to that copy.\n\n  3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.\n\n  The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from\na header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object\ncode under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated\nmaterial is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure\nlayouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates\n(ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the\n   Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n  4. Combined Works.\n\n  You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,\ntaken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the\nportions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse\nengineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of\nthe following:\n\n   a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that\n   the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are\n   covered by this License.\n\n   b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license\n   document.\n\n   c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during\n   execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among\n   these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the\n   copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.\n\n   d) Do one of the following:\n\n       0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this\n       License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form\n       suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to\n       recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of\n       the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the\n       manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying\n       Corresponding Source.\n\n       1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the\n       Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time\n       a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer\n       system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version\n       of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked\n       Version.\n\n   e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise\n   be required to provide such information under section 6 of the\n   GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is\n   necessary to install and execute a modified version of the\n   Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the\n   Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If\n   you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany\n   the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application\n   Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation\n   Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL\n   for conveying Corresponding Source.)\n\n  5. Combined Libraries.\n\n  You may place library facilities that are a work based on the\nLibrary side by side in a single library together with other library\nfacilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this\nLicense, and convey such a combined library under terms of your\nchoice, if you do both of the following:\n\n   a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based\n   on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,\n   conveyed under the terms of this License.\n\n   b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it\n   is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the\n   accompanying uncombined form of the same work.\n\n  6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new\nversions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may\ndiffer in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the\nLibrary as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version\nof the GNU Lesser General Public License \"or any later version\"\napplies to it, you have the option of following the terms and\nconditions either of that published version or of any later version\npublished by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you\nreceived it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser\nGeneral Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide\nwhether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall\napply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is\npermanent authorization for you to choose that version for the\nLibrary.\n"

May 23 2002\n    - Change the scheduling server to reduce database accesses.\n        There's now a shared-memory segment that contains\n        1) the platform, app, and app_version tables in their entirety;\n        2) a fixed-size set of results ready to be sent,\n            and their corresponding workunit.\n        This segment is initialized and maintained by a new program\n        called the \"feeder\" (sched/feeder.C) that should run\n        whenever the scheduling server is up.\n        Note: the scheduler still needs to be converted to fast CGI\n    - Added handy interfaces for dealing with shared memory and semaphores.\n    - Changed to utilities and scripts used for testing so that all\n        server-specific names (paths and URLs) come from environment\n        variables instead of being hardwired in the code.\n        You'll want to add these to your .tcshrc or whatever.\n        See the doc/install.html for details.\n\n    Files:\n    TODO\n    apps/\n        Makefile.in\n    client/\n        app.C\n    db/\n        db.h\n    doc/\n        index.html\n        install.html\n        intro.html\n        tools.html (removed)\n        tools_other.html\n        tools_work.html\n        work.html\n    lib/\n        Makefile.in\n        md5_file.C\n        shmem.C,h (new)\n        shmem_test.C (new)\n        synch.C,h (new)\n        synch_test.C (new)\n    sched/\n        feeder.C (new)\n        Makefile.in\n        handle_request.C,h\n        main.C\n        sched_shmem.C,h (new)\n        server_types.C,h\n    test/\n        account.xml (deleted)\n        account1.xml\n        init.inc\n        test_uc.php\n    tools/\n        add.C\n        create_work.C\n\nHiram C.        Fri May 24 23:34:59 PDT 2002\n        files db/dependencies and client/config.status and client/config.log\n                removed.  These are build time files and should not belong\n                in the source tree.  They confuse subsequent builds.\n        files updated: configure configure.in api/Makefile.in\n                apps/Makefile.in client/Makefile.in db/Makefile.in\n                db/mysql.h lib/Makefile.in sched/Makefile.in\n                tools/Makefile.in\n\n        These Makefile.in changes will allow the build to be performed\n        outside the source tree.  This is convenient for several\n        reasons.  The number one reason is that this allows the source\n        tree to remain untouched by the build and therefore clean.\n        This will prevent garbage build files from being checked in\n        during a 'cvs commit'\n\n        To run a build outside the source tree, simply make an object\n        directory anywhere else that you would like to work, then just\n        execute the configure script in the top-level boinc directory.\n                $ mkdir boincobj\n                $ cd boincobj\n                $ <... path to source tree ...>/boinc/configure\n                $ make > make.out 2>&1 &\n\n        Note the examples in apps/Makefile.in and sched/Makefile.in\n        of how to use the top_srcdir variable to locate include files\n        in the source tree outside of the current directory.  Local\n        references to other object files and libraries produced by\n        the build remain as local .. references.\n\n        The change to configure.in, (and thus configure) and db/mysql.h\n        allow a proper identification of where the mysql .h files live.\n        The SSL location of /usr/local/mysql/include is a bit non-standard.\n        Most systems will have these in /usr/local/include/mysql\n\nHiram C.                Sat May 25 09:20:25 PDT 2002\n        Continue updating:\n        Makefile.in config.guess configure configure.in api/Makefile.in\n        apps/Makefile.in client/Makefile.in client/config.guess\n        client/configure client/configure.in sched/Makefile.in\n        tools/Makefile.in\n\n        I have almost clean builds now on Solaris, Mac OS X,\n        and UnixWare.  There appears to be a missing sched_shmem.h\n        file from the source tree.\n\n        There is still cruft in this configure system.  I will continue\n        to work on it to clean it up.\n\nDavid A.        May 29, 2002\n    - Mostly implemented support for editing preferences,\n        including project-specific preferences.\n        Simplified the preferences scheme.\n        Abandoned the idea of multiple preference sets per user;\n        each user now has a single set of preferences.\n        Got rid of the \"prefs\" database table;\n        prefs are now just an XML and mod_time field in the user table.\n        Haven't tested much yet.\n\n    NOTE: these new features use the XML parsing features of PHP.\n    This means that, on the BOINC web server,\n    you must configure PHP with the --with-xml option,\n    and you must make and install Apache.\n    Also, you probably need to use a recent version of PHP;\n    XML parsing was broken in PHP 4.0.4, but it works in 4.2.1.\n\n    client/\n        Makefile.in\n        speed_stats.C  (fixed code formatting a bit; doesn't compile on linux)\n    db/\n        Makefile.in\n        db.h\n        db_mysql.C\n        schema.sql\n    doc/\n        prefs.html\n    html_user/\n        db.inc\n        prefs.inc\n        prefs.php\n        prefs_action.php (removed)\n        prefs_add_project_action.php (new)\n        prefs_add_project_form.php (new)\n        prefs_delete_project.php (new)\n        prefs_delete_project_confirm.php (new)\n        prefs_edit.php (removed)\n        prefs_edit_disk_action.php (new)\n        prefs_edit_disk_form.php (new)\n        prefs_edit_project_action.php (new)\n        prefs_edit_project_form.php (new)\n        prefs_edit_projects.php (new)\n        prefs_edit_work_action.php (new)\n        prefs_edit_work_form.php (new)\n        test.php (removed)\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        server_types.C,h\n    test/\n        init.inc\n        test_1sec.php\n        test_concat.php\n        test_dynamic.php\n        test_prefs.php\n        test_projects.php\n        test_stderr.php\n        test_uc.php\n        test_uc_slow.php\n    tools/\n        add.C\n\nDavid A.

Thu May 30 01:28:47 PDT 2002\n        updating: client/configure client/configure.in\n        client/net_xfer.C sched/Makefile.in sched/feeder.C\n\n        This now builds just fine on Solaris, Linux and OpenUnix8.\n        And only two tiny errors remain for a Mac OS X build.\n        That being the specification of g++ in the sched/Makefile\n        and statvfs() is not available on the Mac for\n        the client/hostinfo_unix.C compile.  Need a substitute for\n        that function on the Mac.\n\nEric H.  May 30, 2002\n     Added safeguard to avoid removing root directory when\n     BOINC_DOWNLOAD_DIR and BOINC_UPLOAD_ DIR environment\n     variables aren't declared.\n     test/\n        init.inc\n\nDavid A.    June 1, 2002\n    - Ensure that preferences propagate from the server\n        where they are updated to all hosts,\n        Eliminated concept of \"home project\".\n        Not tested yet.\n        Also to do: replace the \"accounts.xml\" file with\n        a file containing preferences.\n    - Changed the way the client handles preferences.\n        It now saves saves the exact XML it gets from the server,\n        regardless of whether it can parse it all.\n    - Fixed client parsing code to reflect new names for preferences\n    - Changed the way the scheduling server handles prefs in\n        a client/server interaction.\n        If it gets newer prefs, it updates its own DB.\n        If its DB has newer prefs, it sends them to client.\n    - Fixed the test scripts so that they start/stop the feeder also.\n        This required adding a \"ready\" flag to the shared-mem structure\n        so that the scheduling server can find out if the feeder hasn't\n        finished initializing the structure.\n        Also required adding a \"-synch\" cmdline option to feeder.\n    - added utility program (sched/show_shmem.C) for looking at\n        scheduler shared memory\n    - renamed \"types.*\" to \"client_types.*\" to avoid name conflict\n        with system include files\n\n    /Makefile (removed - this is derived from Makefile.in)\n    client/\n        Makefile.in\n        accounts.C,h\n        app.C\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h (new)\n        cs_files.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        file_names.h\n        file_xfer.h\n        hostinfo_unix.C\n        net_xfer.C\n        prefs.C,h\n        scheduler_reply.C,h\n        speed_stats.C\n        types.C,h (removed)\n    db/\n        constraints.sql\n    doc/\n        protocol.html\n    html_user\n        prefs.inc\n    sched/\n        feeder.C\n        handle_request.C\n        main.C\n        sched_shmem.h\n        server_types.C,h\n        show_shmem.C (new)\n        ss_reply_file (removed)\n        ss_req_file (removed)\n    test/\n        account1.xml\n        init.inc\n        sched_reply.xml (removed)\n        sched_request.xml (removed)\n        test_uc.php\n    tools/\n        add.C\n\nEric Heien    June 03, 2002\n    - Consolidated XML parsing functions into lib\n    - Fixed compile bug on Solaris in shmem.C\n\n    client/\n        parse.C (moved to lib)\n        parse.h (moved to lib)\n        Makefile.in\n    lib/\n        parse.C (moved from client)\n        parse.h (moved from client)\n        shmem.C\n    sched/\n        parse.C (removed, uses lib version now)\n        parse.h (removed, uses lib version now)\n        Makefile.in\n\nMichael Gary        June 04, 2002\n    - Added server side water level functionality, now sends as many work units\n        as necessary to fill the time requested.\n\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n\nEric Heien   June 06, 2002\n    - Changes and additions made to begin porting to Windows.\n    - This code will compile on Windows, but is not quite fully functional.\n\n    client/\n        hostinfo_unix.C\n        hostinfo_win.C (added)\n        http.C\n        main.C\n        net_xfer.C\n        prefs.C\n        speed_stats.C\n        test_file_xfer.C\n        test_http.C\n        test_net_xfer.C\n        util.C\n        util.h\n        windows_cpp.h (added)\n        win_main.C (added)\n    lib/\n        md5.c\n        parse.C\n\nMichael Gary        June 06, 2002\n    - Added client side water level functionality.\n    - Added rsc_fpops and rsc_iops to the client WORKUNIT struct, bun not yet\n        functional since not initialized.\n    - Test scripts to check water level functionality, including minima and\n        maxima.

To prevent buggy servers from zeroing out\n        users' project lists, the client makes sure there's at least\n        one project, and backs up the old prefs.xml into a timestamped file.\n    - The command-line client, if prefs.xml is absent,\n        prompts the user for a project URL and authenticator,\n        and creates an initial prefs.xml.\n    - Each project now has a \"master URL\", with is its home page\n        and also contains <scheduler> elements giving the URLs of\n        its scheduling servers.\n    - Added a class SCHEDULER_OP which encapsulates fetching and\n        parsing a project's master page (if necessary),\n        then making an RPC to one of its scheduling servers.\n        TODO: add retry and failure logic.\n    - A project can have more than one scheduling server.\n        TODO: use all of them.\n    - Project directories are stored in URL-encoded form.\n        This allows project master URLs to have slashes, which is a necessity.\n\n    client/\n        Makefile.in\n        accounts.C,h (deleted)\n        app.C,h\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        file_names.C,h\n        main.C\n        prefs.C,h\n        scheduler_op.C,h (new)\n        scheduler_reply.C,h (deleted)\n    doc/\n        project.html\n    lib/\n        parse.C,h\n    sched/\n        server_types.C\n    test/\n        account1.xml, account2.xml (deleted)\n        init.inc\n        prefs1.xml, prefs2.xml (new)\n        test_*.php\n\nDavid A     June 21 2002\n    -

Added support for upload authentication.\n        This prevents bad guys from filling up data servers with trash.\n        In this scheme, each <file_info> element sent from\n        server to client includes a <max_nbytes> field limiting\n        the size of the file, and includes a digital signature\n        based on the project's \"upload authentication\" key pair.\n        File uploads, instead of being done by PUT, are now done by POST\n        to a CGI program, \"file_upload_handler\".\n        The request header includes the signed <file_info>,\n        and the CGI program verifies the signature and enforces the size limit.\n\n        The affected pieces of code:\n        - Added a function create_keys() in PHP test scripts\n            to create encryption keys.  Call it from all script.\n        - Added environment var BOINC_KEY_DIR saying where keys are kept.\n        - The client must maintain an exact copy of each <file_info> XML,\n            and of the signature, so that it can send to upload server.\n        - Added a new variant of HTTP operation, HTTP_OP_POST2.\n            The existing variants all use single files for request and reply.\n            The new variant (used for file upload) has a request\n            consisting of a memory block followed by (part of) a file;\n            the reply is in memory.\n            This avoid copying possibly huge upload files.\n        - FILE_XFER objects now take a FILE_INFO as initialization argument;\n            needed to convey authentication info.\n            The upload variant creates and sends the authentication header.\n        - Result templates now include a <max_nbytes> in each\n            <file_info> element, and the URLs refer to the\n            file_upload_handler (with no filename)\n        - process_result_template() works differently, since it must\n            generate a digital signature at the end of each <file_info>\n        - create_work expects the name of a private key file.\n        - Added crypt/md5 functions to sign/verify in memory,\n            encode/decode ASCII data in memory, checksum in memory\n    - Change \"gmake\" to \"make\" in top-level makefile.\n        (alias make to gmake if this is a problem)\n\n    boinc/\n        Makefile.in\n        TODO\n    RSAEuro/source/\n        rsaeuro.h\n    client/\n        Makefile.in\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_files.C\n        file_names.C\n        file_xfer.C,h\n        http.C,h\n        main.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n        test_file_xfer.C\n    db/\n        mysql_util.C\n    doc/\n        index.html\n        intro.html\n        master_url.html (new)\n        project_startup.html (new)\n        tools_security.html (new)\n    html_user/\n        index.html\n    lib/\n        Makefile.in\n        crypt.C,h\n        crypt_prog.C\n        md5_file.C,h\n        parse.C,h\n    sched/\n        Makefile.in\n        file_upload_handler.C\n        server_types.C\n    test/\n        1sec_result\n        concat_result\n        init.inc\n        master.html (new)\n        sah_result\n        test_1sec.php\n        test_concat.php\n        test_dynamic.php\n        test_max_water_prefs.php\n        test_min_water_prefs.php\n        test_normal_water_prefs.php\n        test_prefs.php\n        test_projects.php\n        test_stderr.php\n        test_uc.php\n        test_uc_slow.php\n        uc_result\n        ucs_result\n    tools/\n        Makefile.in\n        add.C\n        backend_lib.C,h\n        create_work.C\n        process_result_template.C\n\nDavid   July 4, 2002\n    - fixed compile problems on linux.\n        use kill() instead of sigsend()\n\n    client/app.C\n    sched/file_upload_handler.C\n\nMichael Gary        July 5, 2002\n    - fixed fast cgi crypto\n        use fgets and sscanf instead of fscanf, which\n        is not implemented in fcgi_stdio.h\n\n    sched/Makefile.in\n    lib/crypt.C\n\nDavid A.    July 7, 2002\n    - Added code signing.  All files associated with an app version\n        (i.e. all executable files) must now be signed\n        with the project's \"code sign key\".  The components include:\n        - PROJECT has new field \"code_sign_key\", keep track of project's\n            public code-signing key.\n            Send this on each scheduler RPC.\n        - The scheduling server stores the public code-signing key in memory.\n            Send it to any client who doesn't have it.\n            If the client has an old key,\n            send them the new key signed with the old key.\n            NOTE: this uses a scheme in which signatures are kept\n            in files on the server, to avoid keeping private keys\n            in online machines.  This should be documented.\n        - The utility to add new app versions (add.C) adds a signature\n            to the FILE_INFO element.\n            NOTE: eventually the signing should be done offline.\n        - FILE_INFO has a new boolean field \"signature_required\";\n            set for all files associated with an app version\n        - FILE_INFO has a new char* field \"file_signature\",\n            which is the digital signature.\n            Renamed upload authenticator from \"signature\" to \"xml_signature\"\n            to avoid confusion.\n        - Add function verify_downloaded_file(), called after every download;\n            does MD5 or signature checking as needed.\n        - Added some new functions for signature checking etc.\n        - the client is now linked with the crypt library\n    - Server-side errors should always include the name of the\n        CGI program generating the error (scheduler or file upload handler)\n\n    client/\n        Makefile.in\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_files.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        file_xfer.C\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n        test_file_xfer.C\n    doc/\n        index.html\n        project_startup.html (new)\n        security.html\n    lib/\n        crypt.C,h\n        parse.C,h\n    sched/\n        file_upload_handler.C\n        handle_request.C,h\n        main.C\n        server_types.C,h\n    test/\n        init.inc\n        prefs1.xml\n        test_uc.php\n    tools/\n        add.C\n        process_result_template.C\n\nDavid A.

Summary:\n        - results now have a \"report deadline\".\n            This may be useful for various purposes; for now,\n            we use it to trigger scheduler RPCs to report results\n        - The client now tries all a project's scheduler URLs in turn.\n        - Projects have a \"min_rpc_time\", the earliest time to\n            attempt another RPC (replaces next_request_time)\n        - We maintain an RPC failure count for each project.\n            If RPCs to all its URLs fail, we increment the count\n            and set its min_rpc_time according to an exponential backoff\n        - If a project is getting repeated RPC failures,\n            reread and parse its master URL file every so often,\n            in case the set of scheduler URLs has changed\n        - When the client has a completed result past its deadline,\n            it attempts to report it to that project.\n        - When the client's estimated work falls below low water,\n            it ranks projects according to their \"resource deficit\",\n            then attempts RPCs to project in that order\n            until the estimated work is above high water.\n        NOTE: only the simplest case has been tested.\n        We need to write test scripts for many other cases.\n        NOTE: currently a result's report deadline is now+1000.\n        We need to add a mechanism for setting it.\n    - The CLIENT_STATE is now kept in a global variable instead of\n        a local var of main().\n        This is because SCHEDULER_OP needs to get at it.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        main.C\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n    db/\n        db.h\n        db_mysql.h\n        schema.sql\n    doc/\n        file_xfer_policy.html (new)\n        index.html\n        result.html\n        rpc_policy.html (new)\n    html_user/\n        db.inc\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C\n        create_work.C\n\nDavid A     July 15, 2002\n    - added env var BOINC_MASTER_URL.\n        Each / in the master URL must be preceded by four \\s\n        e.g. setenv BOINC_MASTER_URL  http:\\\\\\\\/\\\\\\\\/localhost\\\\\\\\/index.html\n    - team name must be non-null to be unique\n    - TODO (Barry): make the master page per-project;\n        make database access from PHP/Web per-project\n    db/\n        schema.sql\n    html_user/\n        db.inc\n    test/\n        init.inc\n        master.html\n        prefs1.xml\n    tools/\n        Makefile.in\n\nMichael Gary        July 15, 2002\n    - Fixed compile bug\n    - Updated documentation\n    - Fixed test script bug\n    - Added comments to some .h files\n    - Fixed timing bug\n    doc/\n        api.html\n        client_debug.html\n        flow.html\n        index.html\n        protocol.html\n        sched_debug.html\n        sched_policy.html\n        test.html\n    tools/\n        Makefile.in\n    test/\n        test_uc.php\n        test_rsc.php\n        init.inc\n    client/\n        client_types.h\n        hostinfo.h\n    api/\n        api.C\n        api.h\n\nMichael Gary        July 16, 2002\n    -Fixed test script bug\n    test/\n        concat_result\n        test_concat.php\n\nEric Heien      July 17, 2002\n    - Removed assembly optimized routines from RSAEuro, since we\n      want to be platform independent and RSAEuro isn't a highly speed\n      critical piece of code.  This had the side benefit of making the\n      RSAEuro Makefile operate cleanly with make.\n    - Fixed compiler warnings in RSAEuro demo programs.

August 10 2002\n    - Changed Winmain() to get argc/argv correctly\n    - fixed bugs in CLIENT_STATE::allowed_disk_usage\n        NOTE: keep track of whether units are bytes or GB.\n            Not interchangeable!\n        NOTE: above bugs caused compiler warnings.\n    - Got rid of all compiler warnings in Windows\n\n    api/\n       boinc_api.h\n    client/\n       app.C\n       client_state.C\n       hostinfo_unix.C (??? should remove this from Windows project)\n       pers_file_xfer.C,h\n    client/win/\n       Resource.h (new)\n       win_main.cpp\n       wingui.cpp,h (new)\n\nBarry        August 12, 2002\n    - Changed front page to a php page so we can check for cookies\n         Added explanatory text to front page and to team pages\n\n    html_user/\n        index.php\n\nEric Heien   August 12, 2002\n    - Added concept of result state.  This replaces the old boolean\n      flags and represents what phase of the computation pipeline\n      each result is currently at (downloading, computing, uploading,\n      etc).\n    - Added file upload/download resumption.  For downloads, this\n      involves checking how big the local file is, then asking\n      the server for the remainder of it.  For uploads, this\n      involves asking the file_upload_handler how much of a certain\n      file it already has, then sending the remainder of it.\n      Both ul and dl resumption need to be thoroughly tested.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        client_state.h\n        client_types.C\n        client_types.h\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_files.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        file_xfer.C\n        http.C\n        net_xfer.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n    sched/\n        file_upload_handler.C\n\nDavid    August 12 2002\n    - Cleaned up initialization code:\n        main.C is now used ONLY for CLI versions\n        (remove this file from GUI projects)\n        Factored out initialization code that is common to\n        both GUI and CLI versions.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C,h\n        log_flags.C,h\n        main.C\n        prefs.h\n\nEric Heien  August 13, 2002\n    - Implemented correct handling of RSA or MD5 failures.

adding missing clause to SCHEDULER_OP::poll(); was failing to\n        return state to IDLE, caused reply to get processed twice\n    - return user name, total credit, avg credit in scheduler RPC reply\n        - save/restore these in client state file\n    - client was trying to delete \"checkpoint CPU file\" in wrong directory\n    - change CLIENT_STATE field from \"version\" to \"core_client_version\"\n    - got rid of CLIENT_STATE::update_net_stats(), insert_file_xfer()\n        (made some stuff public)\n    - disable host performance measurement (temp! turn back on later)\n    - removed comments of the form\n        read_config_file();    // read config file\n    - in HTTP op of type POST2, it's not an error if htp->file is zero\n    - replaced hardwired HTTP_STATUS constants\n    - made separate db.inc, util.inc in html_ops\n    - key creation prints message before delay, not after\n    - file upload handler prints user name in error log lines\n    - scheduling server: make USER, HOST part of SCHEDULER_REPLY\n        so don't have to pass around as separate args\n    - in test/init.inc, don't use the init_db() from html_user/.\n        define it separately here.\n    -

Further work on credit-granting.\n        On each RPC, the scheduler computes a \"credit per CPU second\"\n        for the host (linear combo of FP/int/mem speeds).\n        For each result received, the scheduler computes a \"claimed credit\",\n        the claimed CPU time times the credit per CPU second.\n        It also sets the \"need validate\" flag of the WU.\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n    apps/\n        upper_case.C\n    client/\n        Makefile.in\n        account.C,h (new)\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        file_names.C,h\n        file_xfer.C\n        main.C\n        prefs.C,h\n    db/\n        db.h\n    doc/\n        account.html\n        boinc_dev.html\n        client_files.html\n        client_logic.html\n        prefs.html\n        startup.html\n        validation.html\n    html_user/\n        prefs.inc\n        prefs.php\n        prefs_edit_project_form.php\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        validate.C\n    test/\n        account1.xml (new)\n        init.inc\n        master.html\n        prefs1.xml\n        test_uc.php\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C\n\nDavid   Sept 26 2002\n    -

Clarified the way that preferences (global and project)\n        are stored in the database and in the core client,\n        and the protocol (part of scheduler RPC) for maintaining them.\n        See doc/prefs_impl.html\n    -

Changed the PHP framework for testing to facilitate\n        multi-project, multi-host tests (all on one machine).\n        See doc/test.html for details.\n    - NOTE: the BOINC-related environment variables have changed.\n        There are no longer any project-specific variables\n        (e.g. database name, shmem key)\n    - NOTE: the server programs now expect a configuration file\n        in their directory.\n    - TODO: enhance the testing framework to allow projects with\n        multiple scheduling servers or data servers\n    - TODO: enhance the testing framework to allow specification\n        of failure and recovery of servers\n\n    - changed things so a NULL in the DB won't crash db_mysql.C\n    - parse_int() can now handle hex\n    -

updated test scripts to use new framework\n    - got rid of some obsolete scripts\n\nDavid   Oct 8 2002\n    - progress getting \"make_work\" (dummy work generator) to work.\n        Removed the <name> element from workunit XML,\n        and the <name> and <wu_name> elements from result XML;\n        instead, the scheduler server inserts these as it sends them.\n\n        This simplifies things a little in work generation,\n        and removes some redundancy.\n\n        Everything seems to work now except that the file upload signature\n        ends up being wrong, which is expected,\n        and it shows that the security mechanism works.\n    - added test_loop.php, which simulates a system that is complete\n        except for the validation process.\n\n    client/\n        http.C\n    db/\n        db.h\n        db_mysql.C\n    html_ops/\n        index.html\n    sched/\n        Makefile.in\n        feeder.C\n        file_upload_handler.C\n        handle_request.C\n        main.C\n        make_work.C (new)\n    test/\n        *_result\n        *_wu\n        *.php\n        test_loop.php (new)\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C,h\n        process_result_template.C\n\nEric  October 13, 2002\n    -

Change make_work so that it generates results with\n        valid file upload signatures.\n        Instead of directly creating new DB.result records,\n        it now calls create_result() to do the work.\n    - Changed create_result() to take a name suffix\n    - Factored key parsing into a function\n    - Removed random-WU-name feature from create_work;\n        names should be generated at a higher level\n    - added a key-generation function to test.inc\n\n    lib/\n        parse.C\n    sched/\n        Makefile.in\n        config.C,h\n        make_work.C\n    test/\n        test.inc\n        test_loop.php\n    tools/\n        add.C\n        backend_lib.C,h\n        create_work.C\n        process_result_template.C\n\nDavid  Oct 15 2002\n    - remove the idea of \"dynamic result\" generation\n        (remove some DB fields and code relating to it)\n    - remove the nresults_* fields from the workunit table.\n        These are redundant, and they weren't being used.\n        Furthermore, they were being updated in a way that\n        overwrote other updates.\n    -

floating-point values are passed to/from MySQL using sprintf and atof.\n        The \"%f\" format, by default, uses 6 decimal places of precision.\n        This is inadequate for small values, e.g. 1e-7.\n        So db_mysql.C should use %.12e instead of %f.\n    - changed all floats to doubles in DB schema\n    - Credit half-life is one week\n\n    db/\n        db_mysql.C\n        schema.sql\n    doc/\n        credit.html\n    html_ops/\n        util.inc\n    sched/\n        validate.C\n    test/\n        test_loop.php\n\nEric  October 28, 2002\n    -

fixed bug that caused file upload authentication failure\n    - The user web site now correctly provides download of the core client,\n        as long as you add a core client app version in your test script\n        (see test_uc.php for an example)\n    - version numbers now come from env vars BOINC_MAJOR_VERSION\n        and BOINC_MINOR_VERSION.  You must set these in your .cshrc\n    - Web server config file must have\n        DefaultType application/octet-stream\n        so that core client is saved as file, not displayed\n    - replaced \"db_name\" file in html_user, html_ops directories with\n        \"config.xml\", which contains download URL as well as DB name/passwd\n    -

Change the file upload handler protocol a little:\n        1) add core client version to request\n        2) add enclosing <data_server_request> element\n    - The file upload handler returns an error if client has wrong version\n    - Split up long function in file_upload_handler.C\n    - Changed name of feeder trigger file so that it works\n        (when did this get broken??)\n\n    client/\n        file_xfer.C,h\n    doc/\n        protocol.html\n        upload.html\n    sched/\n        Makefile.in\n        feeder.C\n        file_upload_handler.C\n        handle_request.C\n        server_types.C,h\n    test/\n        test.inc\n\nDavid   Dec 3 2002\n    - change scheduling server so that by default it doesn't\n        store request and reply messages in files;\n        add \"-use_files\" option to do this\n    - added validation step to test_uc.php;\n        this computes and grants credit\n    -

added initial support for aborting runaway applications:\n        check for exceeding maximum CPU time or disk usage\n    - create_work now takes max_cobblestones and max_disk_usage\n    - split ACTIVE_TASK::suspend into separate suspend, resume functions\n\n    A bunch of coding style notes:\n    - changed ACTIVE_TASK::request_exit() so that it doesn't sleep.\n        ==> The core client should never sleep <==\n        This would cause a period of non-response in the GUI client\n    - changed file_delete() so that it doesn't sleep or retry.\n        Should eventually add garbage-collection mechanism\n    - Most functions NEED to be implemented in the client.\n        So e.g. instead of\n        #if HAVE_SIGNAL_H\n            unix code\n        #endif\n        #ifdef _WIN32\n            win code\n        #endif\n        we should have\n        #ifdef _WIN32\n            win code\n        #else\n            unix code\n        #endif\n        Any compilation that doesn't match anything should cause a\n        compile-time error\n    - change file_size(), dir_size(), CLIENT_STATE::total_disk_usage() etc.\n        so that:\n        1) they report file size in double, not int\n        2) they return an error code, not a size overloaded with error code;\n            size is return in reference param\n    - All fopen()s should check for zero pointer and return ERR_FOPEN\n    - Omit \"this->\" wherever it appears\n\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h\n        file_xfer.C\n        http.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n    lib/\n        filesys.C,h\n    test/\n        test.inc\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C,h\n        create_work.C\n\nDavid  Dec 6 2002\n    - fix bugs in get_local_ip_addr()\n        (need to figure out why they were happening)\n\nEric   Dec 8, 2002\n    - added and tested HTTP proxy support (no SOCKS support yet)\n    - proxy server is specified through environment variable HTTP_PROXY\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C,h\n        http.C,h\n        net_xfer.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n\nHamid  Dec 9,2002\n    - added field client_state to result\n\n    - added some more functionality to repor_project_error()\n      It now adds the following info to stderr_out of the result:\n\n      <message>message if any passed</mesage>\n      <active_task_state>%d</active_task_state>\n      <exit_status>%d</exit_status>\n      <signal>%d</signal>\n      if download had failures\n         \"<download_error>\\\n          \"    <file_name>%s</file_name>\n          \"    <error_code>%d</error_code>\\n\"\n          \"    </download_error>\\n\"\n\n\n      if upload  had failures\n        same as above\n\n      if coudln't start active task for result (in which err_num should be set)\n        \"<couldnt_start>%d</couldnt_start>\\n\"\n\n\n    - The error mechanism right now is such that any failures\n    regarding file_infos (download, upload or whatever)\n    are recorded in the status of the file_infos and then garbage collect\n    called report_project_error.\n    However errors regarding starting and ending active tasks\n    are reported from app.C and cs_apps.C.\n\nSeth  Dec 9, 2002\n        -

run_on_batteries defaults to true\n        (else can't run test_uc.php on batteries)\n    - show correct time diffs in client out\n    - In user_html, use row2() uniformly, and added shading\n    - laid some groundwork for multiple prefs sets\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        main.C\n        prefs.C\n    html_user/\n        prefs.inc\n        prefs_edit_global_form.php\n        project_specific_prefs.inc\n        show_hosts.php\n        user.inc\n        util.inc\n    test/\n        test_uc.php\n\nDavid  Mar 4 2003\n    - added PHP code for creating/editing/deleting multiple pref sets\n        See \"prefs.inc\" for a description of the XML format.\n        Prefs are divided into two subsets (global and project).\n        For each subset there is a mandatory \"primary\" version\n        and optional versions for home, school, and work.\n        The prefs display/editing code has been consolidated\n        and parameterized (subset = global or project,\n        venue = none, home, school, work).\n        This actually simplifies things a little.\n\n    html_user/\n        account_setup_first_action.php\n        account_setup_nonfirst_action.php\n        add_venue_action.php (new)\n        add_venue_form.php (new)\n        prefs.inc\n        prefs.php\n        prefs_edit_action.php (new)\n        prefs_edit_form.php (new)\n        prefs_edit_global* (removed)\n        prefs_edit_project* (removed)\n        user.inc\n        util.inc\n\nDavid  Mar 4 2003\n    -

use venue-specific prefs on client side:\n        - schedule server passes <host_venue> element in scheduler reply\n            (but only when it passes back new global prefs)\n        - when parsing global prefs, if find a matching\n            <venue> element, parse its contents and ignore all else\n        - when passing project-specific prefs to app,\n            look for matching <venue> element\n    - changed XML syntax of venue-specific prefs: instead of\n        <home>...</home>, e.g., use\n        <venue name=\"home\">...</venue>\n    - added safe_strncpy(): always adds zero byte at end.\n        Use this instead of strncpy().\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_state.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        hostinfo.C\n        prefs.C,h\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n    html_users/\n        add_venue_action.php\n        prefs.inc\n        show_host_detail.php\n        user.inc\n    lib/\n        parse.C,h\n        util.C,h\n    sched/\n        Makefile.in\n        server_types.C\n\nDavid  Mar 6 2003\n    - new show_message() conventions (not fully implemented):\n        - all error conditions should call show_message() with MSG_ERROR\n        - all log writes should use show_message() with MSG_INFO\n        TODO: change Win implementation of show_message() to\n        write to window AND to file (stderr.txt or stdout.txt)\n    - messages are now timestamped and show project name\n    - use start_table() and row2() more uniformly in user HTML\n    - user HTML: show message if can't connect to DB\n    - standardize terminology in user HTML: \"general prefs\",\n        \"default computer location\", etc.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        main.C\n        message.h\n        scheduler_op.C\n    doc/\n        prefs.html\n    html_user/\n        add_venue_form.php\n        bug_report_form.php\n        create_account*.php\n        db.inc\n        edit_email_form.php\n        edit_user_info_form.php\n        index.php\n        login*.php\n        prefs.inc\n        prefs_edit_form.php\n        show_user.php\n        team_create_form.php\n        top_hosts.php\n        user.inc\n        util.inc\n    lib/\n        util.C,h\n    sched/\n        *.C\n\nEric  March 7, 2003\n    - Moved common functions (write_log, check_trigger, update_average)\n      into sched_util.C\n    - Added stop_server checking to more server programs\n    - Added update_stats program to periodically update exponential average\n      credit for users and hosts, and to update team credit by summing member credit\n    - Added db_sum, db_query_double to retrieve sums of columns (used by update_stats)\n    - Added db_user_sum_team_expavg_credit, db_user_sum_team_total_credit,\n      db_user_count_team for updating team statistics\n    -

changed windows graphics handling again.  client/app messaging\n                now mainly consists of the client polling the app windows,\n                with apps messaging the client when they change modes.\n                moved most of this into the client's child screensaver window.\n\n        api/\n                windows_opengl.cpp\n        client/win/\n                wingui_sswindow.cpp,h\n                wingui_mainwindow.cpp,h\n\nEric  March 11, 2003\n    - changed client exit to send a quit request to the apps, wait 1\n      second for them to quit, then kill them if they're still open.\n      This allows applications to do a final checkpoint before\n      quitting, rather than lose their recent work\n    -

Quit requests are now sent via the SIGQUIT signal (on UNIX)\n      or a named Event (on Windows), rather than via an XML file\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C,h\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n\nEric  March 13, 2003\n    - Added System V message queue functions to library\n\n    lib/\n        msg_queue.C,h\n        msg_test.C\n\nDavid  Mar 15 2003\n    - added some state diagrams to docs\n    - changed var name from \"giveup_after\" to \"file_xfer_giveup_period\"\n        PLEASE USE MEANINGFUL NAMES, especially for global vars\n\n    todo\n    api/\n        boinc_api.h\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_state.C,h\n        pers_file_xfer.C,h\n    doc/\n        various\n    sched/\n        feeder.C\n\nEric  March 17, 2003\n    - Changed app->client communication to use shared memory rather\n      than files.  The client sets up a shared memory segment when\n      starting the app. The app attaches to it and writes XML tags\n      into a 4K text buffer every second.\n    - The shared memory communication has been tested by hand under\n      Windows and UNIX (Mac OS X).  We should write test scripts for\n      it to make sure.\n\n    configure.in\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C,h\n    apps/\n        Makefile.in\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n        cs_apps.C\n    lib/\n        shmem.C,h\n\nDavid  Mar 18 2003\n    - Don't write signed_xml and xml_signature tags in the state file\n        if they're empty strings\n        (this eliminates malformed XML in state file)\n    - Replace safe_strncpy(foo, \"\", sizeof(foo)) with strcpy(foo, \"\").\n        Reduce noise.\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C\n        file_xfer.C\n        hostinfo.C\n        http.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n\nEric  March 19, 2003\n    - Moved OpenGL context creation/destruction outside of drawing\n      loop.  This seems to improve speed on Windows 98.\n    - Added memory deallocation routine for client_state vectors.\n      This clears up several dozen unnecessary memory leak reports.\n\n    api/\n        windows_opengl.cpp\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n        client_state.C,h\n        cs_apps.C\n        win/\n            wingui_mainwindow.cpp\n\nDavid  Mar 19 2003\n    - general cleanup of user web\n\n    html_user/\n        *\n        show_hosts.php (removed)\n\nDavid  Mar 19 2003\n    - added global pref for max CPUs\n    - added global pref for min interval between disk writes\n        (applies to checkpoint writes only)\n    - added URL field to user table\n    - moved \"send_email\" field from XML to DB\n    - added \"show_hosts\" field to user table\n\n    show_host_public.php (removed)\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_state.C,h\n        cs_apps.C\n        prefs.C,h\n    db/\n        db.h\n        db_mysql.C\n        schema.sql\n    doc/\n        index.html\n    html_user/\n        edit_user_info*\n        host.inc\n        prefs.inc\n        prefs_edit_*\n        show_host_detail.php\n        user.inc\n        util.inc\n    sched/\n        db_dump.C\n    test/\n        test.inc\n    tools/\n        add.C\n\nEric  March 20, 2003\n    - Changed speed tests to use a realtime timer rather than\n      estimating the number of iterations.\n    - Changed floating point test to use more accurate code.\n    - Fixed memory bandwidth test reporting.\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_state.C,h\n        speed_stats.C,h\n\nDavid  Mar 20 2003\n    -

(Eric) fix secs-per-day problem in credit\n\nDavid  Mar 24 2003\n    - added preference for time-of-day restrictions\n        (run only between hours X and Y)\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        prefs.C,h\n    html_user/\n        create_account_action.php\n        create_account_form.php\n        prefs.inc\n\nDavid  Mar 25 2003\n    - account creation is now turned off by putting\n        \"<disable_account_creation/>\" in html_user/config.xml\n    - change name of config file to .htconfig.xml\n        (so can't read via HTTP)\n\n    html_user/\n        create_account*\n        util.inc\n\nDavid  Mar 31 2003\n    - add \"-exit_before_upload\" cmdline option\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C,h\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n    html_user/\n        team_create_action.php\n    test/\n        test_uc.php\n\nDavid  Mar 31 2003\n    - added random field to result.\n        Results are sent in random order, making it hard for hackers\n        to get multiple results for the same WU\n    - user-visible messages about files give names, not URLs\n    - Changed all occurrences of \"time test\" and \"speed test\"\n        to \"CPU benchmark\".\n        Please use accurate, consistent terminology in the code.\n    - changed command-line options:\n        -skip_cpu_benchmarks instead of -no_time_tests\n        -run_cpu_benchmarks instead of -run_speed_test\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C,h\n        file_names.h\n        hostinfo.C,h\n        net_xfer.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n        speed_stats.h\n    db/\n        constraints.sql\n        db.h\n        db_mysql.C\n        schema.sql\n    html_user/\n        prefs.inc\n        user.inc\n    sched/\n        make_work.C\n    test/\n        test_1sec.php\n        test_backend.php\n        test_uc.php\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C\n\nDavid  Apr 3 2003\n    - added macro \"safe_strcpy(x, y)\"\n        ** USE THIS INSTEAD OF safe_strncpy(x, y, sizeof(x))\n    - added macro \"safe_strcat(x, y)\"\n        ** USE THIS INSTEAD OF strcat()\n    - changed dynamically-allocated fields of SCHEDULER_REQUEST,\n        SCHEDULER_REPLY to static\n\n    That combination of the above fixes a bug where a long\n    stderr_out could overwrite other fields of RESULT\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        hostinfo_unix.C\n        http.C\n        net_xfer.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n    doc/\n        index.html\n    lib/\n        filesys.C\n        util.C,h\n    sched/\n        file_deleter.C\n        file_upload_handler.C\n        handle_request.C\n        server_types.C,h\n\nDavid  Apr 7 2003\n    - changed names of DB interface routines to get rid of conflict\n        with SETI@home DB interface\n    - changed name of \"db.h\" to \"boinc_db.h\" to remove conflict w/ SETI@home\n\n    db/\n        db.h (removed)\n        boinc_db.h (new)\n        db_mysql.C\n    sched/\n        *.C\n    tools/\n        *.C\n\nErik  May 6 2003\n    - Added a notion of \"transient\" and \"permanent\" errors on file uploads.\n        A permanent error is returned by the file upload handler if\n            - the request is malformed\n            - filename includes \"..\"\n            - the signature is bad\n            - the file size is larger than allowed\n        PERS_FILE_XFER checks for this return from FILE_XFER\n        and gives up immediately.\n    - FILE_XFER now always parses the server response (not just for file size)\n    - Added some missing error checks to FILE_XFER\n    - Punted on the timezone-related ifdefs:\n        added hardwired ifdefs for linux and unix.\n        Need to revisit this\n    - in PHP test library, add a provision for multiple files per application\n\n    client/\n        file_xfer.C\n        hostinfo_unix.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C,h\n    doc/\n        client.html\n        index.html\n        old_news.html (new)\n        result.fig\n        setiathome.jpg\n        upload.html\n    lib/\n        error_numbers.h\n    sched/\n        file_upload_handler.C\n    test/\n        test.inc\n\nErik  May 8 2003\n    - Added a new class SS_LOGIC that encapsulates the core client's\n        screensaver-related logic.\n        It tries to get graphics-capable apps to provide graphics,\n        and if necessary it draws logo-based graphics or blanks the screen.\n    - Changed ACTIVE_TASK.app_client_shm from a pointer to an object.\n        NOTE: AVOID DYNAMIC ALLOCATION WHENEVER POSSIBLE\n    - got rid of free_mem() stuff\n\n    client/\n        Makefile.in\n        app.C,h\n        cs_apps.C\n        ss_logic.C,h (new)\n    lib/\n        Makefile.in\n        app_ipc.C,h\n\nErik  May 13 2003\n    - Added a notion of \"tentative\" project.\n        This means that the (URL, account ID) pair hasn't been verified,\n        i.e. we haven't fetched the master page, found a scheduler,\n        and done a scheduler op that verified the account ID.\n        If anything fails for a tentative project, call project_add_failed().\n        in the cmdline version this prints an error message,\n        deletes all evidence of the project, and exits.\n        TODO: implement for GUI\n    - Make write_account_file() into a member function of PROJECT.\n    - Got rid of CLIENT_STATE::change_project().\n        The user must detach and attach.\n    - CLIENT_STATE::quit_project() now takes a PROJECT*, not an int.\n        Need to change the GUI code.\n    - got rid of separate WIN_32 implementations of\n        make_project_dir(), remove_project_dir(), make_slot_dir().\n        THIS IS THE WRONG LEVEL FOR PLATFORM-DEPENDENT CODE!\n        Instead, added boinc_mkdir() and boinc_rmdir()\n    - added implementation docs for screensaver logic\n    - test_uc.php: wait for a second before running client.\n        On fast computers the client runs before feeder has seeded shmem.\n\n    client/\n        account.C,h\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        file_names.C\n        main.C\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n        ss_logic.C\n        win/\n            wingui.cpp\n            wingui_mainwindow.cpp\n    doc/\n        client_app.html\n        client_app_graphic.html\n    lib/\n        filesys.C,y\n    test/\n        test_uc.php\n\nErik  May 14 2003\n    - added function to \"reset\" project (stop all current activities\n        and delete everything except sticky files)\n    - added function to \"detach\" from project (the above, plus\n        deleting all files, the account file, and the project)\n\n    client/\n        account.C\n        client_state.C,h\n        main.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n    lib/\n        util.C\n    test/\n        test_uc.php\n\nErik  May 15 2003\n    - added cmdline options for show/detach/reset project\n    - -update_prefs command now takes a URL\n    - added license text to some files\n\n    client/\n        account.C\n        client_state.C,h\n    lib/\n        util.C\n    doc/\n        client.html\n\nErik  May 15 2003\n    - change NET_XFER::net_sleep() so that it does up to about .5 sec of I/O,\n        rather than just one block per socket\n\n    client/\n        net_xfer.C\n\nErik  May 16 2003\n    - set FILE_INFO::upload_offset to -1 before restarting file upload.\n        This forces file size check, so that upload can resume\n        with nonzero offset.\n        NOTE: THE USE OF \"SPECIAL VALUES\" (LIKE -1) IS DISCOURAGED\n    - don't set RESULT::state to NEW after parse.\n        This caused completed results to start over.\n    - PERS_FILE_XFER::start_xfer() is int, not bool\n    - better messages on file transfer failure and project backoff\n    -

Used in SETI@home, but probably has wider\n    application, so I moved it to BOINC.\n\nKorpela 2003/09/03\n   - Added OpenGL header check to configure.ac\n   - Changed gutil.C to use OpenGL header paths found by configure.\n\n    api/gutil.C\n    configure.ac\n\nDavid  Sept 3 2003\n    - Changed the way a WU's resources usage is described.\n       There are now separate estimates and bounds for FP ops.\n       Nothing about integer ops.\n       Disk and memory numbers are bounds.\n\n       This changes the client/server RPC format and the DB format,\n       so it will require a major version number increment\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C,h\n        http.C\n        net_xfer.C\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C,h\n        schema.sql\n    lib/\n        crypt.C,h\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n    test/\n        test_rsc.py\n        testbase.py\n    tools/\n        create_work.C\n\nquarl 2003/09/03\n    - overhauled python scripts\n        - reorganized directory structure. Now 'modules' are under\n          boinc/py/Boinc (so you can do \"from Boinc import *\").\n\n    - all python scripts can run from anywhere\n\n    - start and add.py know where config.xml and run_state.xml are\n      (customizable too)\n\n    - finished database.py and add.py\n\n    - configure runs test/test_sanity.py\n\n    - wrote extensive documentation for python framework and tools; revised\n      other documentation\n\n    py/Boinc/    (added entire tree)\n        Makefile.am\n        __init__.py\n        boinc_db.py\n        boinc_path_config.py.in\n        configxml.py\n        database.py\n        db_def_to_py\n        db_mid.py\n        setup_project.py   (this used to be py/boinc.py)\n        util.py\n        version.py.in\n    test/\n        testbase.py\n    tools/\n        add.py\n    sched/\n        start\n    */Makefile.am\n    configure.ac\n\n    doc/\n        python.php (added)\n        software.php\n        test.php\n        tools.php (added)\n        tool_add.php (added)\n        tool_start.php (added)\n        tool_update_versions.php (added)\n        tools_other.php\n        single_host_server.php\n        create_project.php\n\nDavid  Sept 4 2003\n    - fix bug in scheduler: the buffer in insert_wu_tags() wasn't large enough.\n        This is a powerful argument in favor of using \"string\" everywhere!\n    NOTE: in spite of fix, test_uc.py isn't working.  Problem w/ proxy?\n    - HTTP_OP_SET::poll(): if header read_reply() returns nonzero,\n        set htp->io_ready to false (to avoid lots and lots of spurious recv()s)\n    - in test scripts: if TEST_STOP_BEFORE_RUN is set,\n        go into sleep loop rather than exiting\n        (to avoid deleting the test setup)\n    - factor out get_socket_error()\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        http.C\n        main.C\n        net_xfer.C,h\n        scheduler_op.C\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        main.C\n    test/\n        testbase.py\n\nDavid  Sept 5 2003\n    - changed DB interface to make it possible for an application\n        to use different MySQL databases at the same time.\n        A new class DB_CONN represents a connection to a database.\n        Old functions like boinc_db_open() etc. are members of this class.\n        The connection to the BOINC database is represented by\n        by a global object \"boinc_db\" of this class.\n        You're free to have others\n        (e.g. \"app_db\" in the work gen or assimilator for an app)\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C,h\n        db_base.C,h\n    html_ops/\n        db_ops.php\n    sched/\n        *.C\n\nKarl 2003/09/05\n    - restructured application add system; rewrote update_versions:\n        - applications now go in <config.xml:apps_dir>/APPLICATION/\n        - update_versions checks for all versions of core client and all\n          applications, regardless of package version\n\n    py/Boinc/\n        configxml.py\n        database.py\n        db_mid.py\n        tools.py (new)\n\n    tools/\n        add.py\n        update_versions\n\n    - renamed add.C output to old_add and renamed add.py to add\n\n    tools/\n        Makefile.am\n        add.py -> add  (renamed)\n\n\n    - astropulse: use a protocol version number separate of the astropulse\n      client version\n\n    astropulse/client/\n        *.C\n\n    - misc.

I didn't fix all the API routines where parameters\n      should be const.  Using C++ makes it important to get these right.\n\n      tools/backend_lib.[Ch]\n      tools/create_work.C\n      tools/process_result_template.C\n\nJeff 2003/09/17\n    No code changes.  This is the branch point for the seti beta.  The tag is:\n\n        setiathome-4.xx_all_platforms_beta\n\n    for both seti_boinc and boinc.  They both make on solaris without serious\n    error and the resulting seti client links without error with the resulting\n    boinc libs.\n\nKarl,Eric Heien 2003/09/18\n    - fixed some pre-ANSI C\n    sched/\n        transitioner.C\n    tools/\n        create_work.C\n\nDavid  Sept 21 2003\n    - Added mechanism for marking results as COULDNT_SEND:\n        When the scheduler finds that a result is infeasible\n        for a host, it increments the \"infeasible_count\" in the work array.\n        When the feeder finds that too many results in the array\n        have nonzero infeasible_count, it marks some of them\n        as COULDNT_SEND and removes them from the array\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.h\n    sched/\n        feeder.C\n        handle_request.C\n        sched_shmem.h\n\nDavid  Sept 21 2003\n    - Partly debugged the above changes:\n    - The feeder's result enumeration should have no limit;\n        otherwise it may enumerate the same results over and over\n    - If the infeasible_count of a result a threshold (MAX_INFEASIBLE_COUNT)\n        the feeder marks it as couldnt_send.\n        This prevents a situation where results sit in the work array\n        forever, their infeasible_count approaching infinity\n    - Added show_shmem to sched/ Makefile, and fleshed it out a bit\n    - Show hostID correctly when get RPC from wrong major version\n\n    NOTE: still haven't exercised the case where a result is marked COULDNT_SEND\n\n    sched/\n        Makefile.am\n        feeder.C\n        handle_request.C\n        show_shmem.C\n\nEric K  9/22/03\n\n    Modified DB_CONN::open() to support \"db_name@host\" syntax for remote\n    database connections.\n\n    db/db_base.C\n\nDavid  Sept 23 2003\n    - Don't reference-count WUs for results that are ready to report\n        (since don't need their input files anymore)\n        NOTE: this means that RESULT.wup may be zero.\n        Much check before dereferencing.\n    - Changed \"ready_to_ack\" to \"ready_to_report\"\n        (Ack is server->client, not client->server)\n    - Changed \"server_ack\" to \"got_server_ack\"\n    - Moved CLIENT_STATE integrity-check code to a new file (check_state.C)\n        In general it would be nice to move stuff out of client_state.C;\n        It's a hodge-podge currently\n\n    client/\n        Makefile.am\n        client_state.h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        check_state.C (new)\n\nEric K        9/24/03\n    - Create an XML entity encoder/decoder for single byte entities.  In new\n      files lib/xml_util.[Ch].  Encoder will make the following translations.\n        '>' => \"&gt;\"\n        '<' => \"&lt;\"\n        '&' => \"&amp;\"\n        \"'\" => \"&apos;\"\n        '\"' => \"&quot;\"\n        other unprintable -> \"&#nnnd;\"\n      The decoder recognizes a larger number of translations for single byte\n      entities found in XML/HTML.\n    - Added check for <map> header to configure scripts.\n      (Used by xml_util.[Ch] if found).\n\n      lib/xml_util.[Ch]\n      lib/Makefile.am\n      configure.ac\n\nDavid  Sept 27 2003\n    - add app_name to APP_INIT_DATA structure\n        (so that an app can know its own name,\n        and in particular so that we can use it to title its window)\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.h\n        windows_opengl.C\n    client/\n        app.C\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.C,h\n\nDavid Sept 27 2003\n    - added a program \"wu_check\" that sees whether input files\n        of unsent or in-progress results are actually on disk\n\n    sched/\n        Makefile.am\n        wu_check.C (new)\n\nEric K Sept 29 2003\n    - Fixed bug that cause a encoded null to be appended to strings in\n      xml_encode()\n\n    lib/xml_util.C\n\nKarl 2003/09/28\n    - python work\n\n    py/Boinc/\n        database.py\n        setup_project.py\n    tools/\n        dbcheck_files_exist\n\nDavid  Sept 30 2003\n    - Core client: if get 404 error (not found) when downloading file,\n        treat it as permanent error.\n        (not tested)\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C,h\n    client/\n        file_xfer.C,h\n        http.C,h\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n    lib/\n        error_numbers.h\n\n\nDavid  Sept 30 2003\n    - Move graphics-related code from boinc_api.C to graphics_api.C\n    - Don't use the preprocessor symbol BOINC_APP_GRAPHICS in api/\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n        graphics_api.C,h\n        windows_opengl.C\n        x_opengl.h\n    apps/\n        upper_case.C\n\nDavid  Sept 30 2003\n    - Undid checkin of 9/23.  Reference count all WUs,\n        and can assume that result->wup is always valid.\n        I can't remember why we did this, but it creates too many problems.\n    - in Windows GUI, if a result had an error in download or upload,\n        display status as \"Download failed\" instead of \"Download\" etc.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        win/wingui_mainwindow.cpp\n\n\nEric   Oct 1 2003  11:15 am\n     - Fixed compile problems on solaris.\n     - redid graphics_api.h entirely.

Added a mechanism allowing applications to change their graphics\n        \"on the fly\" in response to new project preferences:\n        - Added a new message type <reread_prefs/> to the\n            core->app graphics segment\n        - When the graphics framework (windows_opengl.C) gets this message,\n            it calls an application function app_graphics_reread_prefs().\n            This function can call boinc_parse_init_data_file() (see below)\n            to get the new prefs\n    -

Changed the way that user-supplied files (e.g. logos and images) work.\n        OLD WAY: (see checkin by \"Erik\", May 19 2003)\n            the scheduling server scans the user's project prefs\n            and inserts <file_info> and <file_ref> elements\n            into the <app_version> element,\n            making it look like the user-supplied files are associated\n            with the app.\n            This necessitated the slightly kludgy \"optional\"\n            attribute of FILE_INFO, so that slow-downloading\n            user-supplied files wouldn't defer work indefinitely.\n        NEW WAY:\n            The scheduling server is not involved.\n            PROJECT now has list \"user_files\" of FILE_REFS\n            FILE_INFO now has an attribute \"is_user\"file\"\n            - When parse project prefs from account file,\n                or when get new project preferences from server,\n                convert <app_file> elements to entries in project.user_files\n            - new function ACTIVE_TASK::link_user_files() makes links\n                from slot dir to all user files that are present\n            - when the download of a user file completes,\n                tell running apps to reread prefs\n                (they'll find the user file now)\n            - garbage collection reference-counts user files\n            - got rid of \"optional\" mechanism\n        With this change, user-supplied images in graphics are updated\n        dynamically when the user edits prefs on web,\n        then does \"Get Preferences\" in core client\n    - Handling of completed file transfers moved from\n        PERS_FILE_XFER::poll() to CLIENT_STATE::handle_pers_file_xfers().\n        (this job of PERS_FILE_XFER is to transfer the file,\n        not deal with its contents)\n    - changed benchmarks defaults from 1GFLOPs to 10MFLOPs;\n        prevents slow computers from being inundated with work\n\n    api/\n        gutil.C (fixed code formatting)\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_account.C\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_benchmark.C\n        cs_files.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        cs_statefile.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n\nDavid  2 Nov 2003\n    - removed code in scheduling server for parsing project prefs\n        and inserting <file_info> elements into <app_version> elements\n\n    lib/\n        parse.C\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        server_types.C,h\n\nKarl 2003-11-02\n     -

trivial validator: check for a minimum CPU time\n\n    sched/\n        validate_trivial.C\n\nDavid  4 Nov 2003\n    - scheduler now respects disk usage limits.\n        Scheduler request message now includes BOINC disk usage,\n        both total and for this project.\n        The scheduler parses user's global preferences\n        to get disk-related prefs,\n        and computes the max storage that can be used.\n        It will send only as many results as fit within this limit.\n        NOTE: this is still deficient in several ways:\n            - it assumes that all results will use all their storage\n                simultaneously.

However, on solaris you cannot just say gcc -static as there\n      are dynamic only versions of some needed libs, namely libdl and\n      libaio.  I tried to use the -Xlinker gcc option which theoretically\n      should allow us to specify the link (collect2) line in precise\n      detail.  But -lstdc++ kept showing up twice with one occurrence\n      being outside my -Xlinker -B -Xlinker static directive.  So I\n      hand crafted a collect2 line and placed it in a file - collect2_line.\n      Sourcing this file produces an executable that will load and run\n      across gcc versions (and solaris versions for that matter).  I\n      don't like it but it works.\n\n      IMPORTANT NOTE.  After sourcing collect2_line you have to\n      re-\"hard link\" the executable boinc_client to a proper\n      name with the correct version.\n\n      client/\n        collect2_line   (new file)\n\nGary    09 Dec 2003\n    -

add mechanism to prevent server spamming\n        (i.e. frequence requests for work from a single host).\n        The mechanism: if the last RPC was within 15 minutes,\n        don't send any work.\n    - add result.exit_status field to DB\n        Currently this is populated by the server,\n        if there's a <exit_status> element in the reply's stderr_out.\n        There may be a better way to do this.\n        TODO: display this field in the web GUI\n    -

added boinc_fopen() function.\n       This should be used in lieu of fopen(), in both core client and apps,\n       whenever opening a file for writing.\n       This is because on Windows a utility program like FileFind\n       might have the file open at that exact moment,\n       and your fopen() will fail.\n       boinc_fopen() deals with this by sleeping for 3 seconds and trying again.\n       NOTE: in SETI@home there's a much fancier function\n       that does exponential backoff up to one hour.\n       Can't do that here, in part because the GUI requires\n       the core client to be nonblocking.\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n        graphics_api.C\n        gutil.C\n        mfile.C\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_types.C\n        cs_benchmark.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        cs_statefile.C\n        http.C\n    doc/\n        (various)\n    lib/\n        filesys.C,h\n\nDavid  24 Dec 2003\n    - Fixed errors in deciding whether more work was needed,\n        and if so how much.\n        This caused a situation where hosts would repeatedly\n        ask the server for more work\n        (which, because of recent anti-spam mechanism, would return no work)\n        The error involved the confusion of two quantities:\n        1) work buffer\n            This is an estimate of the time (measured in days)\n            until this host will finish all current work.\n            It reflects the host's \"active_frac\" and the # of CPUs.\n        2) CPU time\n            This is an estimate of the CPU time a WU will take on this host.\n            It does not reflect active_frac or # of CPUs\n        Example error: current_work_buf_days() didn't reflect active_frac and ncpus.\n        So we underestimated the work buffer, and requested work inappropriately.\n\n        NOTE: the <work_req_seconds> field in a request message\n        is in units of CPU time, NOT work buffer\n\n    - Fixed errors in estimating the wallclock duration of a WU\n        (used in feasibility test in scheduler):\n        Should divide, not multiply, by active_frac;\n        should not multiply by # cpus\n    - add a \"deprecated\" flag to app_version.\n        If you decide that a particulate app_version has problems,\n        you can deprecate it.\n        The scheduler advertises the latest non-deprecated version.\n        NOTE: this only is effective if core clients have the following:\n    - Changed the policy assigning an app_version to a WU\n        Use the version included in the scheduler reply,\n        and if there is none, use the latest version.\n        This means that if a project deprecates an app_version,\n        clients won't use it.\n    client/\n        client_state.h\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n    db/\n        schema.sql\n        boinc_db.C,h\n    lib/\n        filesys.h\n        result_state.h\n    py/Boinc/\n        database.py\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        sched_shmem.C\n\nDavid  23 Dec 2003 (supplied by Rom Walton)\n    -

in scan_work_array(): if anonymous platform,\n            instead of checking for an app version in the DB,\n            check that the client has an app version with an\n            acceptable version#\n\n    NOTE: for this to work you need to add an entry named \"anonymous\"\n    to the platform table\n\n    html_user/\n        index.php\n        team_join_form.php\n        team_quit_form.php\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        server_types.C,h\n\nDavid  Jan 26 2004\n    - client-side support for anonymous platform mechanism\n        - To use this mechanism, user puts a file \"app_info.xml\" in a project dir.\n            This file contains <app>, <file_info>, and <app_version> elements\n            for app versions present in the project dir\n            (compiled or manually installed by the user).\n        - If this file is found, the project is marked as \"anonymous_platform\"\n            and app/app_version info in the state file is ignored.\n        - Scheduler RPCs for anonymous projects include a list of app_versions\n    -

Fixed the windows_error_string routine so it'll report back windows system errors.\n    - Updated the CreateProcess part of app.c to report OS Errors based on the above funtion.\n    - Removed the seperate header blocks for both release and debug and made them the same.\n        clears up one customer bug on Windows NT 4.0 platforms\n    - Changed the 1400 version check in stackwalker.h to 1310 which is what the 7.1 compiler\n        version is really.\n    - Changed the service routines to use windows_error_string instead of GetSystemErrorText\n    \n    client/\n        app.c\n    client\n        win/\n            stackwalker.h\n            win_screensaver.h\n            win_service.cpp\n    lib/\n        util.c,h\n\nRom    Feb 4 2004\n    - Changed from using SHGetSpecialFolder to SHGetFolderPath which now uses COM and so will\n        will not throw a dynamic link error on startup for platforms that don't support it.\n    \n    client\n        win/\n            win_screensaver.cpp\n\nDavid  Feb 4 2004\n    - BOINC API: if get a REREAD_PREFS message from core client,\n        only call the app's reread_prefs function if there's a window open\n        (the SETI@home reread_prefs function goes into an infinite loop\n        if there's not a window open)\n    - change copyright year to 2004\n\n    api/\n        windows_opengl.C\n    client/win/\n        resource.rc\n\nKarl 2004-02-03\n    - more misc. make_project fixes\n\nDavid  Feb 4 2004\n    - define a destructor for ACTIVE_TASK.\n        Do all resource deallocation (close thread/proc/msg handles;\n        detach and/or destroy shmem) here.\n        This deallocation was being done piecemeal;\n        for example, it wasn't being done if the process was aborted.\n        Hence the \"quit message\" object was still there,\n        and when another process started in the same slot it would\n        immediately get the message (caused \"reset project\" problem)\n    - Eventually delete all ACTIVE_TASK objects.\n        The following removed them from the list but didn't deleting:\n        ACTIVE_TASK_SET::abort_project()\n        ACTIVE_TASK_SET::restart_tasks()  (failure case)\n    - Don't ask for work if we have any unfinished work.\n        This is a temporary kludge to prevent repeated work requests;\n        it means that min work buffer is meaningless.\n        But maybe this is OK.\n        \n    client/\n        app.h,C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n\nDavid  Feb 4 2004\n    - Cleaned up the project-reset logic a little:\n        - first garbage-collect, THEN unlink and delete the apps and app_versions\n    - When detach project, delete FILE_INFO*s.\n\n    NOTE: there are lots of loose ends, e.g. files/sockets left open etc.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n\nDavid  Feb 4 2004\n    - Released version 2.24 of core client\n\nRom    Feb 4 2004\n    - When handled errors occur provide the translated error message as well as the\n        error code.\n    \n    client/\n        app.c\n\nRom    Feb 4 2004\n    - Update the debugging page with some more useful information about what we need\n        when a crash occurs\n    \n    html/user/\n        debug.php\n\nRom    Feb 5 2004\n    - Microsofts documentation on the matter of SHGetFolderPath seems to be wrong.\n        instead of relying on it, just do a dynamic link and call the function\n        if successful.\n    \n    client/win/\n        win_screensaver.cpp\n    \nDavid  Feb 5 2004\n    - db_dump: files ordered by ID now have a fixed-size ID range,\n        not a fixed # of elements\n    - Changed FEASIBLE_COUNT parameters to very large values,\n        so that results are never classified as COULDNT_SEND.\n        This mechanism is not needed for SETI@home (all results are the same)\n        and is occasionally screwing things up.\n        Can revisit this later.\n    - Make \"host\" web links consistent (\"---\" if ID is zero)\n    - In UOTD browse, show only profiles w/ pics\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            host.inc\n            result.inc\n            util.inc\n        ops/\n            profile_ops.php\n    sched/\n        db_dump.C\n        feeder.C\n        handle_request.C\n        sched_shmem.h\n\nDavid  Feb 5 2004\n    -

removed old TRACEs from Win code\n\n    client/\n        client_types.C\n        win/\n            wingui_mainwindow.cpp\n\nRom    Feb 5 2004\n    - Moved the unhandled exception filter back into boinc_api.c where it was orginally.\n    - Moved stackwalker that is used by BOINC Client applications into api folder since\n        the unhandled exception filter depends on it.\n    - Removed the unhandled exception filter init code from boincdiag.cpp\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.c\n        boincdiag.cpp\n    api/win/\n        stackwalker.cpp,h (Added)\n\nRom    Feb 6 2004\n    - Removed boincdiag.cpp,h from build and encorporated all its functionality into\n        boinc_api.c, h\n    - Improved unhandled exception filter to handle STACK_OVERFLOW exceptions, using\n        new stackwalker code base, STACK_OVERFLOWs would have caused a nested\n        exception issue that would have masked the real error.\n    - Improved unhandled exception filter to handle ACCESS_VIOLATIONs better, using\n        stackwalker code base, giving some of the same information for release builds\n        that is given in debug builds\n    - Created a new macro called BOINCERROR which will trip the management thread into\n        gracefully exiting the process with the correct exit code.  This macro will work\n        across debug/release builds.  Some more work has to go into the base function,\n        hopefully in tomorrow.\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.c,h\n        boincdiag.cpp,h (deleted)\n\nDavid  Feb 6 2004\n    - changed default min/max work buffers from (1,3) to (.1, 1)\n\n    html/incs/\n        prefs.inc\n\nDavid  Feb 6 2004\n    - ask for more work when # of results in progress is less than # CPUs\n    - when get an APP_VERSION in a scheduler reply that's already in client state,\n        DON'T update the client state (it can't be any different anyway)\n        This fixes a garbage-collection crash\n    - Win client: added check_state.C to the project.\n        You can call check_all() to verify the integrity of client data.\n        This is commented out but useful for debugging.\n    - FILE_XFER_SET::insert() adds item to list, even if the underlying\n        HTTP_OP::insert() fails (because can't connect, e.g.)\n        This is necessary to make sure that the FILE_XFER remains in the\n        FILE_XFER_SET even in case of error, so that check_all() works.\n\n        NOTE: the semantics of insert() should be reexamined through the whole\n        FSM stack.

Is it guaranteed to insert?\n        Need consistency.\n\n    client/\n        check_state.C\n        client_state.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        file_xfer.C\n    win_build/\n        boinc_cli.vcproj\n        boinc_gui.vcproj\n\nDavid  Feb 6 2004\n    -

It turns out that a statically linked linux client gets the \n      following warning at build time:\n\n    hostinfo.C:230: warning: Using 'gethostbyname' in statically \n    linked applications requires at runtime the shared libraries \n    from the glibc version used for linking\n\n      and sure enough, when such a client is run on a linux platform\n      with a incompatible glibc, we saw the following:\n\n    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [BOINC] Can't resolve hostname setiboinc \n    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [BOINC] Can't resolve hostname setiboinc \n    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [http://setiboinc/ap/] Couldn't read master \n      page for http://setiboinc/ap/: error -113\n    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [http://setiboinc/ap/] Couldn't read master \n      page for http://setiboinc/ap/: error -113\n    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [http://setiboinc/ap/] Detaching from project - \n      check for URL error\n    2004-03-12 11:07:57 [http://setiboinc/ap/] Detaching from project - \n      check for URL error \n\n      So we needed to link dynamically to libc but statically to libstdc++\n      (for reasons described elsewhere in these notes).  The only way found\n      so far to do this is via a hand crafted collect2 line.  That, and\n      not linking the client statically in a global fashion.\n\n      We should make the collect2 scripts adapt to the environment in\n      which they ar run.

added a mechanism to handle situations where an app\n        appears to have exited successfully,\n        but in fact didn't call boinc_finish() or exit(0).\n        This apparently can happen on various platforms, don't ask me how.\n        The new mechanism:\n        boinc_finish() writes a file \"boinc_finish_called\"\n        in the slot directory.\n        When an app appears to have exited successfully,\n        the core client checks for the existence of this file.\n        If it's not there, the result is placed \"in limbo\":\n        it takes up a slot, but the app isn't restarted.\n        If the core client is restarted, the app is restarted.\n\n        NOTE: when we release a core client with this feature,\n        it's critical that all users reset the project,\n        and that updated versions of all apps are released.\n        Might be a good time for a major release increment.\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.h\n\nDavid  April 3 2004\n    - synchronize access to shared-mem work array by scheduler processes,\n        with the goal of NEVER sending the same result to different hosts.\n        - Instead of a single bool present flag, there are now 3 states\n            for an element in the array: absent, present, and\n            \"checked out\" (being considered for sending)\n        - There's now a semaphore that a scheduler process must acquire before\n            examining the state field of an array entry\n            (note: the feeder creates this semaphore,\n            but doesn't have to acquire it\n            because of the producer/consumer situation).\n    -

Fixed a nasty bug that caused back-end processes\n        to corrupt records in the \"result\" table, and potentially others.\n        The Bug:\n            - escape_string() replaces ' and \\ by \\' and \\\\ respectively;\n                this is done so that they can be used in SQL statements, e.g.\n                update foo set blah='abc\\'def';\n            - escape_string() (which can increase the length of a string)\n                didn't check the size of its output buffer\n            - The stderr_out field of results with stack traces\n                often are near their 4KB limit,\n                and have LOTS of \\s (in file paths)\n            - escape_string() was writing beyond the end of the\n                stderr_out field, writing garbage into fields\n                like batch, claimed_credit, etc.\n        The Fix:\n            add a \"len\" argument to escape_string(),\n            and use safe_strncpy() to avoid writing off the end of the buffer.\n        \n    db/\n        boinc_db.C\n        db_base.C,h\n    html/user/\n        stats.php\n\nRom    April 10 2004\n    -

Massive simplification of STARFIELD implementation.\n        Instead of using the same 3D coordinate space as other stuff,\n        stars now have their own -1..1 type coordinate space,\n        and we do the perspective transformation ourselves.\n        This eliminates the need for all the is_visible() crap.\n\n        The goal was to get rid of the hang/crash when the user\n        moves the viewpoint too far away,\n        but I ended up rewriting the (crufty) code.\n\n        Got rid of get_matrix_invert()\n\n    -

Added code for Dhrystone benchmark.\n        Use the \"VAX MIPS\" result as integer benchmark.\n        It's somewhat higher than the benchmark we've been using.\n    - Switch to using Whetstone and Dhrystone instead of home-brew benchmarks.\n\n    client/\n        cpu_benchmark.C,h\n        cs_benchmark.C\n        dhrystone.C (new)\n        whetstone.C\n\nDavid  May 19 2004\n    -

API: if setup_shared_mem() returns error, set standalone = true.\n        This means that if you run an app standalone,\n        it will be detected automatically,\n        so no need for command-line args or even\n        standalone argument to boinc_init()\n        (but leave that arg in for now)\n    - API: initialize fraction_done to -1,\n        and only report it to core client if >= 0\n        (i.e. don't report it unless app specifies it)\n    - API: removed\n        #ifdef HAVE_SYS_SHM_H\n        #ifdef HAVE_SYS_IPC_H\n        around calls to attach_shmem in non-Win case.\n        This not an appropriate place for these ifdefs.\n    - core client: ACTIVE_TASK_SET::check_app_exited():\n        skip tasks in state PROCESS_IN_LIMBO.\n        This avoid core client spinning when apps misbehave.\n    - core client: changed variable names in app.C:\n        starting_cpu_time -> episode_start_cpu_time\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n\nDavid  May 21 2004\n    -

Support for \"compound applications\" (such as climateprediction.net)\n        in which a main program runs several apps in sequence.\n        The items are:\n        1) The app init file now contains fields\n            <fraction_done_start> and <fraction_done_end>\n            giving the fraction-done range occupied by the app.\n            Note: the app calls boinc_fraction_done() with values\n            from 0 to 1 as usual.\n            The API implementation takes care of scaling them\n            to the start..end range.\n\n            The main program must fill in these fields and call\n            boinc_write_app_init_file() prior to running each app.\n        2) boinc_finish() fills the final CPU time into the\n            APP_INIT_DATA struct, then calls boinc_write_app_init_file().\n            This passes the CPU time along to the next program.\n        3) got rid of boinc_child_start() and boinc_child_done().\n\n    api/\n        boinc_ipc.C,h\n    client/\n        app.C\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.C,h\n\nDavid  May 24 2004\n    -

Removed \"using\" directives from header files.  \"using\"\n      directives should not be used in header files for the following reasons.\n      - A \"using namespace\" directive cannot be revoked for any source file\n        including the header.  It forces the use of the namespace regardless of\n        the consequences.\n      - Dropping the namespace qualifier on STL templates ambiguates the\n        resolution of template functions.  (How many C libraries or headers\n        have you seen that define the function min()?)\n      - Reducing typing is not a good reason to drop namespace qualifiers any\n        more than it would be a good idea to \"#define p printf\"\n      - Namespaces exist for a reason.\n      - It's acceptable to have \"using\" directive in a source file, since it\n        won't affect other files.  It's better to have \"using std::string;\" \n        directives than \"using namespace std;\" for hopefully obvious reasons.\n\nDavid  30 June 2004\n    - change feeder query to eliminate 'order by random'\n        and add a limit of 100.\n    - change db_dump to not get counts, since these are slow on InnoDB\n\n    sched/\n        db_dump.C\n        feeder.C\n\nDaniel 30 June 2004\n    - Continuing Eric's vanquishing of \"using\" directives from header\n      files.

This way, we can have many non-worker apps in\n        addition to one worker app.\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n\nRom    3 July 2004\n    - Introduce basic transaction support for performance DB class.\n    - Implement basic transsction support for the transitioner.\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C\n        db_base.C, .h\n    sched/\n        transitioner.C\n    \nRom   3 July 2004\n    - Plug a memory leak in the transitioner\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C\n\nDavid  4 July 2004\n    - scheduler: if client is requesting work,\n        and client is not returning results,\n        and there's no work,\n        then send \"No work available\" message\n        and return without opening DB\n    - scheduler: if client has wrong major version,\n        and is not returning results,\n        return without opening DB\n\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        main.C\n        sched_shmem.C,h\n\nDavid  6 July 2004\n    - Completed (more or less) the implementation of trickle messages.\n        Some changes:\n        - Trickle-up messages now have a \"variety\",\n            specified by the application.\n            Typically it's the name of the application.\n            The trickle-up handler (on the server side) specifies what\n            variety of message it wants to handle.\n        - boinc_receive_trickle_down() no longer returns the message itself;\n            instead, it returns the name of the file.\n            The app must open, read and delete the file.\n\n    NOTE: the structure of the msg_to_host and msg_from_host tables\n        is changed.  Projects will want to drop and recreate these.\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C,h\n    client/\n        app.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        cs_trickle.C\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C,h\n        schema.sql\n    lib/\n        diagnostics.h\n        filesys.C\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        server_types.C,h\n        trickle_handler.C\n\nBrian  6 July 2004\n      - Changed client so that when a file info is compared to \n        an existing file info with the same name, the differences \n        in whether it is an upload or download are updated and \n        any urls that are not present in the file info are added to the url list.\n    - When a url is requested for a file info, the file info \n        checks whether it is an upload, and then looks for the \n        substring \"file_upload_handler\" any url it is trying to \n        use to upload the file. The opposite is true for downloads.\n\n    - Changed get_url into three separate functions:\n            get_current_url(bool), returns the current good url\n            get_init_url(bool), returns the initial good url and sets the start url\n            get_next_url(book), increments current_url and finds the next good url\n\n    - Changed client so that a file_info will save its signed xml \n        even if it doesn't include have xml signature. \n\n    - Updated the client so that the check to see if the url is \n        valid for the type of network request is a private function of FILE_INFO\n\n    - Modified the backoff_retry function in persistant_file_xfers \n        so that it uses the updated get_url that checks if the url\n        is correct for the type of transfer. Otherwise it could \n        increment the current_url index to point to an invalid url\n\n     - If a file_info doesn't have a max number of bytes and a new \n        file_info with the same name does, update the max number \n        of bytes of the existing file_info and add the <max_nbytes> to the signed_xml. \n\n    - when file_xfer is complete, the client checks if the file \n        was meant to be uploaded when present OR generated locally \n        before setting it to ready to report, instead of only the later\n\n    - With the addition of multiple urls, the issue of sending urls\n        that didn't communicate well or got garbage. Whenever a file \n        get's a server error, it calls, check_giveup, which only gives \n        up on the file if there are no more urls to try. Also is called \n        if the downloaded file is garbage or has the same name but not the\n        correct size.\n\n    - added functionality for send_file_list but does not do anything yet\n\n    \n    client/\n        client_types.C,h\n        client_state.h\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_file.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        file_xfer.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C,h\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n        \nDaniel 2004-07-06\n    - client: when a project fails to attach, call quit_activities()\n        before exit(1) so other running apps will terminate.\n\n    client/\n        main.C\n\nRom    6 July 2004\n    - Removed ';' from queries that had them since the API Docs state\n        not to put them in the query.\n    - Implement a scheduler optimization so we do one batched read and one \n      transactional write.  In the worst case scenario where the client\n      had submitted 20 results we would do 41 reads and 40 writes\n      just to update the results.\n      Now we batch read all the results at one time and surround\n      the write requests within a transaction.\n      So now our worst case scenario is 2 reads and 40 writes within a \n      transaction.\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C, .h\n        db_base.C\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n\nDaniel 2004-07-06\n    - CPU scheduler only considers resource shares for projects that have\n        a runnable result.\n    - Bound debt to [-1 day * ncpus, 1 day * ncpus]\n    - deleted some dead code\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_trickle.C\n\nDaniel 2004-07-06\n    - client: work requests now include <resource_share_fraction> tag.\n    - scheduler: support for resource_share_fraction\n        when checking for wu feasibility, consider resource share of\n        project to determine estimated wallclock duration\n    - scheduler: syntax bug fix in validator\n\n    client/\n        cs_scheduler.C\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.C\n        server_types.h\n        validate.C\n\nDaniel 2004-07-06\n    - client: bugfix in make_scheduler_request\n\n    client/\n        cs_scheduler.C\n\nDaniel 2004-07-06\n    - uh, messed up doing a commit. but i put the \"correct\" files\n      back. sorry.\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        client_state.h\n        cs_prefs.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n\nRom    6 July 2004\n    - Added event handler so we are notified of a system shutdown/logoff which\n      will allow us to shutdown gacefully instead of the OS terminating us.\n    - Do a little clean up work with the resource files in the hope that\n      visual studio won't remove the win_config.h reference the next time the\n      resources are modified.\n\n    client/win/\n        boinc_cli.rc\n        boinc_dll.rc\n        boinc_gui.rc\n        boinc_ss.rc\n        wingui_mainwindow.cpp, .h\n\nRom    6 July 2004\n    - Reduce the total number of messages the system attempts to keep in the\n      messages tab to 200.  2000 was a bit much and caused the system to spend\n      some time processing when there were quite a few messages to go through,\n      such as in Predictor@home\n    - Moved the code that checkes the total number of messages available in\n      the message tab out of the switch/case chunk of code so that it happens\n      more frequently than when the user clicks on the messages tab, which\n      could take awhile if there was more than 1000 messages.\n\n    client/win/\n        wingui_mainwindow.cpp, .h\n\nRom    7 July 2004\n    - Adjust the console control handler such that when a logoff event has\n      occurred check to see if we are running as a service and if so, ignore\n      the event, otherwise quit.\n\n      Thanks to Fernando Vinan-Cano via John McLeod\n\n    client/\n        main.C\n\nDaniel 2004-07-07\n    - client: set the result exit_code to a non-zero value when:\n          1. the result couldn't start\n          2. the result had a download error\n          3. the result had an upload error\n      (unless the exit_code was already non-zero)\n\n      This should get the validator to mark these results as invalid\n      and solve the problem the predictor@home people reported.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n    lib/\n        error_numbers.h\n\n\nDavid  7 July 2004\n    - Implement revised core/app interface\n        (see boinc/doc/api_v4.php).\n        - Augment the set of shared-memory message channels;\n            add a channel for suspend/resume/quit messages\n            (these replace the use of signals and SuspendThread calls);\n            add separate channels for trickle up/down\n        - Modify the API library accordingly.\n            Currently works for Windows; will do UNIX later\n        - Modify the core client (app.C) accordingly\n        - Call ACTIVE_TASK_SET::poll() even when activities suspended;\n            still need to send heartbeats.\n        - added MSG_CHANNEL class to make code better organized\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n        windows_opengl.C\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n        client_state.C\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.C,h\n\nDaniel 2004-07-08\n    - NetBSD compile fixes from John Klos <john@ziaspace.com>\n        (just added __NetBSD__ wherever __OpenBSD__ appeared)\n\n    lib/\n        filesys.C\n        util.C\n\nDavid  8 July 2004\n    - got the new core/app interface working on Unix.\n        I looked into implementing the management functions\n        using a thread (with pthreads).\n        But the pthreads interface is kinda bizarre.\n        E.g. you can't suspend another thread.\n        You can send it a signal - but the signal handler\n        is not allowed to make any pthreads calls!

Expiration and max-age are\n      based upon the max-age parameter passed to start_cache().  \n      start_cache() also check the request header for 'If-Modified-Since'\n      and returns a 'HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified' if 'If-Modified-Since' ==\n      'Last-Modified:'\n\n    html/inc/cache.inc\n\nRom    July 19 2004\n    - Fix a bug where during the benchmarking process all the active tasks\n      would die off.\n\n    client/\n        cs_benchmark.C\n\nKarl 2004-07-21\n    - fix bug in \"couldn't find app\" messages\n\n    sched/\n        message_handler.C\n        validator.C\n\nKarl 2004-07-21\n    - allow '.msi' as extension for installation package\n\n    tools/\n        update_versions\n\nKarl 2004-07-22\n    - fixed html/php bugs (e.g. should be <?php instead of <?)\n    - fixed forum link\n    - multipart/form-data doesn't seem to work (?)\n    - don't show profile thumbnail if none exists\n    - fix installation of head_20.png\n\n    html/user/\n        sample_index.php\n        team_manage.php\n        html.php\n        old_news.php\n    html/inc\n        profile.inc\n        uotd.inc\n    project.sample/\n        project_news.inc\n    py/Boinc/\n        setup_project.py\n\nDavid  21 July 2004\n    - Database optimization in the transitioner:\n        add several results in a single SQL insert statement\n        (using values (...),(...),(...))\n        instead of separate inserts.\n        This is enabled by a BATCH_INSERT compile flag in transitioner.C\n    - Add a USE_TRANSACTIONS flag to transitioner.\n        Leave it off for now.\n    - For some reason we weren't processing the UPLOAD_URL symbol\n        in result templates.\n        Restore this, using the info in the config file.\n    - transitioner: if anything fails (result creation, WU update), quit.\n    - result.random must be initialized by caller on insert\n        (not too relevant since we don't use it anymore)\n    - start/commit_transaction are now members of DB_CONN\n        rather than DB_BASE_SPECIAL\n    - scheduler: in scan_work_array, do all \"cheap\" checks\n        (i.e. those that don't require DB access)\n        before releasing the semaphore.\n        Thus if all the results are infeasible,\n        we'll acquire/release the semaphore once, not 100 times.\n    - re-enable team name search\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C,h\n        db_base.C,h\n    html/user/\n        team.php\n        team_lookup.php\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n        transitioner.C\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C,h\n\n\nNoaa     21 July 2004\n    - incorporated modded, smaller glut into the source tree, includes\n        a makefile if any files are changed\n    - updated, cleaner version of x_opengl.C\n    - removed glut stuff from boinc_gl.h to account for integrated glut in \n        source tree\n    - updated gutil.C header\n    - changed Makefile for api to account for glut in source tree, called \n        Makefile.graphics (unaffected by configure, may not run on every \n        system correctly, please check for specific setups)\n    boincglut/ (new)\n    api/\n        x_opengl.C\n        boinc_gl.h\n        gutil.C\n        Makefile.graphics (new)\n\n    boincglut/ (new)\n\nDavid  21 July 2004\n    - tweaked and enabled Rom's DB accelerator for the scheduler.\n        When a user is reporting results,\n        it reads the necessary fields in one gulp.\n        It updates only the necessary result fields.\n        It updates the workunit transition times in a single SQL statement.\n        It encloses this all in a transaction.\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C,h\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n\nJeff  21 July 2004\n    - only grab 1000 Wus at a time in do_validate_scan() \n\n    sched/\n    validator.C\n\nNoaa     21 July 2004\n\n    - changed frand's type from extern to static to match the .C definition\n    in gutil.h\n    - added gutil.C to the api's Makefile.graphics\n    \n    api/\n        gutil.h\n        Makefile.graphics\n\nDavid  22 July 2004\n    - Another DB performance tweak: add DB_RESULT::update_subset()\n        to update just those fields needed when send a result\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C,h\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n\nRom    22 July 2004\n    - Another tweak to the transitioner so we can go back to use multiple\n      transitioners\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C, .h\n    sched/\n        transitioner.C\n\nDaniel 2004-07-22\n    - use \"estimated_delay\" (sent in scheduler request by client) when\n      trying to meet wu.delay_bound.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.C,h\n\nJeff  22 July 2004\n    - Fixed a malformed SQL statement in DB_RESULT::update_subset() \n      that was leading to zero results being sent out.\n\n    db/\n    boinc_db.C\n\nEric K. July 22 2004\n    - Worked a bit more on the caching...

Full documentation is avaiable\n      on the BOINC website under Disk Space Management. Major changes to the\n      client are as follows:\n        - When a file is sent to be downloaded, it is associated with a project\n          which checks if there is enough space on disk\n        - Files are deleted when this space, as set by the user prefs, fills up\n        - Instead of sending the user prefs to the scheduling server, three \n          new values are sent and the server decides how much work to award\n          each host based on these values and config.xml prefs (documented)\n        - Files have a priority and expiration date which sorts them for\n          deletion purposes\n    - Uploaded my tools for sending and getting files to and from a host.\n    - Uploaded a tool that requests a file list from all hosts, although it has\n      not been fully implimented on the core client\n    - Uploaded a tool that sends a request for a host to delete a local file\n\n    client/\n        Makefile.am\n        gui_titles.h\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n        main.C\n        gui_titles.C\n        file_names.h\n        cs_statefile.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        cs_files.C\n        client_types.C,h\n    sched/\n        server_types.C,h\n        handle_request.C\n        sched_send.C\n        delete_file.C\n        get_file.C\n        request_file_list.C\n        send_file.C\n        Makefile.am\n    db/\n        boinc_db.h\n\nRom    5 Aug 2004\n    - Possible fix for segfaults on Linux platforms with the scheduler.\n\n    lib/\n        msg_log.h\n    sched/\n        sched_msgs.h\n\nNoaa    5 August 2004\n\n        -changed source tree's glut library to boincglut to avoid\n         linking problems with possibly prexisting glut libraries\n        -updated the Makefile.Readme to reflect the change\n        -updated sample Makefile.graphics\n\n        boincglut/\n            lib/\n                glut/\n                    Makefile\n\n        api/\n                Makefile.Readme\n                Makefile.graphics\n        \n        /\n                Graphics.Readme\n\nDaniel 2004-08-05\n    - regenerated build files to fix (some) compilation problems from the\n      data management code\n\n    aclocal.m4\n    client/\n        Makefile.in\n    sched/\n        Makefile.in\n    win_build/\n        boinc_cli.dsp,vcproj\n        boinc_gui.dsp,vcproj\n\nDavid  6 Aug 2004\n    - Changed server software to use the hierarchical directory mechanism.\n        This means using dir_hier_path() to generate the pathname\n        of an input or output file,\n        rather than just concatenating directory and filename.\n        Also (in process_wu_template()) use dir_hier_url()\n        to generate the appropriate URL\n    - Add a scheme for transitioning from flat to hierarchical download dir.\n        Can have a <download_dir_alt> element in config.xml,\n        giving the path of an old, flat dir.\n        file_deleter will look here if it can't find file in main download dir.\n    - Pass around SCHED_CONFIG in a few interfaces\n        (e.g. create_work()) in order to access uldl_dir_fanout\n\n    html/inc/\n        profile.inc\n    lib/\n        util.C,h\n    sched/\n        file_deleter.C\n        file_upload_handler.C\n        make_work.C\n        sched_config.C,h\n        validate_util.C\n        wu_check.C\n    tools/\n        Makefile.am\n        backend_lib.C,h\n        create_work.C\n        dir_hier_move.C\n        dir_hier_path.C\n\nDavid  6 Aug 2004\n    - In the web \"get password\" function,\n        look for not just the email addr but also\n        any munged versions of the email addr.\n        So people won't see \"no such account\" and create a new one.\n        (from Carl Christensen)\n    - Add escape_pattern() function for escaping \"like\" patterns;\n        use this in team lookup also\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            db.inc\n        user/\n            mail_passwd.php\n            team_lookup.php\n\nBrian  6 Aug 2004\n    - Fixed bug that was causing problems with BOINC client\n      Files were not being associated with projects because of small\n      bugs in the code that were resently checked in.

Originally every scheduler reply contained\n        user, host and team info.\n        This is no longer the case because, for example,\n        the \"no work available\" logic now skips DB access.\n        Fixed a few bugs related to this:\n        - scheduler: send user/host/team info only if\n            the corresponding record was read from DB\n        - client: get team name, user credits, host credits\n            from scheduler reply only if they're actually there\n            (use -1 as a null value for credit fields)\n\n    client/\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        server_types.C\n\nDavid  12 Aug 2004\n    -

handle_exited_app():\n        Returning early in all cases of exiting with zero status\n        caused core client not to read stderr_out file\n        or clean out slot dir.\n        This made test_uc.py fail.\n\n        DANIEL: please examine this and see if you agree,\n        and get test_uc.py working any time you do a major checkin\n\n    client/\n        app_control.C\n\nDavid  20 Aug 2004\n    - already_sent_to_different_platform():\n        fix concurrency bug by reading WU.workseq_next\n        from database just prior to checking,\n        then updating the field immediately if needed.\n    - scheduler: update_wu_transition_time():\n        use update_field(); more efficient\n    - Added DB_BASE::get_field_int(): get a single integer\n        field from a DB record.\n        A little cheaper than reading the whole record\n    - DB_BASE::lookup(): remove code that sees if record is unique.\n        It's called after mysql_free_result(),\n        so it will never return anything.\n    - DB code: changed \"if (db->mysql && is_high_priority) to just\n        \"if (is_high_priority)\".\n        db->mysql is a pointer, and is always nonzero.\n        It's not a flag saying whether the DB is MySQL.\n        All this code is only for MySQL anyway.\n\n    db/\n        db_base.C,h\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n\nDavid  21 Aug 2004\n    - Fixed nasty bug in feeder that has been present since April 3 (doh!).\n        scan_work_array() scanned the work array with logic of the form\n            if (wu_result.state == PRESENT) {\n                ...\n            } else {\n                // assume wu_result.state == EMPTY\n            }\n        but with the introduction of the CHECKED_OUT state,\n        this became invalid, and the feeder was overwriting entries while they\n        were \"checked out\" by a scheduler.\n        Fixed this by changing if() to switch()\n    - Added check to scan_work_array(): when read result from DB,\n        make sure result.workunitid matches the WU's ID.\n        This ensures correctness even if the feeder is wrong.\n    - removed commented-out code from feeder\n\n    sched/\n        feeder.C\n        sched_send.C\n        sched_shmem.h\n\nDavid  21 Aug 2004\n    -

Cleanup and bug fixes in CPU scheduler\n        There was inconsistent terminology,\n        e.g. a task could have scheduler_state = CPU_SCHED_RUNNING\n        but actually be suspended; it could have state = PROCESS_RUNNING\n        but actually be suspended, and so on.\n        New terminology:\n            \"executing\" (formerly \"running\", which was used ambiguously)\n            CPU_SCHED_SCHEDULED (formerly CPU_SCHED_RUNNING):\n                the CPU scheduler has given its permission\n                for a task to execut; it may not actually be executing\n            PROCESS_EXECUTING: the process is executing (not suspended)\n            PROCESS_SUSPENDED: the process is suspended\n        new function: ACTIVE_TASK::process_exists():\n            true if the state is EXECUTING, SUSPENDED, or ABORT_PENDING\n            Use this instead of (state == PROCESS_RUNNING) in many cases\n        renamed ACTIVE_TASK::task_exited() to has_task_exited()\n        changed logic in ACTIVE_TASK_SET::suspend_all()\n        ACTIVE_TASK_SET::unsuspend_all():\n            Removed code that checks for process exit.\n            Poll code should take care of this.\n    - enabled preemption by quit\n    - add MSG_CHANNEL::send_msg_overwrite(): send message even\n        if there's already a message there.\n        Use this for process control messages.\n    - API: if suspended, check for <quit/> messages as well as <resume/>\n        (this affects Unix only)\n    -

Core client: check that shared memory exists before\n        attempting to send or get msgs to an app.\n        This hopefully will fix a crashing bug\n        that happens when you use quit-on-suspend\n        (since the shared-memory seg is deleted on quit)\n    -

Well this chunk of code seems to\n       be broken, it is probably the first time it has ever been used.\n\n    lib/\n        diagnostics.C\n\nRom    31 Aug 2004\n     - Win98 has a memory leak condition in dealing with memory mapped files.\n       So lets go ahead and fix one possible way to slow down the leak, A better\n       fix is to recycle the shared memory segments.  Recycling of the shared\n       memory segments is forthcomming.\n\n    lib/\n        shmem.C\n\nDavid  31 Aug 2004\n    - Don't delete shared-memory segment while ACTIVE_TASK is preempted\n        via quit (hopefully will fix Win98 problem).\n    - Add shmem_seg_name field to ACTIVE_TASK\n    - Factor ACTIVE_TASK::get_shmem_seg_name() out of write_app_init_file().\n        It had no business being there.\n        In particular, write_app_init_file() is sometimes called\n        in the middle of execution, when you definitely don't want\n        to create a new shmem seg name\n    - write_app_init_file() doesn't take APP_INIT_DATA arg\n    - define type SHMEM_SEG_NAME (for uniformity across platforms)\n\n    client/\n        app.C,h\n        app_control.C\n        app_start.C\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.C,h\n\nDavid  31 Aug 2004\n    - feeder/scheduler:\n        We were seeing problems where the shared-mem array was\n        filling up with results that were \"locked\" by a particular\n        scheduler process, which apparently had then died,\n        leaving that slot in limbo.\n        Add code to the feeder to check if the process that\n        locked a slot still exists, and unlock it if not.\n    - end_cache(): check for \"..\" in params string.\n        We've had problems with files mysteriously disappearing,\n        and it's possible that the caching mechanism has a security loophole.\n    html/\n        inc/\n            cache.inc\n            prefs.inc\n        user/\n            download_network.php\n    sched/\n        feeder.C\n        main.C\n        sched_send.C\n        sched_shmem.h\n\nJeff   31 Aug 2004\n    - limit workunit enumeration in the assimilator to 1000.\n\n    sched/\n        assimilator.C\n\nRom    31 Aug 2004\n    - BUGFIX: Moved the delete shared memory code to the end of the function, to\n      happen right before slot directory cleanup.  The previous instance of code\n      t8hat was commented out was for the unix branch.\n    - BUGFIX: The shared memory enumerator had a bug where the name it was\n      enumerating wasn't the same name that was eventually locked by the start \n      routine, this caused the client to only be able to run one application at\n      a time\n    - BUGFIX: The shared memory enumerator was still referencing the slot\n      directory number instead of the for loop iterator.\n    - BUGFIX: When a process has been preempted, it's pid handle and thread handle\n      need to be freed.\n    - BUGFIX: Calling MapViewOfFile on Win98 automatically causes a memory leak,\n      so don't call it unless we really have to.\n\n    NOTE: I would like to thank Walt Gribben for helping me by debugging this issue\n          for me.\n\n    client/\n        app_control.C\n        app_start.C\n    lib/\n        error_numbers.h\n        shmem.C, .h\n\nRom    31 Aug 2004\n    - Tag for 4.06 release, all platforms\n      boinc_core_release_4_06\n\nRom    1 Sep 2004\n    - Language File Updates across all languages.\n\n    client/translations/\n        <Many Files>\n\nRom    1 Sep 2004\n    - Tag for 4.07 release, all platforms\n      boinc_core_release_4_07\n\nDavid  1 Sep 2004\n    - fixed bug in web-caching code that caused files in html/user\n        to be randomly deleted.\n        The function clean_cache($dir) was enumerating files in $dir,\n        and doing unlink($file), but without chdir'ing into $dir\n        or concatenating $dir onto $file.\n\n    html/inc\n        cache.inc\n\nDavid  2 Sept 2004\n    - If an executable file failed validation, any results using\n        that app version would hang forever in the \"downloading\" state.\n        Two changes were needed to fix this:\n        1) garbage_collect(): when scanning results,\n            check for download failures of APP_VERSION files\n            (as well as WU files), and if so mark the result as failed.\n            Added new functions APP_VERSION::had_failure() and get_file_errors().\n        2) handle_scheduler_reply(): if get an APP_VERSION that we already have,\n            reset any errored-out FILE_INFOs,\n            i.e. give it a chance to download again.\n            There are various ways to do this, but this seems the cleanest.\n            Added new functions FILE_INFO::reset()\n            and APP_VERSION::clear_errors()\n    - made verify_downloaded_file() into a member function of FILE_INFO.\n        It now sets the error_msg field to a descriptive string\n        so that failures will be reported to project\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_files.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n\nDavid  2 Sept 2004\n    - change MAX_WU_RESULTS from 500 to 100\n\n    sched/\n        sched_shmem.h\n\nRom    2 Sep 2004\n    - BUGFIX: The active task destructor also tried to clean up dangling handles, so\n          after cleaning up a handle lets also set the handle value to NULL to keep it from\n          being acted on again.\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        app_control.C\n\nDavid  2 Sept 2004\n    - PERS_FILE_XFER::poll(): don't check file size if it's not specified in FILE_INFO\n        ==> This fixes download failure of user-supplied files\n    - PROJECT::parse_preferences_for_user_files(): fill in fip->project\n        ==> This fixes a crashing bug when user supplies files\n    - User-visible test:\n        change \"preempt\" to \"pause\"\n        change \"quit\" to \"removed from memory\"\n        change \"suspend\" to \"left in memory\"\n\n    client/\n        app_control.C\n        client_types.C\n        gui_titles.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n\nRom    2 Sep 2004\n    - BUGFIX: During a project reset the next_runnable_result becomes invalid, so each\n          time we go through the loop reset all next_runnable_result to NULL so we don't\n          crash.\n\n    client/\n        cs_apps.C\n\nDavid  2 Sept 2004\n    - PERS_FILE_XFER::poll(): fixed bug that caused hang\n\n    NOTE: check_giveup(), handle_xfer_failure(), and retry_or_backoff()\n    are a total mess.

(from Ben Herndon)  Some compilers optimize away sections of the Whetstone\n        benchmark function, since their results aren't used outside the function.\n        To deal with this, we added an global-scope array (extern_array[])\n        and store the result of each section into it.\n        Also changed section 3 by initializint j from the extern_array,\n        so the compiler can't optimize out all the conditionals.\n\n    client/\n        whetstone.C\n\nDavid  7 Sept 2004\n    - change \"upgrade\" to query user before overwriting files\n\n    tools/\n        upgrade\n\nDavid  7 Sept 2004\n    - recognize CPU type on HP (DEC) alpha (from Duane Krahn)\n\n    client/\n        hostinfo_unix.C\n\nRom    8 Sep 2004\n    - If we can lock the lockfile, also aquire the global mutex.\n        If we don't the screensaver\n        cannot properly detect that BOINC is executing.\n\n    client/\n        file_names.C\n\nJeff  09 Sep 2004\n    - Change the validator to handle the case where one or more\n      of the result files for a WU's result set can't be read.\n      Currently, this case results in this WU and its results\n      never getting looked at again - no science, no credit.\n\n      We distinguish 2 cases:\n      1) transient failure, e.g. an NFS mount is not working.\n         (can't read directory)\n         In this case check_set() returns a special code to the validator,\n         which arranges for the WU to get transitioned again in a few hours.\n      2) permanent failure (file doesn't exist)\n         The result's validate_state is set to ERROR (new state),\n         which is generally equivalent to INVALID\n    - add new WU arg to check_set()\n        (so it can access min_quorum)\n\n      This is coordinated seti_boinc / boinc change.\n      This note is repeated in the seti_boinc checkin_notes.\n\n      seti_boinc changes:\n        - get_result_file(), if it cannot read the result file,\n          tries to read the directory where the result file should be.\n          If it can read the directory, it returns ERR_FOPEN, as before.\n          If it cannot read the directory, it resturns ERR_OPENDIR.\n          ERR_OPENDIR in this context signals a possibly transient problem.\n          Upon a successful result read, it sets sah_result.have_result\n          (a new data member as of this change) to true.\n        - check_set(), upon return from get_result_file() :\n            - sets result.validate_state to VALIDATE_STATE_ERROR (a new state)\n              and retval to zero if there is a nonzero retval from check_set()\n              and it is not ERR_OPENDIR.  It then continues.\n            - otherwise just continues.\n          check_set() then determines if any IO errors brought the result count\n          below wu.min_quorum.  If not, it continues.  Otherwise it returns.\n          In all subsequent logic any results for which\n          sah_result.have_result == false are skipped.\n          Note that the result and the sah_result vectors are associated.\n\n        validate/\n            sah_result.h\n            sah_validate.cpp\n            sah_boinc_db.cpp\n\n        boinc changes:\n          - new validate state VALIDATE_STATE_ERROR.\n          - in the enumeration for check_set(),\n            we now include a clause to check for VALIDATE_STATE_INIT\n            in order to ignore results set to VALIDATE_STATE_ERROR.\n            This enumeration query now matches that for check_pair().\n          Note that the only possible retvals from check_set()\n          are now zero or ERR_OPENDIR.\n          Note that logic to retry possibly transient errors still needs\n          to be done.\n          Also left to be done is a transitioner change to subtract\n          the number of results in state VALIDATE_STATE_ERROR\n          from the count of active results.\n          The latter change is needed to stimulate the production\n          of additional results for the affected WU.\n\n        sched/\n            validator.C\n        db/\n            boinc_db.h\n\n\nRom    9 Sep 2004 ( for Sebastian Masch )\n    - Don't cause the core client to rewrite the state file\n      for every block transfered during a network operation.\n\n    client/\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n\nDavid  9 Sept 2004\n    - Further refinements of validation to deal with\n       recoverable/nonrecoverable file read errors.\n       Revised the signatures of check_set() and check_pair(),\n       and revised the validator accordingly.\n\n    db/\n        boinc.db.h\n    sched/\n        sample_bitwise_validator.C\n        sample_trivial_validator.C\n        validate_util.C,h\n        validator.C\n\nDavid  9 Sept 2004\n    - added try_fopen() (from Jeff Cobb):\n        like fopen(), but on tells you whether it's recoverable or not\n\n    lib/\n        util.C,h\n\n\nDavid  9 Sept 2004\n    - Added support for stats access via WAP (for cell phones)\n        (from Carl Christensen)\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            userw.inc\n            wap.inc\n        user/\n            userw.php\n        ops/\n            opsw.php\n            userw.php\n\nDavid  9 Sept 2004\n    - In transitioner, count RESULT_OUTCOME_VALIDATE_ERROR as an error\n\n    sched/\n        transitioner.C\n\nDavid  9 Sept 2004\n    - preliminary support for \"locality scheduling\" (for Einstein@home).\n        \n    client/\n        client_types.h\n        sc_scheduler.C\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C,h\n        server_types.h\n\nDavid  10 Sept 2004\n    - compile fix for Win\n\n    lib/\n        util.C\n\nDavid  10 Sept 2004\n    - validator: slight change to check_set() and check_pair():\n        they no longer should update result records in case of\n        nonrecoverable error.\n        Just set the outcome to RESULT_OUTCOME_VALIDATE_ERROR,\n        and the framework program will do the updates.\n\n    sched/\n        validator.C\n\nDavid  10 Sept 2004\n    - more changes for locality scheduling\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n    sched/\n        Makefile.am\n        sched_config.C,h\n        sched_locality.h (new)\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.C,h\n\nRom    10 Sept 2004\n    - NEw GUI: Put the glue back in so that we can make the various tabs work.\n\n    clientgui/\n        MainDocument.cpp, .h\n        stdwx.h\n\n\nLana 26 August 2004\n     - Installation script provides better default daemons by starting\n       transitioner, feeder and file deleter deamons automatically\n\n     tools/\n        make_project\n\nLana 11 Sept 2004\n     - Created DB Purger that archives \"DONE\" workunits and their\n       results into XML archive files.

db_dump: use mysql_use_result() instead of mysql_store_result()\n        for the enumeration of users.\n        Otherwise it has to store the entire result set in memory,\n        which could be prohibitive.\n        NOTE: still have to use mysql_store_result() for hosts\n        because of the user lookup to get show_hosts flag.\n        Could deal with this by doing a join.\n    - added use_use_result arg to DB_BASE::enumerate() (default false)\n    - change printfs to log_messages.printf in db_dump\n    - db_dump: don't show user host list\n        (can't do this if use mysql_use_result())\n\n    db/\n        db_base.C,h\n    sched/\n        db_dump.C\n\nDavid  24 Sept 2004\n    -

It no longer takes an \"nmessages\" arg.\n        - it returns messages in order of increasing seqno\n    - changed message_descs from a std::list to a std::deque\n\n    client/\n        client_msgs.C,h\n        gui_rpc_server.C\n    lib/\n        boinc_win.h\n        gui_rpc_client.C,h\n        gui_test.C\n    win_build/\n        boinc_guirpc_test.vcproj\n\nDavid  30 Sept 2004\n    -

always pass back host credit info in sched reply\n        (not just if new hostid - how did that happen??)\n    - add none (---) as an option for venue in web form\n    - when user change venue of host, tell them that it\n        will take effect only after a sched request\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            host.inc\n        user/\n            host_venue_action.php\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        server_types.C,h\n\nDavid  1 Oct 2004\n    - Ending the venue debacle, part II: The Client\n\n        1) Each project maintains its venue separately.\n        It's stored in the project's account file,\n        and is used to select the project prefs variant.\n\n        2) Let P be the project that's the source of the global prefs.\n        Then P's venue is used to select the global prefs variant.\n        (Note: P's venue may change without the global prefs changing).\n        This venue is stored in the CLIENT_STATE.main_host_venue\n        and in the client state file; it survives even if P is detached.\n\n        So the basic logic is:\n        if you get a new venue from project P,\n        re-parse its project prefs.\n        If in addition P is the source of the global prefs,\n        re-parse the global prefs and put the venue in CLIENT_STATE.main_host_venue\n    -

Added some new items to the APP_INIT_DATA struct\n        (and to the init_data.xml file):\n        - global preferences\n        - user/team/host IDs\n        - proxy info\n\n    This is for the benefit of Folding@home,\n    whose application does some core-client-type stuff\n    (e.g. network communication) and therefore needs this info\n\n    - changed GLOBAL_PREFS::source_project and source_scheduler\n        from std::string to char[256]\n\n    - factored out PROXY_INFO code into lib/proxy_info.C,h\n    - moved GLOBAL_PREFS code from client/ to lib/\n\n    client/\n        app_start.C\n        client_state.C\n        cs_prefs.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        prefs.C,h (moved to lib)\n        proxy.C,h\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.C,h\n        prefs.C,h (moved from client)\n        proxy_info.C,h (new)\n    win_build/\n        boinc_cli.vcproj\n        boinc_gui.vcproj\n        upper_case.vcproj\n\nDavid  6 Oct 2004\n    -

May or may not work.\n\n    - got rid of everything related to the GRAPHICS_INFO structure.\n        This wasn't being used.\n\n    NOTE: this change doesn't affect the core/app interface.\n    No need to recompile existing apps.\n\n    api/\n        graphics_api.C,h\n        windows_opengl.C\n    client/\n        app_start.C\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.C,h\n        prefs.C\n\nDavid  11 Oct 2004\n    - added <get_host_info/> GUI RPC\n    - put extern \"C\" around filesys.C functions\n        (so can use from C apps)\n\n    client/\n        gui_rpc_server.C\n    lib/\n        filesys.h\n        gui_rpc_client.C,h\n        util.h\n\nDavid  12 Oct 2004\n    - fixes to forum code (from Janus)\n    - finished checkin of 9 Oct (forgot db_update.php)\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            forum.inc\n        ops/\n            db_update.php\n        user/\n            edit_forum_preferences_action.php\n            edit_forum_preferences_form.php\n\nDavid  12 Oct 2004\n    - API: more detailed message when do heartbeat giveup\n    - remove CLIENT_STATE::previous_activities_suspended\n    - changed work fetch policy to get T work, not 2T\n    - don't handle SIGTSTP and SIGCONT\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n    client/\n        client_state.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        main.C\n        win/\n            wingui_mainwindow.cpp\n\nDavid  13 Oct 2004\n    - in global prefs XML, if cpu_scheduling_period_minutes is empty,\n        set it to 60 (this caused core client to hang in some situations)\n    - renamed PREFS::cpu_sched_period to cpu_scheduling_period_minutes\n        (matching what it's called in the XML)\n\n    client/\n        cs_apps.C\n    lib/\n        prefs.C,h\n\nDavid  13 Oct 2004\n    - initial cleanup of x_opengl.C\n        (e.g. use a timer instead of onIdle)\n\n    api/\n        x_opengl.C\n\nLana    13 Oct 2004\n    - cleanup of boinc validator to handle error conditions\n\n    sched/\n        validator.C\n\nDavid  13 Oct 2004\n    - Get app graphics working in Linux\n\n    api/\n        graphics_api.C\n        gutil.h\n        reduce.C\n        x_opengl.C,h\n    apps/\n        Makefile.am\n\nDavid  13 Oct 2004\n    - upload handler: return error msg to client if can't open log file\n\n    sched/\n        file_upload_handler.C\n\nDavid  14 Oct 2004\n    - Core client: change the poll paradigm a little\n        OLD: all the poll functions get called,\n            at least once a second or more often when there's activity,\n            e.g. network traffic.\n            The problem: some of the poll functions (e.g. garbage collect)\n            do a lot of work, and in periods of network activity\n            they get called hundreds of times/sec.\n        NEW: all poll functions take a \"double now\" argument.\n            Those that only need to run every second can\n            keep track of the last time called, and return false\n            if not enough time has gone by\n    - Clarify meaning of TIME_STATS::active_frac:\n        it is the fraction of total time\n        (NOT time that core client is running)\n        that core client is enabled to work\n    - CLIENT_STATE::compute_work_requests():\n        Don't divide by active_frac in computing work request;\n        the scheduler already does this!!\n    - Core client: don't use time_t for times.

Fixed the display of top users/hosts/teams ordered by average credit.\n        This code wasn't taking into account how long ago\n        the average credit was computed.\n        The fix: add functions user_inactive_days() (host/team also)\n        If the user's expavg_time is older than a week,\n        call user_decay_credit() to decay the average credit.\n    -

Under a number of possible\n      error conditions, handle_request.C would read only some fields of\n      and existing request into memory, and then write more of those fields,\n      some of which were null, back into memory.

In fact the\n      fix was incomplete. In order for it to work as intended, I would\n      have also had to modify SCHED_RESULT_ITEM::parse to copy the\n      additional needed fields into the in-memory structure.  But this\n      is fragile.  The next time some additional fields are added to the\n      result table, they would have to be incorporated here as well, to\n      ensure that SET followed by UPDATE is the identity operation.  So\n      I did a more graceful and robust fix.  Simply set result.id=0 for\n      those results that have already been received or which for other\n      reasons should not be modified in the database, then skip these\n      when updating.\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C   [reverted to 1.96 + comments]\n    sched/\n        handle_result.C\n\n\nDavid 5 Dec 2004\n    - show message (DEBUG level) if > 1 result/user/WU situation occurs\n    - FreeBSD compile fixes (from J.R.

This broke\n      boinc_time_to_checkpoint() under Win32, when used within pure ANSI\n      C code, if you treated the return value as a bool. So this patch\n      defines bool as char if using C under recent MS compilers.\n\n      David, a better solution for API functions that should be\n      callable from C is to make them return 'int' not 'bool'.\n      Probably ditto for Fortran.

At the right point,\n        after sucessful dlopen(), boinc_init_graphics_lib() will call\n        that user-supplied function (if not NULL) passing it handle.\n        On return boinc_init_graphics_lib() will then carry on and start\n        graphics.\n        It's fun working on a file that's not in Makefile.  No guilt!\n                                                                                                                                    \n    api/\n        graphics_lib.C\n\nDavid  10 Dec 2004\n    - Spiffed up Bruce's code a little and got it compile.\n        The DLL handle is now available as a global variable\n            (graphics_lib_handle)\n    - change BOINC_OPTIONS::defaults() to a regular function,\n        options_defaults(BOINC_OPTIONS&).\n        More of the API (e.g. boinc_init_options()) is now \"pure C\"\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C,h\n        grpahics_impl.C\n        graphics_lib.C,h\n\nDavid  10 Dec 2004\n    - Added clientgui/Makefile.mac\n        Currently, to use this you have to:\n        - install Wxwidgets 2.5.3 at the same level as boinc/\n        - create clientgui/ in the wxwidgets samples directory\n        - copy the contents of boinc/clientgui there\n        - make -f Makefile.mac\n\n    clientgui/\n        Makefile.mac (new)\n        stdwx.h\n\nDavid  11 Dec 2004\n    - Fixed Makefile.am for building graphics libs\n\n    api/\n        Makefile.am\n\nBruce  12 Dec 2004\n      Added extern C declarations to a couple of header files:\n    - In graphics_lib.h, this is for compatibility with pure C\n      applications.\n    - In graphics_impl.h, this would be needed EVEN if we were\n      never building app or library with anything other than C++.\n      It's because dlsym() can only work if you pass it a non-name\n      mangled symbol.

 Spent several hours tracking down a problem that turned\n       out to be the fact that sizeof(bool) is not consistent\n       even across gcc.

Botton line: one MUST eliminate bool from any\n       library object that's meant to be used in the public\n       API available from C.  I started fixing this across more\n       of the API but got nervous that this would break the E@h\n       builds and cause even more delay.

Inserted\n      a simple caching mechanism into the utility function\n      process_wu_template().  For a given filename FILENAME, this looks\n      for a file called FILENAME.md5, which contains the md5sum and\n      length.  If the file exists, these values are used.  If not, such\n      a file is created.  Since (I think) David is planning to have a\n      database for files, this mechanism will eventually be obsolete.\n      Right now it disabled by default.  Use -DBOINC_CACHE_MD5 to\n      enable it.\n\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C\n\nBruce  31 Dec 2004\n\n    - Some improvements on the md5-info caching.  If the 'data' file is\n      more recent than the 'md5info', then ignore md5info.  If md5info\n      has *exactly* the right format (no extra or missing characters) then\n      remove it in this case (only).  Don't write an md5info file if\n      another file is found with the same name.  Thus if someone has two\n      data files called X and X.md5, unless X.md5 has the exact correct\n      syntax for an md5-info cache file, it won't be removed or used.\n      Still disabled by default.  Use -DBOINC_CACHE_MD5 to enable it.\n\n    - Improvements to ops/ pages, from Christian Beer.  Show all fields of\n      WU.  Display status summaries based on mod-times.\n\n    - Make 'grep logs' function assume default of *.log for filenames, unless\n      specified.\n\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C\n    html/\n        inc/\n            db_ops.inc\n            util.inc\n        ops/\n            show_log.php\n\n\n"

The\n    basic idea is to provide a simple notification mechanism to the\n    project, so that if no work is currently available for a given\n    data file, there is an opportunity to make such work.  This is\n    controlled by an additional tag in config.xml, of the form:\n\n    <locality_scheduling_wait_period> N </locality_scheduling_wait_period>\n\n    where N is some number of seconds.  If this new tag is absent,\n    then the locality scheduler behaves as before.\n\n    The modification to behavior happens in send_results_for_file().\n    This is the function that queries the database to see if there are\n    unsent results available for a given (large) data file on the\n    host.  Previously, if such results are not found the scheduler\n    gives up and tries sending other results.  With this modification,\n    if N is nonzero, then if no results are found the scheduler\n    touches a file with the same name as the host's data file, in a\n    directory\n       PROJECT_ROOT/locality_scheduling/need_work/\n    The scheduler then sleeps for N seconds, and makes one additional\n    attempt to find suitable unsent results. The idea is that in this\n    interval, the project has an opportunity to make additional WU for\n    this file, which the transitioner can convert to unsent\n    results. [Note, the transaction for the first query is completed\n    before the sleep(N), and a new transaction is initiated\n    afterwards. So there is no 'sleep within a transaction'.] This\n    delay allows the project to make additional workunits suitable for\n    the host's existing data files.\n\n    In addition, if the project determines that NO further workunits\n    can be made for a given data file, then the project can touch a\n    file with the same name as the input data file, in a directory\n          PROJECT_ROOT/locality_scheduling/no_work_available/\n    If the scheduler finds this warning then it assumes that the\n    project can not manufacture additional WU for this data file and\n    skips the 'notify, sleep, query again' sequence above.  Of course\n    it still does the initial query, so if the transitioner has made\n    some new results for an existing (old) WU, they will get picked\n    up.\n\n    This mechanism is robust in the sense that if the signals fail for\n    any reason, or (say) the WU are not converted into unsent results\n    quickly enough by the transitioner, or if they are snapped up by\n    some other host, then the scheduler simply proceeds as with its\n    current unmodified behavior and nothing goes wrong.  In other\n    words, the signals can be ignored at any time and for any time\n    without adverse consequences.\n\n    TODO: further testing.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C\n\nDavid  8 Jan 2005\n    Some changes related to locality scheduling:\n\n    - Factored Bruce's new code into a separate function,\n        make_more_work_for_file()\n    - Remove the 'id>X' stuff from queries.\n        Assuming that work is fairly homogeneous\n        (i.e. no results are rejected because of resource requirements)\n        this is not needed.\n        If a result has already been sent,\n        it won't qualify for the select anyway.\n    - Add a 'workunitid<>X' clause to the queries.\n        This is to make the process of enforcing the\n        one_result_per_wu_per_user rule more efficient.\n        If the rule is not in effect, X is zero (so always true)\n    - If two consecutive select queries return the same result,\n        break out of the loop (avoid undesired looping)\n    - Use a for i=1,100 loop instead of a while(1) loop\n        around the work-sending logic,\n        to avoid infinite loops just in case\n\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C\n\nDavid  8 Jan 2005\n    - Implement the <locality_scheduling_wait_period> element in config.xml\n        If present, this tells the scheduler how long to sleep\n        between requesting more work for a file\n        and looking for it (and giving up if it's not there)\n        If absent, the scheduler doesn't request more work unit generation.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_config.C,h\n        sched_locality.C\n\nDavid  9 Jan 2005\n    -

locality scheduling changes:\n        Changed the algorithms a bit to avoid lots of DB queries\n        Invariant: for a given file/user pair,\n            results are sent in order of increasing ID\n            (i.e. the result sent is that with the smallest ID\n            among all those that CAN be sent).\n            This ensures that:\n            - the result for given WU will be sent around the same time\n        send_results_for_file():\n            1) of results for this file sent to this user,\n                find the one R with largest ID\n            2) find unsent result R2 for this file with next ID greater than R,\n                and (if one result per user per WU) different workunitid than\n                ALL previous results sent to this user.\n            3) if need more results, set R = R2 and go to 2)\n        send_new_file_work():\n            min_id = 0\n            while need more work\n                find unsent result R with id>min_id of least ID\n                min_id = R.id\n            (Note: this is necessary to preserve the invariant)\n        Changed make_more_work_for_file() to return zero for success\n            (BOINC convention)\n\n    db/\n        db_base.C,h\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C\n\nDavid  11 Jan 2005\n    more locality sched changes (with Bruce Allen)\n\n    - Added a notion of \"working set\" of files.\n        If a host doesn't have a file, the scheduler picks a\n        random entry from the working set and tries to send it\n        work from that file.\n        The project must supply a daemon program that maintains the working set\n        (could be the same as the work generator)\n    - Added config.locality_scheduling_send_timeout.\n        If any unsent result is older than this,\n        send it to the first eligible host\n    - If a host already has files, randomize their order\n    - Integrate work-generator invocation in send_results_for_file()\n    - If can't send a result because of no app_version, give up\n\n    lib/\n        error_numbers.h\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C\n\nJanus 12 Jan 2005\n    - Removed check for $user->disabled_filtering which no longer exists.\n    - Added output of CVS version information if available.\n      Someone with time on their hands should add the following line to all\n      the PHP and include files (right after the inital &lt;php \n      (remove the star! - inserted to avoid having CVS generate the info...):\n\n      $cvs_version_tracker[]=\"\\$I*d$\";  //Generated automatically - do not edit\n\n      (bug and idea found by Bruce Allen)\n\n    html/inc\n        util.inc\n        forum_show.inc\n\nBruce 12 Jan 2005\n    more locality sched changes.\n    - bug fix 1, trivial, n % 0  generates FPE if no files.\n    - bug fix 2, subtle.  In the deterministic hunt to find\n      the next unsent result, the comparison of the result name must be\n      done with the lexically maximum result name constructed from the\n      given filename.  Eg, if one needs name>FILE_ZZZZ...Z where\n      Z=0xff (is this charset independent??) and the total name length\n      is 255 (or is it 254??).\n\n    - David, I'll clean out some of the debugging scaffolding in a few\n      more days, when I get some confidence that there are not other\n      problems to fix!  Please read embedded comments/questions in code.\n\n    - Some more comemnts added later.  We do sometimes get non-zero\n      return values from possibly_send_result().  I think that this is\n      because you've failed to match up the start_transaction and\n      commit_transaction pairs.  Be careful: sleeps AND modifies the\n      DB.  Right now I am too tired to fix this without making it worse.\n      Your turn.\n\n    - A few other comments.  Currently, I am 'advertising' filenames\n      returned by get_working_set_filename() for TWO types of files:\n      (1) those for which I can make more work\n      (2) those for which I can NOT make more work, but where you have\n          not flagged with flag_for_possible_removal().\n      I am not sure that I understand the intent of\n      flag_for_possible_removal().  You surely are not guaranteeing\n      that no results will ever appear in the future for these files\n      (outstanding results might fail).  So what is my WU generator\n      supposed to do with flag_for_possible_removal?  Is (2) above\n      correct? \n\n     - Finally, I have not yet seen a SINGLE instance of a\n       flag_for_possible_removal.  Is the logic right?\n\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C\n   \nDavid  12 Jan 2005\n    - xml_escape() and xml_unescape(): handle non-ASCII characters\n\n    lib/\n        parse.C\n\nRom    12 Jan 2005\n    - Bug Fix: Fix the bug where the screensaver wasn't saving the \n        configuration settings to the registry without the prep\n        work done by the previous installer.\n\n    client/win/\n        win_screensaver.cpp, .h\n\nBruce  13 Jan 2005\n    - Various efforts to fix CVS 'loginfo' file so that we get auto\n      mailings of changes to the top level directory.  The main problem\n      is that one can't use \"^boinc[ ]\" or \"^boinc\\ \" or\n      \"^boinc\\#20\" as a regex to try and match the name of the top\n      level directory with no trailing slash. What a mess! \n\n    - More work on sched_locality.C.  Note that the 'wacky' warning is\n      actually not impossible.  Consider the following scenario: WU A\n      has result 1 and WU B has result 2.  These are both sent to a\n      host.  Some time later, result 1 fails and the transitioner\n      creates a new result, result 3 for WU A.  Then the host requests\n      a new result.  The maximum result already sent to the host is 2.\n      The next unsent result (sorted by ID) is #3.  But since it is\n      for WU A, and since the host has already gotten a result for WU\n      A, it's infeasible.  So I think this is only wacky if\n      !one_wu_per_result_per_host.\n\n    - David, I simplified the inner part of send_results_for_file()\n      somewhat.  I can't see the need/use for the bool bool\n      in_working_set argument.  If I have really screwed the pooch\n      please revert.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C\n\nDavid  13 Jan 2005\n    - Core client: when get a workunit from scheduler,\n        clear errors (e.g. download failures)\n        for all files associated with this WU\n        (this is down in a new function WORKUNIT::clear_errors())\n        Without this, if a file common to multiple WUs had a download\n        failure, all WUs would fail until user resets project!!\n    - Giant bug in HTTP file transfer:\n        If a network connection failed in the middle,\n        it wasn't being distinguished from a completed download;\n        the file size would be checked at the PERS_FILE_XFER level,\n        and it would get a \"bad file size\" fatal error.\n        Fix: when get EOF from a network connection reading HTTP reply,\n        compare the bytes transferred with the content-length\n        from HTTP header.\n        If not equal, classify it as an error.\n        This will cause higher levels to view it as a transient error,\n        and restart the download later.\n    -

We had an interesting crash condition where the GUI would crash while\n      requesting for a run mode update, aparently the core client has some\n      junk appended to the end of the RPC, so this allows the cliet-side\n      code to deal with this condition.\n\n    lib/\n        gui_rpc_client.C\n\nDavid  29 Jan 2005\n    - make_work: fixed a basic design problem.\n        Its main loop creates workunits until the number of\n        sendable results reaches the \"cushion\" level.\n        This worked OK in the old days when creating a workunit\n        created its results; but these days the transitioner does that.\n        So make_work would end up creating way more workunits\n        than it's supposed to.\n\n        The fix: estimate how many WUs to create\n        (based on wu.target_nresults).\n        Make that many, then sleep for 10 seconds\n        (give the transitioner a chance to create the results).\n\n    - Another problem: the \"master WU\" used by make_work could\n        get deleted by file_deleter and db_purge.\n        Kludgy but effective solution:\n        change file_deleter and db_purge to ignore WUs whose\n        name includes \"nodelete\".\n        Call your master WU \"wu_nodelete\".\n\n    -

Note that (1) this deletion simply removes the <sticky> tag, so\n      file won't be deleted until after all WU that depend upon it are\n      completed and (2) the mechanism to determine which file to delete\n      could be improved. TODO: improve messages to hosts which have no file\n      space and ALSO have no files to delete.\n    - scheduler changes: locality scheduling.  Clean up code which makes a\n      deterministic search of results to delete.  Data files names can not\n      contain the \"~\" character!\n    - modified the send_new_file_work() function to look for unsent work\n      starting with a random time 6 to 12 hours ago.\n    - scheduler changes: added a simple debugging mechanism for scheduler\n      requests/replies.  If you touch a file named 'debug_sched' in the project\n      root, then files called sched_reply_HOSTID_RPCNO and\n      sched_request_HOSTID_RPCNO will be created\n      under cgi-bin/ which contain the scheduler replies.  You can turn on\n      this mechanism for some time to study the scheduler replies.\n    - David, the write() function that I added to SCHEDULER_REQUEST can\n      probably be done better.  It would be nice if all the classes that\n      this includes an instance of had their own write() functions: it\n      would make debugging very easy.\n\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        sched_locality.C\n        server_types.h\n        server_types.C\n\nEric K.    31 Jan 05\n    Fixed typo in lib/parse.C\n\n    lib/parse.C\n\nJanus 31 Jan 05\n    - Added functions to read and parse .po translations for the webinterface.\n    - Changed apps.php to use these new functions as an example.\n    - Added a tiny example language interface file\n    - Added language files (that are valid with regards to the interface) for\n      English and Danish as an example\n\n      The script (Apache or whatever webserver is used) must have write-\n      access to the /languages/compiled directory as well as /languages/. It \n      will create compiled versions of the interface file and language files the\n      first time a page is accessed after a new language file or interface file\n      has been installed.\n\n      To output something that can be translated, a page can use:\n      echo tr(MY_TOKEN);\n      where MY_TOKEN is the token-name used to identify the text that will be\n      output. To actually be allowed to write and use MY_TOKEN, the token must\n      be added to the language interface. The language interface file is simply\n      a file containing all the valid tokens listed one per line. Adding\n      MY_TOKEN\n      to the bottom of the file will make \"MY_TOKEN\" a valid token.\n\n      Whenever you add a new token to the interface you _should_ at least add\n      the text to the english language file located in \n      /languages/translations/en.po\n      This file is used as default language and will be used as fallback in case\n      a translator for another language does not provide a translation for your\n      particular token (which especially will be the case when you add a new\n      token).\n\n      You should be able to add comments using a # as the first char in a line - \n      at least in the .po-files.\n\n      Future plans: 1) An expansion for project specific translations which can \n      be independently maintained by the project.\n      2) Language selection in user prefs (to override browser defaults)\n      3) Even better automatic language detection\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            translation.inc (new)\n        languages/ (new)\n            language_interface (new)\n            translations/ (new)\n                da.po (new)\n                en.po (new)\n        user/\n            apps.php\n\nDavid  31 Jan 2005\n    - Make it possible for a scheduler RPC reply to include several \"messages\",\n        each with its own message body and priority.\n        This involved changes to both scheduler and core client.\n        If the current core client gets several messages,\n        it will display only the last one.\n\n    client/\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.C,h\n\nDavid  31 Jan 2005\n    - Made WORK_REQ into a member of SCHEDULER_REPLY.\n        This makes it available in handle_request()\n        in case you want to send user messages based on it.\n        Also reduces the number of structs that have to be\n        passed around everywhere.\n    - Fixed formatting in sched_locality.C.\n        Bruce: please use 4-space indentation, no tab chars\n\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C,h\n        sched_send.C,h\n        server_types.C,y\n\nDavid  31 Jan 2005\n    - Changed the way the core client handles <delete_file_info> elements\n        in scheduler RPC replies.\n        Old: clear the FILE_INFO's sticky bit\n        New: set a FILE_INFO::marked_for_delete flag.\n            An unreferenced file will be deleted if this flag is set,\n            regardless of whether the sticky flag is set.\n            If the marked_for_delete flag is set,\n            it won't be reported in scheduler RPCs,\n            even if the report_on_rpc flag is set.\n        This avoids situations where a server asks the client to delete a file,\n        but later sends work to that file\n        because it's reported in an RPC file list\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n\nDavid  31 Jan 2005\n    - Core client: moved initialization stuff to new boinc_init();\n        change main() so that it calls boinc_init(),\n        then does platform-specific stuff,\n        then calls boinc_main_loop()\n        This ensures, e.g. that check_unique_instance() is called\n        before most other stuff\n\n    client/\n        main.C,h\n        win/\n            win_service.cpp\n\nRom    31 Jan 2005\n    - Implement log files for the BOINC Manager\n    - Implement call stacks, and memory leak detection for the BOINC Manager\n      on Windows\n    - Implement log rotation for both the core client and manager\n    - Implement stderr and stdout redirects with the core client\n    - Make the manager start the core client with IO redirection enabled\n    - Cleanup some more memory leaks in the BOINC Manager\n    - Enabled the STL use of the debug heap on Windows\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C, .h\n        cs_cmdline.C\n        cs_files.C\n        file_names.h\n        main.C\n    client/win/\n        wingui_mainwindow.cpp\n    clientgui/\n        BOINCGUI.cpp, .h\n        LogBOINC.cpp, .h (Added)\n        Makefile.am\n        ViewProjects.cpp\n        ViewMessages.cpp\n        ViewResources.cpp\n        ViewTransfers.cpp\n        ViewWork.cpp\n        stdwx.h\n    lib/\n        diagnostics.C, .h\n    win_build/\n        BOINCGUI.vcproj\n\nRom    31 Jan 2005\n    - Move the SetCurrentDirectory call to boinc_init() from service_main()\n        which was causing the log files to be put into the system32 directory.\n        Fixes start as service setup case.\n    - Flush stderr as well as stdout in boinc_init()\n    - Remove needless calls to PostMessage from check_unique_instance()\n    - Adjust BOINC Manager so that it can properly detect if it can open\n        a connection to the core client so that it can determine\n        if it needs to start it.

Now try removing files if\n      no work was sent to hosts, and available space<0 OR if available space>0\n      but work was unfeasible because the disk bound requirements of the work\n      exceeded the available space.\n   -  Added a new config.xml boolean element called 'choose_download_url_by_timezone'\n      This requires that projects provide a 2-column file in the project root named\n      'download_servers'.  An example is:\n           3600   http://einstein.aei.mpg.de\n         -21600   http://einstein.phys.uwm.edu\n      The first column is offset from UTC in seconds, and the second column is the URL\n      of the download server.  When enabled, the scheduler will replace the download\n      path for data and executables by a list of download URLs, ordered by proximity\n      to the host's timezone.  The download path must start with the\n      BOINC default download/ and the different download servers must have identical\n      file paths under download/, in other words they must be mirrored.\n    - Really exciting news, David: I have finally gotten emacs to obey your\n      indentations and formatting conventions, apart from doing this:\n      some_function(foo, bar\n                    );\n      instead of this:\n      some_function(foo, bar\n      );\n      Emacs experts, advice appreciated!\n\n    doc/\n        configuration.php\n        server_debug.php\n\n    sched/\n        sched_config.h\n        sched_config.C\n        sched_send.C\n        handle_request.C\n\nRom    2 Feb 2005\n    - Moved localization resources to the root of the project per a discussion with\n        Janus, basically we are going to try to have all the localization material\n        for the web/Forum and clients all in one place.\n\n    clientgui/locale/\n        <all directories and files deleted>\n    locale/\n        <all localization files for the client are now here>\n\nBruce  2 Feb 2005\n\n    - Made the caching of md5 info for source files a configuration option in \n      config.xml.

On these systems largefile\n     support breaks C++ compiles by defining away many of the C standard library\n     routines that should reside in namespace std::.  In order to get around\n     problem first we have to check the largefile support macros.  Later we will\n     use the macro SAH_LARGEFILE_BREAKS_CXX to check for the breakage.  If\n     if breakage is found LARGEFILE_BREAKS_CXX is defined in config.h.  This\n     define is checked in std_fixes.h and the appropriate functions are defined\n     in order to solve the problem. (These functions were already in place)\n     Because these defines affect the behavior of standard library headers,\n     std_fixes.h is being included from config.h\n    -Added AM_CPPFLAGS, AM_CFLAGS, and AM_CXXFLAGS (for flags common to all\n     compiles) so they will be defined in all Makefile.am files.\n    -Put #ifdef _cplusplus around the C++ specific items in std_fixes.h so it\n     may be included from C source files.  \n    \n    configure.ac\n    Makefile.incl\n    m4/\n        sah_largefile_breaks_cxx.m4\n    api/\n        Makefile.am\n    lib/\n        std_fixes.h\n\nDavid  9 Feb 2005\n    - locality scheduling: move check for transient infeasibility\n        to SCHEDULER_REPLY::work_needed() for uniformity\n    - scheduler: if request has different CPID, accept it\n        whether or not it's greater than current one\n    - file deleter: show full path in error messages\n\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n        sched_locality.C\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.h\n\nRom    9 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: Fix a stupid mistake where I wasn't even checking to see if a\n        person selected to allow the screen to be blanked before setting the\n        blank timer to work.\n\n    client/win/\n        win_screensaver.cpp, .h\n\nRom    9 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: If a result is flagged as 'Aborted', do not show the \n        'Suspend'/'Resume' options in the task list.\n    - Bug Fix: If a result is suspended without having already been\n        executed, display it as suspended instead of 'Ready to Run'\n\n    clientgui/\n        ViewWork.cpp\n\nDavid  9 Feb 2005\n    - scheduler changes to get the FCGI version to compile.\n        Problem: the FCGI library inexplicably doesn't provide\n        a version of fscanf().\n        Some of Bruce's recent additions\n        (timezone-dependent URL, MD5 caching) use fscanf().\n        I commented them out with the _USING_FCGI_ symbol.\n        This shouldn't affect anyone since E@h doesn't use FCGI.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n    tools/\n        backend_lib.C\n\nDavid  9 Feb 2005\n    - report GUI RPC connection rejected errors at most once every ten minutes\n\n    client/\n        gui_rpc_server.C\n\nBruce 10 Feb 2005\n    More sched locality and other scheduler changes.\n    - Address David's comment of Feb 2.\n        Now properly reduce the disk size resource requirements\n        of a WU being sent if the file is already on the host,\n        or already included in a previous WU being sent.\n        DAVID: please check that reply_copy.wus.pop_back() is right.\n    - For this, define a function host_has_file().\n        This can also be used in the future for more intelligent\n        file deletion schemes.\n    - Make warnings to upgrade old clients have low priority until\n        3 days before deadline.

In many places the code was written assuming default \n      values of 0, especially for pointers and booleans.  While that's true \n      in the case of a static instance with the default constructors, it not\n      generally true with dynamic allocation unless the default constructor \n      is replaced.  Therefore I've added constructors in the following \n      classes/structs:  MOVING_TEXT_PANEL, COLOR, PROGRESS, PROGRESS_2D,\n      TEXTURE_DESC, REDUCED_ARRAY.  \n    - This will be a problem is any are used from C code unless the \n      constructors declarations are enclosed in \"#ifdef __cplusplus\" blocks.\n    - There was also a problem that showed up under Windows when dynamic \n      allocations were used.  app_graphics_resize() gets called before \n      app_graphics_init().  This usually results in a crash since classes\n      haven't yet been constructed.  To work around this I've added a case\n      for WM_CREATE in the WndProc() which calls app_graphics_init.  Under\n      windows this will get passed before WM_SIZE does.\n\n    api/\n        gutil.C\n    gutil.h\n    reduce_main.C\n    windows_opengl.C\n\nRom    10 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: Reorder the logic for NT 4.0 domain controllers one more\n        time.

This is the same\n      way that disk space limits are handled.  This is necessary since otherwise\n      a host with small memory will endlessly trigger the WU generator, churning\n      out infeasible WUs.\n    - Added boolean arg to host_has_file() following David A's advice. This\n      eliminates the 'expensive' copy of a large data structure. The bool arg\n      makes host_has_file() skip the final WU in the vector in hunting for a file.\n    - Better log message for setting coredump size.\nI   - Added RCSID tag to sched_timezone.C\n    - Got rid of annoying 'no <host_venue>' tag messages from scheduler\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n        sched_locality.C\n        main.C\n        sched_timezone.C\n        server_types.C\n\nDavid  11 Feb 2005\n    - Core client: require that an app version's main program be executable\n        (and thus that it be digitally signed)\n    - compile fix for Windows guirpctest (should rename boinc_cmd)\n    client/\n        app_control.C\n        app_start.C\n    win_build/\n        boinc_guirpctest.vcproj\n\nJanus 11 Feb 2005\n   - Added translation features to create_account_form.php\n   - Inserted the text from the page in the language interface and the\n     english language file\n\n   /html/\n        users/\n                create_account_form.php\n        languages/translations/\n                en.po\n\nRom    11 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: Check to see if the hostname given to us is in dotted decimal\n        notation, if so, convert it into an ip address, otherwise pass it to\n        a name resolution service.\n\n    client/\n        net_xfer.C\n\nDavid  11 Feb 2005\n    - core client: added a function maybe_more_data()\n        to see if there might be more data later\n        on a socket for which recv() returned -1\n\n        Previously this was done in HTTP_REPLY_HEADER::read_reply()\n        in a way that worked on Unix but not Windows,\n        and it wasn't done at all in read_reply()\n        (used to read file upload handler replies).\n\n    client/\n        http.C\n\nDavid  11 Feb 2005\n    - compile fix for Unix\n\n    client/\n        net_xfer.C\n\nDavid  11 Feb 2005\n    - compile fix for FreeBSD (from JR Oldroyd)\n\n    api/\n        graphics_lib.C\n\nJanus 12 Feb 2005\n    - Added \"Delete forum thread\" feature\n    - Added \"Double post\" to the list of reasons why a post is deleted\n\n    /html/\n        inc/\n             email.inc\n        user/\n             forum_moderate_post.php\n             forum_moderate_thread.php (new)\n             forum_moderate_thread_action.php (new)\n             forum_thread.php\n\nDavid  12 Feb 2005\n    - fix to the 11/feb fix\n\n    client/\n        http.C\n\nDavid  12 Feb 2005\n    - added functions in PHP code to get data from GET and POST,\n        and do various safety checking on it.\n        These functions should be used exclusively;\n        $_GET and $_POST should not be accessed directly\n    - moved some stuff out of html/inc/util.inc\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            db_ops.inc\n            gallery.inc\n            prefs.inc\n            profile.inc\n            util.inc\n        user/\n            various (didn't finish)\n\nDavid  13 Feb 2005\n    - Get rid of the concept of explicitly \"activating\" an account.\n        Instead: whenever the server receives an account key\n        (whether via the web or in a scheduler RPC request)\n        for an account that has an unverified email address\n        (i.e. the email_addr field is in 'munged' form)\n        it changes the email address to non-munged form.\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            email.inc\n        languages/\n            language_interface\n            translations/\n                en.po\n        user/\n            account_created.php\n            account_setup.php\n            account_setup_first.php\n            account_setup_nonfirst_done.php\n            create_account_form.php\n            login_action.php\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n\nDavid  13 Feb 2005\n    - code cleanup in forum code.\n        More validation of GET and POST data\n\n    html/\n        forum*.php\n\nDavid  13 Feb 2005\n    - scheduler: change config option from \"enforce_delay_bound\"\n        to \"ignore_delay_bound\" (i.e. the default is to enforce the bound)\n    - scheduler: in estimating result delay,\n        take into account results being included in this reply\n        (as well as work already on client)\n\n    sched/\n        sched_config.C,h\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.C,h\n\nDavid  13 Feb 2005\n    - Core client: require that all app_version files be signed\n    - update_versions: put signatures on all app_version files\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        cs_files.C\n    py/Boinc/\n        tools.py\n\nDavid  14 Feb 2005\n    - user web fixes\n\n    html/user/\n        create_account_form.php\n        account_created.php\n\nDavid  14 Feb 2005\n    - scheduler: in estimating delay of a result,\n        ignore time stats (on_frac, active_frac)\n        if no results have been added to reply yet.\n        Clients with low on_frac/active_frac\n        will still get at least one result.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.C\n\nDavid  14 Feb 2005\n    - Allow remote application graphics via X11.

It liberalizes slightly David A's approach\n      from 14 Feb 2005. Eliminate use_time_stats from wreq structure.\n    - Scheduler changes (locality scheduling only):\n    - Improve return value info for some functions.\n    - Modify send_old_work() to accept a t_min < t < t_max time range\n    - New sched locality algorithm to send work to hosts with no files.\n      Send oldest result in the time range A < t < B where\n      B = locality_scheduling_timeout/2\n      A = B - rand*locality_scheduling_timeout/2\n      Here rand is a uniformly distributed random number in [0,1].\n    - When an unsent result is older than locality_scheduling_timeout, no\n      longer send it to the FIRST host that requests work.

If a host contacts the\n      scheduler, and fails to get work because there are N secs\n      of pending work, then send a delay request of min(3600, N/5) secs.\n      Otherwise the same host was coming back every hour, without being able\n      to get additional work.\n    - Implemented by adding a method set_delay() to\n      SCHEDULER_REQUEST. This sets the delay to the maximum of the\n      previous requested delay or the current requested delay. The\n      delay is NEVER set longer than two days.\n\n    sched/\n        server_types.h\n        server_types.C\n        handle_request.C\n        sched_send.C\n\nDavid  15 Feb 2005\n    - user web\n\n    html/user/\n        account_setup_first_done.php (new)\n\nDavid  16 Feb 2005\n    - user web fixes\n\n    html/user/\n        account_setup_first_done.php\n        team_display.php\n\nDavid  16 Feb 2005\n    - Giant checkin to remove warnings when compiled with\n        all known warnings enabled.\n        This consisted of:\n        1) string literals (\"foo\") are type const char*,\n            so any variables or args that you assign them to\n            must be const char*\n        2) shadowed variables\n        3) unused params (removed or commented out)\n        4) a couple of printf format/var mismatches\n            (nothing that would cause a problem at this point)\n\n    api/\n        x_opengl.C\n    client/\n        (most .C, .h)\n    clientgui/\n        (most .C, .h)\n        res/\n            *.xpm\n    db/\n        (most .C, .h)\n    lib/\n        (most .C, .h)\n    sched/\n        (most .C, .h)\n    tools/\n        (most .C, .h)\n\nJanus 17 Feb 2005\n    - Added security checks to forum moderation features\n    - Added project specific translation ability to the translator:\n            To use this you simply add language files and tokens in the \n            project specific language directory:\n            /html/languages/project_specific_translations/\n            There's a dummy en.po file there to show how it is done.\n            You use the tr(TOKEN)-function to get your token translated.\n            It is possible to override the BOINC-provided translation by\n            redefining the TOKEN in the project specific translation files.\n    - Changed the translator to use the project default language as interface\n      instead of having to explicitly write everything in a seperate file.\n      Therefore you do no longer  have to add tokens to the \n      language_interface-file.\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            translation.inc\n        user/\n            forum_moderate_thread.php\n            forum_moderate_post.php\n            forum_moderate_thread_action.php\n            forum_moderate_post_action.php\n        languages/\n            language_interface (removed)\n            project_specific_translations/ (new)\n                en.po (new)\n\nRom    17 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: Close down the local boinc daemon if we started the local boinc\n        daemon.\n    - Bug Fix: I forgot to change the comparision in the ENABLESCREENSAVER from\n        string to integer when I changed the control type\n\n    clientgui/\n        BOINCGUIApp.cpp, .h\n    win_build/installerv2/\n        BOINC.ism\n \nDavid  17 Feb 2005\n    - make_project: added --db_host option.\n        Lets you make a project with a remote DB server\n    - make_project: got rid of --base option\n    - add html/languages/project_specific_translations to set\n        of directories created by make_project and upgrade\n\n    py/Boinc/\n        database.py\n        setup_project.py\n    tools/\n        make_project\n\nDavid  17 Feb 2005\n    - Win core client: retry CreateProcess() 5 times with random delay,\n        in case some other process has executable file open\n        (from Bruce Allen)\n\n    client/\n        app_start.C\n\nBruce 17 Feb 2005\n    - make daily_result_quota be PER CPU with a hardwired limit of\n      4 CPUS.\n    - Improved error messages if users are being denied work because of\n      lack of CPU.

When old work was being sent,\n    the daily_result_quota constraint was not being enforced.\n    Normally this constraint is enforced in the work_needed()\n    function.  However note that the critical send_work() function\n    NEVER checks work_needed() [DAVID, perhaps it should?] before\n    calling send_work_locality() or scan_work_array().  Then, when\n    send_work_locality() was called, it would in turn call\n    send_old_work() immediately, WITHOUT checking to see if\n    work_needed() was TRUE.  This allowed the daily_result_quota\n    constraint to be broken.\n\n    Possible fixes included:\n      test work_needed() before calling send_old_work()\n      test work_needed() WITHIN send_old_work()\n      test work_needed() within possibly_send_result()\n      test work_needed() within wu_is_infeasible()\n\n    Conclusion: work is ONLY sent by the function\n    possibly_send_result() which is called in two places in\n    sched_locality.C: once in send_results_for_file() and once in\n    send_old_work().  The first of these DOES check the value of\n    work_needed().  The second does NOT.  So I added a check of\n    work_needed() within send_old_work().  A also added\n    added another check of work_needed() at the top of\n    send_results_for_file() BEFORE any DB access is done.  It might be\n    better to put this test of work_needed() lower down (within\n    possibly_send_result()) or higher up (where send_old_work())\n    is called.  I am not sure. David, I'd appreciate your advice.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C\n\nRom    21 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: Fix a localization error where we were refering to\n        \"Abort Transfer\" as \"Abort Upload\"\n\n    clientgui/\n        ViewTransfers.cpp\n\nRom    21 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: On platforms other than Windows, really close down the\n        manager, when the user requests the app to close.\n\n    clientgui/\n        MainFrame.cpp\n\nRom    21 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: If a result or transfer is paused by some event other than\n        actually changing it's CPU_SCHED state, such as user activity then\n        report the result as suspended instead of running.\n\n    client/\n        gui_rpc_server.C\n    clientgui/\n        MainDocument.cpp, .h\n        ViewTransfers.cpp\n        ViewWork.cpp\n    lib/\n        gui_rpc_client.C, .h\n\nBruce 22 Feb 2005\n    - Bug fixes to scheduler code\n    - For locality scheduler, if anonymous platform lacks app,\n        don't do deterministic search for work!\n    - For locality scheduler, remove 'unsent' constraint from initial query\n        so that existing index in result table can be used to perform\n        a more efficient search.\n    - Send multi-message replies to core clients > 4.19\n    - Change 'no work available' message to 'no work sent'\n        since this is often due to constraints at the client end,\n        NOT lack of work at project end.\n    - When daily result quota exceeded,\n        tell users what its value is for that host.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_locality.C\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.C\n        server_types.h\n\nDavid  22 Feb 2005\n    - prevent users from including HTML tags in the\n        name, url, postal_code fields of their DB records\n    - add a script (clean_user_names.php) for fixing existing DBs\n    - fix type in team edit\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            db.inc\n            translation.inc\n        ops/\n            clean_user_names.php (new)\n        user/\n            create_account_action.php\n            edit_user_info_action.php\n            team_edit_form.php\n\nDavid  22 Feb 2005\n    - Validator: added a \"-mod n i\" cmdline option.\n        Processes only WUs with ID mod n == i.\n        Lets you run multiple copies of validators for greater throughput.\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C,h\n    sched/\n        validator.C\n\nRom    22 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: Include the core client version number in the connected to\n        field of the status bar to ease deployment issues for large farms\n\n    client/\n        gui_rpc_server.C\n    clientgui/\n        MainDocument.cpp, .h\n        MainFrame.cpp\n    lib/\n        gui_rpc_client.C, .h\n\nDavid  22 Feb 2005\n    - backend processes: centralize avg_turnaround updating,\n        and write log messages\n    - backend programs: define CRITICAL/NORMAL/DEBUG as 1/2/3\n        so that message logging works as advertised\n\n    sched/\n        sched_msgs.h\n        sched_util.C,h\n        transitioner.C\n        validator.C\n\nDavid  22 Feb 2005\n    - admin web:\n        fixed boinc_real_escape_string();\n        fixed clean_user_names.php (rerun this if you already ran)\n    - user web:\n        change \"questions and problems\" to \"questions and answers\"\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            db.inc\n        ops/\n            clean_user_names.php\n            create_forums.php\n        user/\n            forum_help_desk.php\n            forum_post.php\n            forum_reply.php\n            sample_index.php\n\nDavid  22 Feb 2005\n    - core client: scheduling: cap project debt at 1 day\n\n    client/\n        cs_apps.C\n        http.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n\nDavid  23 Feb 2005\n    - got test_uc.py to work again - woohoo!\n        - changed WU name to uc_wu_nodelete.\n            Otherwise the input file would get deleted\n            and subsequent WUs (created by make_work) would bomb out\n        - change make_work to strictly obey its max_wus argument.\n        - remove check that original input file is deleted, 'cuz it's not.\n\n    py/Boinc/\n        setup_project.py\n    sched/\n        make_work.C\n    test/\n        make_project_ap.php (removed)\n        test_backend.py (removed)\n        test_uc.py\n        testbase.py\n        uc_wu (removed)\n        uc_wu_nodelete (new)\n\nRom    23 Feb 2005\n    - Bug Fix: On localized machines the administrators and users groups\n        can be named something other than administrators and users.

Core client: don't print \"no final message\" (not relevant in most cases)\n    - Core client: don't do SS poll more than once per second\n    - Core client: don't do SS reset on each CPU resched\n        (no reason to start/stop SS if same app running)\n    - Get rid of SS_STATUS_RESTARTREQUEST,\n        which as far as I can tell involved the core client asking\n        the screensaver to ask it to do graphics again.\n        Instead, the core client just tells another app to start doing SSG.\n        It hangs on to the last GRAPHICS_MSG\n        (workstation/desktop will be the same)\n    - Got rid of SS_STATUS_NOTGRAPHICSCAPABLE\n        ???\n    - Allow really small CPU scheduling periods (for debugging)\n\n    client/\n        app_control.C\n        app_graphics.C\n        client_state.C\n        cs_apps.C\n        ss_logic.C,h\n        win/\n            win_screensaver.cpp,h\n    lib/\n        gui_rpc_client.h\n        prefs.C\n\nRom    5 April 2005\n    -

Check for any graphics messages that\n        need to be processed from get_next_graphics_capable_app().\n    - Bug Fix: Adjust the logic of get_next_graphics_capable_app() so that even\n        if the graphics mode was MODE_WINDOW or MODE_HIDE_GRAPHICS before the\n        start of the screensaver, we still factor in what it's current\n        graphics_mode_acked in case it has been changed to MODE_UNSUPPORTED\n\n    client/\n        app_graphics.C\n    client/win/\n        win_screensaver.cpp\n\nDavid  6 April 2005\n    Changes to support users whose Internet providers\n    modify image files in transit.\n    Cell-phone-based providers using UMTS (e.g. Vodaphone)\n    apparently do this.\n\n    - Add a preference \"dont_verify_images\" that tells BOINC\n        not to verify (via signature or checksum) image files.\n        \"Image files\" for those whose names end with .jpg, .jpeg or .png.\n        \n    - Change the Windows path separator from \\ to /\n\n    client/\n        app_start.C\n        cs_files.C\n        file_names.C,h\n        gui_rpc_server.C\n        pers_file_xfer.C\n    html/\n        inc/\n            prefs.inc\n    lib/\n        filesys.h\n        prefs.C,h\n\nRom    6 April 2005\n    - Implement a connection manager thread for the Manager, it is really rough.\n\n      NOTE: Currently crashes on exit, due to an access violation, and changing\n        computers does not work.  It also prompts for a project every time it\n        starts\n    - Read/Write font information to the registry so we can attempt to\n        identify some of the localization issues as possible font set issues with\n        wxwidgets.\n \n    clientgui/\n        BOINCBaseView.h\n        BOINCTaskCtrl.cpp\n        MainDocument.cpp, .h\n        stdwx.h\n\nDavid  6 April 2005\n    - screensaver tweaks\n    - code cleanup in screensaver.cpp\n\n    client/win/\n        boinc_ss.rc\n        win_screensaver.cpp\n        res/\n            boinc.cmp\n\nRom    6 April 2005\n    - Added the connecting state to the status bar since the UI was displaying\n        it as disconnected when we would switch between machines.\n    - Bug Fix: Explicitly declare the network connection thread as a joinable\n        thread, by default wxWidgets defines the default behavior as detached \n        which handles its own destruction.\n\n      NOTE: The documentation also states that on Windows all threads are \n        joinable, so in the end, the crashes were related to me attempting to\n        cleanup the thread when it had already deleted itself, which caused a \n        double free situation.\n\n    clientgui/\n        MainDocument.cpp, .h\n        MainFrame.cpp, .h\n\nDavid  6 April 2005\n    - code cleanup in BOINC manager\n\n    clientgui/\n        *.cpp\n\nDavid  7 April 2005\n    - Attempt to fix the situation where:\n        1) user merges hosts; hosts with lower IDs are folded\n            into host with maximal ID, then deleted\n        2) If host's client_state.xml file still has one of the\n            lower IDs, then the next time it contacts the scheduler,\n            the host lookup fails and a new host record is created,\n            which defeats the purpose of the merge.\n\n        Solution:\n            - When merge hosts, don't delete lower-ID records.\n                Instead, change them to \"zombie\" state, in which:\n                - userid is zero\n                - rpc_seqno is ID of new host record\n            - scheduler: if host is zombie, follow link to new host,\n                send back its ID to client\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.h\n    html/\n        inc/\n            util.inc\n        user/\n            host_edit_action.php\n            host_edit_form.php\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n\nDavid  7 April 2005\n    - Core client: deal correctly with HTTP servers that don't support\n        the Range: option.\n        Namely: if we issue an HTTP GET request with a Range option,\n        and the reply header is 200 OK (rather than 206 Partial Content)\n        then assume the server is sending us the whole file;\n        reset bytes_xfered and offset to zero,\n        and open the file in \"wb\" rather than \"ab\" mode.\n\n    client/\n        http.C,h\n\nDavid  7 April 2005\n    - Python: in install_boinc_files(): don't copy \"sample\" php files,\n        since this is called from \"upgrade\" and it would overwrite\n        existing files.\n        Move the copies to install_project(),\n        which is used only at project creation.\n\n    py/Boinc/\n        setup_project.py\n\nDavid  7 April 2005\n    - Show complete account info in profile page\n    - fix name conflict in PHP\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            profile.inc\n            user.inc\n            util.inc\n        user/\n            host_edit_form.php\n            show_user.php\n\nRom    7 April 2005\n    - Switch the connection errors and connection initialization routines\n        from a polling style routines to an event style, this fixes the\n        issues of the attach to project dialog being displayed at odd\n        times.\n    - Warn the user of connection failures to a new host.\n    - Deal with various odd issues that cropped up due to the connection\n        thread being introduced to the system.\n\n    clientgui/\n        BOINCGUIApp.cpp\n        MainDocument.cpp, .h\n        MainFrame.cpp, .h\n    lib/\n        gui_rpc_client.C\n\nRom    7 April 2005\n    - Enable the F1 key so that it'll open up a browser to\n        http://boinc.berkeley.edu/manager.php\n    - Add status bar text for each task that is defined and don't remove it\n        until the list has been updated.\n    - Define and fire an update view window message which is used to quickly\n        update the listview out of cycle with the timer event, but since the\n        timer event in turn fires the same event, we won't be caught in a\n        recursive update loop.

I learned that is it not\n      reliable to use flock/lockf/fnctl file locking with buffered\n      IO.  This is because the stream libraries might unexpectedly\n      open/close/dup file descriptors on you.  So I have modified\n      the file write/append functions to use raw IO rather than\n      buffered IO.  In doing this I also found and fixed some small\n      bugs. There is no guarantee that one can mix flock/lockf/fnctl\n      file locking so I have settled on fnctl since it is POSIX and\n      gives the most control.\n\n    sched/\n        file_upload_handler.C\n\nDavid  19 April 2005\n    - bug fixes for remote GUI RPC\n\n    client/\n        gui_rpc_client.C\n    lib/\n        gui_rpc_client.C\n\nBruce 19 April 2005\n    - Better error reporting from problem_host.php reporting page, if\n      host does not exist.

If a project has multiple scheduler URLs,\n        contact them cyclically but starting at a random index.\n    - Add error-checking on start_rpc() for schedulers beyond the first one.\n        This might fix some of the problems seen recently with Pirate.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C\n        client_types.C,h\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n\nDavid  1 June 2005\n    - Restrict the account management mechanism to reduce its security risk.\n        1) am_create.php now returns an error if an account\n            (validated or not) exists with the given email address.\n        2) The account-confirmation email cautions the recipient\n            to ignore it if they didn't make the request\n        2) am_query.php returns an error if an account with same email exists.\n    - Add an \"acct_mgr_name\" argument to am_create.php so we can\n        tell the user where the request came from\n\n    The reason for this change is as follows.\n    Suppose a hacker X knows or guesses the email address of a user Y.\n    X sends an am_create RPC to the project.\n    Y receives an email and, without thinking, clicks on the URL.\n    X then does an am_query RPC and gets Y's authenticator.\n    These changes prevent this attack.\n\n    There's still a small security risk.\n    A hacker could spam a project with am_create RPCs\n    with various known email addresses.\n    A small fraction of recipients might click on validate link,\n    which would create accounts with authenticators known to the hacker.\n    However I don't see this as a significant problem.\n\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            email.inc\n        user/\n            am_create.php\n            am_query.php\n            login_action.php\n\nDavid  1 June 2005\n    - Reorganization of schedule RPC and master file fetch code\n        trying to get rid of bug where once project's scheduler URLS\n        end up in another project.\n\n        The following conditions are either all true or all false:\n            1) SCHEDULER_OP::project is nonzero\n            2) SCHEDULER_OP::state is not IDLE\n            3) SCHEDULER_OP::http_op is in HTTP_OP_SET.\n\n        These become true in:\n            SCHEDULER_OP::start_rpc()\n            SCHEDULER_OP::init_master_fetch()\n\n        These become false in:\n            SCHEDULER_OP::poll() (when an operation finishes)\n            SCHEDULER_OP::abort() (called when reset or abort project)\n\n    -

Scheduler: when send the client a delay request because\n        it's contacted us before min_sendwork_interval,\n        add an additional 1% to the delay request.\n        This handles the case where the client's clock is\n        slightly faster than the servers,\n        and it repeatedly does an RPC slightly before it should\n        (from John McLeod)\n\n    sched/\n        handle_request.C\n\nDavid  1 June 2005\n    - add <work_fetch_no_new_work> and <cpu_earlist_deadline_first>\n        items to  GUI RPC \"get_state\" reply.\n        These indicate the current work-fetch and CPU sched policies.\n        They're integers -

enable locking only if <sched_lockfile_dir> is present in config file\n    - delete lockfiles from sched_lockfile_dir (NOT necessarily CGI dir)\n    - if mylockf(fd) fails (can't lock file) close fd before returning\n        Otherwise would overflow fd limit under FCGI\n    -

rename things in terms of these concepts, e.g.\n        local_total_resource_share -> runnable_resource_share\n            (i.e. sum of resource shares of runnable projects)\n        local_total_lt_available_resource_share\n            -> potentially_runnable_source_share\n    - eliminate the use of PROJECT::next_runnable_result\n        as an indicator of whether a project has a runnable result.\n        Just call PROJECT::runnable().\n        Eliminate the use of assign_results_to_project()\n        to see if projects have a runnable result.\n    - rename \"debt\" to \"short_term_debt\", including in client_state.xml\n        (this will cause one-time parse error, shouldn't hurt anything)\n\n    client/\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n\nRom    7 June 2005 (boinc_public)\n    -

core client: store the overall work fetch urgency in\n        CLIENT_STATE::overall_work_fetch_urgency,\n        and don't pass it around as an argument\n    - add PROJECT::downloading(): true if the project\n        has a result in state RESULT_FILES_DOWNLOADING\n    - got rid of \"old\" argument to CLIENT_STATE::next_project_need_work()\n    - CLIENT_STATE::compute_work_requests():\n        return value is an error code, not overall urgency.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n\nDavid  7 June 2005\n    - code cleanup: use new functions (like RESULT::runnable() etc.)\n        instead of inspecting member variables (like suspended_via_gui)\n    - Added RESULT::runnable_soon(): true iff result is\n        downloading or runnable, not suspended, project not suspended\n    -

FILE_INFO::verify_file(): if a file fails verification,\n        set its \"status\" field to the appropriate error code.\n        This wasn't being done, so in most cases the\n        core client would verify the file over and over.\n\n        This was exacerbated by a bug I introduced 7 months and 3 weeks ago\n        (and fixed earlier today).\n        In CLIENT_STATE::update_result() I had\n\n        if (now - last_time < 1.0) return false;\n        last_time = 0;\n\n        It should be \"now\", not zero.

add a new core client message priority: MSG_ALERT.\n        The accompanying message should be shown in an alert dialog.\n    - CLIENT_STATE::add_project: show alert msg if URL or key is bad\n    - project_add_failed(): add a \"reason\" argument,\n        and show alert messages accordingly\n    - change SCHEDULER_OP::check_master_fetch_start(), SCHEDULER_OP::poll()\n        to call project_add_failed() with appropriate reason\n    - CMainDocument::CachedMessageUpdate():\n        scan new messages; if any are MSG_ALERT priority, show alert.\n        Else append to main message vector.\n    - CMainFrame::OnListPanelRender(): call pDoc->CachedMessageUpdate().\n        This is the easiest way I could find of checking new messages\n        every 5 seconds, even when not in the Messages tab.\n\n    NOTE: there's one piece I didn't do.\n    When the Manager connects to a core client with some ALERT messages\n    already in its message log, it probably shouldn't show alerts for them.\n    Rom, please figure out how to do this.\n\n    client/\n        client_msgs.h\n        cs_account.C\n        gui_rpc_server.C\n        main.C,h\n        scheduler_op.C\n        win/\n            wingui_mainwindow.cpp\n    clientgui/\n        MainDocument.cpp,h\n        MainFrame.cpp\n        ViewMessages.cpp\n    lib/\n        gui_rpc_client.h\n\nDavid  11 June 2005\n    -

estimating how long a project's work will take\n        - how many CPUs a project should occupy\n        - the \"resource share fraction\" reported to schedulers\n\n        The idea: if a process is not potentially runnable\n        (e.g. because it's suspended by user)\n        it's not going to get CPU time,\n        so it shouldn't be included in resource share calculations.\n        (suggested by Jim Harris)\n    -

Prompting for connect/disconnect requests is now\n        handled in the manager instead of the CC so the CC won't lock up\n        when configured to confirm before connect.\n\n        When multiple ISP's are detected but none are defined as the default\n        another dialog will appear giving you a choice as to which ISP to\n        use.\n\n        If the manager is hidden then the taskbar will display a balloon\n        stating that BOINC needs to connect and by opening the BOINC\n        manager you'll be able to connect up and update all projects.\n    - Added an 'Update All' button to the projects tab.\n    - More manager code clean-up\n    - Make alerts show up as a balloon if the manager is hidden.

What is even worse is\n        if you are typing and dismiss the dialog before you have even had a\n        chance to look at it.  The balloons show up in the lower right hand\n        corner and automatically go away after 5 seconds or so.\n    - If alerts already exist in the message queue when you connect up\n        to a remote computer, ignore them.\n\n    client/\n        net_xfer.C\n    clientgui/\n        BOINCBaseView.cpp\n        BOINCGUIApp.h\n        BOINCTaskBar.h\n        Events.h\n        MainDocument.cpp, .h\n        MainFrame.cpp, .h\n        ViewProjects.cpp, .h\n        ViewTransfers.cpp\n        ViewWork.cpp\n\nDavid  24 June 2005\n    - Bug fix in round-robin simulator:\n        If N is the # of CPUs, and a project has M < N runnable results,\n        its per_cpu_proc_rate should be scaled by N/M.\n        (Thanks to John McLeod for identifying this error)\n\n    client/\n        cs_scheduler.C\n\nDavid  24 June 2005\n    - Doh!

API library: potential bug:\n        if the core client sends a \"quit\" message that is handled\n        (by the timer handler) while the worker thread is\n        in the middle of checkpointing,\n        the result could be an incomplete checkpoint,\n        which in general screws up the result.\n        Same problem exists if the app exits due to no CC heartbeat\n        while a checkpoint is in progress.\n\n        Solution: if boinc_time_to_checkpoint() returns true,\n        it sets a flag (checkpointing) that suppresses\n        the handling of process control messages\n        and the checking of heartbeat timeout.\n        boinc_checkpoint_completed() clears the flag.\n\n        One consequence of this design:\n        if boinc_time_to_checkpoint() returns true,\n        you HAVE to checkpoint immediately.\n        So don't call boinc_time_to_checkpoint() unless\n        you're prepared to checkpoint.\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n\nDavid  25 June 2005\n    -

But this delayed\n      reissuing of new results.  For example if two results were\n      issued a hours 17 and 18, and both timed out (no reply). At\n      time 17+deadline the first would time out and a new result\n      would be issued.  But then instead of setting the transition\n      time to 18+deadline it would be set to 18+deadline+1 day.\n\n      To prevent thrashing I have fixed this so that if a transition\n      time is in the past, I advance it by TWICE the amount it is late,\n      but never less than 1 minute or more than 1 day.\n\n    - Ops pages: show unsent/in-progress results in purple.

file_deleter: added a new argument -delete_antiques.\n      If this switch is enabled on the command line, then\n      periodically (once per hour) removes any files in the\n      upload/ directory that are older than the oldest WU in the\n      database.  These files are created when BOINC clients\n      return work really late after the deadline -- so late that\n      the corresponding WU has been deleted from the database.\n      About half the results in the E@H upload/ directory were\n      of this form.  The 'find' command is used to locate such\n      files.  This is potentially a dangerous operation since\n      if we find then delete the wrong file(s) all hell could\n      break lose on the server.

To control the posting of offensive pictures, do not\n      display any user profile pictures until they have been verified by\n      project admin.  When user enters or modifies picture, only they can\n      see if.  If not yet verified, they will see a message saying that\n      other users can't see it until it has been verified by the project.\n      If admins have rejected it, user will see a message saying that they\n      must replace their picture or no one but themselves can see it.\n    - The only known side effect of this is that selection of UOTD is now\n      done slightly differently by the uotd.inc functions.  Previously the only\n      profiles with verification=1 were those with credit, so UOTD was\n      selected from those.  Now there are profiles of users with zero credit\n      that have verification=1.  So script that selects UOTD now does\n      a table join to restrict profile searches to those of users with\n      credit only.\n\n    html/\n        inc/\n            profile.inc\n            uotd.inc\n        ops/\n            profile_screen_form.php\n\nBruce 10 Sept 2005\n    - transitioner was doing incorrect log accounting for OVER results.\n\n    sched/\n        transitioner.C\n\nJanus 11 Sept 2005\n    - (Rob) Cleanup of forum search action file + moderated posts no longer\n      show up in the result listings.\n    - Added translation tokens for this page\n    - Changed page_head() to include a meta tag for CHARSET (if defined) for\n      buggy IE 5.5 browsers that autodetect the charset to UTF7 (not 8)\n      adding an extra +AF8- whereever underscore is used in links.\n      Will keep an eye on this bug.\n    - The teampage shouldn't use the HTML version of the teamname as page\n      title and most certainly shouldn't use an extra parameter in page_head()\n      to do it...\n\n    html/\n        user/\n            forum_text_search_action.php\n        languages/translations/\n            en.po\n        inc/\n            util.inc\n            team.inc\n\nBruce 13 Sept 2005\n    - Scheduler: when resending 'lost' or 'ghost' WU, don't count this against\n      the daily result quota for the host.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n\nBruce 13 Sept 2005\n    - Add BOINC_RCSID_ tags to those .C, .c and .cpp files that don't yet have\n      them.\n\n    api/\n    mac_icon.C\n    make_app_icon_h.C\n    texture.C\n    client/\n    gui_rpc_server_ops.C\n    acct_setup.C\n    gui_http.C\n    DlgAbout.cpp\n    clientgui/\n    DlgOptions.cpp\n    WizAttachProject.cpp\n    WizAttachAccountManager.cpp\n    DlgDialupCredentials.cpp\n    DlgAccountManagerSignup.cpp\n    DlgSelectComputer.cpp\n    DlgAccountManagerStatus.cpp\n    hyperlink.cpp\n    Localization.cpp\n    mac/\n        MacSysMenu.cpp\n        SetVersion.C\n        mac_saver_module.cpp\n    lib/\n    gui_rpc_client_ops.C\n    gui_rpc_client_print.C\n    network.C\n    mac_installer/\n    LoginItemAPI.c\n    PostInstall.cpp\n    openssl/\n    include/\n        openssl/\n        applink.c\n    sched/\n    sched_hr.C\n    sched_array.C\n    sched_resend.C\n    win_build/\n    installerv2/\n        redist/\n        Windows/\n            src/\n            boinccas/\n                CADetectOldInstaller.cpp\n                CAGetAdministratorsGroupName.cpp\n                CAGetUsersGroupName.cpp\n                CAGrantServiceExecutionRight.cpp\n                CAPopulateServiceAccount.cpp\n                CAShutdownBOINCManager.cpp\n                CAValidateServiceAccount.cpp\n                CAValidateSetupType.cpp\n                CAVerifyServiceExecutionRight.cpp\n                CAVerifyServicePassword.cpp\n                boinccas.cpp\n                lkuprid.cpp\n                main.cpp\n                stdafx.cpp\n\n\nBruce 13 Sept 2005\n    - Scheduler: if admin has set min_sendwork_interval in config file, then\n      include a delay request at least this big in EVERY sched reply.

This makes the string longer.  To guarantee that the\n      resulting longer string does not overflow storage, escape_string()\n      uses safe_strncpy() to copy the longer string back.  But this\n      is too heavy-handed, since safe_strncpy() will blindly truncate\n      the string.  Thus it might clobber \\\\ into \\ or \\' into \\ which\n      causes trouble.\n\n      David, Rom, please double-check my changes, since escape_string()\n      is used all over the place.\n\n    db/\n        db_base.C\n\n"

Memory\n          allocations are normally handled on the stack or as\n          global variables which are only used via the graphics\n          thread.\n\n        Timer: normally handles the IPC to and from the core client.\n\n    When the quit request is received from the core client the timer\n      thread would call exit which in turn would cause the C Runtime\n      Library to clean up after itself before calling the ExitProcess\n      Windows API which would actually stop the threads and exit the\n      process.  The thread that calls ExitProcess causes the heaps to\n      be freed before the other threads have been stopped.

core client: improved log message for debts\n\n    client/\n        cpu_sched.C\n\nDavid  9 July 2006\n    - core client: improve \"RPC succeeded\" message\n\n    client/\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n\nDavid  9 July 2006\n    - core client: instead of calling compute_work_requests()\n        every 5 seconds (in scheduler_rpc_poll()),\n        call it at startup, and thereafter every 10 minutes or\n        whenever something happens that could change work requests.\n        (from John McLeod)\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C,h\n        cpu_sched.C\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        gui_rpc_server_ops.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n\nDavid  9 July 2006\n    - core client: keep track of the \"outages\"\n        (periods when BOINC hasn't run) in the last 60 days.\n        This will be used in the work fetch policy.\n        (from John McLeod)\n\n    client\n        time_stats.C,h\n\nMatt 10 July 2006\n\n    I did this already once, but for some reason the code got lost, so..\n    - User web:\n        - If the flag <no_forum_rating/> is in config.xml,\n            the rating +/- links don't show up under posts.\n        - check in forum_rate.php to do the same check\n            (and make sure people are trying to sneakily downrate posts\n            without using the +/- links).\n\n    html/user\n       forum_rate.php\n    html/inc\n       forum.inc\n\nDavid  11 July 2006\n    - Feeder: an option so that apps have a \"weight\" (floating-pt)\n        that determines the proportions of work items inserted by the feeder.\n        I.e. if app 1 has weight .5 and app 2 has weight 1.5,\n        then we'll send 3 times as many results for app 2 as app 1\n    - Feeder/scheduler: add an option \"-reliable N\":\n        This tags work items whose workunits are older than N days\n        as \"need_reliable\",\n        so that the scheduler can try to send them to \"reliable\" hosts\n        (those with expavg_credit > 70)\n        In no case send a \"need_reliable\" result to a host\n        with zero total credit.\n    - Feeder, with homogeneous redundancy:\n        when add a result with a sibling that's already sent\n        (or on a collision, if we learn that this is the case)\n        increment its infeasible_count.\n        This causes it to be sent quicker.\n        It's better to have the array full of results\n        that are not already committed to a platform.\n    - validator: add -sleep_interval cmdline arg\n    - Add TRANSITIONER_ITEM::res_received_time\n        (Nothing currently uses this - should we remove??)\n\n    NOTE: this update requires a database change: see html/ops/db_update.php\n\n    (from Kevin Reed)\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.C,h\n        schema.sql\n    html/ops/\n        db_update.php\n    sched/\n        feeder.C\n        sched_array.C\n        sched_send.C\n        sched_shmem.C,h\n        server_types.h\n        show_shmem.C\n        validator.C\n\nDavid  11 July 2006\n    - core client: fix bug where the first log flag in the\n        list was getting skipped over.\n        This was due to a design flaw in the new XML parsing code.\n        To work around this, I changed the format of\n        the cc_config.xml file so that options are\n        enclosed in <options> ... </options>\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        cs_statefile.C\n        log_flags.C,h\n    lib/\n        parse.C\n\nMilos  11 July 2006\n    -

core client, Windows: don't call finalize() in quit_client();\n        quit_client() is run in a different thread, apparently,\n        and we can't safely do anything in that thread.\n        Instead, have it set a flag telling the main thread to exit,\n        then do a sleep loop until the main thread has exited.\n        (Windows... you gotta love it).\n\n    client/\n        main.C\n\nRom    12 July 2006\n    - Bug Fix: Remove extra waiting loop for Win9x based platforms\n        when shutting down a console window now that quit_client()\n        does the waiting.\n        \n    client/\n        main.C\n\nDavid  12 July 2006\n    - core client: fix bug where sym links for project files\n        weren't getting written (missing fclose())\n    - core client: fix crash on project detach\n        (PROJECT object was being referenced after it was deleted)\n\n    client/\n        client_types.C\n        gui_rpc_server_ops.C\n\nDavid  12 July 2006\n    -

core client: fix bug where, if cc_config.xml is present\n        but doesn't specify save_stats_days,\n        it's zero (rather than the correct default of 30).\n    - user web: remove SETI@home-specific text from translate.php\n\n    client/\n        log_flags.C\n    html/\n        ops/\n            remind.php\n        user/\n            translate.php\n\nDavid  14 July 2006\n    - core client: clean up related to host venue and project preferences.\n        Old: store host venue in account file,\n            and use it when parsing account file\n            to get the right venue-specific prefs.\n            This is bad because the account file is not\n            supposed to containt host-specific info,\n            and the venue is host-specific.\n        New: venue is stored in client state file, as part of project.\n            On initial parse of account file, <venue> elements are skipped.\n            Later, after client state file has been read,\n            account files projects with non-empty host_venue\n            are read again, this time looking for the selected\n            <venue> element and ignoring the rest.\n        Has this fixed any bugs?

This is similar to implementation \n        for FreeGLUT on Linux.\n    - Mac: When closing graphics window, remember its size and position; restore \n        window's size and position after exiting screensaver, or if user closes \n        and reopens the window.  Presently implemented only for Mac, and retains \n        information only while application remains in memory.\n    - Mac: Show window only after a successful call to throttled_app_render(); \n        this eliminates ugly flashes, especially when switching to MODE_WINDOW \n        from MODE_FULLSCREEN; also avoids momentary display of old image when \n        screensaver restarts which made image appear to \"jump.\"  Presently \n        implemented only for Mac\n        \n    api/\n        macglutfix.m\n        x_opengl.C\n\nDavid  21 Aug 2006\n    - Manager: make axis labels uniform in Statistics tab\n        (from Mifistor)\n\n    clientgui/\n        ViewStatistics.cpp\n\nRom    21 Aug 2006\n    - Remove the suppression of the \"Expect: 100 continue\" in HTTP header.\n        This bug fix from Ian Hay was originally to fix some proxy issues.\n        We do not know which proxy issues it actually fixes, we are waiting\n        on some follow-up from Ian.

core client: various changes to the CPU scheduler, mostly to fix:\n        1) on cold start (no projects), when attaching to 1st project,\n            the client would do an RPC not asking for work,\n            then would back off for 10 minutes\n            (for SETI@home; this is a project param)\n            until the next RPC, which would actually get work.\n        2) On the 2nd RPC, the work fetch calculation would generate\n            some INF#00s (due to divide by zero)\n            and would end up requesting 1 second.\n        Also, some code cleanup.\n\n        - rr_simulation(): get rid of arguments.\n            Always treat nearly runnable results as if they were runnable.\n            The code was sort of doing this anyway\n        - rr_simulation(): get rid of divide by zero.\n             If total resource share is zero,\n            use 1 instead of p->resource_share/total resource share.\n        - rr_simulation(): remove *ncpus from calculation\n            of pbest->work_request\n        - remove per_cpu_proc_rate arg from set_rrsim_proc_rate()\n        - use project->get_project_name() instead of project->name\n             (works for brand-new projects also)\n         \n        -

Core client: change the sequence of events for first-time use,\n        with the goal of not running CPU benchmarks until user\n        has attached to project and started to run first result.\n        Sequence is:\n        1) manager requests get_project_config, polls until done\n        2) manager calls lookup_account or create_account, polls until done\n        3) manager calls project_attach.\n            core client sets CPU specs to default values (1 GFLOPS),\n            sets project work_request to 1 second,\n            does scheduler RPC\n        4) Manager poll finishes\n        5) core client starts CPU benchmarks\n\n        The above is enforced by:\n        - only run benchmarks if there's a nontentative project\n        - if RPC reason is INIT, set work_request to 1\n        - after successful RPC, set work_request to zero\n\n    - Core client: PROJECT::sched_rpc_pending is now an int\n        that encodes the reason we need to do a sched RPC.\n        The actual reason is now shown, not always \"Requested by user\".\n\n    client/\n        acct_mgr.C\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_account.C\n        cs_benchmark.C\n        cs_cmdline.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        gui_rpc_server_ops.C\n        scheduler_op.C,h\n\nDavid  24 Aug 2006\n    -

the \"master prefs\", which are stored on disk (in global_prefs.xml),\n        which have a mod time, and which can include <venue> elements.\n    - the \"working prefs\", which are formed by taking the\n        master prefs (using the venue variant for this host)\n        and then modifying it by the contents of the prefs override file.\n        The working prefs determine what the core client actually does,\n        i.e. how much memory/disk it uses.\n    When the client makes a scheduler RPC, the request message includes\n    global prefs, which are used for two purposes:\n        1) so that the scheduler can take the prefs into account in making\n        scheduling decisions;\n        2) to propagate preferences between projects, so that users\n        see consistent prefs, and can edit them on any project site.\n    The problem is: for 1), the scheduler needs the working prefs.\n    For 2), it needs the master prefs.\n    Currently the client sends the master prefs.\n    So in some cases, scheduling decisions are now based\n    on the wrong information.\n\n    Fix: include both master prefs and working prefs in request msg.\n    New server logic:\n\n    if request message includes <working_global_preferences>\n        P = <working_global_prefs>\n    else\n        if req msg includes <global_preferences>\n            if newer than DB\n                P = <global_prefs>\n            else\n                P = DB prefs\n\n    use P for sched decisions\n\n    If request message includes <global_preferences>,\n        and mod time is later than DB version,\n        and email hash is the same,\n        update DB\n\n    Reply: if DB prefs have later mod time than P\n        send DB prefs in reply\n\n    -----------------------\n    -

(let's not always see the same hands).\n        Well, the send_msg() needs to handle the situation\n        where there's a message in the queue but none in the buffer.\n\n        This results in a bug in the CPU throttling mechanism\n        that can cause a task to sleep forever.\n    - core client: a SECOND significant bug in the shmem msg passing code.\n        In general, the API library consumes at most one message per second\n        from a given channel.\n        That means that if you write more than one message/sec\n        (even for a short period) it creates a queue that never goes away.\n        If you write more than one message/sec indefinitely,\n        it creates an unbounded queue.\n\n        At this point, the only channel that uses queuing and can\n        have more than one msg/sec is process control\n        (because of CPU throttling).\n        I put in kludge that handles this case:\n        if we want to send a <resume/> and there's already\n        a <suspend/> in the queue,\n        remove the <suspend/> and don't send anything.\n        And conversely.\n    - core client: to debug all the above, added <app_msg_send>\n        and <app_msg_receive> log flags.\n        Also added some commented-out printfs in the API library.\n\n    NOTE: in the course of debugging this I realized that, in the Windows\n        version of the API, <suspend/> and <resume/> message result\n        in calls to SuspendThread() and ResumeThread(),\n        which inc and dec a \"suspend counter\".\n        ResumeThread() decrements the counter, and resumes the thread\n        only if the counter is then zero.\n        This makes the process-control message-passing scheme fragile.\n        If for some reason you send two <suspend/>s and a <resume/>,\n        the result is that the job is suspended.\n        At some point we should change to API to do the right thing.\n\n    api/\n        boinc_api.C\n    client/\n        app.C\n        app_control.C\n        log_flags.C,h\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.h\n\nCharlie 21 Nov 2006\n    - Mac: Fix compiler warning.\n    - MGR: Don't put an empty View menu in menu bar if not SimpleGUI.\n    \n    clientgui/\n        AdvancedFrame.cpp\n    client/\n        app.C\n\nDavid  21 Nov 2006\n    - core client: if we're preempting a job because total RAM\n        usage is too high, preempt by quitting.\n        \n        This has a downside: it wastes CPU time for apps that\n        don't checkpoint often.\n        However, if we don't do it, the core client might\n        try running dozens of queued apps, looking for one that fits in RAM.\n        That might use too much swap space.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.h\n        client_types.C\n        cpu_sched.C\n        cs_files.C\n    lib/\n        gui_rpc_client.h\n\nDavid  21 Nov 2006\n    - core client: don't get work from a project with a backed-off download\n        (from John McLeod)\n\n    client/\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_scheduler.h\n\nDavid  21 Nov 2006\n    - GUI RPC: add a run mode, RUN_MODE_RESTORE,\n        whose function is to set the mode back to its permanent value\n        (i.e. to end a \"snooze\").\n        The GUI now doesn't have to remember the original value.\n\n    client/\n        client_types.C\n        gui_rpc_server_ops.C\n    lib/\n        common_defs.h\n        gui_rpc_client_ops.C\n        util.C\n\nRom    22 Nov 2006\n    - MGR: It turns out that wxWidgets exposes searching for a window by ID and\n        by default dialogs all have an id of 10000, so if we can find a window\n        with an ID of 10000 and it is of wxDialog type then disable the \"Exit\" \n        menu item.\n    - MGR: Clean out a bunch of the #ifdef's that were littered across the\n        taskbar implementation, the compiler can take care of removing the dead \n        code during the optimization phase.

add synchronization so that the core client,\n        when it's ready to do an auto-update,\n        arranges for any local Manager and screensaver to exit first.\n        This is done in a slighly kludgy way:\n        any GUI RPC connection that has done a get_screensaver_mode()\n        is assumed to be a screensaver,\n        and we send it a SS_STATUS_QUIT on its next request.\n        Any connection that has done a get_cc_status() is assumed to\n        be a Manager, and we set <manager_must_quit> on the next request.\n        The core client waits until these have been sent,\n        and waits an additional 10 seconds to let the other program exit.\n    - updater: add a mandatory --install_dir argument (don't assume ../../..)\n    - wait_client_mutex(): add a directory argument;\n        the updater needs to acquire the mutex while it's\n        running in a different directory\n    -

New logic in \n        cc quits if (launched by screensaver) and (recent user activity) and \n        (parent [screensaver] has exited).

Scheduler: enhancements to replication policy\n        (which attempts to send additional replicas of a WU\n        only to reliable/fast hosts).\n        There are several new config options which let projects\n        tailor the policy in various ways:\n        -

<reliable_priority_on_over_except_error>\n            increase priority of additional replicas\n            triggered by timeout (but not error) by this amount\n        - <reliable_time>: send results for WUs at least this old\n            only to reliable hosts\n        -

If the \n        legend changed so it required more space, this bug would also clip \n        to the former size the first time it was updated.  This problem \n        did not occur on Windows.\n        NOTE: I currently can't build on Windows or Linux, so please verify \n        that my modified code works OK on those platforms. \n    - Mac: removed the hack which refreshed once a second the first 3 times \n        to work around this bug.\n        \n    clientgui/\n        ViewResources.cpp\n        common/\n            wxPieCtrl.cpp\n\nDavid  9 May 2007\n    - Client simulator: added --dcf_dont_use and --dcf_stats options\n        (alternate ways of computing DCF)\n\n    client/\n        cpu_sched.C\n        sim.C,h\n        sim_util.C\n\nDavid  9 May 2007\n    - scheduler: slight code cleanup prior to adding EDF stuff\n\n    languages/translations/\n        en.po\n    sched/\n        sched_send.C\n        server_types.h\n\nRytis   9 May 2007\n    - Update BBCode to allow easy linking to Trac tickets, wiki and changesets.\n        \n    html/\n        user/\n            bbcode.php\n        inc/\n            text_transform.inc\n\nCharlie 10 May 2007\n    - A better fix for Mac PieCtrl legend clipping bug: wxPieCtrl::Refresh() \n        calls new wxPieCtrlLegend::MeasureText() method to caclulate size of \n        the legend area and SetSize() of legend window before OnPaint() is \n        called.  Apparently, calling SetSize() from within the OnPaint() \n        function doesn't adjust the \"invalid\" area to be repainted until \n        a return to the event loop, so the added area didn't get painted \n        until the next OnPaint() call.  Also, the wxMemoryDC bitmap was \n        being created at the smaller size, so that was also clipping the \n        drawing.\n    - Mac: include size of BOINC Manager bundle in BOINC total disk usage \n        displayed in Disk Usage pane Pie Chart.\n\n    clientgui/\n        BOINCGUIApp.cpp, .h\n        ViewResources.cpp\n        common/\n            wxPieCtrl.cpp\n\nRom    10 May 2007\n    - Possible fix for a crashing condition when the manager is shutdown\n        from the system tray icon.\n        \n    clientgui/\n        BOINCBaseFrame.cpp\n        BOINCTaskBar.cpp, .h\n\n\nDavid  10 May 2007\n    - client simulator: make it compile on Win\n    - client: parse version_num in active_task to avoid spurious error msg\n\n    client/\n        app.C\n        sim.C\n    win_build/\n        sim.vcproj\n\nRom    10 May 2007\n    - fixes #164: Aborting a Task\n    \n        If a task has already been aborted, don't enable the abort task\n        button.\n\n    clientgui/\n        ViewWork.cpp\n        ViewWorkGrid.cpp\n\nDavid  10 May 2007\n    - client: add constructor/destructor for APP_VERSION, WORKUNIT, RESULT\n    - client: with anonymous platform, don't link app version twice\n\n    client/\n        client_types.h\n        client_state.C\n        cs_apps.C\n        cs_files.C\n        cs_prefs.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        cs_statefile.C\n        sim_util.C\n    html/\n        uotd.inc\n    sched/\n        edf_sim.h\n        server_types.h\n    client/\n        app.C\n        sim.C\n    win_build/\n        sim.vcproj\n\nDavid  10 May 2007\n    - scheduler: add <workload_sim> config option.\n        If set, the scheduler will use EDF simulation,\n        together with the in-progress workload reported by the client,\n        to avoid sending results that\n        1) will miss their deadline, or\n        2) will cause an in-progress result to miss its deadline, or\n        3) will make an in-progress result miss its deadline\n            by more than is already predicted.\n        If this option is not set, or if the client request doesn't\n        include a workload description (i.e. the client is old)\n        use the existing approach, which assumes there's no workload.\n        NOTE: this is experimental.

core client: on attach to project,\n        if the initial sched request failed,\n        the manager would show \"communicating\" for 60 sec,\n        then time out and show \"failed to attach\".\n        But the project would actually be attached.\n        This was due to a logic error,\n        but I fixed it in a more fundamental way:\n        by considering an attach to be complete immediately,\n        without waiting for a successful scheduler RPC.\n\n        This was originally done to ensure that the URL and account key\n        were valid.\n        But when using the BOINC Manager, we've already verified\n        both of these before doing the attach project RPC.\n\n        When using boinc_cmd, you now have to check for messages\n        indicating a bad URL or account key.\n        I changed things to print these messages on every sched RPC.\n\n        Implementation: the notion of \"tentative project\" no longer exists.\n\n    client/\n        client_state.C,h\n        client_types.C,h\n        cs_account.C\n        cs_benchmarks.C\n        cs_scheduler.C\n        gui_rpc_server_ops.C\n        scheduler_op.C\n        sim.C\n        sim_util.C\n\nDavid  14 May 2007\n    -

client: fix two XML parsing bugs:\n        1) XML_PARSER::parse_int() and parse_double() wouldn't parse\n            <foo></foo>, and in fact would consume the </foo>,\n            so that the resulting skip_unexpected()\n            would skip the entire rest of the document.\n\n            This was exercised because my checking of 17 Apr\n            set the default for work_buf_min_days as \"\" rather than 0.\n\n        2) XML_PARSER::scan_tag() was removing spaces,\n            so <venue name=\"home\"> parsed as venuename=\"home\"\n            This actually didn't do any damage.\n\n    lib/\n        parse.C\n        prefs.C\n\nDavid  22 June 2007\n    -

Don't treat failure to allocate & attach to shared memory as a \n            computation error.\n        - Destroy shared memory segments associated with all tasks which \n            exit, not just those with a finished file.  This frees up a \n            segment for use by another task.\n        - If we run out of shared memory, start a 10 second timer during \n            which don't try to run tasks unless they are already attached \n            to shared memory (suspended tasks left in memory qualify.)\n        - If a task is waiting for shared memory to become available, \n            display this in the Manager's tasks pane.\n        - Added a new log flag stress_shmem_debug for testing scheduling \n            logic when we run out of shared memory.\n        \n    QUESTIONS for further development:\n        - Note that it is quite easy to run out of shared memory segments if \n            the leave-suspended-tasks-in-memory option is set.  (The shared \n            memory channel must remain active for heartbeats and to tell the \n            task when to resume.)\n            - Should we override this option if we run out of shared memory \n                segments?  \n            - What about tasks left in RAM because they don't checkpoint?\n        - If BOINC crashes, its shared memory is not removed.  In some \n            cases, when BOINC is relaunched it will use the same key and \n            so can re-attach to the orphaned segments, but this won't always \n            happen.  This can cause problems with the system-wide limits.\n            We can't mark the segment for removal when we create it, because \n            doing so (by calling shmctl with IPC_RMID) would remove its key \n            so the project application couldn't attach to it.\n            But we could do this safely after the first successful response \n            from the project application.

identify this situation, and set the WU.error_mask to a new code\n            (WU_ERROR_NO_CANONICAL_RESULT)\n        - zero out the \"canonical_result\" variable passed to the handler,\n            so even if the handler fails to check wu.error_mask,\n            at least it won't assimilate the same result twice.\n        Thanks to Hendrik Verhoek for finding this bug.\n    -

Client: add <run_apps_manually> config flag.\n        This is for debugging apps (currently works only in Unix).\n        What it does: when running an app,\n        the client does everything except actually fork/exec the app,\n        i.e. it sets up the slot dir, creates shared mem segment etc.\n        It then continues as if the app were actually running,\n        and you can then manually run your app under a debugger\n        in the slot directory.\n        Note: the client won't notice the termination of your app.\n    - API, Unix: in situations where the timer thread wants to exit\n        (e.g. it notices a missing heartbeat).\n        don't directly call boinc_exit(),\n        since this touches data structures that the worker thread\n        may be using concurrently.\n        Instead, set a flag telling the worker thread to call boinc_exit()\n        (which it will do from its signal handler)\n        This is an attempt to fix problems reported by Bernd;\n        I haven't tested it.\n    -

Client (Windows) change the way core/app shmem segs are created.\n        Old: get_shmem_seg_name() tries names of the form shm_boinc_N\n            until it finds one for which creating succeeds.\n            Then it detaches (deletes) the segment and records the name.\n            Later, the segment is created again.\n            This creates a race condition if two core clients\n            are running on the same host.\n            It's also kind of silly.\n        New: get_shmem_seg_name() doesn't detach the segment,\n            and we dont have to create it again later.\n            \n    client/\n        app_start.C\n    lib/\n        shmem.C\n\nEric K May 12 2008\n    -

Work fetch / scheduler:\n        There are two mechanisms to prevent the scheduler from\n        sending jobs that won't finish by their deadline.\n        Simple mechanism:\n            The client sends the interval x for which CPUs are projected\n            to be saturated.\n            Given a job with estimated duration y,\n            the scheduler doesn't send it if x + y exceeds the delay bound.\n            If it does send it, x is incremented by y.\n        Complex mechanism:\n            Client sends workload description.\n            Scheduler does EDF simulation, sees if deadlines are missed.\n            The only project using this AFAIK is BOINC alpha test.\n        Neither of these mechanisms takes coprocessors into account,\n        and as a result jobs could be sent that are doomed to\n        miss their deadline.\n        This checkin adds coprocessor awareness to the Simple mechanism.\n\n        Changes:\n        Client:\n            compute estimated delay (i.e. time until non-saturation)\n            for coprocessors as well as CPU.\n            Send them in scheduler request as part of coproc descriptor.\n        Scheduler:\n            Keep track of estimated delays separately for different resources\n    -

clear_request() is called but that doesn't change *coproc_cuda\n\n        Solution: work-fetch code no longer knows about internals of\n            COPROC_CUDA and is not responsible for settings its request fields.\n            The copying of request fields from RSC_WORK_FETCH to COPROC\n            is done at a higher level,\n            in CLIENT_STATE::make_scheduler_request()\n\n        Additional bug fix: estimated_delay wasn't being cleared in some cases.\n\n    client/\n        cs_scheduler.cpp\n        scheduler_op.cpp\n        work_fetch.cpp\n\nDavid  27 Feb 2009\n    -

we tell job B to quit, and initialize job A but don't start it;\n            however, we set if scheduler state to SCHEDULED\n            (rather than UNINITIALIZED)\n        - job B exits, and we start job A.\n            Since its state is not UNITIALIZED, we don't set up its slot dir.\n        - job A runs in an empty slot dir, doesn't find its files, and bombs out.\n    - client: add <slot_debug> option (prints messages about\n        allocation of slots, creating/removing files in slot dirs).\n\n    client/\n        app.cpp,h\n        app_control.cpp\n        app_start.cpp\n        cpu_sched.cpp\n        file_names.cpp\n        sandbox.cpp,.h\n        sim_util.cpp\n    clientgui/\n        ViewWork.cpp\n\nCharlie 28 May 2009\n    -

app_plan() can specify the GPU RAM requirements of an app version.\n            This is passed to the client in a new field\n            <gpu_ram> of the <app_version> element.\n        - prior to starting or restarting a GPU app, the client\n            checks the amount of free RAM on the particular GPU.\n            If it's not enough for the app version,\n            the client doesn't start it,\n            and arranges for the scheduler to ignore it for 5 minutes\n            (by which point there might be more free GPU RAM)\n        Notes:\n        1) this change will have effect only when\n            both client and scheduler are updated.\n        2) the check is done in enforce_schedule(),\n            rather than schedule_cpus(),\n            because only at that point\n            have we assigned a specific GPU to the job.\n        3) there's another case to deal with:\n            a GPU app's malloc of GPU RAM fails in the middle of the job.\n            Currently the job fails.\n            I plan to add an API call boinc_temporary_exit(x) so\n            that the job can exit and potentially restart in x seconds.\n            (In principle this mechanism is sufficient for all cases,\n            but it could lead to a lot of starting/exiting,\n            so the current change is worthwhile).\n\n    client/\n        client_types.cpp,h\n        coproc_detect.cpp\n        cpu_sched.cpp\n        work_fetch.cpp\n    lib/\n        coproc.h\n    sched/\n        sched_customize.cpp,h\n        sched_types.h\n\nDavid  11 Dec 2009\n    -

back end: change \"daily result quota\" mechanism.\n        Old: config.xml specifies an initial daily quota (say, 100).\n            Each host_app_version starts out with this quota.\n            On the return of a SUCCESS result,\n            the quota is doubled, up to the initial value.\n            On the return of an error result, or a timeout,\n            the quota is decremented down to 1.\n        Problem:\n            Doesn't accommodate hosts that can do more than 100 jobs/day.\n        New: similar, but\n            - on validation of a job, daily quota is incremented.\n            - on invalidation of a job, daily quota is decremented.\n            - on return of an error result, or a timeout,\n                daily quota is min'd with initial quota, then decremented.\n        Notes:\n            - This allows a host to have an unboundedly large quota\n                as long as it continues to return more valid\n                than invalid results.\n            - Even with this change, hosts that return SUCCESS but\n                invalid results will continue to get the initial daily quota.\n                It would be desirable to reduce their quota to 1.\n\n    db/\n        boinc_db.cpp\n    sched/\n        sched_result.cpp\n        sched_send.cpp\n        transitioner.cpp\n        validator.cpp\n\nDavid  1 Jun 2010\n    -

client/scheduler: fix a group of bugs related to the new mechanism\n        where the client tells the scheduler which app versions\n        its queued jobs use\n        (this is needed, e.g., to enforce per-app or per-resource job limits).\n        In this mechanism, the client sends an array of <app_version>s,\n        and each <other_result> includes an index into this array.\n\n        - The wrong index was being sent (client).\n        - If an <app_version> had a non-existent app name\n            (e.g. because that app had been deprecated)\n            it wasn't getting put in the array, invalidating array indices\n            Furthermore, an erroneous message was being sent to the user\n\n            Fix: if parse error for <app_version>,\n            put it in the array anyway, but with cav.app = NULL,\n            meaning that it's a place-holder.\n            Send a message to user only if anon platform.\n\n    -

suppose we add an EDF 1-CPU job to the list, then a MT job.\n                We'll stop at that point because #CPUs is exceeded.\n                But enforce_schedule() won't run the MT job,\n                and CPUs will be idle.\n            - Because the list may be reordered, skipping jobs based\n                on RAM is not correct, and may cause deadlines to be missed.\n\n        New:\n            - when making the job list, keep track of #CPUs used\n                by MT jobs and non-MT jobs separately.\n                Stop the scan only if the non-MT count exceeds #CPUs.\n                This ensures that we have enough jobs to use all the CPUs,\n                even if the MT jobs can't be run for whatever reason.\n            - don't skip jobs because of RAM usage\n            - skip MT jobs if the MT CPU count is at least #CPUs\n\n        Notes:\n            - ignoring RAM usage in phase 1 can cause idleness in some cases,\n                e.g. suppose there are 4 GB of RAM and the list has\n                jobs that use 3 GB, but there are also some jobs that use 1 GB.\n                I'm not sure how to fix this.\n            - Maybe the 2-phase approach is not a good idea.\n                We did it this way for efficiency,\n                so that we don't have to recompute the job list\n                each time a job checkpoints.\n                But this is probably not a concern,\n                and I like the idea of a simpler approach,\n                e.g. reducing the policy to a single comparison function.\n\n    client/\n        cpu_sched.cpp\n\nDavid  03 Nov 2010\n    -

At the end of the log files the last\n        message logged was 0x12 which translates into WM_QUIT.  The latest\n        documentation on WM_QUIT states it should never show up in the message\n        loop to begin with.\n        \n        The docs now say that WM_QUIT should not be sent to the message loop by\n        way of PostMessage.  We have been doing things this way for over 5 years.\n        \n        Change the shutdown logic so that only the primary curtain window can call\n        PostQuitMessage() and all other curtain windows just exit when they receive\n        a WM_DESTROY message.\n        \n        I'm not sure what causes this to be a problem on some machines and not\n        others.

MGR: It turns out we want the Wizard ProjectInfo Page to check for ATI and NVIDIA \n        GPUs regardless of whether they were reported by CAL, CUDA or OpenCL, so we can \n        just check CC_STATE::have_ati and CC_STATE::have_nvidia even for newer clients.  \n        This means the Manager doesn't need to do get_host_info RPCs, because all the \n        host info it needs is available from the host_info section of the get_state RPC, \n        so eliminate the unnecessary Manager calls of get_host_info RPC.\n\n    clientgui/\n        DlgAdvPreferences.cpp\n        MainDocument.cpp, .h\n        ProjectInfoPage.cpp\n\nDavid  23 Jun 2011\n    -

client: fix a bug reported by Jacob Klein,\n        where work fetch didn't work right in the presence of\n        multiple GPUs and <exclude_gpu> config options.\n        For example: suppose:\n            - you have 2 GPUs and 2 projects\n            - Project A is excluded from GPU 1\n            - you have lots of jobs for project A\n        Then the client won't try to fetch jobs from project B.\n\n        The problem had 2 parts:\n        a) round-robin simulation wasn't taking GPU exclusions into account.\n            In the above example, it would think that both GPUs had jobs.\n            I fixed this by computing the # of GPUs from each project\n            is excluded, and using this in the RR simulation.\n        b) Once this was done, I needed to make the client\n            request GPU jobs from project B rather than project A.\n            I did this with following policy:\n            If a project has excluded GPUs of a given type,\n            and has a runnable job of that type,\n            don't ask it for more work of that type.\n\n        Notes:\n        - the policy in b) is crude, and it means that work-buffer\n            preferences are ignored in some cases.\n        - neither a) nor b) takes into account app-level exclusions.\n\n        I could fix both of these with a lot of work,\n        but I'd rather move to a model in which dissimilar GPUs\n        are modeled as different resources,\n        which would remove the need for the <exclude_gpu> mechanism\n        in the first place.\n\n        Other note: I figured out this problem using the client simulator,\n        based on the client state file that Jacob sent me.\n\n    -

Work fetch: similar situation.\n            We were making an adjustment based on how much work the project currently has queued,\n            but the adjustment drowned out the project priority,\n            so we'd tend to always get work from the project that has least work queued.\n            Solution: make a smaller adjustment (-.3 ... .3)\n\n    -

Since there is no CAL for Mac, this is not an issue \n        for ATI / AMD GPUs.  On other platforms, the CUDA and CAL drivers \n        also provide OpenCL support, so we don't expect the problem there.\n    \n        Solution: I believe that CUDA and OpenCL return identical GPU \n        model names for the same GPU, and that both return the GPUs in the \n        same order (but with some possibly omitted from the OpenCL sequence.)\n        We use that information to correlate the OpenCL data with CUDA data. \n        We use our internal CUDA device_num for the corresponding OpenCL \n        device, but add a new field opencl_device_index; the two fields are \n        equal unless we have CUDA devices not recognized by OpenCL.  We \n        add a new array opencl_device_indexes[] to the COPROC struct, \n        corresponding to the entries in device_nums[].\n    \n        The init_data.xml file now has a new field gpu_opencl_device_index.  \n        If this field exists, the boinc_get_opencl_ids() API uses this to \n        find the cl_device_id and cl_platform_id, otherwise it continues \n        to use the value in gpu_device_num.\n    \n    api/\n        boinc_opencl.cpp\n    client/\n        app_start.cpp\n        coproc_detect.cpp\n    lib/\n        app_ipc.cpp,.h\n        coproc.h\n\nDavid  20 Jan 2012\n    - volunteer data archival stuff\n\n    ssim/\n        vda.cpp,h (new)\n        ssim.cpp\n        makefile\n\nDavid  20 Jan 2012\n    - client: add a mechanism for restartable download of compressed files.\n        (It turns out that the compression schemes supported by\n        Apache and libcurl, suprisingly, aren't restartable.)\n\n        if a <file_info> from the server contains <gzipped_url> tags,\n        use those instead of the <url> tags,\n        and flag the file as \"download_gzipped\".\n        If this is the case, download NAME.gz and save it as NAME.gzt.\n        When the download is complete, rename NAME.gzt to NAME.gz,\n        and uncompress it to NAME.\n        (this ensures that if NAME.gz is present, it's complete).\n        Also do the uncompression, if needed, in verify_file().\n        This ensures that the uncompression will eventually get done\n        even if the client quits are crashes in the middle.\n\n    - update_versions: if <gzip> is present in a <file_info>,\n        add a gzipped copy in the download directory\n        and add a <gzipped_url> elements to the app version's xml_doc.\n\n    client/\n        client_types.cpp,h\n        file_xfer.cpp\n        cs_files.cpp\n    tools/\n        update_versions\n\nDavid  20 Jan 2012\n    - feeder: if we're rereading the DB because of trigger file,\n        do PERF_INFO::get_from_db() also.\n        From Teemu Mannermaa.\n\n    sched/\n        feeder.cpp\n\nDavid  20 Jan 2012\n    - admin web: if change app or app version params,\n        advise user to stop/restart the project\n\n    html/ops/\n        manage_apps.php\n        manage_app_versions.php\n\nRom    21 Jan 2012\n    - VBOX: Enable the wrapper to handle fractional CPU usage.

client: change the job scheduling policy for MT jobs.\n        The old policy avoided running an N-CPU job unless N CPUs were free.\n        This could result in idle CPUs for long periods; for example:\n        on a 4-CPU machine, suppose you have a long 1-CPU job in EDF mode,\n        and some 4-CPU jobs.\n        3 CPUs will be idle until the 1-CPU job finishes.\n        Furthermore, the work fetch mechanism won't try to get\n        jobs (possibly non-MT) from other projects,\n        because the RR simulation doesn't reflect the scheduling\n        policy's exclusion principle.\n\n        The change: schedule jobs until ncpus_used >= ncpus.\n        E.g. in the above situation run the 1- and 4-CPU jobs together.\n        In extreme cases we might run 3 1-CPU jobs and the 4-CPU job.\n        This will degrade the performance of the 4-CPU job,\n        but that's probably better than having idle CPUs.\n\n    client/\n        cpu_sched.cpp\n\nDavid  22 Feb 2012\n    -

scheduler: when choosing the best app version,\n        by default we skip app versions that use a resource\n        for which work has not been requested.\n        This is determined by the \"check_req\" arg to get_app_version().\n        This flag is cleared whenever we want to send a job\n        regardless of whether a requested resource can be used:\n        namely, when resending lost jobs, and when sending assigned jobs.\n\n        Fix a bug that could skip unrequested versions even\n        when check_req is false.\n\n        NOTES:\n\n        1) The current semantics aren't right.\n        When check_req is false, we selected the fastest of all app versions,\n        including those for which no work is requested.\n        Instead, we should select the fastest of the versions\n        for which work is requested if there are any;\n        otherwise, select the fastest version.\n\n        2) The mechanism isn't implemented for anonymous platform.\n        It should be.\n\n        3) If we've cached an answer (including NULL) for a given\n        value of check_req, that answer may be wrong for a different value.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_version.cpp\n\nBernd  27 feb 2012\n    -

Now add\n        <dont_search_host_for_userid>userid</dont_search_host_for_userid>\n        to the project config (in config.xml) for each such userid.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_config.h\n        sched_config.cpp\n        handle_request.cpp\n\nBernd  27 Feb 2012\n    - scheduler: fix typo in previous commit (patch was using old parser)\n\n    sched/\n        sched_config.cpp\n\nBernd  27 Feb 2012\n    - scheduler: the scheduler (stderr) log is buffered to keep the output of\n        one instance together in the scheduler.log when multiple instances are\n        running. Currently the buffer has a fixed size of 32768 charaters.\n        On one hand with much debug output this buffer may turn out to be\n        too small. OTOH the log of this instance is completely lost in case\n        of a crash, which doesn't help with debugging. Thus make the\n        scheduler log buffer size configurable using the tag\n        <scheduler_log_buffer> in project config. The default value is\n        still the old size (32768), set it to 0 to disable buffering\n        completely, e.g. for debugging.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_config.h\n        sched_config.cpp\n        sched_main.cpp\n\nBernd  27 Feb 2012\n    - scheduler: Another feature for debugging the scheduler.\n        Previously (little known) the scheduler could be hacked to preserve\n        the sched_request.xml and sched_reply.xml in own directories\n        (you had to modify the initial value of use_files in sched_main.cpp).\n        This feature could now be switched on and off on the fly just by\n        changing the project config.\n        When there is an (existing) directory configured as\n        <debug_req_reply_dir>, each schduler instance will write three\n        files in there: PID_C_sched.log, PID_C_sched_request.xml and (if all\n        goes well) PID_C_sched_reply.xml.

It is not necessary\n        to tell the user to upgrade the client just to suite the needs of\n        a particular app version if this app version requires resources\n        that the host dosn't have or didn't request work for.\n\n        Actually I don't think it's good to tell the user he needs to\n        upgrade the client if there is only one particular app version\n        that requires a more recent one than he has. I think that the\n        purpose of the g_wreq->outdated_client flag was checking the\n        min_core_version in the project configuration. For this the \n        flag and the notice/message that it triggers is still ok. But\n        in the app version checks setting this flag leads to misleading\n        messages in most cases, so I commented that out for now.\n\n        I'm not sure, though, that both of these measurements are needed.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_version.cpp\n\nBernd  6 Jun 2012\n    - scheduler: minor fixes to plan_clas_spec:\n      - consistently accept both 'ati' and 'amd' for AMD/ATI plan classes\n      - in OpenCL plan classes always use device memory reported via OpenCL\n        (might be different e.g. from what's available/reported via CUDA)\n      - comment formatting\n\n    sched/\n        plan_class_spec.cpp\n\nDavid  6 June 2012\n    - scheduler: add <need_ati_libs> option\n\n    sched/\n        plan_class_spec.cpp,h\n        handle_request.cpp\n        sched_config.h\n\nDavid  7 June 2012\n    - scheduler: add max_results_accepted config option.\n        Limits mem usage by the scheduler, can prevent crashes.\n\n    sched/\n        sched_config.cpp,h\n        sched_types.cpp\n\nDavid  7 June 2012\n    - scheduler: add <min_cal_target>, <max_cal_target>\n        to plan class XML spec options;\n        lets you specify a range of ATI GPU models to use\n\n    sched/\n        plan_class.cpp,h\n        sched_config.cpp,h\n\nDavid  9 June 2012\n    - fixes of various (non-critical) fd and memory leaks.\n        Fixes #1188.

client: change work fetch policy to avoid starving GPUs\n        in situations where GPU exclusions are used.\n    - client: fix bug in round-robin simulation when GPU exclusions are used.\n\n    Note: this fixes a major problem (starvation)\n        with project-level GPU exclusion.\n        However, project-level GPU exclusion interferes with most of\n        the client's scheduling policies.\n        E.g., round-robin simulation doesn't take GPU exclusion into account,\n        and the resulting completion estimates and device shortfalls\n        can be wrong by an order of magnitude.\n\n        Furthermore, this fix only works for project-level exclusions.\n        If you use app-level exclusions, starvation is still possible.\n\n        The only way I can see to fix this would be to model each\n        GPU instance as a separate resource,\n        and to associate each job with a particular GPU instance.\n        This would be a sweeping change in both client and server.\n\n    client/\n        log_flags.cpp\n        project.cpp,h\n        rr_sim.cpp\n        work_fetch.cpp,h\n    lib/\n        coproc.h\n\nDavid  21 Oct 2012\n    -

But we have cached the html in\n            a local file, so it is no longer associated with the http \n            protocol / scheme.

This is likely due to the installer not being able to\ndelete the old boinc.dll file\n\nIf a client connects to the scheduling server using default prefs,\nuse the stored user prefs for determining how much work to send\n\nget preferences works, but is slightly confusing - you have to go to\nprojects, right click on \"get preferences\", and then exit/restart boinc\nbefore I get to see my new pretty underwater colors.\n\n\"suspend\" seems to suspend, but after restart the CPU time jumped up\nby a significant amount.  This is because Windows 9x uses GetTickCount\nfor CPU time.\n\n\"Retry transfers now\" feature, especially for dialup users\n\n-----------------------\nLONG-TERM IDEAS AND PROJECTS\n-----------------------\n\nCPU benchmarking\n    This should be done by a pseudo-application\n    rather than by the core client.\n    This would eliminate the GUI-starvation problem,\n    and would make it possible to have architecture-specific\n    benchmarking programs (e.g. for graphics coprocessor)\n    or project-specific programs.\n\ninvestigate binary diff mechanism for updating persistent files\n\nverify support for > 4 GB files everywhere\n\nLocal scheduling\n    more intelligent decision about when/what to work on\n    - monitor VM situation, run small-footprint programs\n        even if user active\n    - monitor network usage, do net xfers if network idle\n        even if user active\n\nThe following would require client to accept connections:\n    - clients can act as proxy scheduling server\n    - exiting client can pass work to another client\n    - client can transfer files to other clients\n\nUser/host \"reputation\"\n    keep track of % results bad, %results claimed > 2x granted credit\n    both per-host and per-user.\n    Make these visible to project, to that user (only)\n\nStorage validation\n    periodic rehash of persistent files;\n    compare results between hosts\n\nWU/result sequence mechanism\n    design/implement/document\n\nMultiple application files\n    document, test\n\nVersioning\n    think through issues involved in:\n    compatibility of core client and scheduling server\n    compatibility of core client and data server\n    compatibility of core client and app version\n    compatibility of core client and client state file?\n    Need version numbers for protocols/interfaces?\n    What messages to show user?  Project?\n\nPersistent files\n    test\n    design/implement test reporting, retrieval mechanisms\n    (do this using WU/results with null application?)\n\nNET_XFER_SET\n    review logic; prevent one stream for starving others\n"
