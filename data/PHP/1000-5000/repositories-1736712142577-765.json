I was hesitant to include it right away, but at the same time I thought: it might be good to have some kind of document to formulate the foundation this project is built on. To tell you the truth, this document is not it. However, it is a start and I thought: why not open this in the spirit of open source, sharing and pull requests and see if and how you or you or you want to change or add parts of this very *standard and corporate* document. Like most of you, I also have a small kid and my time is scarce, I might find some time though to add a bit. **All the best, Micz**, 2018-08-21\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant][homepage], version 1.4, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4][version]\n\n## Our Pledge\n\nIn the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.\n\n## Our Standards\n\nExamples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:\n\n* Using welcoming and inclusive language\n* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences\n* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism\n* Focusing on what is best for the community\n* Showing empathy towards other community members\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:\n\n* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances\n* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks\n* Public or private harassment\n* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission\n* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting\n\n## Our Responsibilities\n\nProject maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.\n\nProject maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at <micz.flor@web.de>. The project team will review and investigate all complaints, and will respond in a way that it deems appropriate to the circumstances.

          "content": "# Contributing\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> This describes contributing for **version 2.x**. For Version 3 please see <https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/blob/future3/main/CONTRIBUTING.md>\n\n## How to contribute\n\nContributors have played a bigger role over time to keep Phoniebox on the edge of innovation :)\n\nWe want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.\n\nDevelopment is done on the git branch `develop`. How to move to that branch, see below.\n\n### Getting Started\n\n* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).\n* Open an issue if one does not already exist.\n  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.\n  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.\n* Use the online line install script to get the box installed.\n* By default this will get you to the `master` branch. You will move to the `develop` branch, do this:\n\n~~~bash\ncd /home/pi/RPi-Jukebox-RFID\ngit checkout develop\ngit fetch origin\ngit reset --hard origin/develop\ngit pull\n~~~\n\nThe preferred way of code contributions are [pull requests (follow this link for a small howto)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github). And ideally pull requests using the \"running code\" on the `develop` branch of your Phoniebox. Alternatively, feel free to post tweaks, suggestions and snippets in the [\"issues\" section](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues).\n\nPlease check also our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n### Making Changes\n\n* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.\n  * This is usually the `develop` branch.\n  * Only target release branches (i.e. `master`) if you are certain your fix must be on that\n    branch.\n  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master, run `git checkout -b\n    fix/master/my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the\n    `master` branch.\n* Make commits of logical and atomic units.\n* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.\n\n~~~bash\n      Added shuffle mode and RFID controls for it (issue #130) #140\n      \n      Adds a shuffle mode for MPD to be triggered by RFID card.\n      The shuffle mode stays permanently active until deactivation (also after shutdown and reboot).\n      That is why i decided to automatically set random off (if currently active) during shutdown \n      and reboot.\n      \n      Scenario: You use your toddlers phoniebox as party jukebox in the evening and shuffle over \n      folders with your music and forget to deactivate the shuffle mode.\n      Next morning your toddler gets crazy because his preferred fairytale plays the chapters in \n      random mode => Therefore the automatism\n      \n      Update: This time without the need to create an extra random.txt file.and uptodate with the \n      master branch.\n~~~\n\n### Making Trivial Changes\n\nFor changes of a trivial nature, it is not always necessary to create a new issue.\nIn this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a\ncommit with one of  `(docs)`, `(maint)`, or `(packaging)` instead of a ticket\nnumber.\n\nFor commits that address trivial repository maintenance tasks or packaging\nissues, start the first line of the commit with `(maint)` or `(packaging)`,\nrespectively.\n\n### Submitting Changes\n\n* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n* Submit a pull request to the repository.\n* The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis.\n* After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.\n\n### Revert Policy\n\nBy running tests in advance and by engaging with peer review for prospective changes, your contributions have a high probability of becoming long lived parts of the the project. After being merged, the code will run through a series of testings. These Tests can reveal incompatibilities that are difficult to detect in advance.\n\nIf the code change results in a test failure, we will make our best effort to correct the error. If a fix cannot be determined and committed within 24 hours of its discovery, the commit(s) responsible *may* be reverted, at the discretion of the committer and Phonie maintainers. The original contributor will be notified of the revert.\n\n#### Summary\n\n* Changes resulting in test failures will be reverted if they cannot be resolved within one business day.\n\n### Guidelines\n\n* All code has to run under the stable and legacy version of Raspberry Pi OS (please check if currently even an older version is still supported).\n* For GPIO all code should work with **RPi.GPIO**. gpiozero is currently not intended to use.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n* [General GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/)\n* [GitHub pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)\n\n## Naming conventions\n\n* **Files & folder names**\n  * all **lower case**\n  * separate words with **dashes** `-` (less keystrokes, better autocomplete recognition, in HTML links dashes can not be confused) not camel/PascalCaps or underscores\n  * be **descriptive** in your wording (e.g. `raspberry`, not `juicy-red-thing`)\n  * move **from general to specific** (e.g. `food-fruit-raspberry`, not `raspberry-food-fruit`)\n  * unique and clear product IDs (e.g. MAX7219)\n    * the product ID should be written as is (no lowercase)\n    * the product ID should come last in a descriptive name (e.g. dot-matrix-module-MAX7219)\n  * be consistent and look at existing examples before you invent something new\n* **`README.md`**\n  * written in capital letters, so it's easier to spot\n  * every new folder of a component deserves a `README.md` file\n\n## Structure of files and folders\n\nInside the root folder or the repo, these folders are important:\n\n* `scripts`\n  * this folder should contain **only actively used scripts** (controlling playout, rfid tiggers, etc.)\n  * some possible services and features might live in the *components* directory (see below)\n  * if one or more scripts are needed for the activation of a component (like daemons), they should be copied to the `scripts` directory during installation / activation\n  * WHY? By copying, changes will NOT affect the github repo and make it easier for users to modify their components\n* `components`\n  * contains sub- und subsubfolders for additional features, services, hardware\n  * **subfolders** are for categories (e.g. displays, soundcards) and are plural, even if there is only one\n  * **subsubfolders** are specific hardware, services, features, protocols, etc.\n"

All plug and play via USB, no soldering iron needed. It also features GPIO buttons control support.\n\n## The new Phoniebox Calendar is here\n\nAnother bunch of wonderful designs!\n\nTo share your design or see all previous calendars and designs of the community visit the [Phoniebox Gallery](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/GALLERY).\n\n![The Phoniebox Calendar](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/img/gallery/calendar/latest-Phoniebox-Calendar.jpg \"The Phoniebox Calendar\")\n\n## Install Phoniebox\n\n### 🔥 Version 3 is coming\n\nThe goal for Version 3 was to tidy up the codebase, focus on a single programming language for the core (Python), establish a solid plugin system and build a responsive web client. [Read on here if you want to learn about more reasons](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/blob/future3/main/documentation/README.md).\n\n#### 👋 Looking for adopters, testers and contributors\n\nIf you want to test or help develop this new version called `future3`, let us know what you think about the new architecture, the new web application and help us find bugs (or fix them proactively).\n\nWhile Version 3 is still under development, it is becoming a lot more stable! Although not all of the features from version 2.x have been ported to version 3 so far.\n\nIf you seek the adventure, your support will be more then welcome.

Please try to add content in the wiki regarding special hardware, software tweaks and the like.\n\n### Manual\n\nIn the [Manual](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL) you will learn:\n\n* [How to connect to the Phoniebox from any computer to add and edit audio files.](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL#connect)\n* [How to register new RFID cards, assign them a *human readable* shortcut and add audio files for each card.](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL#registercardswebapp)\n* [How to add webradio stations and other streams to the playout files](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL#webstreams) - [and even mix web based and local files.](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL#mixwebstreams)\n* [Adding Podcasts the your Phoniebox](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL#podcasts)\n* [How to control the Phoniebox through the web app.](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL#webapp)\n* [How to assign cards specific tasks such as changing the volume level or shutting down the Phoniebox.](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/MANUAL#cardcontrol)\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nThere is a growing section of [troubleshooting](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/Troubleshooting-FAQ) including:\n\n* I want to improve the onboard audio quality\n* I am moving, how do I get the Phoniebox into my new WiFi network?\n* The RFID Reader doesn't seem to work.\n* Changing the volume does not work, but the playout works.\n* Script `daemon_rfid_reader.py` only works via SSH not by RFID cards.\n* Script daemon is closing down unexpectedly.\n* Everything seems to work, but I hear nothing when swiping a card.\n* I would like to use two cards / IDs to do the same thing.\n\n## Hardware aka Shopping List\n\nHere is a list of equipment needed. You can find a lot second hand online (save money and the planet). The links below lead to Amazon, not at all because I want to support them, but because their PartnerNet program helps to support the Phoniebox maintenance (a little bit...).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Depending on individual projects, the hardware requirements vary.\n\n### Raspberry Pi\n\n* [Raspberry Pi 4 Modell B](https://amzn.to/2Yuei04)\n* [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://amzn.to/3fqp8ef)\n* [Raspberry Pi Zero WH](https://amzn.to/3fkfKc5)\n\nYou might be surprised how easy and affordable you can get an RPi second hand. Think about the planet before you buy a new one.\n\n### RFID Reader and cards / fobs\n\n* RFID Card Reader (USB): [Neuftech USB RFID Reader ID](https://amzn.to/2RrqScm) using 125 kHz - make sure to buy compatible cards, RFID stickers or key fobs working with the same frequency as the reader.\n  * RFID cards: [125 KHz EM4100](https://amzn.to/37pjy9q) make sure the frequency matches the RFID card reader!  \n  * RFID fobs / key rings: [EM4100 RFID-Transponder-Schlüsselring, 125 KHz](https://amzn.to/3hsuvLO) make sure the frequency matches the RFID card reader!\n* RFID Kit RC522: [RC522 Reader, Chip, Card for Raspberry Pi 13.56MHz](https://amzn.to/2C7YZCZ)\n  * RFID sticker / tags: [MIFARE RFID NFC Tags](https://amzn.to/30GfLDg) untested by me personally, but reported to work with work with RC522 and PN532 card readers.  \n\n### Speakers / amps\n\n* [USB Stereo Speaker Set (6 Watt, 3,5mm jack, USB-powered) black](http://amzn.to/2kXrard) | This USB powered speaker set sounds good for its size, is good value for money and keeps this RPi project clean and without the need of a soldering iron :)\n* [USB A Male to Female Extenstion Cable with Switch On/Off](http://amzn.to/2hHrvkG) | I placed this USB extension between the USB power adapter and the Phoniebox. This will allow you to switch the Phoniebox on and off easily.\n* [USB 2.0 Hub 4-port bus powered USB Adapter](http://amzn.to/2kXeErv) | Depending on your setup, you will need none, one or two of these. If you are using the external USB powered speakers, you need one to make sure the speakers get enough power. If you want to use the additional USB soundcard and have an older RPi, you might need a second one to make sure you can connect enough devices with the RPi.\n\n### Arcade Buttons\n\n* [USB Interface for Arcade buttons](https://amzn.to/3nRAtIS) if you insist on not soldering hardware.\n* Arcade Buttons / Sensors (one of these might suit you)\n  * [Arcade Buttons / Schalter in various colours](https://amzn.to/2QMxe9r) if you want buttons for the GPIO control.\n  * [Arcade Buttons wit LED and custom icons](https://amzn.to/2MWQ6hq) as used by [@splitti](https://splittscheid.de/selfmade-phoniebox/#3C).\n  * [Set: Arcade Buttons / Tasten / Schalter](https://amzn.to/2T81JTZ) GPIO Extension Board Starter Kit including cables and breadboard.\n  * [Touch Sensor / Kapazitive Touch Tasten](https://amzn.to/2Vc4ntx) these are not buttons to press but to touch as GPIO controls.\n\n### Special hardware\n\nThese are links to additional items, which will add an individual flavour to your Phoniebox setup. Consult the issue threads to see if your idea has been realised already.\n\n* [Ground Loop Isolator / Entstörfilter Audio](https://amzn.to/2Kseo0L) this seems to [get rid off crackles in the audio out (a typical RPi problem)](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/341)\n* [Mechanical audio switch](https://amzn.to/35oOSCS) if you want to connect differen audio devices, this is the easiest way (in connection with the *Ground Loop Isolator* you will get good results)\n* [Rotary Encoder / Drehregler / Dial](https://amzn.to/2J34guF) for volume control. Read here for more information on how to [integrate the rotary dial](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/267)\n* [HiFiBerry DAC+ Soundcard](https://amzn.to/2J36cU9) Read here for more information on how to [HifiBerry Soundcard integration](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/wiki/HiFiBerry-Soundcard-Details)\n* [HDMI zu HDMI + Optisches SPDIF mit 3,5-mm-Stereo-HDMI Audio-Extractor | HDMI zu SPDIF Konverter](https://amzn.to/2N8KP8C) If you plan to use video, this might be the better solution than a USB soundcard or the hifiberry. If takes up some space, but will work with the HDMI audio out and split the signal to deliver audio through 3.5mm jack.\n\n### Components\n\nSpecial hardware is now organised in the folder [`components`](components/). If you have new hardware attached to your Phoniebox, please add to this library! It currently contains soundcards, displays, GPIO controls, RFID reader, smarthome integration.\n\n## Support Phoniebox\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->\n<!-- markdownlint-disable MD045 -->\n\n<a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/MiczFlor\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/assets/img/guidelines/download-assets-sm-2.svg\"></a>\n\nIf you like your Phoniebox, consider to [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/MiczFlor)\nor donate via [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com) to <micz.flor@web.de> using the *friends* option.\n\n## Media\n\n### Videos and Screenshots\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/7GI0VdPehQI\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/img/iFun-YouTube.jpg\" alt=\"Prototype of the RFID jukebox\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" border=\"1\" /></a>\n\nSee the Phoniebox code in action, watch this video and read the blog post from [iphone-ticker.de](https://www.iphone-ticker.de/wochenend-projekt-kontaktlose-musikbox-fuer-kinder-123063/)\n\n**We love Tech** published a video screencast on *how to build your Phoniebox* (in German), you can find all the steps and see the final product here:\n\n|  |  |   |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| <a href=\"https://youtu.be/spHDGSxckmw\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/spHDGSxckmw/hqdefault.jpg\"><br>Installation und Hardware</a> | <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9ZSKFoWr9WY\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/9ZSKFoWr9WY/hqdefault.jpg\"><br>Web App and Audio / Spotify</a> | <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YucQuwUD7XE\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YucQuwUD7XE/hqdefault.jpg\"><br>The finished Phoniebox in action</a> |\n\nA new video screencast about\n\n<!-- markdownlint-restore -->\n\n**What makes this Phoniebox easy to install and use:**\n\n* Runs on all Raspberry Pi models (1, 2, 3 and 4) and [Raspberry Zero](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/issues/15).\n* Just plug and play using USB, no soldering iron needed.\n* Once the Phoniebox is up and running, add music from any computer on your home network.\n* Register new RFID cards easily without having to connect to the RPi.\n* Play single or multiple files, podcasts or web streams.\n* Volume control is also done with RFID cards or key fobs.\n* Connect to your Phoniebox via your wifi network or run the Phoniebox like an access point and connect directly without a router.\n* **Bonus:** control the Phoniebox from your phone or computer via a web app.\n\n![The web app allows you to change the volume level, list and play audio files and folders, stop the player and shut down the RPi gracefully.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/img/web-app-iphone-screens.jpg \"The web app allows you to change the volume level, list and play audio files and folders, stop the player and shut down the RPi gracefully.\")\n\nThe **web app** runs on any device and is mobile optimised.

Think about the planet before you buy a new one.\nCreating a Phoniebox may be sustainable for the following reasons:\n\n* You **buy things second hand** or **do upcycling on unused objects** and reduce newly produced products\n* You built your Phoniebox yourself, so **maintaining and repairing is not a problem** (Additionally **a great community helps** you)\n* Since the Phoniebox uses Linux as a base system it's **very unlikely that you run out of system and security updates** - so it can run and run and run...\n* **RFID cards or tags can be reused - no need to buy new plastic elements** for changing the music or story linked to a card\n* **Build it together with your kids** to show them that building things on their own is possible and in cooperation with others makes life easier and fun at the same time\n\n## Contributing improvements\n\nRead the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file for [more infos on how to contribute code](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThere are many, many, many inspiring suggestions and solutions on the web to bring together the idea of a jukebox with RFID cards. I want to mention a few of these that have inspired me.\n\n* Thanks to all the [contributors](https://github.com/MiczFlor/RPi-Jukebox-RFID/graphs/contributors). Not only for the good code review and feature suggestions, but also for the good spirit I get each time a new Phoniebox comes to this world :)\n* Thanks to Andreas aka [hailogugo](https://github.com/hailogugo) for writing and testing the script for the [GPIO buttons as controllers for the jukebox](docs/GPIO-BUTTONS.md).\n* [Francisco Sahli's Music Cards: RFID cards + Spotify + Raspberry Pi](https://fsahli.wordpress.com/2015/11/02/music-cards-rfid-cards-spotify-raspberry-pi/) written in python, playing songs from Spotify.
