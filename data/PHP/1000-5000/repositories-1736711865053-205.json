However, you may\r\nonly distribute the software according to [Distribution\r\nLicense](#distribution-license) and make changes or new works\r\nbased on the software according to [Changes and New Works\r\nLicense](#changes-and-new-works-license).\r\n\r\n## Distribution License\r\n\r\nThe licensor grants you an additional copyright license\r\nto distribute copies of the software.  Your license\r\nto distribute covers distributing the software with\r\nchanges and new works permitted by [Changes and New Works\r\nLicense](#changes-and-new-works-license).\r\n\r\n## Notices\r\n\r\nYou must ensure that anyone who gets a copy of any part of\r\nthe software from you also gets a copy of these terms or the\r\nURL for them above, as well as copies of any plain-text lines\r\nbeginning with `Required Notice:` that the licensor provided\r\nwith the software.  For example:\r\n\r\n> Required Notice: Copyright Yoyodyne, Inc. (http://example.com)\r\n\r\n## Changes and New Works License\r\n\r\nThe licensor grants you an additional copyright license to\r\nmake changes and new works based on the software for any\r\npermitted purpose.\r\n\r\n## Patent License\r\n\r\nThe licensor grants you a patent license for the software that\r\ncovers patent claims the licensor can license, or becomes able\r\nto license, that you would infringe by using the software.\r\n\r\n## Noncompete\r\n\r\nAny purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing any\r\nproduct that competes with the software or any product the\r\nlicensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software.\r\n\r\n## Competition\r\n\r\nGoods and services compete even when they provide functionality\r\nthrough different kinds of interfaces or for different technical\r\nplatforms.  Applications can compete with services, libraries\r\nwith plugins, frameworks with development tools, and so on,\r\neven if they're written in different programming languages\r\nor for different computer architectures.  Goods and services\r\ncompete even when provided free of charge.  If you market a\r\nproduct as a practical substitute for the software or another\r\nproduct, it definitely competes.\r\n\r\n## New Products\r\n\r\nIf you are using the software to provide a product that does\r\nnot compete, but the licensor or any of its affiliates brings\r\nyour product into competition by providing a new version of\r\nthe software or another product using the software, you may\r\ncontinue using versions of the software available under these\r\nterms beforehand to provide your competing product, but not\r\nany later versions.\r\n\r\n## Discontinued Products\r\n\r\nYou may begin using the software to compete with a product\r\nor service that the licensor or any of its affiliates has\r\nstopped providing, unless the licensor includes a plain-text\r\nline beginning with `Licensor Line of Business:` with the\r\nsoftware that mentions that line of business.  For example:\r\n\r\n> Licensor Line of Business: YoyodyneCMS Content Management\r\nSystem (http://example.com/cms)\r\n\r\n## Sales of Business\r\n\r\nIf the licensor or any of its affiliates sells a line of\r\nbusiness developing the software or using the software\r\nto provide a product, the buyer can also enforce\r\n[Noncompete](#noncompete) for that product.\r\n\r\n## Fair Use\r\n\r\nYou may have \"fair use\" rights for the software under the\r\nlaw. These terms do not limit them.\r\n\r\n## No Other Rights\r\n\r\nThese terms do not allow you to sublicense or transfer any of\r\nyour licenses to anyone else, or prevent the licensor from\r\ngranting licenses to anyone else.  These terms do not imply\r\nany other licenses.\r\n\r\n## Patent Defense\r\n\r\nIf you make any written claim that the software infringes or\r\ncontributes to infringement of any patent, your patent license\r\nfor the software granted under these terms ends immediately. If\r\nyour company makes such a claim, your patent license ends\r\nimmediately for work on behalf of your company.\r\n\r\n## Violations\r\n\r\nThe first time you are notified in writing that you have\r\nviolated any of these terms, or done anything with the software\r\nnot covered by your licenses, your licenses can nonetheless\r\ncontinue if you come into full compliance with these terms,\r\nand take practical steps to correct past violations, within\r\n32 days of receiving notice.  Otherwise, all your licenses\r\nend immediately.\r\n\r\n## No Liability\r\n\r\n***As far as the law allows, the software comes as is, without\r\nany warranty or condition, and the licensor will not be liable\r\nto you for any damages arising out of these terms or the use\r\nor nature of the software, under any kind of legal claim.***\r\n\r\n## Definitions\r\n\r\nThe **licensor** is the individual or entity offering these\r\nterms, and the **software** is the software the licensor makes\r\navailable under these terms.\r\n\r\nA **product** can be a good or service, or a combination\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n**You** refers to the individual or entity agreeing to these\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n**Your company** is any legal entity, sole proprietorship,\r\nor other kind of organization that you work for, plus all\r\nits affiliates.\r\n\r\n**Affiliates** means the other organizations than an\r\norganization has control over, is under the control of, or is\r\nunder common control with.\r\n\r\n**Control** means ownership of substantially all the assets of\r\nan entity, or the power to direct its management and policies\r\nby vote, contract, or otherwise.

          "content": "# WebPageTest by Catchpoint Licensing FAQ \n\n## Executive Summary\nThe WebPageTest code is free to use under the Polyform Shield license, a source-available license. As long as you are not creating a product or service that competes with Catchpoint’s offerings then you are free to do whatever you like with the WebPageTest code, including using it for your own internal use or creating non-competing commercial products from it. In fact, we encourage using the WebPageTest code to build your own value-added applications.  \n\n## What is the Polyform Shield License? \n\nMore information about Polyform licenses, including the Shield License, can be found here: https://polyformproject.org, and the Shield License is here: https://polyformproject.org/licenses/shield/1.0.0/.  \n\nWe chose the Polyform Shield license because it provides a standard community-accepted license that provides the necessary protections for a commercial product while keeping the code as open as possible. \n\nA prior version of the WebPageTest code was released under the BSD and Apache 2.0 licenses.  A branch of the code under that license is available [here](https://github.com/WPO-Foundation/webpagetest/tree/apache) for anyone in the community who wants to continue to use the code under that license or contribute to its maintenance. \n\n## What does this mean for my access and usage of the source code? \n\nYou can access the WebPageTest source code, and download, modify, or redistribute it with one limitation: you can’t use the WebPageTest source code to make a product that competes with Catchpoint. We’ve excerpted the relevant license language here: \n\n> “Any purpose is a permitted purpose, except for providing any product that competes with the software or any product the licensor or any of its affiliates provides using the software.” \n\nFor clarity, “permitted purposes” exclude providing any software-as a-service, platform-as-a-service, infrastructure-as-a-service or other similar online service that competes with Catchpoint products or services. \n\nWe expect that almost all users of the WebPageTest will have no trouble abiding by this license. We hope this explanation is helpful, but the legal requirements are in the actual language of the license, not this FAQ.  \n\nWhile our prior open source version is still available, we may no longer be maintaining this version. \n\nIf you are interested in a license of WebPageTest software on commercial licensing terms, please contact us at [webpagetest@catchpoint.com](mailto:webpagetest@catchpoint.com), and we would be happy to answer any questions and help you set up an enterprise relationship. \n\n## Can I embed WebPageTest source code licensed under the Polyform Shield License in a software I distribute? \n\nYes, you are still able to do so, as long as that product does not compete with Catchpoint products and services. \n\n## Can I embed Polyform Shield source code in a new SaaS offering? \n\nYes, but only as long as your SaaS offering does not compete with Catchpoint products and services.\n\n## Can I modify some of the WebPageTest source code licensed under the Polyform Shield License? \n\nYes, as long as your use case is covered by the “permitted purpose” defined in the license. \n\n## Under the terms of the Polyform Shield License, can I create a competing product but give it away for free? \n\nNo; whether a fee is charged or not does change whether your product competes. A free-of-charge product that competes with Catchpoint products or services is still prohibited.  \n\n## Is the Polyform Shield License open source? \n\nThey are not exactly the same. The Polyform Shield License permits many of the same actions that “true” open source licenses do, such as downloading, modifying, and distributing the source code, but it does not permit the use case of creating a product “that competes with the software or any product the licensor or any of its affiliates provides,” as described above. The Polyform Shield License is technically source available, rather than open source, and we will refer to it as “source available.” The phrase “open source,” used strictly, refers to licenses adhering to a specific set of criteria published by the Open Source Initiative. \n\n## When will the Polyform Shield License be effective? \n\nIt will apply to WebPageTest software released as of November 1, 2020, and later releases. Previous releases and any bug fixes to such releases will remain under the BSD and Apache 2.0 licenses. \n\n## Does the Polyform Shield License impose a general prohibition against competing with Catchpoint? \n\nYes, in the sense that you cannot use our software to compete with any of our products or services; see the definition of “permitted purpose” above. \n\n## I’m confused about what use cases are competitive. What if future Catchpoint products compete with mine? \n\nCompetitive products are evaluated relative to the Catchpoint offerings at the time your product is created. If you create a product that does not compete with current Catchpoint offerings, then you can continue to use the WebPageTest software even if a future Catchpoint offering does compete. Please see the license for the exact limitations. \n\n## Can I still use older versions of the WebPageTest software? \n\nYes; the new license terms don’t alter your ability to use older versions of the WebPageTest software under their open source license.  \n\n## My company doesn’t permit employees to use code with a non-commercial restriction. Can I still use WebPageTest under the new Polyform Shield license? \n\nThe only commercial restriction imposed is set out in the “permitted purposes” described above: a product that competes with Catchpoint. This is a much narrower restriction than a “non-commercial” restriction. If you want to use the software and are having trouble getting it approved by your company, contact us at [webpagetest@catchpoint.com](mailto:webpagetest@catchpoint.com), and we may be able to help. \n\n## Is the Polyform Shield License a EULA? \n\nNo, a “EULA” is an end user license agreement, and is almost always used for binary software only.  The Polyform Shield License gives you other rights in addition to use, such as modification and distribution, in addition to use, subject only to the “permitted purposes” clause set out above. \n\n## Why did Catchpoint make this change? \n\nThis lets us invest heavily in code that we distribute for free, while sustaining a healthy business that funds this investment.  \n\nThis change is similar to and made for similar reasons as other companies that have gone through similar licensing adjustments. We still believe in the WebPageTest project and its availability as a resource for the community.  "

Run `composer test`\n\n## Contributing\n\nThere are separate lines of development under different licenses (pull requests accepted to either):\n\n- The `master` branch where most active development occurs has the [Polyform Shield 1.0.0 license](LICENSE.md)\n- The `apache` branch has the more permissive [Apache 2.0 license](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0)\n\n### Code style\n\nWebPageTest uses PSR12 coding conventions for PHP linting and formatting.\nFor JavaScript and CSS formatting we use Prettier with its default configuration.\nAdditionally we use Stylelint for CSS linting.\n\nBefore you send a pull request please make sure to run: `composer lint && composer format`.\n\nAlternatively you can run\n\n - `composer lint:php && composer format:php` if you only touched PHP code, or\n - `composer lint:css && composer format:prettier` if you only touched CSS or JavaScript code\n\n### VSCode integration\n\nIf you use VSCode you might find it helpful to install Prettier and PHP Intelephence plugins and use these in your \"settings.json\":\n\n```\n{\n  \"[php]\": {\n    \"editor.tabSize\": 4\n  },\n\n  // uncomment to reformat on every file save\n  //\"editor.formatOnSave\": true,\n\n  \"phpcs.standard\": \"PSR12\",\n\n  \"files.trimTrailingWhitespace\": true,\n\n  \"files.eol\": \"\\n\",\n\n  \"files.associations\": {\n    \"*.inc\": \"php\"\n  }\n}\n```\n"
