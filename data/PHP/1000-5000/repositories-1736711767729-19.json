It was created specifically for APIs to get rid of the performance penalties associated with process calls and file loading. EasySwoole highly encapsulates the Swoole Server and still maintains the original features of the Swoole server, supports simultaneous monitoring of HTTP, custom TCP, and UDP protocols, allowing developers to write multi-process, asynchronous, and highly available applications with minimal learning cost and effort.\n          \n- Base on Swoole extension\n- Built-in HTTP, TCP, WebSocket,Udp Coroutine Server\n- Global dependency injection container\n- PSR-7 based HTTP message implementation\n- HTTP,TCP, WebSocket, Udp middleware support\n- Scalable high performance RPC\n- Database ORM\n- Mysql, Redis, RPC, HTTP Coroutine Clients\n- Coroutine and asynchronous task delivery\n- Custom user processes\n- RESTful supported\n- High performance router\n- Fast and flexible parameter validator\n- Powerful log component\n- Universal connection pools\n- Remote Console support\n- Crontab Rule Timer support\n\n## Doc \n\n- [Doc](http://www.easyswoole.com)\n- [中文文档](http://www.easyswoole.com)\n- [Git For Doc](https://github.com/easy-swoole/doc-3.7)\n\n## ab Test\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nnamespace App\\HttpController;\n\nuse EasySwoole\\Http\\AbstractInterface\\Controller;\n\n\n/**\n * Class Index\n * @package App\\HttpController\n */\nclass Index extends Controller\n{\n    public function index()\n    {\n        $this->response()->write('Hello World');\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### 1 Core 1G RAM\n\n> command : ab -c 100 -n 10000 http://192.168.0.11:9501/\n\n```\nServer Software:        EasySwoole\nServer Hostname:        192.168.0.11\nServer Port:            9501\n\nDocument Path:          /\nDocument Length:        21 bytes\n\nConcurrency Level:      100\nTime taken for tests:   0.652 seconds\nComplete requests:      10000\nFailed requests:        0\nWrite errors:           0\nTotal transferred:      1690000 bytes\nHTML transferred:       210000 bytes\nRequests per second:    15325.16 [#/sec] (mean)\nTime per request:       9.685 [ms] (mean)\nTime per request:       0.097 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)\nTransfer rate:          2592.05 [Kbytes/sec] received\n```\n\n### 8 Core 16G RAM\n\n> command : ab -c 100 -n 10000 http://192.168.0.4:9501/\n\n```\nServer Software:        EasySwoole\nServer Hostname:        192.168.0.4\nServer Port:            9501\n\nDocument Path:          /\nDocument Length:        21 bytes\n\nConcurrency Level:      100\nTime taken for tests:   0.746 seconds\nComplete requests:      10000\nFailed requests:        0\nWrite errors:           0\nTotal transferred:      1690000 bytes\nHTML transferred:       210000 bytes\nRequests per second:    66935.97 [#/sec] (mean)\nTime per request:       1.149 [ms] (mean)\nTime per request:       0.015 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)\nTransfer rate:          2265.40 [Kbytes/sec] received\n```\n\n## Quick Start\n```\ncomposer require easyswoole/easyswoole=3.7.x\nphp vendor/bin/easyswoole.php install\nphp easyswoole.php server start\n```\n\n## Docker\n### Get Docker Image\n```\ndocker pull easyswoolexuesi2021/easyswoole:php8.1.22-alpine3.16-swoole4.8.13\n```\n> More Docker images can be viewed：[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/easyswoolexuesi2021/easyswoole) or [Git for Dockerfile](https://github.com/XueSiLf/easyswoole-docker)\n\n### Run\n\n```\ndocker run --name easyswoole \\\n-v /workspace/project:/var/www/project \\\n-p 9501:9501 -it \\\n--privileged -u root \\\n--entrypoint /bin/sh \\\neasyswoolexuesi2021/easyswoole:php8.1.22-alpine3.16-swoole4.8.13\n```\n- WorkerDir: ***/var/www***\n- Run Easyswoole : \n```bash\ncomposer require easyswoole/easyswoole=3.7.x\nphp vendor/bin/easyswoole.php install\nphp easyswoole.php server start\n```\n\n## Others \n- [Git For Demo](https://github.com/easy-swoole/demo)\n- QQ交流群\n    - VIP群 579434607 （本群需要付费599元）\n    - EasySwoole官方一群 633921431(已满)\n    - EasySwoole官方二群 709134628(已满)\n    - EasySwoole官方三群 932625047(已满)\n    - EasySwoole官方四群 779897753(已满)\n    - EasySwoole官方五群 853946743(已满)\n    - EasySwoole官方六群 524475224\n    \n- 商业支持：\n    - QQ 291323003\n    - EMAIL admin@fosuss.com\n"
