Doing so at runtime by checking the installed\nversion of a package would be too expensive, and this package mitigates that.\n\n## ocramius/package-versions for enterprise\n\nAvailable as part of the Tidelift Subscription.\n\nThe maintainer of ocramius/package-versions and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications.

Гибнут люди - и гражданское население, и военные, в том числе российские призывники, которых бросили воевать. Чтобы лишить собственный народ доступа к информации, правительство РФ запретило называть войну войной, закрыло независимые СМИ и принимает сейчас ряд диктаторских законов. Эти законы призваны заткнуть рот всем, кто против войны. За обычный призыв к миру сейчас можно получить несколько лет тюрьмы.\n\nНе молчите!

People are dying – both civilians and military servicemen, including Russian conscripts who were thrown into the fighting. In order to deprive its own people of access to information, the government of the Russian Federation has forbidden calling a war a war, shut down independent media and is passing a number of dictatorial laws. These laws are meant to silence all those who are against war. You can be jailed for multiple years for simply calling for peace.\n\nDo not be silent!
