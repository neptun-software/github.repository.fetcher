Please review these guidelines before submitting any pull requests to the package.\n\n## Which Branch?\n\n**ALL** bug fixes should be made to the branch which they belong.\n\n## Pull Requests\n\nThe pull request process differs for new features and bugs. Before sending a pull request for a new feature, you should first create an issue with `[Proposal]` in the title. The proposal should describe the new feature, as well as implementation ideas. The proposal will then be reviewed and either approved or denied. Once a proposal is approved, a pull request may be created implementing the new feature. Pull requests which do not follow this guideline will be closed immediately.\n\nPull requests for bugs may be sent without creating any proposal issue. If you believe that you know of a solution for a bug that has been filed, please leave a comment detailing your proposed fix.\n\n### Feature Requests\n\nIf you have an idea for a new feature you would like to see added to the package, you may create an issue with `[Request]` in the title. The feature request will then be reviewed by a core contributor.\n\n## Coding Guidelines\n\nCode Studio follows the [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) and [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) and laravel coding standards.\n"

Use composer to install totem to your Laravel project\n\n```\ncomposer require studio/laravel-totem\n```\n\n> Laravel Totem supports auto package discovery for Laravel v5.5+, therefore service provider registration is not required in Laravel v5.5+\n\nAdd `TotemServiceProvider` to the `providers` array of your Laravel v5.4 application's config/app.php\n\n```php\nStudio\\Totem\\Providers\\TotemServiceProvider::class,\n```\n\nOnce `Laravel Totem` is installed & registered,\n\n- Run the migration\n\n```\nphp artisan migrate\n```\n\n- Publish `Totem` assets to your public folder using the following command\n\n```\nphp artisan totem:assets\n```\n\n##### Table Prefix\n\nTotems' tables use generic names which may conflict with existing tables in a project. To alleviate this the `.env` param `TOTEM_TABLE_PREFIX` can be set which will apply a prefix to all of Totems tables and their models.\n\n#### Updating\n\nPlease republish totem assets after updating totem to a new version\n\n```\nphp artisan totem:assets\n```\n\n#### Configuration\n\n##### Cron Job\n\nThis package assumes that you have a good understanding of [Laravel's Task Scheduling](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/scheduling) and [Laravel Console Commands](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/artisan#writing-commands). Before any of this works please make sure you have a cron running as follows:\n\n```\n* * * * * php /path-to-your-project/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1\n```\n\n##### Web Dashboard\n\n`Laravel Totem`'s dashboard is inspired by `Laravel Horizon`. Just like Horizon you can configure authentication to `Totem`'s dashboard. Add the following to the boot method of your AppServiceProvider or wherever you might seem fit.\n\n```php\nuse Studio\\Totem\\Totem;\n\nTotem::auth(function($request) {\n    // return true / false . For e.g.\n    return Auth::check();\n});\n```\n\nBy default Totem's dashboard only works in local environment. To view the dashboard point your browser to /totem of your app. For e.g. laravel.dev/totem.\n\n##### Filter Commands Dropdown\n\nBy default `Totem` outputs all Artisan commands on the Create/Edit tasks. To make this dropdown more concise there is a filter config feature that can be set in the `totem.php` config file.\n\nExample filters\n\n```php\n'artisan' => [\n    'command_filter' => [\n        'stats:*',\n        'email:daily-reports'\n    ],\n],\n```\n\nThis feature uses [fnmatch](http://php.net/manual/en/function.fnmatch.php) syntax to filter displayed commands. `stats:*` will match all Artisan commands that start with `stats:` while `email:daily-reports` will only match the command named `email:daily-reports`.\n\nThis filter can be used as either a whitelist or a blacklist. By default it acts as a whitelist but an option flag can be set to instead act as a blacklist.\n\n```php\n'artisan' => [\n    'command_filter' => [\n        'stats:*',\n        'email:daily-reports'\n    ],\n    'whitelist' => true,\n],\n\n```\n\nIf the value of whitelist is `false` then the filter acts as a blacklist.\n\n`'whitelist' => false`\n\n#### Middleware\n\n`Laravel Totem` uses the default web and api middleware but if customization is required the middleware can be changed by setting the appropriate `.env` value. These values can be found in `config/totem.php`.\n\n#### Making Commands available in `Laravel Totem`\n\nAll artisan commands can be scheduled. If you want to hide a command from Totem make sure you have the `hidden` attribute set to true in your command. For e.g.\n\n```php\nprotected $hidden = true;\n```\n\nFrom L5.5 onwards all commands are auto registered, so this wouldn't be a problem.\n\n#### Command Parameters\n\nIf your command requires arguments or options please use the optional command parameters field. You can provide parameters to your command as a string in the following manner\n\n```text\nname=john.doe --greetings='Welcome to the new world'\n```\n\nIn the example above, name is an argument while greetings is an option\n\n#### Console Command\n\nIn addition to the dashboard, Totem provides an artisan command to view a list of scheduled task.\n\n```\nphp artisan schedule:list\n```\n\n### Screenshots\n\n##### Task List\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/codestudiohq/laravel-totem/blob/1.0/public/img/screenshots/tasks.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Task List\"/>\n\n##### Task Details\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/codestudiohq/laravel-totem/blob/1.0/public/img/screenshots/task-details.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Task List\"/>\n\n##### Edit Task\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/codestudiohq/laravel-totem/blob/1.0/public/img/screenshots/edit-task.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Task List\"/>\n\n##### Artisan Command to view scheduled tasks\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/codestudiohq/laravel-totem/blob/1.0/public/img/screenshots/artisan.png?raw=true\" alt=\"Task List\"/>\n\n## Changelog\n\nImportant versions listed below.
