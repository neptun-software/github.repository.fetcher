You can validate the Python3 version that was installed on your OS by default by running : `python3 -V` -- If this returns a version equal to or higher than 3.8, you can skip this section!\n\nüî¥ Install Python v3.12:\n\n```\nyum -y install python3.12 python3.12-devel gcc\n```\n\nüî¥ Configure Python v3.12 for usage - there are a couple of options here:\n\n- Call Python3.12 directly from Diskover and do nothing to the system level **Python3 executable (Recommended)**.\n- **Symlink** Python3.12 in as the default Python3 executable on your OS.\n\n### Diskover Python Executable\n\nUsing this approach, we will simply execute Diskover with the full path to our Python3.12 version : `/usr/bin/python3.12`\n\nWhen we do a scan at the end of this install, we will use that full path instead of just `python3`\n\n### Symlink\n\n```sh\nunlink /usr/bin/python3\nln -s /usr/bin/python3.12 /usr/bin/python3\nwhich python3\npython3 -V\n```\n\nThe output of your `python3 -V` command should show a 3.12.X\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING!** Depending on your distributtion and version of Linux, modifying the system level Python3 executable version could have unintended consequences.\n\n## Diskover Installation\n\nNow that we've settled all the requirements to run the Diskover Community Edition, let's put the actual software in place. You'll want to get the code from this repository on the server you've been working on. Either by cloning this Git Repo directly on the server or pulling from our [Releases](https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-community/releases) page!\n\nüî¥ Uncompress the TAR:\n\n```\ntar -xvzf diskover-community-2.3.0.tar.gz\n```\n\nüî¥ Move the Source Code:\n\n```sh\ncd diskover-community-2.3.0/\ncp -a diskover /opt/\ncp -a diskover-web /var/www/\n```\n\nüî¥ Install the Python libraries:\n\n```sh\n/usr/bin/python3.12 -m ensurepip\n/usr/bin/python3.12 -m pip install -r /opt/diskover/requirements.txt\n```\n\nüî¥ Copy the Diskover-Web Nginx configuration:\n\n```sh\nmv /var/www/diskover-web/diskover-web.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/\nsystemctl restart nginx php-fpm\nsystemctl status nginx php-fpm\nchown -R nginx.nginx /var/www/diskover-web/\n```\n\n‚úèÔ∏è **NOTE!** You should now be able to hit your Diskover system at the IP address in the browser : `http://IP:8000` if this does not work initially and you get a 500 error, re-run that `chown` command above!\n\n## Execute a Scan Task\n\nWe have installed all of the necessary components for Diskover Community Edition. \n\nüî¥ Let's run a scan of a folder on our local system and ensure things are working properly:\n\n```\n/usr/bin/python3.12 /opt/diskover/diskover.py -i diskover-test /opt/diskover\n```\n\nüî¥ Now that your scan has completed.. Let's view the contents! \n\n- Go Back to Diskover Web `http://IP:8000`\n- Click the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** Icon in the Top-Right Corner\n- Choose **Indices**\n- Select the `diskover-test` Index and Choose `Save Selection`\n- Click the **Dashboard** or **üìÅ File Search** Icon in the Top-Left Corner\n\nYou've now successfully installed the Diskover Community Edition v2.3.X!\n\n## License\n\nThe Community Edition is free to use for an unlimited time and operates without the need for license keys, subject to the terms of the [Apache License](https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-community/blob/master/LICENSE)\n\n## Community Support\n\nIf you have any questions feel free to reach out on our Community Slack Organization - [Diskover Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/diskoverworkspace/shared_invite/zt-2up4tjux2-eZYt1OFgCeA3kSFQfsU93A).\n\nPlease note that Diskover doesn't offer dedicated support for the free Community Edition.\n\n## Feature Upgrade Information\n\n- If you are a **home user**, the Community Edition is your best option as it is free to use for an unlimited time, and offers features to find and organize your data. The Diskover‚Äôs [subscription plans](https://diskoverdata.com/platform/features/) are designed for businesses, offering advanced features that exceed the budget of most home users.\n\n- If you are a **business** trying out Diskover, please [contact us](https://diskoverdata.com/contact/) if would like to have more information regarding our [subscription options](https://diskoverdata.com/platform/features/).\n  \n"

Using Diskover, you are able to more effectively search and organize files and system administrators are able to manage storage infrastructure, efficiently provision storage, monitor and report on storage usage and effectively make decisions about new infrastructure purchases.\n\nAs the amount of file data generated by businesses continues to expand, the stress on expensive storage infrastructure, users and system administrators and IT budgets continues to grow.\n\nUsing Diskover, users can identify old and unused files and give better insights into data change, file duplication and wasted space. Diskover supports crawling local file-systems, crawling NFS/SMB, cloud storage, etc. Plugins can be used for adding additional metadata.\n\nDiskover runs on Linux, macOS and Windows 10 and is written in Python. Diskover's web app, diskover-web, is written in PHP, Javascript, HTML5 and CSS.\n\n## Diskover Interface\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n<img width=\"366\" height=\"234\" src=\"https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-docs/blob/main/source_files/images/diskover_ce_v2-3_dashboard.png\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"2\" alt=\"diskover-web screenshot 1\">\n<img width=\"366\" height=\"234\" src=\"https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-docs/blob/main/source_files/images/diskover_ce_v2-3_search_page.png\" hspace=\"5\" vspace=\"2\" alt=\"diskover-web screenshot 2\">\n</p>\n\n## News & Updates\n\n- Diskover 2.3.0 Community Edition - Released in August 2024\n- Diskover Version 1.X is EOL and no longer supported\n\n## Install & User Guides\n\nSee the [Install Guide](https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-community/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for Community Edition & [Read the Docs](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/) for more documentation on how to use Diskover.\n\n## Changelogs\n\n[Changelogs](https://docs.diskoverdata.com/diskover_changelogs/)\n\n## Discussions & Support\n\nFor discussions or support on Diskover join the [Diskover Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/diskoverworkspace/shared_invite/zt-2up4tjux2-eZYt1OFgCeA3kSFQfsU93A).\n\n## Bugs\n\nFor bugs about the Diskover Community Edition, please use the [Issues Page](https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-community/issues).\n\n## Security\n\nSee the [Security File](https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-community/blob/master/SECURITY.md).\n\n## License\n\nSee the [License File](https://github.com/diskoverdata/diskover-community/blob/master/LICENSE).  \n"
