There are plenty of people that follow [the StackOverflow tag \"backpack-for-laravel\"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/backpack-for-laravel) and are glad to help you out. Post your question there and please include:\n- (A) what you did\n- (B) what you expected to happen\n- (C) what happened\n- (D) what have you already tried to fix it?\n\n# Idea for a new feature?\n\n**[Open an issue](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/crud) and tell the community you are willing to submit a PR.** We usually end up with better solutions when we talk about it and everybody pitches in with their opinion. Plus, some features might be better presented as a separate package, a tutorial or a code snippet.\n\nPR Rules:\n\n- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.\n\n- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](http://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer). It's ok to push non-PSR-2 code, but know that [StyleCI](https://styleci.io/) will convert it after the merge. \n\n# Discovered a bug?\n\n**Step 1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/crud).** Please include:\n- (A) what you did\n- (B) what you expected to happen\n- (C) what happened\n- (D) what have you already tried to fix it?\n\n**Step 2. Submit a PR.** \nIf you have a solution for it and want to help, you can submit a Pull Request. Tell us you are willing to do that. It takes a little more time from you, but:\n- your fix is guaranteed to be merged a lot faster;\n- you'll become one of the Backpack contributors; [welcome to the party! :-)](https://media.giphy.com/media/l0MYt5jPR6QX5pnqM/giphy.gif);\n- you'll not just be helping yourself and the maintainers of Backpack, you'd be helping thousands of Backpack developers;\n\nIf you've never submitted a PR before, don't worry, it's not that difficult. Read [this tutorial](https://mattstauffer.com/blog/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-github-project-using-your-own-fork) and the rules above. I promise, you'll enjoy sending PRs after a while :-)\n\n\n# Want to help out?\n\nThank you, thank you, thank you! You can:\n- [add a StackOverflow filter](https://stackexchange.com/filters) to receive emails for backpack-for-laravel questions;\n- [install Gitter](https://gitter.im/BackpackForLaravel/Lobby) and help people out in real-time;\n- [star Backpack\\CRUD on GitHub](https://github.com/laravel-backpack/crud) so the repository can get more views;\n- [purchase a commercial license](https://www.backpackforlaravel.com/commercial-license/form), if you use Backpack to make money;\n- ALL OF THE ABOVE. Groundbreaking, I know, right? :-)\n\n# How to do those things\n\n### Pull Requests\n- There are no restrictions. Go ahead and submit your PR!\n\n### Issues\n- There are no restrictions. Go ahead and submit your issue!\n\n### Rules for writing effectively\n\nThis project stands by [The Whole Fruit Manifesto](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto).

They also love it because it's **ridiculously easy to override a functionality**. Generally, you just need to create a function (or blade file) with the right name. Yes, it can be _that_ easy.\n\n> Need more complex features? Purchase [Backpack PRO](https://backpackforlaravel.com/pricing), our closed-source paid add-on. It will add **5 more operations, 10 filters, 28 more fields, 6 more columns and 1 more widget**. For more info, see our [FREE vs PRO comparison table](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/features-free-vs-paid).

It will explain what you can do with Backpack, and let you choose a guide, depending on how you like to learn:\n- a 59-minute [\"Getting Started\" video course](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/getting-started-videos);\n- a 20-minute [\"Getting Started\" text course](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/getting-started-basics);\n- a 4-day, 5min/day [\"Getting Started\" drip email course](https://sendy.digitallyhappy.com/subscription?f=jlldf83763papd2Ifee0838Xs65TkXSvi17yEAuEnJiNj9ct53p5tikGHM4OkvpCeFUCbwcEYRt763ZSTILFXRWWEQ);\n\n## Install\n\nFor the current version (recommended):\n- [Install Backpack v6 on Laravel 10 & 11](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/installation);\n\nFor the previous versions (not recommended):\n- [Install Backpack v5 on Laravel 10, 9 or 8](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/5.x/installation)  - last feature update was 27th April 2023;\n- [Install Backpack 4.1 on Laravel 6, 7 or 8](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/4.1/installation) - last feature update was 1st Jan 2021;\n- [Install Backpack 4.0 on Laravel 5.8, 6 or 7](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/4.0/installation) - last feature update was 21st Apr 2020;\n- [Install Backpack 3.6 on Laravel 5.8 or 6.x](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/3.6/installation) - last feature update was 17th Sep 2019;\n- [Install Backpack 3.5 on Laravel 5.5, 5.6, 5.7](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/3.5/installation) - last feature update was 27th Feb 2019;\n- [Install Backpack 3.x on Laravel 5.4](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs/install-on-laravel-54) - last feature update was 27 Sep 2017;\n- [Install Backpack 3.x on Laravel 5.3](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs/installation-on-laravel-53) - last feature update was 02 Feb 2017;\n- [Install Backpack 3.x on Laravel 5.2](https://laravel-backpack.readme.io/docs/installation) - deprecated, lacks a lot of features;\n\n## Change Log\n\nPlease see [the Releases tab](https://github.com/Laravel-Backpack/CRUD/releases). \n\n## Security\n\n> It's _heavily_ recommended that you **[subscribe to the Backpack Newsletter](http://backpackforlaravel.com/newsletter)** so you can find out about any security updates, breaking changes or major features. We send an email about 1-2 emails per year. Sometimes less.\n\nIf you discover any security related issues, please email hello@backpackforlaravel.com instead of using the issue tracker. Alternatively, please disclose the issue on [huntr.dev](https://huntr.dev/) to also get a small bounty ($25-40).\n\n## License\n\nBackpack is open-core:\n- **Backpack CRUD is licensed under the [MIT License](LICENSE.md)** (open-source free software); it is perfect if you're building a simple admin panel - it's packed with features! It's also perfect if you're building an open-source project, the permissive license allows you to do whatever you want;\n- **Backpack PRO is licensed under our [EULA](https://backpackforlaravel.com/eula)**; it is a closed-source, paid add-on; [PRO](https://backpackforlaravel.com/products/pro) will be useful when your admin panel needs grow, because it adds A LOT of features for complex use cases (see our [FREE vs PRO comparison](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs/features-free-vs-paid));\n\n[Our documentation](https://backpackforlaravel.com/docs) covers both CRUD and PRO, with all the PRO features clearly labeled <span class=\"badge badge-pill badge-info\">PRO</span>. You do not _need_ PRO, that is just an add-on. But we're hoping you find it useful, and pay for it, to support the development of our open-core.\n\n<a name=\"versioning\"></a>\n## Versioning\n\nOur packages follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Here's what `major.minor.patch` (eg. `6.0.1`) means for us:\n- `major` - breaking changes, major new features, complete rewrites; released **once a year**, in the first quarter; it adds features that were previously impossible and upgrades our dependencies; upgrading is done by following our clear and detailed upgrade guides;\n- `minor` - new features, released in backwards-compatible ways; **every few months**; update takes seconds;\n- `patch` - bug fixes & small non-breaking changes; historically **every week**; update takes seconds;\n\nWhen we release a new Backpack\\CRUD version, all premium addons receive support for it the same day. When you buy a premium Backpack addon, you get access to not only _updates_, but also _upgrades_ (for 12mo), that means that... **any time you buy a Backpack addon, it is very likely that you're not only buying the _current_ version** (`v6` at the moment), **but also the upgrade to the _next version_** (`v7` for example).\n\n## Contributing Guidelines\n\nThis project stands by [The Whole Fruit Manifesto](https://github.com/the-whole-fruit/manifesto).

We've developed e-Commerce, e-Learning, ERPs, social networks, payment gateways and much more. We've worked on admin panels _so much_, that we've created one of the most popular packages for Laravel - just from making public what was repetitive in our projects.\n\nIf you are looking for a developer/team to help you build an admin panel on Laravel, look no further. You'll have a difficult time finding someone with more experience & enthusiasm for admin panels. This is _what we do_.

That's why it's a good idea for any project to be reasonably up-to-date. If we consider a security issue is something that affects our users, we'll email you.  Please **[subscribe to the Backpack Newsletter](http://backpackforlaravel.com/newsletter)** so you can find out about any security updates, breaking changes or major features. We only send an email 1-2 emails per year. Sometimes less.\n\n**Past security issues:**\n- 2022\n    - June - [Error Messages Not Escaped in Error Pages](https://backpackforlaravel.com/articles/news/we-recommend-you-fix-this-vulnerability)\n- 2021 \n    - March - [Security Issue If You Use SQL Server (May Affect <0.02% Backpack Projects)](https://backpackforlaravel.com/articles/news/possible-security-issue-especially-important-if-you-use-sql-server)\n- 2020 - none\n- 2019 - none\n- 2018 - none\n- 2017 - none\n- 2016 - none\n"
