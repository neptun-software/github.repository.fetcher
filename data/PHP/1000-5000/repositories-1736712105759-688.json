Bug was introduced in 3.2.1.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 4.1.2][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 4.2.2][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],\n  [sabre/uri 1.2.0][uri] and [sabre/xml 1.5.0][xml].\n\n\n3.2.1 (2017-01-28)\n------------------\n\n* #877: Fix for syncing large calendars when using the Sqlite PDO backend.\n  (@theseer).\n* #889 Added support for filtering vCard properties in the addressbook-query\n  REPORT (@DeepDiver1975).\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 4.1.2][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 4.2.2][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],\n  [sabre/uri 1.2.0][uri] and [sabre/xml 1.5.0][xml].\n\n\n3.2.0 (2016-06-27)\n------------------\n\n* The default ACL rules allow an unauthenticated user to read information\n  about nodes that don't have their own ACL defined. This was a security\n  problem.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 4.1.0][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 4.2.1][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],\n  [sabre/uri 1.1.0][uri] and [sabre/xml 1.4.2][xml].\n\n\n3.2.0-beta1 (2016-05-20)\n------------------------\n\n* #833: Calendars throw exceptions when the sharing plugin is not enabled.\n* #834: Return vCards exactly as they were stored if we don't need to convert\n  in between versions.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 4.1.0][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 4.2.1][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],\n  [sabre/uri 1.1.0][uri] and [sabre/xml 1.4.1][xml].\n\n\n3.2.0-alpha1 (2016-05-09)\n-------------------------\n\n* Database changes for CalDAV.

Run `./bin/migrateto32.php` for more info.\n* Support for WebDAV Resource Sharing, an upcoming standard.\n* Added support for sharing in the CalDAV PDO backend! Users can now invite\n  others to their calendar and give them read/read-write access!\n* #397: Support for PSR-3. You can now log exceptions with your favourite\n  psr3-compatible logging tool.\n* #825: Actual proper, tested support for PostgreSQL. We require version 9.5.\n* Removed database migration script for sabre/dav 1.7. To update from that\n  version you now first need to update to sabre/dav 3.1.\n* Removed deprecated function: `Sabre\\DAV\\Auth\\Plugin::getCurrentUser()`.\n* #774: Fixes for getting free disk space on Windows.\n* #803: Major changes in the sharing API. If you were using an old sabre/dav\n  sharing api, head to the website for more detailed migration notes.\n* #657: Support for optional auth using `{DAV:}unauthorized` and `{DAV:}all`\n  privileges. This allows you to assign a privilege to a resource, allowing\n  non-authenticated users to access it. For instance, this could allow you\n  to create a public read-only collection.\n* #812 #814: ICS/VCF exporter now includes a more useful filename in its\n  `Content-Disposition` header. (@Xenopathic).\n* #801: BC break: If you were using the `Href` object before, it's behavior\n  now changed a bit, and `LocalHref` was added to replace the old, default\n  behavior of `Href`. See the migration doc for more info.\n* Removed `Sabre\\DAVACL\\Plugin::$allowAccessToNodesWithoutACL` setting.\n  Instead, you can provide a set of default ACL rules with\n  `Sabre\\DAVACL\\Plugin::setDefaultAcl()`.\n* Introduced `Sabre\\DAVACL\\ACLTrait` which contains a default implementation\n  of `Sabre\\DAV\\IACL` with some sane defaults. We're using this trait all over\n  the place now, reducing the amount of boilerplate.\n* Plugins can now control the \"Supported Privilege Set\".\n* Added Sharing, ICSExport and VCFExport plugins to `groupwareserver.php`\n  example.\n* The `{DAV:}all` privilege is now no longer abstract, so it can be assigned\n  directly. We're using the `{DAV:}all` privilege now in a lot of cases where\n  we before assigned both `{DAV:}read` and `{DAV:}write`.\n* Resources that are not collections no longer support the `{DAV:}bind` and\n  `{DAV:}unbind` privileges.\n* Corrected the CalDAV-scheduling related privileges.\n* Doing an `UNLOCK` no longer requires the `{DAV:}write-content` privilege.\n* Added a new `getPrincipalByUri` plugin event. Allowing plugins to request\n  quickly where a principal lives on a server.\n* Renamed `phpunit.xml` to `phpunit.xml.dist` to make local modifications easy.\n* Functionality from `IShareableCalendar` is merged into `ISharedCalendar`.\n* #751: Fixed XML responses from failing `MKCOL` requests.\n* #600: Support for `principal-match` ACL `REPORT`.\n* #599: Support for `acl-principal-prop-set` ACL `REPORT`.\n* #798: Added an index on `firstoccurence` field in MySQL CalDAV backend. This\n  should speed up common calendar-query requests.\n* #759: DAV\\Client is now able to actually correctly resolve relative urls.\n* #671: We are no longer checking the `read-free-busy` privilege on individual\n  calendars during freebusy operations in the scheduling plugin. Instead, we\n  check the `schedule-query-freebusy` privilege on the target users' inbox,\n  which validates access for the entire account, per the spec.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 4.1.0][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 4.2.1][http], [sabre/event 3.0.0][evnt],\n  [sabre/uri 1.1.0][uri] and [sabre/xml 1.4.1][xml].\n\n\n3.1.5 (2018-10-19)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Creating a new calendar on some MySQL configurations caused an error.\n* #889 Added support for filtering vCard properties in the addressbook-query\n  REPORT (@DeepDiver1975).\n\n\n\n3.1.4 (2016-05-28)\n------------------\n\n* #834: Backport from `master`: Return vCards exactly as they were stored if\n  we don't need to convert in between versions.

The latter is going to be deprecated in 2.1,\n  so this makes it slightly easier to write code that works in both branches.\n* #497: Making sure we're initializing the sync-token field with a value after\n  migration.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 3.3.4][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 2.0.4][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.1][evnt].\n\n\n2.0.5 (2014-10-14)\n------------------\n\n* #514: CalDAV PDO backend didn't work when overriding the 'calendar changes'\n  database table name.\n* #515: 304 status code was not being sent when checking preconditions.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 3.3.3][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 2.0.4][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.1][evnt].\n\n\n2.0.4 (2014-08-27)\n------------------\n\n* #483: typo in calendars creation for PostgreSQL.\n* #487: Locks are now automatically removed after a node has been deleted.\n* #496: Improve CalDAV and CardDAV sync when there is no webdav-sync support.\n* Added: Automatically mapping internal sync-tokens to getctag.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 3.3.1][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 2.0.4][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.1][evnt].\n\n\n2.0.3 (2014-07-14)\n------------------\n\n* #474: Fixed PropertyStorage `pathFilter()`.\n* #476: CSP policy incorrect, causing stylesheets to not load in the browser\n  plugin.\n* #475: Href properties in the browser plugin sometimes included a backslash.\n* #478: `TooMuchMatches` exception never worked. This was fixed, and we also\n  took this opportunity to rename it to `TooManyMatches`.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 3.2.4][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 2.0.4][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.1][evnt].\n\n\n2.0.2 (2014-06-12)\n------------------\n\n* #470: Fixed compatibility with PHP < 5.4.14.\n* #467: Fixed a problem in `examples/calendarserver.php`.\n* #466: All the postgresql sample files have been updated.\n* Fixed: An error would be thrown if a client did a propfind on a node the\n  user didn't have access to.\n* Removed: Old and broken example code from the `examples/` directory.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 3.2.3][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 2.0.3][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.1][evnt].\n\n\n2.0.1 (2014-05-28)\n------------------\n\n* #459: PROPFIND requests on Files with no Depth header would return a fatal\n  error.\n* #464: A PROPFIND allprops request should not return properties with status\n  404.\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 3.2.2][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 2.0.3][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.0][evnt].\n\n\n2.0.0 (2014-05-22)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 3.2.2][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 2.0.3][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.0][evnt].\n* Fixed: #456: Issue in sqlite migration script.\n* Updated: MySQL database schema optimized by using more efficient column types.\n* Cleaned up browser design.\n\n\n2.0.0-beta1 (2014-05-15)\n-------------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with [sabre/vobject 3.2.2][vobj],\n  [sabre/http 2.0.3][http], and [sabre/event 1.0.0][evnt].\n* BC Break: Property updating and fetching got refactored. Read the [migration\n  document][mi20] for more information. This allows for creation of a generic\n  property storage, and other property-related functionality that was not\n  possible before.\n* BC Break: Removed `propertyUpdate`, `beforeGetProperties` and\n  `afterGetProperties` events.\n* Fixed: #413: Memory optimizations for the CardDAV PDO backend.\n* Updated: Brand new browser plugin with more debugging features and a design\n  that is slightly less painful.\n* Added: Support for the `{DAV:}supported-method-set` property server-wide.\n* Making it easier for implementors to override how the CardDAV addressbook\n  home is located.\n* Fixed: Issue #422 Preconditions were not being set on PUT on non-existent\n  files. Not really a chance for data-loss, but incorrect nevertheless.\n* Fixed: Issue #428: Etag check with `If:` fails if the target is a collection.\n* Fixed: Issues #430, #431, #433: Locks plugin didn't not properly release\n  filesystem based locks.\n* Fixed: #443. Support for creating new calendar subscriptions for OS X 10.9.2\n  and up.\n* Removed: `Sabre\\DAV\\Server::NODE_*` constants.\n* Moved all precondition checking into a central place, instead of having to\n  think about it on a per-method basis.\n* jCal transformation for calendar-query REPORT now works again.\n* Switched to PSR-4\n* Fixed: #175. Returning ETag header upon a failed `If-Match` or\n  `If-None-Match` check.\n* Removed: `lib/Sabre/autoload.php`. Use `vendor/autoload.php` instead.\n* Removed: all the rfc documentation from the sabre/dav source. This made the\n  package needlessly larger.\n* Updated: Issue #439. Lots of updates in PATCH support. The\n  Sabre_DAV_PartialUpdate_IFile interface is now deprecated and will be\n  removed in a future version.\n* Added: `Sabre\\DAV\\Exception\\LengthRequired`.\n\n1.9.0-alpha2 (2014-01-14)\n-------------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 3.1.3, sabre/http 2.0.1, and\n  sabre/event 1.0.0.\n* Added: Browser can now inspect any node, if ?sabreaction=browser is appended.\n* Fixed: Issue #178. Support for multiple items in the Timeout header.\n* Fixed: Issue #382. Stricter checking if calendar-query is allowed to run.\n* Added: Depth: Infinity support for PROPFIND request. Thanks Thomas Müller and\n  Markus Goetz.\n\n\n1.9.0-alpha1 (2013-11-07)\n-------------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 3.1.3, sabre/http 2.0.0alpha5, and\n  sabre/event 1.0.0.\n* BC Break: The CardDAV and CalDAV BackendInterface each have a new method:\n  getMultipleCards and getMultipleCalendarObjects. The Abstract and PDO backends\n  have default implementations, but if you implement that interface directly,\n  this method is now required.\n* BC Break: XML property classes now receive an extra argument in their\n  unserialize method ($propertyMap). This allows for recursively parsing\n  properties, if needed.\n* BC Break: Now using sabre/event for event emitting/subscription. For plugin\n  authors this means Server::subscribeEvent is now Server::on, and\n  Server::broadcastEvent is now Server::emit.\n* BC Break: Almost all core functionality moved into a CorePlugin.\n* BC Break: Most events triggered by the server got an overhaul.\n* Changed: Sabre\\HTTP now moved into a dedicated sabre/http package.\n* Added: Support for WebDAV-sync (rfc6578).\n* Added: Support for caldav-subscriptions, which is an easy way for caldav\n  clients to manage a list of subscriptions on the server.\n* Added: Support for emitting and receiving jCal instead of iCalendar for\n  CalDAV.\n* Added: BasicCallback authenticaton backend, for creating simple authentication\n  systems without having to define any classes.\n* Added: A $transactionType property on the server class. This can be used for\n  logging and performance measuring purposes.\n* Fixed: If event handlers modify the request body from a PUT request, an ETag\n  is no longer sent back.\n* Added: Sabre\\DAV\\IMultiGet to optimize requests that retrieve information\n  about lists of resources.\n* Added: MultiGet support to default CalDAV and CardDAV backends, speeding up\n  the multiget and sync reports quite a bit!\n* Added: ICSExportPlugin can now generate jCal, filter on time-ranges and expand\n  recurrences.\n* Fixed: Read-only access to calendars still allows the sharee to modify basic\n  calendar properties, such as the displayname and color.\n* Changed: The default supportedPrivilegeSet has changed. Most privileges are no\n  longer marked as abstract.\n* Changed: More elegant ACL management for CalendarObject and Card nodes.\n* Added: Browser plugin now marks a carddav directory as type Directory, and a\n  shared calendar as 'Shared'.\n* Added: When debugExceptions is turned on, all previous exceptions are also\n  traversed.\n* Removed: Got rid of the Version classes for CalDAV, CardDAV, HTTP, and DAVACL.\n  Now that there's no separate packages anymore, this makes a bit more sense.\n* Added: Generalized the multistatus response parser a bit more, for better\n  re-use.\n* Added: Sabre\\DAV\\Client now has support for complex properties for PROPPATCH.\n  (Issue #299).\n* Added: Sabre\\DAV\\Client has support for gzip and deflate encoding.\n* Added: Sabre\\DAV\\Client now has support for sending objects as streams.\n* Added: Deserializer for {DAV:}current-user-privilege-set.\n* Added: Addressbooks or backends can now specify custom acl rules when creating\n  cards.\n* Added: The ability for plugins to validate custom tokens in If: headers.\n* Changed: Completely refactored the Lock plugin to deal with the new If: header\n  system.\n* Added: Checking preconditions for MOVE, COPY, DELETE and PROPPATCH methods.\n* Added: has() method on DAV\\Property\\SupportedReportSet.\n* Added: If header now gets checked (with ETag) all the time. Before the dealing\n  with the If-header was a responsibility of the Locking plugin.\n* Fixed: Outbox access for delegates.\n* Added: Issue 333: It's now possible to override the calendar-home in the\n  CalDAV plugin.\n* Added: A negotiateContentType to HTTP\\Request. A convenience method.\n* Fixed: Issue 349: Denying copying or moving a resource into it's own subtree.\n* Fixed: SabreDAV catches every exception again.\n* Added: Issue #358, adding a component=vevent parameter to the content-types\n  for calendar objects, if the caldav backend provides this info.\n\n\n1.8.12-stable (2015-01-21)\n--------------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.7.\n* #568: Support empty usernames and passwords in basic auth.\n\n\n1.8.11 (2014-12-10)\n-------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.6.\n* Updated: MySQL database schema optimized by using more efficient column types.\n* #516: The DAV client will now only redirect to HTTP and HTTPS urls.\n\n\n1.8.10 (2014-05-15)\n-------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.4.\n* includes changes from version 1.7.12.\n\n\n1.8.9 (2014-02-26)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.3.\n* includes changes from version 1.7.11.\n\n\n1.8.8 (2014-02-09)\n------------------\n\n* includes changes from version 1.7.10.\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.3.\n\n1.8.7 (2013-10-02)\n------------------\n\n* the zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.3.\n* includes changes from version 1.7.9.\n\n\n1.8.6 (2013-06-18)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.0.\n* Includes changes from version 1.7.8.\n\n\n1.8.5 (2013-04-11)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.7.\n* Includes changes from version 1.7.7.\n\n\n1.8.4 (2013-04-08)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.7.\n* Includes changes from version 1.7.6.\n\n\n1.8.3 (2013-03-01)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.6.\n* Includes changes from version 1.7.5.\n* Fixed: organizer email-address for shared calendars is now prefixed with\n  mailto:, as it should.\n\n\n1.8.2 (2013-01-19)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.5.\n* Includes changes from version 1.7.4.\n\n\n1.8.1 (2012-12-01)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.5.\n* Includes changes from version 1.7.3.\n* Fixed: Typo in 1.7 migration script caused it to fail.\n\n\n1.8.0 (2012-11-08)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.5.\n* BC Break: Moved the entire codebase to PHP namespaces.\n* BC Break: Every backend package (CalDAV, CardDAV, Auth, Locks, Principals) now\n  has consistent naming conventions. There's a BackendInterface, and an\n  AbstractBackend class.\n* BC Break: Changed a bunch of constructor signatures in the CalDAV package, to\n  reduce dependencies on the ACL package.\n* BC Break: Sabre_CalDAV_ISharedCalendar now also has a getShares method, so\n  sharees can figure out who is also on a shared calendar.\n* Added: Sabre_DAVACL_IPrincipalCollection interface, to advertise support for\n  principal-property-search on any node.\n* Added: Simple console script to fire up a fileserver in the current directory\n  using PHP 5.4's built-in webserver.\n* Added: Sharee's can now also read out the list of invites for a shared\n  calendar.\n* Added: The Proxy principal classes now both implement an interface, for\n  greater flexibility.\n\n\n1.7.13 (2014-07-28)\n-------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.4.\n* Changed: Removed phing and went with a custom build script for now.\n\n\n1.7.12 (2014-05-15)\n-------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.4.\n* Updated: Issue #439. Lots of updates in PATCH support. The\n  Sabre_DAV_PartialUpdate_IFile interface is now deprecated and will be removed\n  in a future version.\n* Fixed: Restoring old setting after changing libxml_disable_entity_loader.\n* Fixed: Issue #422: Preconditions were not being set on PUT on non-existent\n  files. Not really a chance for data-loss, but incorrect nevertheless.\n* Fixed: Issue #427: Now checking preconditions on DELETE requests.\n* Fixed: Issue #428: Etag check with If: fails if the target is a collection.\n* Fixed: Issue #393: PATCH request with missing end-range was handled\n  incorrectly.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Exception_LengthRequired to omit 411 errors.\n\n\n1.7.11 (2014-02-26)\n-------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.3.\n* Fixed: Issue #407: large downloads failed.\n* Fixed: Issue #414: XXE security problem on older PHP versions.\n\n\n1.7.10 (2014-02-09)\n-------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue #374: Don't urlescape colon (:) when it's not required.\n* Fixed: Potential security vulnerability in the http client.\n\n\n1.7.9 (2013-10-02)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.3.\n* Fixed: Issue #365. Incorrect output when principal urls have spaces in them.\n* Added: Issue #367: Automatically adding a UID to vcards that don't have them.\n\n\n1.7.8 (2013-06-17)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.1.0.\n* Changed: Sabre\\DAV\\Client::verifyPeer is now a protected property (instead of\n  private).\n* Fixed: Text was incorrectly escaped in the Href and HrefList properties,\n  disallowing urls with ampersands (&) in them.\n* Added: deserializer for Sabre\\DAVACL\\Property\\CurrentUserPrivilegeSet.\n* Fixed: Issue 335: Client only deserializes properties with status 200.\n* Fixed: Issue 341: Escaping xml in 423 Locked error responses.\n* Added: Issue 339: beforeGetPropertiesForPath event.\n\n\n1.7.7 (2013-04-11)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.7.\n* Fixed: Assets in the browser plugins were not being served on windows\n  machines.\n\n\n1.7.6 (2013-04-08)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.7.\n* Fixed: vcardurl in database schema can now hold 255 characters instead of 80\n  (which is often way to small).\n* Fixed: The browser plugin potentially allowed people to open any arbitrary\n  file on windows servers (CVE-2013-1939).\n\n\n1.7.5 (2013-03-01)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.6.\n* Change: No longer advertising support for 4.0 vcards. iOS and OS X address\n  book don't handle this well, and just advertising 3.0 support seems like the\n  most logical course of action.\n* Added: ->setVerifyPeers to Sabre_DAV_Client (greatly resisting against it,\n  don't use this..).\n\n\n1.7.4 (2013-01-19)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.5.\n* Changed: To be compatible with MS Office 2011 for Mac, a workaround was\n  removed that was added to support old versions of Windows XP (pre-SP3).\n  Indeed!

Sending back HTTP/1.0 for requests with this version.\n\n\n1.7.2 (2012-11-08)\n------------------\n\n* The zip release ships with sabre/vobject 2.0.5.\n* Added: ACL plugin advertises support for 'calendarserver-principal-\n  property-search'.\n* Fixed: [#153] Allowing for relative http principals in iMip requests.\n* Added: Support for cs:first-name and cs:last-name properties in sharing\n  invites.\n* Fixed: Made a bunch of properties protected, where they were private before.\n* Added: Some non-standard properties for sharing to improve compatibility.\n* Fixed: some bugfixes in postgres sql script.\n* Fixed: When requesting some properties using PROPFIND, they could show up as\n  both '200 Ok' and '403 Forbidden'.\n* Fixed: calendar-proxy principals were not checked for deeper principal\n  membership than 1 level.\n* Fixed: setGroupMemberSet argument now correctly receives relative principal\n  urls, instead of the absolute ones.\n* Fixed: Server class will filter out any bonus properties if any extra were\n  returned. This means the implementor of the IProperty class can be a bit\n  lazier when implementing. Note: bug numbers after this line refer to Google\n  Code tickets. We're using github now.\n\n\n1.7.1 (2012-10-07)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: include path problem in the migration script.\n\n\n1.7.0 (2012-10-06)\n------------------\n\n* BC Break: The calendarobjects database table has a bunch of new fields, and a\n  migration script is required to ensure everything will keep working. Read the\n  wiki for more details.\n* BC Break: The ICalendar interface now has a new method: calendarQuery.\n* BC Break: In this version a number of classes have been deleted, that have\n  been previously deprecated. Namely: - Sabre_DAV_Directory (now:\n  Sabre_DAV_Collection) - Sabre_DAV_SimpleDirectory (now:\n  Sabre_DAV_SimpleCollection)\n* BC Break: Sabre_CalDAV_Schedule_IMip::sendMessage now has an extra argument.\n  If you extended this class, you should fix this method. It's only used for\n  informational purposes.\n* BC Break: The DAV: namespace is no longer converted to urn:DAV. This was a\n  workaround for a bug in older PHP versions (pre-5.3).\n* Removed: Sabre.includes.php was deprecated, and is now removed.\n* Removed: Sabre_CalDAV_Server was deprecated, and is now removed. Please use\n  Sabre_DAV_Server and check the examples in the examples/ directory.\n* Changed: The Sabre_VObject library now spawned into it's own project! The\n  VObject library is still included in the SabreDAV zip package.\n* Added: Experimental interfaces to allow implementation of caldav-sharing. Note\n  that no implementation is provided yet, just the api hooks.\n* Added: Free-busy reporting compliant with the caldav-scheduling standard. This\n  allows iCal and other clients to fetch other users' free-busy data.\n* Added: Experimental NotificationSupport interface to add caldav notifications.\n* Added: VCF Export plugin. If enabled, it can generate an export of an entire\n  addressbook.\n* Added: Support for PATCH using a SabreDAV format, to live-patch files.\n* Added: Support for Prefer: return-minimal and Brief: t headers for PROPFIND\n  and PROPPATCH requests.\n* Changed: Responsibility for dealing with the calendar-query is now moved from\n  the CalDAV plugin to the CalDAV backends. This allows for heavy optimizations.\n* Changed: The CalDAV PDO backend is now a lot faster for common calendar\n  queries.\n* Changed: We are now using the composer autoloader.\n* Changed: The CalDAV backend now all implement an interface.\n* Changed: Instead of Sabre_DAV_Property, Sabre_DAV_PropertyInterface is now the\n  basis of every property class.\n* Update: Caching results for principal lookups. This should cut down queries\n  and performance for a number of heavy requests.\n* Update: ObjectTree caches lookups much more aggresively, which will help\n  especially speeding up a bunch of REPORT queries.\n* Added: Support for the schedule-calendar-transp property.\n* Fixed: Marking both the text/calendar and text/x-vcard as UTF-8 encoded.\n* Fixed: Workaround for the SOGO connector, as it doesn't understand receiving\n  \"text/x-vcard; charset=utf-8\" for a contenttype.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Client now throws more specific exceptions in cases where we\n  already has an exception class.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_PartialUpdate. This plugin allows you to use the PATCH method\n  to update parts of a file.\n* Added: Tons of timezone name mappings for Microsoft Exchange.\n* Added: Support for an 'exception' event in the server class.\n* Fixed: Uploaded VCards without a UID are now rejected. (thanks Dominik!)\n* Fixed: Rejecting calendar objects if they are not in the\n  supported-calendar-component list.

(CVE-2013-1939).\n\n\n1.6.7 (2013-03-01)\n------------------\n\n* Change: No longer advertising support for 4.0 vcards. iOS and OS X address\n  book don't handle this well, and just advertising 3.0 support seems like the\n  most logical course of action.\n* Added: ->setVerifyPeers to Sabre_DAV_Client (greatly resisting against it,\n  don't use this..).\n\n\n1.6.6 (2013-01-19)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Backported a fix for broken XML serialization in error responses.\n  (Thanks @DeepDiver1975!)\n\n\n1.6.5 (2012-10-04)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Workaround for line-ending bug OS X 10.8 addressbook has.\n* Added: Ability to allow users to set SSL certificates for the Client class.\n  (Thanks schiesbn!).\n* Fixed: Directory indexes with lots of nodes should be a lot faster.\n* Fixed: Issue 235: E_NOTICE thrown when doing a propfind request with\n  Sabre_DAV_Client, and no valid properties are returned.\n* Fixed: Issue with filtering on alarms in tasks.\n\n\n1.6.4 (2012-08-02)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 220: Calendar-query filters may fail when filtering on alarms, if\n  an overridden event has it's alarm removed.\n* Fixed: Compatibility for OS/X 10.8 iCal in the IMipHandler.\n* Fixed: Issue 222: beforeWriteContent shouldn't be called for lock requests.\n* Fixed: Problem with POST requests to the outbox if mailto: was not lower\n  cased.\n* Fixed: Yearly recurrence rule expansion on leap-days no behaves correctly.\n* Fixed: Correctly checking if recurring, all-day events with no dtstart fall in\n  a timerange if the start of the time-range exceeds the start of the instance\n  of an event, but not the end.\n* Fixed: All-day recurring events wouldn't match if an occurence ended exactly\n  on the start of a time-range.\n* Fixed: HTTP basic auth did not correctly deal with passwords containing colons\n  on some servers.\n* Fixed: Issue 228: DTEND is now non-inclusive for all-day events in the\n  calendar-query REPORT and free-busy calculations.\n\n\n1.6.3 (2012-06-12)\n------------------\n\n* Added: It's now possible to specify in Sabre_DAV_Client which type of\n  authentication is to be used.\n* Fixed: Issue 206: Sabre_DAV_Client PUT requests are fixed.\n* Fixed: Issue 205: Parsing an iCalendar 0-second date interval.\n* Fixed: Issue 112: Stronger validation of iCalendar objects.

The Bynari outlook\n  plugin used much longer strings so this should improve compatibility.\n* Fixed: Added a workaround for a bug in KDE 4.8.2 contact syncing. See\n  https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=300047\n* Fixed: Issue 217: Sabre_DAV_Tree_FileSystem was pretty broken.\n\n\n1.6.2 (2012-04-16)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Sabre_VObject_Node::$parent should have been public.\n* Fixed: Recurrence rules of events are now taken into consideration when doing\n  time-range queries on alarms.\n* Fixed: Added a workaround for the fact that php's DateInterval cannot parse\n  weeks and days at the same time.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Server::$exposeVersion, allowing you to hide SabreDAV's\n  version number from various outputs.\n* Fixed: DTSTART values would be incorrect when expanding events.\n* Fixed: DTSTART and DTEND would be incorrect for expansion of WEEKLY BYDAY\n  recurrences.\n* Fixed: Issue 203: A problem with overridden events hitting the exact date and\n  time of a subsequent event in the recurrence set.\n* Fixed: There was a problem with recurrence rules, for example the 5th tuesday\n  of the month, if this day did not exist.\n* Added: New HTTP status codes from draft-nottingham-http-new-status-04.\n\n\n1.6.1 (2012-03-05)\n------------------\n\n* Added: createFile and put() can now return an ETag.\n* Added: Sending back an ETag on for operations on CardDAV backends. This should\n  help with OS X 10.6 Addressbook compatibility.\n* Fixed: Fixed a bug where an infinite loop could occur in the recurrence\n  iterator if the recurrence was YEARLY, with a BYMONTH rule, and either BYDAY\n  or BYMONTHDAY match the first day of the month.\n* Fixed: Events that are excluded using EXDATE are still counted in the COUNT=\n  parameter in the RRULE property.\n* Added: Support for time-range filters on VALARM components.\n* Fixed: Correctly filtering all-day events.\n* Fixed: Sending back correct mimetypes from the browser plugin (thanks\n  Jürgen).\n* Fixed: Issue 195: Sabre_CardDAV pear package had an incorrect dependency.\n* Fixed: Calendardata would be destroyed when performing a MOVE request.\n\n\n1.6.0 (2012-02-22)\n------------------\n\n* BC Break: Now requires PHP 5.3\n* BC Break: Any node that implemented Sabre_DAVACL_IACL must now also implement\n  the getSupportedPrivilegeSet method. See website for details.\n* BC Break: Moved functions from Sabre_CalDAV_XMLUtil to\n  Sabre_VObject_DateTimeParser.\n* BC Break: The Sabre_DAVACL_IPrincipalCollection now has two new methods:\n  'searchPrincipals' and 'updatePrincipal'.\n* BC Break: Sabre_DAV_ILockable is removed and all related per-node locking\n  functionality.\n* BC Break: Sabre_DAV_Exception_FileNotFound is now deprecated in favor of\n  Sabre_DAV_Exception_NotFound. The former will be removed in a later version.\n* BC Break: Removed Sabre_CalDAV_ICalendarUtil, use Sabre_VObject instead.\n* BC Break: Sabre_CalDAV_Server is now deprecated, check out the documentation\n  on how to setup a caldav server with just Sabre_DAV_Server.\n* BC Break: Default Principals PDO backend now needs a new field in the\n  'principals' table. See the website for details.\n* Added: Ability to create new calendars and addressbooks from within the\n  browser plugin.\n* Added: Browser plugin: icons for various nodes.\n* Added: Support for FREEBUSY reports!\n* Added: Support for creating principals with admin-level privileges.\n* Added: Possibility to let server send out invitation emails on behalf of\n  CalDAV client, using Sabre_CalDAV_Schedule_IMip.\n* Changed: beforeCreateFile event now passes data argument by reference.\n* Changed: The 'propertyMap' property from Sabre_VObject_Reader, must now be\n  specified in Sabre_VObject_Property::$classMap.\n* Added: Ability for plugins to tell the ACL plugin which principal plugins are\n  searchable.\n* Added: [DAVACL] Per-node overriding of supported privileges. This allows for\n  custom privileges where needed.\n* Added: [DAVACL] Public 'principalSearch' method on the DAVACL plugin, which\n  allows for easy searching for principals, based on their properties.\n* Added: Sabre_VObject_Component::getComponents() to return a list of only\n  components and not properties.\n* Added: An includes.php file in every sub-package (CalDAV, CardDAV, DAV,\n  DAVACL, HTTP, VObject) as an alternative to the autoloader. This often works\n  much faster.\n* Added: Support for the 'Me card', which allows Addressbook.app users specify\n  which vcard is their own.\n* Added: Support for updating principal properties in the DAVACL principal\n  backends.\n* Changed: Major refactoring in the calendar-query REPORT code. Should make\n  things more flexible and correct.\n* Changed: The calendar-proxy-[read|write] principals will now only appear in\n  the tree, if they actually exist in the Principal backend. This should reduce\n  some problems people have been having with this.\n* Changed: Sabre_VObject_Element_* classes are now renamed to\n  Sabre_VObject_Property. Old classes are retained for backwards compatibility,\n  but this will be removed in the future.\n* Added: Sabre_VObject_FreeBusyGenerator to generate free-busy reports based on\n  lists of events.\n* Added: Sabre_VObject_RecurrenceIterator to find all the dates and times for\n  recurring events.\n* Fixed: Issue 97: Correctly handling RRULE for the calendar-query REPORT.\n* Fixed: Issue 154: Encoding of VObject parameters with no value was incorrect.\n* Added: Support for {DAV:}acl-restrictions property from RFC3744.\n* Added: The contentlength for calendar objects can now be supplied by a CalDAV\n  backend, allowing for more optimizations.\n* Fixed: Much faster implementation of Sabre_DAV_URLUtil::encodePath.\n* Fixed: {DAV:}getcontentlength may now be not specified.\n* Fixed: Issue 66: Using rawurldecode instead of urldecode to decode paths from\n  clients. This means that + will now be treated as a literal rather than a\n  space, and this should improve compatibility with the Windows built-in client.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Exception_PaymentRequired exception, to emit HTTP 402 status\n  codes.\n* Added: Some mysql unique constraints to example files.\n* Fixed: Correctly formatting HTTP dates.\n* Fixed: Issue 94: Sending back Last-Modified header for 304 responses.\n* Added: Sabre_VObject_Component_VEvent, Sabre_VObject_Component_VJournal,\n  Sabre_VObject_Component_VTodo and Sabre_VObject_Component_VCalendar.\n* Changed: Properties are now also automatically mapped to their appropriate\n  classes, if they are created using the add() or __set() methods.\n* Changed: Cloning VObject objects now clones the entire tree, rather than just\n  the default shallow copy.\n* Added: Support for recurrence expansion in the CALDAV:calendar-multiget and\n  CALDAV:calendar-query REPORTS.\n* Changed: CalDAV PDO backend now sorts calendars based on the internal\n  'calendarorder' field.\n* Added: Issue 181: Carddav backends may no optionally not supply the carddata\n  in getCards, if etag and size are specified. This may speed up certain\n  requests.\n* Added: More arguments to beforeWriteContent and beforeCreateFile (see\n  WritingPlugins wiki document).\n* Added: Hook for iCalendar validation. This allows us to validate iCalendar\n  objects when they're uploaded. At the moment we're just validating syntax.\n* Added: VObject now support Windows Timezone names correctly (thanks mrpace2).\n* Added: If a timezonename could not be detected, we fall back on the default\n  PHP timezone.\n* Added: Now a Composer package (thanks willdurand).\n* Fixed: Support for \\N as a newline character in the VObject reader.\n* Added: afterWriteContent, afterCreateFile and afterUnbind events.\n* Added: Postgresql example files. Not part of the unittests though, so use at\n  your own risk.\n* Fixed: Issue 182: Removed backticks from sql queries, so it will work with\n  Postgres.\n\n\n1.5.9 (2012-04-16)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue with parsing timezone identifiers that were surrounded by quotes.\n  (Fixes emClient compatibility).\n\n\n1.5.8 (2012-02-22)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 95: Another timezone parsing issue, this time in calendar-query.\n\n\n1.5.7 (2012-02-19)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: VObject properties are now always encoded before components.\n* Fixed: Sabre_DAVACL had issues with multiple levels of privilege aggregration.\n* Changed: Added 'GuessContentType' plugin to fileserver.php example.\n* Fixed: The Browser plugin will now trigger the correct events when creating\n  files.\n* Fixed: The ICSExportPlugin now considers ACL's.\n* Added: Made it optional to supply carddata from an Addressbook backend when\n  requesting getCards.

(we used 'DATETIME').\n* Changed: Sending back HTTP 204 after a PUT request on an existing resource\n  instead of HTTP 200. This should fix Evolution CardDAV client compatibility.\n* Fixed: Issue 95: Parsing X-LIC-LOCATION if it's available.\n* Added: All VObject elements now have a reference to their parent node.\n\n\n1.5.3 (2011-09-28)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Sabre_DAV_Collection was missing from the includes file.\n* Fixed: Issue 152. iOS 1.4.2 apparantly requires HTTP/1.1 200 OK to be in\n  uppercase.\n* Fixed: Issue 153: Support for files with mixed newline styles in\n  Sabre_VObject.\n* Fixed: Issue 159: Automatically converting any vcard and icalendardata to\n  UTF-8.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_SimpleFile class for easy static file creation.\n* Added: Issue 158: Support for the CARDDAV:supported-address-data property.\n\n\n1.5.2 (2011-09-21)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: carddata and calendardata MySQL fields are now of type 'mediumblob'.\n  'TEXT' was too small sometimes to hold all the data.\n* Fixed: {DAV:}supported-report-set is now correctly reporting the reports for\n  IAddressBook.\n* Added: Sabre_VObject_Property::add() to add duplicate parameters to\n  properties.\n* Added: Issue 151: Sabre_CalDAV_ICalendar and Sabre_CalDAV_ICalendarObject\n  interfaces.\n* Fixed: Issue 140: Not returning 201 Created if an event cancelled the creation\n  of a file.\n* Fixed: Issue 150: Faster URLUtil::encodePath() implementation.\n* Fixed: Issue 144: Browser plugin could interfere with\n  TemporaryFileFilterPlugin if it was loaded first.\n* Added: It's not possible to specify more 'alternate uris' in principal\n  backends.\n\n\n1.5.1 (2011-08-24)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 137.

This is very\n  useful for people attempting to parse vcards.\n* BC Break: Adding parameters with the VObject libraries now overwrites the\n  previous parameter, rather than just add it. This makes more sense for 99% of\n  the cases.\n* BC Break: lib/Sabre.autoload.php is now removed in favor of\n  lib/Sabre/autoload.php.\n* Deprecated: Sabre_DAV_Directory is now deprecated and will be removed in a\n  future version.

This is a slight BC break.\n* Fixed: Issue 118: Lock tokens in If headers without a uri should be treated as\n  the request uri, not 'all relevant uri's.\n* Fixed: Issue 120: PDO backend was incorrectly fetching too much locks in cases\n  where there were similar named locked files in a directory.\n\n\n1.4.1-beta (2011-02-26)\n-----------------------\n\n* Fixed: Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_PDO returned too many locks.\n* Fixed: Sabre_HTTP_Request::getHeader didn't return Content-Type when running\n  on apache, so a few workarounds were added.\n* Change: Slightly changed CalDAV Backend API's, to allow for heavy\n  optimizations. This is non-bc breaking.\n\n\n1.4.0-beta (2011-02-12)\n-----------------------\n\n* Added: Partly RFC3744 ACL support.\n* Added: Calendar-delegation (caldav-proxy) support.\n* BC break: In order to fix Issue 99, a new argument had to be added to\n  Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_*::getLocks classes. Consult the classes for details.\n* Deprecated: Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_FS is now deprecated and will be removed\n  in a later version. Use PDO or the new File class instead.\n* Deprecated: The Sabre_CalDAV_ICalendarUtil class is now marked deprecated, and\n  will be removed in a future version.

To\n  use: Add the Sabre_CalDAV_ICSExportPlugin, and add ?export to your calendar\n  url.\n* Added: Plugins can now specify a pluginname, for easy access using\n  Sabre_DAV_Server::getPlugin().\n* Added: beforeGetProperties event.\n* Added: updateProperties event.\n* Added: Principal listings and calendar-access can now be done privately,\n  disallowing users from accessing or modifying other users' data.\n* Added: You can now pass arrays to the Sabre_DAV_Server constructor. If it's an\n  array with node-objects, a Root collection will automatically be created, and\n  the nodes are used as top-level children.\n* Added: The principal base uri is now customizable. It used to be hardcoded to\n  'principals/[user]'.\n* Added: getSupportedReportSet method in ServerPlugin class. This allows you to\n  easily specify which reports you're implementing.\n* Added: A '..' link to the HTML browser.\n* Fixed: Issue 99: Locks on child elements were ignored when their parent nodes\n  were deleted.\n* Fixed: Issue 90: lockdiscovery property and LOCK response now include a\n  {DAV}lockroot element.\n* Fixed: Issue 96: support for 'default' collation in CalDAV text-match filters.\n* Fixed: Issue 102: Ensuring that copy and move with identical source and\n  destination uri's fails.\n* Fixed: Issue 105: Supporting MKCALENDAR with no body.\n* Fixed: Issue 109: Small fixes in Sabre_HTTP_Util.\n* Fixed: Issue 111: Properly catching the ownername in a lock (if it's a string)\n* Fixed: Sabre_DAV_ObjectTree::nodeExist always returned false for the root\n  node.\n* Added: Global way to easily supply new resourcetypes for certain node classes.\n* Fixed: Issue 59: Allowing the user to override the authentication realm in\n  Sabre_CalDAV_Server.\n* Update: Issue 97: Looser time-range checking if there's a recurrence rule in\n  an event. This fixes 'missing recurring events'.\n\n\n1.3.0 (2010-10-14)\n------------------\n\n* Added: childExists method to Sabre_DAV_ICollection. This is an api break, so\n  if you implement Sabre_DAV_ICollection directly, add the method.\n* Changed: Almost all HTTP method implementations now take a uri argument,\n  including events. This allows for internal rerouting of certain calls. If you\n  have custom plugins, make sure they use this argument. If they don't, they\n  will likely still work, but it might get in the way of future changes.\n* Changed: All getETag methods MUST now surround the etag with double-quotes.\n  This was a mistake made in all previous SabreDAV versions. If you don't do\n  this, any If-Match, If-None-Match and If: headers using Etags will work\n  incorrectly. (Issue 85).\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Auth_Backend_AbstractBasic class, which can be used to easily\n  implement basic authentication.\n* Removed: Sabre_DAV_PermissionDenied class. Use Sabre_DAV_Forbidden instead.\n* Removed: Sabre_DAV_IDirectory interface, use Sabre_DAV_ICollection instead.\n* Added: Browser plugin now uses {DAV:}displayname if this property is\n  available.\n* Added: Cache layer in the ObjectTree.\n* Added: Tree classes now have a delete and getChildren method.\n* Fixed: If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since would be incorrect if the\n  date is an exact match.\n* Fixed: Support for multiple ETags in If-Match and If-None-Match headers.\n* Fixed: Improved baseUrl handling.\n* Fixed: Issue 67: Non-seekable stream support in ::put()/::get().\n* Fixed: Issue 65: Invalid dates are now ignored.\n* Updated: Refactoring in Sabre_CalDAV to make everything a bit more ledgable.\n* Fixed: Issue 88, Issue 89: Fixed compatibility for running SabreDAV on\n  Windows.\n* Fixed: Issue 86: Fixed Content-Range top-boundary from 'file size' to 'file\n  size'-1.\n\n\n1.2.5 (2010-08-18)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 73: guessBaseUrl fails for some servers.\n* Fixed: Issue 67: SabreDAV works better with non-seekable streams.\n* Fixed: If-Modified-Since and If-Unmodified-Since would be incorrect if\n  the date is an exact match.\n\n\n1.2.4 (2010-07-13)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 62: Guessing baseUrl fails when url contains a query-string.\n* Added: Apache configuration sample for CGI/FastCGI setups.\n* Fixed: Issue 64: Only returning calendar-data when it was actually requested.\n\n\n1.2.3 (2010-06-26)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 57: Supporting quotes around etags in If-Match and If-None-Match\n\n\n1.2.2 (2010-06-21)\n------------------\n\n* Updated: SabreDAV now attempts to guess the BaseURI if it's not set.\n* Updated: Better compatibility with BitKinex\n* Fixed: Issue 56: Incorrect behaviour for If-None-Match headers and GET\n  requests.\n* Fixed: Issue with certain encoded paths in Browser Plugin.\n\n\n1.2.1 (2010-06-07)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 50, patch by Mattijs Hoitink.\n* Fixed: Issue 51, Adding windows 7 lockfiles to TemporaryFileFilter.\n* Fixed: Issue 38, Allowing custom filters to be added to TemporaryFileFilter.\n* Fixed: Issue 53, ETags in the If: header were always failing.

This should reduce load due to less crawling\n* Added: Full support for the calendar-query report.\n* Added: More unittests.\n* Added: Support for complex property deserialization through the static\n  ::unserialize() method.\n* Added: Support for modifying calendar-component-set\n* Fixed: Issue 29: Added TIMEOUT_INFINITE constant\n\n\n1.1.1-alpha (2010-03-11)\n------------------------\n\n* Added: RFC5689 - Extended MKCOL support.\n* Fixed: Evolution support for CalDAV.\n* Fixed: PDO-locks backend was pretty much completely broken. This is 100%\n  unittested now.\n* Added: support for ctags.\n* Fixed: Comma's between HTTP methods in 'Allow' method.\n* Changed: default argument for Sabre_DAV_Locks_Backend_FS. This means a\n  datadirectory must always be specified from now on.\n* Changed: Moved Sabre_DAV_Server::parseProps to\n  Sabre_DAV_XMLUtil::parseProperties.\n* Changed: Sabre_DAV_IDirectory is now Sabre_DAV_ICollection.\n* Changed: Sabre_DAV_Exception_PermissionDenied is now\n  Sabre_DAV_Exception_Forbidden.\n* Changed: Sabre_CalDAV_ICalendarCollection is removed.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_IExtendedCollection.\n* Added: Many more unittests.\n* Added: support for calendar-timezone property.\n\n\n1.1.0-alpha (2010-03-01)\n------------------------\n\n* Note: This version is forked from version 1.0.5, so release dates may be out\n  of order.\n* Added: CalDAV - RFC 4791\n* Removed: Sabre_PHP_Exception. PHP has a built-in ErrorException for this.\n* Added: PDO authentication backend.\n* Added: Example sql for auth, caldav, locks for sqlite.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Browser_GuessContentType plugin\n* Changed: Authentication plugin refactored, making it possible to implement\n  non-digest authentication.\n* Fixed: Better error display in browser plugin.\n* Added: Support for {DAV:}supported-report-set\n* Added: XML utility class with helper functions for the WebDAV protocol.\n* Added: Tons of unittests\n* Added: PrincipalCollection and Principal classes\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Server::getProperties for easy property retrieval\n* Changed: {DAV:}resourceType defaults to 0\n* Changed: Any non-null resourceType now gets a / appended to the href value.\n  Before this was just for {DAV:}collection's, but this is now also the case for\n  for example {DAV:}principal.\n* Changed: The Href property class can now optionally create non-relative uri's.\n* Changed: Sabre_HTTP_Response now returns false if headers are already sent and\n  header-methods are called.\n* Fixed: Issue 19: HEAD requests on Collections\n* Fixed: Issue 21: Typo in Sabre_DAV_Property_Response\n* Fixed: Issue 18: Doesn't work with Evolution Contacts\n\n\n1.0.15 (2010-05-28)\n-------------------\n\n* Added: Issue 31: Hiding exception information by default. Can be turned on\n  with the Sabre_DAV_Server::$debugExceptions property.\n* Added: Moved autoload from lib/ to lib/Sabre/autoload.php. This is also the\n  case in the upcoming 1.2.0, so it will improve future compatibility.\n\n\n1.0.14 (2010-04-15)\n-------------------\n\n* Fixed: double namespace declaration in multistatus responses.\n\n\n1.0.13 (2010-03-30)\n-------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 40: Last references to basename/dirname\n\n\n1.0.12 (2010-03-30)\n-------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 37: Incorrect smultron regex in temporary filefilter.\n* Fixed: Issue 26: Workaround for broken GVFS behaviour with encoded special\n  characters.\n* Fixed: Issue 33: Converting ISO-8859-1 characters to UTF-8.\n* Fixed: Issue 39: Basename fails on non-utf-8 locales.\n* Added: More unittests.\n* Added: SabreDAV version to all error responses.\n* Added: URLUtil class for decoding urls.\n* Updated: Now using pear.sabredav.org pear channel.\n\n\n1.0.11 (2010-03-23)\n-------------------\n\n* Non-public release. This release is identical to 1.0.10, but it is used to\n  test releasing packages to pear.sabredav.org.\n\n\n1.0.10 (2010-03-22)\n-------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 34: Invalid Lock-Token header response.\n* Added: Issue 35: Adding SabreDAV version to HTTP OPTIONS responses.\n\n\n1.0.9 (2010-03-19)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 27: Entities not being encoded in PROPFIND responses.\n* Fixed: Issue 29: Added missing TIMEOUT_INFINITE constant.\n\n\n1.0.8 (2010-03-03)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 21: typos causing errors\n* Fixed: Issue 23: Comma's between methods in Allow header.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_ICollection interface, to aid in future compatibility.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Exception_Forbidden exception. This will replace\n  Sabre_DAV_Exception_PermissionDenied in the future, and can already be used to\n  ensure future compatibility.\n\n\n1.0.7 (2010-02-24)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 19 regression for MS Office\n\n\n1.0.6 (2010-02-23)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 19: HEAD requests on Collections\n\n\n1.0.5 (2010-01-22)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Fatal error when a malformed url was used for unlocking, in conjuction\n  with Sabre.autoload.php due to a incorrect filename.\n* Fixed: Improved unittests and build system\n\n\n1.0.4 (2010-01-11)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: needed 2 different releases. One for googlecode and one for pearfarm.\n  This is to retain the old method to install SabreDAV until pearfarm becomes\n  the standard installation method.\n\n\n1.0.3 (2010-01-11)\n------------------\n\n* Added: RFC4709 support (davmount)\n* Added: 6 unittests\n* Added: naturalselection. A tool to keep cache directories below a specified\n  theshold.\n* Changed: Now using pearfarm.org channel server.\n\n\n1.0.1 (2009-12-22)\n------------------\n\n* Fixed: Issue 15: typos in examples\n* Fixed: Minor pear installation issues\n\n\n1.0.0 (2009-11-02)\n------------------\n\n* Added: SimpleDirectory class. This class allows creating static directory\n  structures with ease.\n* Changed: Custom complex properties and exceptions now get an instance of\n  Sabre_DAV_Server as their first argument in serialize()\n* Changed: Href complex property now prepends server's baseUri\n* Changed: delete before an overwriting copy/move is now handles by server class\n  instead of tree classes\n* Changed: events must now explicitly return false to stop execution. Before,\n  execution would be stopped by anything loosely evaluating to false.\n* Changed: the getPropertiesForPath method now takes a different set of\n  arguments, and returns a different response. This allows plugin developers to\n  return statuses for properties other than 200 and 404. The hrefs are now also\n  always calculated relative to the baseUri, and not the uri of the request.\n* Changed: generatePropFindResponse is renamed to generateMultiStatus, and now\n  takes a list of properties similar to the response of getPropertiesForPath.\n  This was also needed to improve flexibility for plugin development.\n* Changed: Auth plugins are no longer included. They were not yet stable\n  quality, so they will probably be reintroduced in a later version.\n* Changed: PROPPATCH also used generateMultiStatus now.\n* Removed: unknownProperties event. This is replaced by the afterGetProperties\n  event, which should provide more flexibility.\n* Fixed: Only calling getSize() on IFile instances in httpHead()\n* Added: beforeBind event. This is invoked upon file or directory creation\n* Added: beforeWriteContent event, this is invoked by PUT and LOCK on an\n  existing resource.\n* Added: beforeUnbind event. This is invoked right before deletion of any\n  resource.\n* Added: afterGetProperties event. This event can be used to make modifications\n  to property responses.\n* Added: beforeLock and beforeUnlock events.\n* Added: afterBind event.\n* Fixed: Copy and Move could fail in the root directory. This is now fixed.\n* Added: Plugins can now be retrieved by their classname. This is useful for\n  inter-plugin communication.\n* Added: The Auth backend can now return usernames and user-id's.\n* Added: The Auth backend got a getUsers method\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_FSExt_Directory now returns quota info\n\n\n0.12.1-beta (2009-09-11)\n------------------------\n\n* Fixed: UNLOCK bug. Unlock didn't work at all\n\n\n0.12-beta (2009-09-10)\n----------------------\n\n* Updated: Browser plugin now shows multiple {DAV:}resourcetype values if\n  available.\n* Added: Experimental PDO backend for Locks Manager\n* Fixed: Sending Content-Length: 0 for every empty response. This improves NGinx\n  compatibility.\n* Fixed: Last modification time is reported in UTC timezone. This improves\n  Finder compatibility.\n\n\n0.11-beta (2009-08-11)\n----------------------\n\n* Updated: Now in Beta\n* Updated: Pear package no longer includes docs/ directory. These just contained\n  rfc's, which are publicly available. This reduces the package from ~800k to\n  ~60k\n* Added: generatePropfindResponse now takes a baseUri argument\n* Added: ResourceType property can now contain multiple resourcetypes.\n* Fixed: Issue 13.\n\n\n0.10-alpha (2009-08-03)\n-----------------------\n\n* Added: Plugin to automatically map GET requests to non-files to PROPFIND\n  (Sabre_DAV_Browser_MapGetToPropFind). This should allow easier debugging of\n  complicated WebDAV setups.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Property_Href class. For future use.\n* Added: Ability to choose to use auth-int, auth or both for HTTP Digest\n  authentication. (Issue 11)\n* Changed: Made more methods in Sabre_DAV_Server public.\n* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter plugin now intercepts HTTP LOCK requests to\n  non-existent files. (Issue 12)\n* Added: Central list of defined xml namespace prefixes. This can reduce\n  Bandwidth and legibility for xml bodies with user-defined namespaces.\n* Added: now a PEAR-compatible package again, thanks to Michael Gauthier\n* Changed: moved default copy and move logic from ObjectTree to Tree class\n\n0.9a-alpha (2009-07-21)\n----------------------\n\n* Fixed: Broken release\n\n0.9-alpha (2009-07-21)\n----------------------\n\n* Changed: Major refactoring, removed most of the logic from the Tree objects.\n  The Server class now directly works with the INode, IFile and IDirectory\n  objects. If you created your own Tree objects, this will most likely break in\n  this release.\n* Changed: Moved all the Locking logic from the Tree and Server classes into a\n  separate plugin.\n* Changed: TemporaryFileFilter is now a plugin.\n* Added: Comes with an autoloader script. This can be used instead of the\n  includer script, and is preferred by some people.\n* Added: AWS Authentication class.\n* Added: simpleserversetup.py script. This will quickly get a fileserver up and\n  running.\n* Added: When subscribing to events, it is now possible to supply a priority.\n  This is for example needed to ensure that the Authentication Plugin is used\n  before any other Plugin.\n* Added: 22 new tests.\n* Added: Users-manager plugin for .htdigest files. Experimental and subject to\n  change.\n* Added: RFC 2324 HTTP 418 status code\n* Fixed: Exclusive locks could in some cases be picked up as shared locks\n* Fixed: Digest auth for non-apache servers had a bug (still not actually tested\n  this well).\n\n\n0.8-alpha (2009-05-30)\n----------------------\n\n* Changed: Renamed all exceptions! This is a compatibility break. Every\n  Exception now follows Sabre_DAV_Exception_FileNotFound convention instead of\n  Sabre_DAV_FileNotFoundException.\n* Added: Browser plugin now allows uploading and creating directories straight\n  from the browser.\n* Added: 12 more unittests\n* Fixed: Locking bug, which became prevalent on Windows Vista.\n* Fixed: Netdrive support\n* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter filtered out too many files. Fixed some of the\n  regexes.\n* Fixed: Added README and ChangeLog to package\n\n\n0.7-alpha (2009-03-29)\n----------------------\n\n* Added: System to return complex properties from PROPFIND.\n* Added: support for {DAV:}supportedlock.\n* Added: support for {DAV:}lockdiscovery.\n* Added: 6 new tests.\n* Added: New plugin system.\n* Added: Simple HTML directory plugin, for browser access.\n* Added: Server class now sends back standard pre-condition error xml bodies.\n  This was new since RFC4918.\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_Tree_Aggregate, which can 'host' multiple Tree objects into\n  one.\n* Added: simple basis for HTTP REPORT method. This method is not used yet, but\n  can be used by plugins to add reports.\n* Changed: ->getSize is only called for files, no longer for collections. r303\n* Changed: Sabre_DAV_FilterTree is now Sabre_DAV_Tree_Filter\n* Changed: Sabre_DAV_TemporaryFileFilter is now called\n  Sabre_DAV_Tree_TemporaryFileFilter.\n* Changed: removed functions (get(/set)HTTPRequest(/Response)) from Server\n  class, and using a public property instead.\n* Fixed: bug related to parsing proppatch and propfind requests. Didn't show up\n  in most clients, but it needed fixing regardless. (r255)\n* Fixed: auth-int is now properly supported within HTTP Digest.\n* Fixed: Using application/xml for a mimetype vs. text/xml as per RFC4918 sec\n  8.2.\n* Fixed: TemporaryFileFilter now lets through GET's if they actually exist on\n  the backend. (r274)\n* Fixed: Some methods didn't get passed through in the FilterTree (r283).\n* Fixed: LockManager is now slightly more complex, Tree classes slightly less.\n  (r287)\n\n\n0.6-alpha (2009-02-16)\n----------------------\n\n* Added: Now uses streams for files, instead of strings. This means it won't\n  require to hold entire files in memory, which can be an issue if you're\n  dealing with big files. Note that this breaks compatibility for put() and\n  createFile methods.\n* Added: HTTP Digest Authentication helper class.\n* Added: Support for HTTP Range header\n* Added: Support for ETags within If: headers\n* Added: The API can now return ETags and override the default Content-Type\n* Added: starting with basic framework for unittesting, using PHPUnit.\n* Added: 49 unittests.\n* Added: Abstraction for the HTTP request.\n* Updated: Using Clark Notation for tags in properties. This means tags are\n  serialized as {namespace}tagName instead of namespace#tagName\n* Fixed: HTTP_BasicAuth class now works as expected.\n* Fixed: DAV_Server uses / for a default baseUrl.\n* Fixed: Last modification date is no longer ignored in PROPFIND.\n* Fixed: PROPFIND now sends back information about the requestUri even when\n  \"Depth: 1\" is specified.\n\n\n0.5-alpha (2009-01-14)\n----------------------\n\n* Added: Added a very simple example for implementing a mapping to PHP file\n  streams. This should allow easy implementation of for example a WebDAV to FTP\n  proxy.\n* Added: HTTP Basic Authentication helper class.\n* Added: Sabre_HTTP_Response class. This centralizes HTTP operations and will be\n  a start towards the creating of a testing framework.\n* Updated: Backwards compatibility break: all require_once() statements are\n  removed from all the files. It is now recommended to use autoloading of\n  classes, or just including lib/Sabre.includes.php. This fix was made to allow\n  easier integration into applications not using this standard inclusion model.\n* Updated: Better in-file documentation.\n* Updated: Sabre_DAV_Tree can now work with Sabre_DAV_LockManager.\n* Updated: Fixes a shared-lock bug.\n* Updated: Removed ?> from the bottom of each php file.\n* Updated: Split up some operations from Sabre_DAV_Server to\n  Sabre_HTTP_Response.\n* Fixed: examples are now actually included in the pear package.\n\n\n0.4-alpha (2008-11-05)\n----------------------\n\n* Passes all litmus tests!\n* Added: more examples\n* Added: Custom property support\n* Added: Shared lock support\n* Added: Depth support to locks\n* Added: Locking on unmapped urls (non-existent nodes)\n* Fixed: Advertising as WebDAV class 3 support\n\n\n0.3-alpha (2008-06-29)\n----------------------\n\n* Fully working in MS Windows clients.\n* Added: temporary file filter: support for smultron files.\n* Added: Phing build scripts\n* Added: PEAR package\n* Fixed: MOVE bug identified using finder.\n* Fixed: Using gzuncompress instead of gzdecode in the temporary file filter.\n  This seems more common.\n\n\n0.2-alpha (2008-05-27)\n----------------------\n\n* Somewhat working in Windows clients\n* Added: Working PROPPATCH method (doesn't support custom properties yet)\n* Added: Temporary filename handling system\n* Added: Sabre_DAV_IQuota to return quota information\n* Added: PROPFIND now reads the request body and only supplies the requested\n  properties\n\n\n0.1-alpha (2008-04-04)\n----------------------\n\n* First release!\n* Passes litmus: basic, http and copymove test.\n* Fully working in Finder and DavFS2.\n\nProject started: 2007-12-13\n\n[vobj]: http://sabre.io/vobject/\n[evnt]: http://sabre.io/event/\n[http]: http://sabre.io/http/\n[uri]: http://sabre.io/uri/\n[xml]: http://sabre.io/xml/\n[mi20]: http://sabre.io/dav/upgrade/1.8-to-2.0/\n[rfc6638]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6638 \"CalDAV Scheduling\"\n[rfc7240]: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7240\n[calendar-availability]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-daboo-calendar-availability-05\n"

          "content": "Contributing to sabre projects\n==============================\n\nWant to contribute to sabre/dav? Here are some guidelines to ensure your patch\ngets accepted.\n\n\nBuilding a new feature? Contact us first\n----------------------------------------\n\nWe may not want to accept every feature that comes our way. Sometimes\nfeatures are out of scope for our projects.\n\nWe don't want to waste your time, so by having a quick chat with us first,\nyou may find out quickly if the feature makes sense to us, and we can give\nsome tips on how to best build the feature.\n\nIf we don't accept the feature, it could be for a number of reasons. For\ninstance, we've rejected features in the past because we felt uncomfortable\nassuming responsibility for maintaining the feature.\n\nIn those cases, it's often possible to keep the feature separate from the\nsabre projects. sabre/dav for instance has a plugin system, and there's no\nreason the feature can't live in a project you own.\n\nIn that case, definitely let us know about your plugin as well, so we can\nfeature it on [sabre.io][4].\n\nWe are often on [IRC][5], in the #sabredav channel on freenode. If there's\nno one there, post a message on the [mailing list][6].\n\n\nCoding standards\n----------------\n\nsabre projects follow:\n\n1. [PSR-1][1]\n2. [PSR-4][2]\n\nsabre projects don't follow [PSR-2][3].\n\nIn addition to that, here's a list of basic rules:\n\n1. PHP 5.4 array syntax must be used everywhere. This means you use `[` and\n   `]` instead of `array(` and `)`.\n2. Use PHP namespaces everywhere.\n3. Use 4 spaces for indentation.\n4. Try to keep your lines under 80 characters. This is not a hard rule, as\n   there are many places in the source where it felt more sensible to not\n   do so. In particular, function declarations are never split over multiple\n   lines.\n5. Opening braces (`{`) are _always_ on the same line as the `class`, `if`,\n   `function`, etc. they belong to.\n6. `public` must be omitted from method declarations. It must also be omitted\n   for static properties.\n7. All files should use unix-line endings (`\\n`).\n8. Files must omit the closing php tag (`?>`).\n9. `true`, `false` and `null` are always lower-case.\n10. Constants are always upper-case.\n11. Any of the rules stated before may be broken where this is the pragmatic\n    thing to do.\n\n\nUnit test requirements\n----------------------\n\nAny new feature or change requires unit tests. We use [PHPUnit][7] for all our\ntests.\n\nAdding unittests will greatly increase the likelihood of us quickly accepting\nyour pull request. If unittests are not included though for whatever reason,\nwe'd still _love_ your pull request.\n\nWe may have to write the tests ourselves, which can increase the time it takes\nto accept the patch, but we'd still really like your contribution!\n\nTo run the unit tests locally:\n1. `composer install`\n2. start a PHP dev server in a separate terminal: `php -S localhost:8000 -t vendor/sabre/http/tests/www`\n3. `composer phpunit`\n\nRelease process\n---------------\n\nGenerally, these are the steps taken to do releases.\n\n1. Update the changelog. Every repo will have a `CHANGELOG.md` file. This file\n   should have a new version, and contain all the changes since the last\n   release. I generally run a `git diff` to figure out if I missed any changes.\n   This file should also have the current date.\n2. If there were BC breaks, this usually now means a major version bump.\n3. Ensure that `lib/DAV/Version.php` also matches this version number.\n4. Tag the release (Example `git tag 3.0.1` and push the tag (`git push --tags`)).\n5. (only for the sabre/dav project), create a zip distribution. Run\n   `php bin/build.php`.\n6. For the relevant project, go to GitHub and click the 'releases' tab. On this\n   tab I create the release with the relevant version. I also set the\n   description of the release to the same information of the changelog. In the\n   case of the `sabre/dav` project I also upload the zip distribution here.\n7. Write a blog post on sabre.io. This also automatically updates twitter.\n\n\n[1]: http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/\n[2]: http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/\n[3]: http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/\n[4]: http://sabre.io/\n[5]: irc://freenode.net/#sabredav\n[6]: http://groups.google.com/group/sabredav-discuss\n[7]: http://phpunit.de/\n"
