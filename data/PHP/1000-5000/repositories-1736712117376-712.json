          "content": "# Contributing\n\nFirst of all, **thank you** for contributing, **you are awesome**!\n\nThis project uses the fork & pull model of development. This means that in order to contribute\nyou need to submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).\n\nFor relatively small features, improvements and bug fixes ([example](https://github.com/sstalle/php7cc/commit/a9f40a363fab2b24506465f8849a82cb3542739a)),\nyou can submit pull requests without prior discussion. If you are planning on doing something that requires\na lot of changes and/or big refactoring ([example](https://github.com/sstalle/php7cc/commit/600f0f9848af1f5ab631114304e0683d512f532b)),\nplease open an issue first so it can be thoroughly considered and examined.\n\nHere are a few rules to follow in order to ease code reviews and discussions before\nmaintainers accept and merge your work:\n\n* [Follow the coding standards](#coding-standards)\n* [Run and update the tests](#running-and-updating-test-suite)\n* [Document your work](#documenting-your-work)\n\nPlease [rebase your branch](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)\nbefore submitting your Pull Request. One may ask you to [squash your\ncommits](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html)\ntoo. This is used to \"clean\" your Pull Request before merging it (we don't want\ncommits such as `fix tests`, `fix 2`, `fix 3`, etc.).\n\n\n## Coding standards\nYou MUST follow the [PSR-1](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/1/), \n[PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/2/) and\n[Symfony Coding Standard](http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html)\n(the only exception is that you must add single spaces around the concatenation operator).\nIf you don't know about any of them, you should really read the recommendations.\n\nTo fix your code according to the project standards, you can run\n[PHP-CS-Fixer tool](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) before commit: \n```bash\ncomposer cs\n```\n\n\n## Running and updating test suite\n* You MUST run the test suite.\n* You MUST write tests for PHP 7 compatibility errors.\n* You SHOULD write (or update) unit tests for any other non-trivial functionality.\n\nTest suite can be run using the following command:\n```bash\ncomposer test\n```\n\nIn most cases you should not write unit tests for compatibility violation checking visitors (like the ones found\nin ```src/NodeVisitor```). To test them, you should create a subfolder in ```test/resource```\nfolder and put a ```.test``` file in it. ```.test``` files have multiple sections separated by\n`-----`:\n\n1. First section is the description of the test suite. It can also contain PHP version constraint.\n2. Second section is the php code to be tested. It must be syntactically correct, unless it is an expression\n or a statement that had been correct in PHP 5 but is no longer correct in PHP 7. \n3. Third section is a newline separated array of messages and errors that\n should be emitted for the code from the previous section. Errors are instances of \n \\Exception and \\ParseException that are thrown during the checks. If there should be no messages\n and no errors, just leave a blank like in this section. Please keep in mind that test suites are\n not isolated, so you may get messages from other checkers in your test suite.\n\nSecond and third sections can be repeated one or more times. \n\nSome tests require a particular version of PHP. For example, the `yield` keyword\nhad been introduced in PHP 5.5, and tests containing it cannot be run on the lower versions.\nTo specify a version constraint for the test suite, add a new line of the following format\nto the first section:\n```\nPHP <operator><version>\n```\nOperator is one of the operators supported by `version_compare` function. Multiple space separated\nconstraints can be specified.\n\n\n## Documenting your work\nYou SHOULD write documentation for the code you add.\n\nAlso, please, write [commit messages that make\nsense](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).\nWhile creating your Pull Request on GitHub, you MUST write a description\nwhich gives the context and/or explains why you are creating it.\n\nThank you!\n"

          "content": "# PHP 7 Compatibility Checker(php7cc)\n#### Project status\n**The project is no longer supported**. Please consider using one of the following alternatives:\n\n* [phan](https://github.com/phan/phan)\n* [phpstan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan)\n\n#### Introduction\nphp7cc is a command line tool designed to make migration from PHP 5.3-5.6 to PHP 7 easier.\nIt searches for potentially troublesome statements in existing code and generates reports containing\nfile names, line numbers and short problem descriptions. It does not automatically fix\ncode to work with the new PHP version.\n\n#### What kind of problems does it detect?\nThere are 2 types of issues reported by php7cc:\n\n1. **Errors** that will definitely cause some kind of trouble (a fatal, a syntax error, a notice, etc.) on PHP 7. These are highlighted in red.\n2. **Warnings** that may or may not lead to logical errors. For example, statements that are legal in both PHP 5 and PHP 7, but change their behaviour between versions fall into this category. Warnings are highlighted in yellow.    \n\nA list of statements that may cause errors or warnings to be reported can be found in the [php-src repository](https://github.com/php/php-src/blob/PHP-7.0/UPGRADING).\n\n***Although php7cc tries to detect as much problems as accurately as possible, sometimes 100% reliable detection\nis very hard to achieve. That's why you should also run a comprehensive test suite for the code\nyou are going to migrate.***\n\n# Prerequisites\nTo run php7cc, you need php installed, minimum required version is 5.3.3. PHP 7 is supported,\n but files with syntax errors (for example, invalid numeric literals\n or invalid UTF-8 codepoint escape sequences) can't be processed. You will only get the\n warning message about the first syntax error for such files.\n \nYou may also need [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to install php7cc.\n\n# Installation\n#### Phar package\nYou can download a phar package for any stable version from the Github\n [releases](https://github.com/sstalle/php7cc/releases) page.\n\n#### Composer (globally)\nMake sure you have composer installed. Then execute the following command:\n```bash\ncomposer global require sstalle/php7cc\n```\nIt is also recommended to add global Composer binaries directory to your ```PATH``` environment\nvariable. The location of this directory depends on the operating system you use\n(see [Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#composer-home)\nif you want to know more). The following command should work for some *nix systems:\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/.config/composer/vendor/bin\"\n```\nThis makes it possible to run php7cc by entering just the executable name.\n\n#### Composer (locally, per project)\nMake sure you have composer installed. Then execute the following command from your project\ndirectory:\n```bash\ncomposer require sstalle/php7cc --dev\n```\n\n#### Docker image\nA docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ypereirareis/php7cc/)\n (contributed and maintained by [ypereirareis](https://github.com/ypereirareis)).\n\n# Usage\nExamples in this section assume that you have installed php7cc globally using composer\nand that you have added it's vendor binaries directory to your ```PATH```. If this is not\nthe case, just substitute ```php7cc``` with the correct path to the binary of phar package.\nFor local per project installation the executable will be located at ```<your_project_path>/vendor/bin/php7cc```.\n\n#### Getting help\nTo see the full list of available options, run:\n```bash\nphp7cc --help\n```\n\n#### Checking a single file or directory\nTo check a file or a directory, pass its name as the first argument. Directories are checked\nrecursively.\n \nSo, to check a file you could run:\n```bash\nphp7cc /path/to/my/file.php\n```\nTo check a directory:\n```bash\nphp7cc /path/to/my/directory/\n```\n\n#### Specifying file extensions to check\nWhen checking a directory, you can also specify a comma-separated list of file extensions that\nshould be checked. By default, only .php files are processed.\n \nFor example, if you want to check .php, .inc and .lib files, you could run:\n```bash\nphp7cc --extensions=php,inc,lib /path/to/my/directory/\n```\n\n#### Excluding file or directories\nYou can specify a list of absolute or relative paths to exclude from checking.\nRelative paths are relative to the checked directories.\n\nSo, if you want to exclude vendor and test directories, you could run:\n```bash\nphp7cc --except=vendor --except=/path/to/my/directory/test /path/to/my/directory/\n```\nIn this example, directories ```/path/to/my/directory/vendor```,  ```/path/to/my/directory/test``` and their contents will not be checked.\n\n#### Specifying minimum issue level\nIf you set a minimum issue level, only issues having that or higher severity level will be\nreported by `php7cc`. There are 3 issue levels: \"info\", \"warning\" and \"error\". \"info\" is\nreserved for future use and is the same as \"warning\".\n\nExample usage:\n```bash\nphp7cc --level=error /path/to/my/directory/\n```\nOnly errors, but not warnings will be shown in this case.\n\n#### Specifying output format\nThere are two output format available: `plain` and `json`.\n\n`output-format` command-line option, `o` in short form, can be used in order to change the output format:\n\n```bash\nphp7cc -o json /path/to/my/directory/ | json_pp\n```\n\nWould output:\n\n```json\n{\n   \"summary\" : {\n      \"elapsedTime\" : 0.0060338973999023,\n      \"checkedFiles\" : 3\n   },\n   \"files\" : [\n      {\n         \"errors\" : {},\n         \"name\" : \"/path/to/my/directory/myfile.php\",\n         \"warnings\" : [\n            {\n               \"text\" : \"String containing number in hexadecimal notation\",\n               \"line\" : 13\n            }\n         ]\n      },\n      {\n         \"warnings\" : [\n            {\n               \"line\" : 6,\n               \"text\" : \"Reserved name \\\"string\\\" used as a class, interface or trait name \"\n            }\n         ],\n         \"name\" : \"/path/to/my/directory/myfile.php\",\n         \"errors\" : {}\n      }\n   ]\n}\n\n```\n\n# Troubleshooting\n#### Maximum function nesting level of 100/250/N reached, aborting!\nYou should increase maximum function nesting level in your PHP or Xdebug config file like this:\n```cfg\nxdebug.max_nesting_level = 1000\n```\n\n#### Allowed memory size of N bytes exhausted \nYou should increase amount of memory available to CLI PHP scripts or disable PHP memory limit.\nThe latter can be done by setting the `memory_limit` PHP option to -1. This option can be set by editing\n`php.ini` or by passing a command-line argument to PHP executable like this:\n```bash\nphp -d memory_limit=-1 php7cc.php /path/to/my/directory\n```\n\n# Other useful links\n#### Contributing\nPlease read the [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n#### Credits\n[The list of contributors](https://github.com/sstalle/php7cc/graphs/contributors) is available on the corresponding\n Github page.\n"
