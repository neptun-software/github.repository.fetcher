          "content": "composer/semver\n===============\n\nSemver (Semantic Versioning) library that offers utilities, version constraint parsing and validation.\n\nOriginally written as part of [composer/composer](https://github.com/composer/composer),\nnow extracted and made available as a stand-alone library.\n\n[![Continuous Integration](https://github.com/composer/semver/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/composer/semver/actions/workflows/continuous-integration.yml)\n[![PHP Lint](https://github.com/composer/semver/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/composer/semver/actions/workflows/lint.yml)\n[![PHPStan](https://github.com/composer/semver/actions/workflows/phpstan.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/composer/semver/actions/workflows/phpstan.yml)\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nInstall the latest version with:\n\n```bash\ncomposer require composer/semver\n```\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* PHP 5.3.2 is required but using the latest version of PHP is highly recommended.\n\n\nVersion Comparison\n------------------\n\nFor details on how versions are compared, refer to the [Versions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md)\narticle in the documentation section of the [getcomposer.org](https://getcomposer.org) website.\n\n\nBasic usage\n-----------\n\n### Comparator\n\nThe [`Composer\\Semver\\Comparator`](https://github.com/composer/semver/blob/main/src/Comparator.php) class provides the following methods for comparing versions:\n\n* greaterThan($v1, $v2)\n* greaterThanOrEqualTo($v1, $v2)\n* lessThan($v1, $v2)\n* lessThanOrEqualTo($v1, $v2)\n* equalTo($v1, $v2)\n* notEqualTo($v1, $v2)\n\nEach function takes two version strings as arguments and returns a boolean. For example:\n\n```php\nuse Composer\\Semver\\Comparator;\n\nComparator::greaterThan('1.25.0', '1.24.0'); // 1.25.0 > 1.24.0\n```\n\n### Semver\n\nThe [`Composer\\Semver\\Semver`](https://github.com/composer/semver/blob/main/src/Semver.php) class provides the following methods:\n\n* satisfies($version, $constraints)\n* satisfiedBy(array $versions, $constraint)\n* sort($versions)\n* rsort($versions)\n\n### Intervals\n\nThe [`Composer\\Semver\\Intervals`](https://github.com/composer/semver/blob/main/src/Intervals.php) static class provides\na few utilities to work with complex constraints or read version intervals from a constraint:\n\n```php\nuse Composer\\Semver\\Intervals;\n\n// Checks whether $candidate is a subset of $constraint\nIntervals::isSubsetOf(ConstraintInterface $candidate, ConstraintInterface $constraint);\n\n// Checks whether $a and $b have any intersection, equivalent to $a->matches($b)\nIntervals::haveIntersections(ConstraintInterface $a, ConstraintInterface $b);\n\n// Optimizes a complex multi constraint by merging all intervals down to the smallest\n// possible multi constraint. The drawbacks are this is not very fast, and the resulting\n// multi constraint will have no human readable prettyConstraint configured on it\nIntervals::compactConstraint(ConstraintInterface $constraint);\n\n// Creates an array of numeric intervals and branch constraints representing a given constraint\nIntervals::get(ConstraintInterface $constraint);\n\n// Clears the memoization cache when you are done processing constraints\nIntervals::clear()\n```\n\nSee the class docblocks for more details.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\ncomposer/semver is licensed under the MIT License, see the LICENSE file for details.\n"
