Please be sure to file an issue first.\n\n## Pull request best practices\n\nWe want to accept your pull requests. Please follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: File an issue\n\nBefore writing any code, please file an issue stating the problem you want to solve or the feature you want to implement. This allows us to give you feedback before you spend any time writing code. There may be a known limitation that can't be addressed, or a bug that has already been fixed in a different way. The issue allows us to communicate and figure out if it's worth your time to write a bunch of code for the project.\n\n### Step 2: Fork this repository in GitHub\n\nThis will create your own copy of our repository.\n\n### Step 3: Add the upstream source\n\nThe upstream source is the project under the Box organization on GitHub. To add an upstream source for this project, type:\n\n```\ngit remote add upstream git@github.com:box/spout.git\n```\n\nThis will come in useful later.\n\n### Step 4: Create a feature branch\n\nCreate a branch with a descriptive name, such as `add-search`.\n\n### Step 5: Push your feature branch to your fork\n\nAs you develop code, continue to push code to your remote feature branch. Please make sure to include the issue number you're addressing in your commit message, such as:\n\n```\ngit commit -m \"Adding search (fixes #123)\"\n```\n\nThis helps us out by allowing us to track which issue your commit relates to.\n\nKeep a separate feature branch for each issue you want to address.\n\n### Step 6: Rebase\n\nBefore sending a pull request, rebase against upstream, such as:\n\n```\ngit fetch upstream\ngit rebase upstream/master\n```\n\nThis will add your changes on top of what's already in upstream, minimizing merge issues.\n\n### Step 7: Run the tests\n\nMake sure that all tests are passing before submitting a pull request.\n\n### Step 8: Fix code style\n\nRun the following command to check the code style of your changes:\n\n```\nvendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --config=.php_cs.dist --verbose --diff --dry-run --diff-format=udiff\n```\n\nThis will print a diff of proposed code style changes. To apply these suggestions, run the following command:\n\n```\nvendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --config=.php_cs.dist\n```\n\n### Step 9: Send the pull request\n\nSend the pull request from your feature branch to us. Be sure to include a description that lets us know what work you did.\n\nKeep in mind that we like to see one issue addressed per pull request, as this helps keep our git history clean and we can more easily track down issues.\n"

No bug fix and no additional features will be added.<br>\nYou won't be able to submit new issues or pull requests, and no additional features will be added\n\nYou can still use Spout as is in your projects though :)\n\n> Thanks to everyone who contributed to this project, from a typo fix to the new cool feature.<br>\n> It was great to see the involvement of this community!\n\n<br>\n\n## About\n\nSpout is a PHP library to read and write spreadsheet files (CSV, XLSX and ODS), in a fast and scalable way.\nUnlike other file readers or writers, it is capable of processing very large files, while keeping the memory usage really low (less than 3MB).\n\nJoin the community and come discuss Spout: [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/box/spout?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull documentation can be found at [https://opensource.box.com/spout/](https://opensource.box.com/spout/).\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n* PHP version 7.2 or higher\n* PHP extension `php_zip` enabled\n* PHP extension `php_xmlreader` enabled\n\n## Upgrade guide\n\nVersion 3 introduced new functionality but also some breaking changes. If you want to upgrade your Spout codebase from version 2 please consult the [Upgrade guide](UPGRADE-3.0.md). \n\n## Running tests\n\nThe `master` branch includes unit, functional and performance tests.\nIf you just want to check that everything is working as expected, executing the unit and functional tests is enough.\n\n* `phpunit` - runs unit and functional tests\n* `phpunit --group perf-tests` - only runs the performance tests\n\nFor information, the performance tests take about 10 minutes to run (processing 1 million rows files is not a quick thing).\n\n## Support\n\nSpout is no longer actively supported. You can still ask questions, or discuss about it in the chat room:<br>\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/box/spout?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\n\n## Copyright and License\n\nCopyright 2022 Box, Inc.

          "content": "Upgrading from 2.x to 3.0\n=========================\n\nSpout 3.0 introduced several backwards-incompatible changes. The upgrade from Spout 2.x to 3.0 must therefore be done with caution.\nThis guide is meant to ease this process.\n\nMost notable changes\n--------------------\nIn 2.x, styles were applied per row; it was therefore impossible to apply different styles to cells in the same row.\nWith the 3.0 version, this is now possible: each cell can have its own style.\n\nSpout 3.0 tries to enforce better typing. For instance, instead of using/returning generic arrays, Spout now makes use of specific `Row` and `Cell` objects that can encapsulate more data such as type, style, value.\n\nFinally, **_Spout 3.2 only supports PHP 7.2 and above_**, as other PHP versions are no longer supported by the community.\n\nReader changes\n--------------\nCreating a reader should now be done through the Reader `ReaderEntityFactory`, instead of using the `ReaderFactory`.\nAlso, the `ReaderFactory::create($type)` method was removed and replaced by methods for each reader:\n```php\nuse Box\\Spout\\Reader\\Common\\Creator\\ReaderEntityFactory; // namespace is no longer \"Box\\Spout\\Reader\"\n...\n$reader = ReaderEntityFactory::createXLSXReader(); // replaces ReaderFactory::create(Type::XLSX)\n$reader = ReaderEntityFactory::createCSVReader();  // replaces ReaderFactory::create(Type::CSV)\n$reader = ReaderEntityFactory::createODSReader();  // replaces ReaderFactory::create(Type::ODS)\n```\n\nWhen iterating over the spreadsheet rows, Spout now returns `Row` objects, instead of an array containing row values. Accessing the row values should now be done this way:\n```php\n...\nforeach ($reader->getSheetIterator() as $sheet) {\n    foreach ($sheet->getRowIterator() as $row) { // $row is a \"Row\" object, not an array\n        $rowAsArray = $row->toArray();  // this is the 2.x equivalent\n        // OR\n        $cellsArray = $row->getCells(); // this can be used to get access to cells' details\n        ... \n    }\n}\n```\n\nWriter changes\n--------------\nWriter creation follows the same change as the reader. It should now be done through the Writer `WriterEntityFactory`, instead of using the `WriterFactory`.\nAlso, the `WriterFactory::create($type)` method was removed and replaced by methods for each writer:\n\n```php\nuse Box\\Spout\\Writer\\Common\\Creator\\WriterEntityFactory; // namespace is no longer \"Box\\Spout\\Writer\"\n...\n$writer = WriterEntityFactory::createXLSXWriter(); // replaces WriterFactory::create(Type::XLSX)\n$writer = WriterEntityFactory::createCSVWriter();  // replaces WriterFactory::create(Type::CSV)\n$writer = WriterEntityFactory::createODSWriter();  // replaces WriterFactory::create(Type::ODS)\n```\n\nAdding rows is also done differently: instead of passing an array, the writer now takes in a `Row` object (or an array of `Row`). Creating such objects can easily be done this way:\n```php\n// Adding a row from an array of values (2.x equivalent)\n$cellValues = ['foo', 12345];\n$row1 = WriterEntityFactory::createRowFromArray($cellValues, $rowStyle);\n\n// Adding a row from an array of Cell\n$cell1 = WriterEntityFactory::createCell('foo', $cellStyle1); // this cell has its own style\n$cell2 = WriterEntityFactory::createCell(12345, $cellStyle2); // this cell has its own style\n$row2 = WriterEntityFactory::createRow([$cell1, $cell2]);\n\n$writer->addRows([$row1, $row2]);\n```\n\nNamespace changes for styles\n-----------------\nThe namespaces for styles have changed. Styles are still created by using a `builder` class.\n\nFor the builder, please update your import statements to use the following namespaces:\n\n    Box\\Spout\\Writer\\Common\\Creator\\Style\\StyleBuilder\n    Box\\Spout\\Writer\\Common\\Creator\\Style\\BorderBuilder\n\nThe `Style` base class and style definitions like `Border`, `BorderPart` and `Color` also have a new namespace.\n\nIf your are using these classes directly via an import statement in your code, please use the following namespaces:\n\n    Box\\Spout\\Common\\Entity\\Style\\Border\n    Box\\Spout\\Common\\Entity\\Style\\BorderPart\n    Box\\Spout\\Common\\Entity\\Style\\Color\n    Box\\Spout\\Common\\Entity\\Style\\Style\n\nHandling of empty rows\n----------------------\nIn 2.x, empty rows were not added to the spreadsheet.\nIn 3.0, `addRow` now always writes a row to the spreadsheet: when the row does not contain any cells, an empty row is created in the sheet.\n"
