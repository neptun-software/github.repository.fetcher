It also provides additional features such as user groups and additional security features.\n\nSentry is a framework agnostic set of interfaces with default implementations, though you can substitute any implementations you see fit.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cartalyst/sentry.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cartalyst/sentry)\n\n![Bitdeli](https://d2weczhvl823v0.cloudfront.net/cartalyst/sentry/trend.png)\n\n### Features\n\nIt also provides additional features such as user groups and additional security features:\n\n- Configurable authentication (can use any type of authentication required, such as username or email)\n- Authorization\n- Activation of user *(optional)*\n- Groups and group permissions\n- \"Remember me\"\n- User suspension\n- Login throttling *(optional)*\n- User banning\n- Password resetting\n- User data\n- Interface driven - switch out your own implementations at will\n\n### Installation\n\nInstallation of Sentry is very easy. We've got a number of guides to get Sentry working with your favorite framework or on it's own:\n\n- [Install Sentry](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry#installation)\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- Use in [Laravel 4](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry#laravel-4)\n- Use in [FuelPHP 1](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry#fuelphp-1.x)\n- Use in [CodeIgniter 3](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry#codeigniter-3.0-dev)\n- Use [natively (through composer)](https://cartalyst.com/manual/sentry#native)\n\n### Upgrading\n\nCurrently, we do not have an upgrade method from Sentry 1, however we may be able to publish one before the stable release of Sentry 2.0. When upgrading between betas or release-candidates, please see [our changelog](https://github.com/cartalyst/sentry/blob/master/changelog.md).\n\n### Support\n\nWe offer support through [our help forums](http://help.cartalyst.com), on [IRC at #cartalyst](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=cartalyst) and through GitHub issues (bugs only).\n\nIf you like Sentry, consider [subscribing](http://www.cartalyst.com/pricing) to our [Arsenal](http://www.cartalyst.com/arsenal). It allows us to keep creating awesome software and afford to eat at night. Subscribers also get **priority support** with all of our packages, both free and subscriber-only.\n\n"
