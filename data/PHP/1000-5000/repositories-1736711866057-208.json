Pattern Lab is still, at its core, a prototyping tool focused on encouraging communication between content creators, designers, devs, and clients. It combines platform-agnostic assets, like the [Mustache](http://mustache.github.io/)-based patterns, with a PHP-based \"builder.\" Pattern Lab 2 introduces [the beginnings of an ecosystem](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-ecosystem-overview.html) that will allow teams to mix, match and extend Pattern Lab to meet their specific needs. It will also make it easier for the Pattern Lab team to push out new features. Pattern Lab Standard Edition for Mustache is just [one of the four PHP-based Editions currently available](http://patternlab.io/docs/installation.html).\n\n## Demo\n\nYou can play with a demo of the front-end of Pattern Lab at [demo.patternlab.io](http://demo.patternlab.io).\n\n## Requirements\n\nTo use the basic features of Pattern Lab to compile patterns, you must have **PHP 5.4+** installed. On Mac OS X Pattern Lab should work \"out of the box.\" If you're on Windows you can [download PHP from PHP.net](http://windows.php.net/download/). Pattern Lab comes with its own built-in web server.\n\nPattern Lab uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage project dependencies. It's required if you want to install Pattern Lab using Composer's `create-project` command or if you want to upgrade Pattern Lab in the future.\n\n## Installing\n\nThere are two methods for downloading and installing the Standard Edition for Mustache:\n\n* Download a pre-built project\n* Create a project based on this Edition with Composer\n\n### Download a pre-built project\n\nThe fastest way to get started with Pattern Lab's Standard Edition for Mustache is to download the latest pre-built version from the [releases page](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php/releases/latest).\n\n### Use Composer to create a project\n\nPattern Lab uses [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to manage project dependencies.\n\n#### 1. Install Composer\n\nPlease follow the directions for [installing Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx) on the Composer website. We recommend you [install it globally](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).\n\n#### 2. Install the Standard Edition for Mustache\n\nUse Composer's [`create-project` command](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#create-project) to install the Standard Edition for Mustache into a location of your choosing. To create a project do the following:\n\n1. In a terminal window navigate to where you want to install Pattern Lab\n2. Type `composer create-project pattern-lab/edition-mustache-standard patternlab2-example && cd $_`\n3. When prompted, type `1` to install the demo StarterKit\n\nThis will install the Standard Edition for Mustache along with the demo StarterKit into a directory called `patternlab2-example`. You will be automatically dropped into `patternlab2-example/` when the install is finished.\n\n**Note:** If you clone or download this repository and use `composer install` to install the project dependencies you'll need to type the following to install the demo StarterKit:\n\n    composer install-demo\n\nOtherwise you'll have a very bare set-up of Pattern Lab.\n\n## Get Up and Running\n\nAfter installing do the following to start and view Pattern Lab:\n\n1. In a terminal window navigate to the root of your project if you aren't there already\n2. Type `php core/console --server --with-watch`\n\nYou should now be able to open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see your generated site. Any changes you make in `./source/` will automatically rebuild your site and reload your browser.\n\nAs you get more comfortable with Pattern Lab you can [integrate it with a Gulp or Grunt workflow](http://patternlab.io/docs/advanced-integration-with-grunt.html) and drop some of the native Pattern Lab features like automatic browser reload. You can also check out [the list of plugins](http://patternlab.io/download.html).\n\n## More Documentation\n\nObviously Pattern Lab is deeper than the install process. [Check out the documentation](https://patternlab.io/docs/) to learn about how to use patterns, how to modify the data used to populate those patterns, and about some advanced features.\n\n## Migrating from Pattern Lab 1 to Pattern Lab 2\n\nPattern Lab 2 was a complete rewrite and reorganization of Pattern Lab 1. [Learn about the changes](http://patternlab.io/docs/changes-1-to-2.html). After installing the Standard Edition for Mustache do the following to migrate from Pattern Lab 1 to Pattern Lab 2:\n\n1. Copy `./source` from your old project to your new install\n2. Copy `./source/_patterns/00-atoms/00-meta/_00-head.mustache` to `./source/_meta/_00-head.mustache`\n3. Copy `./source/_patterns/00-atoms/00-meta/_01-foot.mustache` to `./source/_meta/_00-foot.mustache`\n4. Copy `./source/_data/annotations.js` to `./source/_annotations/annotations.js`\n\nEverything else should work without changes.\n\n## Need Pattern Lab 1?\n\nThe [source code for Pattern Lab 1](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php/releases/tag/v1.1.0) is still available for download.\n\n## Packaged Components\n\nThe Standard Edition for Mustache installs the following components:\n\n* `pattern-lab/core`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-php-core), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/core)\n* `pattern-lab/patternengine-mustache`: [documentation](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-mustache#mustache-patternengine-for-pattern-lab-php), [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternengine-php-mustache), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/patternengine-mustache)\n* `pattern-lab/plugin-reload`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/plugin-php-reload), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/plugin-reload)\n* `pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-assets-default)\n* `pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default`: [GitHub](https://github.com/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default), [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-mustache-default)\n\n## List All of the Available Commands and Their Options\n\nTo list all available commands type:\n\n    php core/console --help\n\nTo list the options for a particular command type:\n\n    php core/console --help --[command]\n"
