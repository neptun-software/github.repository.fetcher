In case you face any errors, googling it with a \"Laravel\" keyword will find you an asnwer faster than opening an issue. \n\nAfter cloning the repository, first create a .env from the example file:\n\n```\ncp .env.example .env\n```\n\nOpen \".env\" file with your desired editor and enter your services info.\nNow run below commands:\n\n```\ncomposer install\nphp artisan key:generate\nphp artisan migrate\nphp artisan passport:install\nnpm install\nnpm run production\n```\n\n### Create admin user\n\nTo create an admin user, run the below command from the root of the project\n\n```\nphp artisan db:seed --class=AdminUserSeeder\n```\n\nThe login details for the admin user is `admin` and `password`.\n\nAfter running the seeder, be sure to clear your redis cache, you should now be able to navigate to `/backend`"
