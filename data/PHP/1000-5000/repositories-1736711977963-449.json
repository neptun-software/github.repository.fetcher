This means we focus on squashing critical bugs before adding new features. Often, we can do both in tandem, but bugs will take priority over a new feature.\n- Pi-hole is open source and [powered by donations](https://pi-hole.net/donate/), and as such, we give our **free time** to build, maintain, and **provide user support** for this project. It would be extremely unfair for us to suffer abuse or anger for our hard work, so please take a moment to consider that.\n- Please be considerate towards the developers and other users when raising issues or presenting pull requests.\n- Respect our decision(s), and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.\n\n## Viability\n\nWhen requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether it might be useful to others. Open source projects are used by many people, who may have entirely different needs to your own. Think about whether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.\n\n## Procedure\n\n**Before filing an issue:**\n\n- Attempt to replicate and **document** the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.\n- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.\n- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.\n- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.\n\n**Before submitting a pull request:**\n\n- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.\n- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.\n\n## Technical Requirements\n\n- Submit Pull Requests to the **development branch only**.\n- Before Submitting your Pull Request, merge `development` with your new branch and fix any conflicts. (Make sure you don't break anything in development!)\n- Commit Unix line endings.\n- Please use the Pi-hole brand: **Pi-hole** (Take a special look at the capitalized 'P' and a low 'h' with a hyphen)\n- (Optional fun) keep to the theme of Star Trek/black holes/gravity.\n"

The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.\n\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, Compatible Licence refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.\n\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.\n\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n\n6.

However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\n9. Additional agreements\n\nWhile distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.\n\n10.

Can be accessed at `/admin/api.php`. With either no parameters or `/admin/api.php?summary` it returns the following JSON:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"domains_being_blocked\":243038,\n  \"dns_queries_today\":2385,\n  \"ads_blocked_today\":414,\n  \"ads_percentage_today\":17.35849,\n  \"unique_domains\":429,\n  \"queries_forwarded\":1537,\n  \"queries_cached\":434,\n  \"clients_ever_seen\":5,\n  \"unique_clients\":5,\n  \"status\":\"enabled\"\n}\n```\n\n[There are many more parameters](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pi-hole-api/1863), such as:\n\n- `type & version`\n- `summaryRaw`\n- `summary`\n- `overTimeData10mins`\n- `topItems`\n- `getQuerySources`\n- `getForwardDestinations`\n- `getQueryTypes`\n- `getAllQueries`\n- `enable`\n- `disable`\n- `recentBlocked`\n\nTogether with a token it is also possible to [enable and disable (also with a set timeout) blocking via the API](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/is-there-an-api-command-to-disable-ad-blocking/7693).\n\nThe API returns more information (in a slightly different format if `FTL` is running) - it supports a fall-back to the \"old\" PHP API if `FTL` is not running. Test the type and/or version of the API by using the parameter `type` and `version`.\n"

This is a universal limitation of <code>CNAME</code> records.</p>\n                <p>The reason for this is that Pi-hole will not send additional queries upstream when serving <code>CNAME</code> replies. As consequence, if you set a target that isn't already known, the reply to the client may be incomplete. Pi-hole just returns the information it knows at the time of the query. This results in certain limitations for <code>CNAME</code> targets,\n                for instance, only <i>active</i> DHCP leases work as targets - mere DHCP <i>leases</i> aren't sufficient as they aren't (yet) valid DNS records.</p>\n                <p>Additionally, you can't <code>CNAME</code> external domains (<code>bing.com</code> to <code>google.com</code>) successfully as this could result in invalid SSL certificate errors when the target server does not serve content for the requested domain.</p>\n                <button type=\"button\" id=\"btnAdd\" class=\"btn btn-primary pull-right\">Add</button>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\n        <div class=\"box\" id=\"recent-queries\">\n            <div class=\"box-header with-border\">\n                <h3 class=\"box-title\">\n                    List of local CNAME records\n                </h3>\n            </div>\n            <!-- /.box-header -->\n            <div class=\"box-body\">\n                <table id=\"customCNAMETable\" class=\"table table-striped table-bordered\" width=\"100%\">\n                    <thead>\n                        <tr>\n                            <th>Domain</th>\n                            <th>Target</th>\n                            <th>Action</th>\n                        </tr>\n                    </thead>\n                </table>\n                <button type=\"button\" id=\"resetButton\" class=\"btn btn-default btn-sm text-red hidden\">Clear Filters</button>\n            </div>\n            <!-- /.box-body -->\n        </div>\n        <!-- /.box -->\n    </div>\n</div>\n\n<script src=\"<?php echo fileversion('scripts/pi-hole/js/customcname.js'); ?>\"></script>\n\n<?php\nrequire 'scripts/pi-hole/php/footer.php';\n?>\n"
