          "content": "# opcache-gui\n\nA clean and responsive interface for Zend OPcache information, showing statistics, settings and cached files, and providing a real-time update for the information.\n\nThis interface uses ReactJS and Axios and is for modern browsers, and requires a minimum of PHP 7.1.\n\n## License\n\nMIT: http://acollington.mit-license.org/\n\n## Sponsoring this work\n\nIf you're able and would like to sponsor this work in some way, then that would be super awesome :heart:.  You can do that through the [GitHub Sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/amnuts) page.\n\nAlternatively, if you'd just like to give me a [shout-out on X (aka, Twitter)](https://twitter.com/acollington) to say you use it, then that'd be awesome, too!  (Any one else miss postcardware?)\n\n## Using the opcache-gui\n\n### Installing\n\nThere are two ways to getting started using this gui:\n\n#### Copy/clone this repo\n\nThe easiest way to start using the opcache-gui is to clone this repo, or simply copy/paste/download the `index.php` file to a location which your web server can load.  Then point your browser to that location, such as `https://www.example.com/opcache/index.php`.\n\n#### Install via composer\n\nYou can include the files with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) by running the command `composer require amnuts/opcache-gui`.\n\nOnce in your `vendor` directory, there are numerous ways in which you can use the interface.  For example, if you're using a framework such as Symfony or Laravel, you could load opcache-gui into a `Controller`.  Your requirements of setting it up within your framework of choice will vary, so it's not really possible to detail how to do that within this readme... but I have faith in your ability to figure it out!\n\nThe namespace used for the class is `Amnuts\\Opcache`, so once the dependency is in your `autoload.php` you can use the `\\Amnuts\\Opcache\\Service` class.  For example, you could do something like:\n\n```php\n<?php\n\nuse Amnuts\\Opcache\\Service;\n\n// assuming location of: /var/www/html/opcache.php\nrequire_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php';\n\n// specify any options you want different from the defaults, if any\n$options = [/* ... */];\n\n// setup the class and pass in your options, if you have any\n$opcache = (new Service($options))->handle();\n```\n\nThen you can create whatever view you want with which to show the opcache details.  Although there is a pretty neat React-based interface available for you in this repo.\n\nAlternatively, include `vendor/amnuts/opcache-gui/index.php` directly and this'll give you the same result as just copying/pasting the `index.php` somewhere.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// assuming location of: /var/www/html/opcache.php\n\nrequire_once __DIR__ . '/../vendor/amnuts/opcache-gui/index.php';\n```\n\nYou could even simply create a symlink to the `index.php` that's in the `vendor` directory:\n\n```shell script\nln -s /var/www/vendor/amnuts/opcache-gui/index.php /var/www/html/opcache.php\n```\n\nBasically, there are plenty of ways to get the interface up and running - pick whichever suits your needs.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe default configuration for the interface looks like this:\n\n```php\n$options = [\n    'allow_filelist'   => true,                // show/hide the files tab\n    'allow_invalidate' => true,                // give a link to invalidate files\n    'allow_reset'      => true,                // give option to reset the whole cache\n    'allow_realtime'   => true,                // give option to enable/disable real-time updates\n    'refresh_time'     => 5,                   // how often the data will refresh, in seconds\n    'size_precision'   => 2,                   // Digits after decimal point\n    'size_space'       => false,               // have '1MB' or '1 MB' when showing sizes\n    'charts'           => true,                // show gauge chart or just big numbers\n    'debounce_rate'    => 250,                 // milliseconds after key press to send keyup event when filtering\n    'per_page'         => 200,                 // How many results per page to show in the file list, false for no pagination\n    'cookie_name'      => 'opcachegui',        // name of cookie\n    'cookie_ttl'       => 365,                 // days to store cookie\n    'datetime_format'  => 'D, d M Y H:i:s O',  // Show datetime in this format\n    'highlight'        => [\n        'memory' => true,                      // show the memory chart/big number\n        'hits'   => true,                      // show the hit rate chart/big number\n        'keys'   => true,                      // show the keys used chart/big number\n        'jit'    => true                       // show the jit buffer chart/big number\n    ],\n    // json structure of all text strings used, or null for default\n    'language_pack'    => null\n];\n```\n\nIf you want to change any of the defaults, you can pass in just the ones you want to change if you're happy to keep the rest as-is.  Just alter the array at the top of the `index.php` script (or pass in the array differently to the `Service` class).\n\nFor example, the following would change only the `allow_reset` and `refresh_time` values but keep everything else as the default:\n\n```php\n$opcache = (new Service([\n    'refresh_time' => 2,\n    'allow_reset' => false\n]))->handle();\n```\n\nOr this example to give the tabs a slightly more \"piratey\" feel:\n\n```php\n$opcache = (new Service([\n    'language_pack' => <<<EOJSON\n{\n    \"Overview\": \"Crows nest\",\n    \"Cached\": \"Thar Booty\",\n    \"Ignored\": \"The Black Spot\",\n    \"Preloaded\": \"Ready an' waitin', Cap'n\",\n    \"Reset cache\": \"Be gone, yer scurvy dogs!\",\n    \"Enable real-time update\": \"Keep a weathered eye\",\n    \"Disable real-time update\": \"Avert yer eyes, sea dog!\"\n}\nEOJSON\n]))->handle();\n```\n\n\n### The interface\n\n#### Overview\n\nThe overview will show you all the core information.  From here you'll be able to see what host and platform you're running on, what version of OPcache you're using, when it was last reset, the functions and directives available (with links to the php.net manual), and all the statistics associated with the OPcache (number of hits, memory used, free and wasted memory, and more).\n\n![Screenshot of the Overview tab](http://amnuts.com/images/opcache/screenshot/overview-v3.3.0.png)\n\n#### Cached files\n\nAll the files currently in the cache are listed here with their associated statistics.\n\nYou can filter the results to help find the particular scripts you're looking for and change the way cached files are sorted.  From here you can invalidate the cache for individual files or invalidate the cache for all the files matching your search.\n\nIf you do not want to show the file list at all then you can use the `allow_filelist` configuration option; setting it to `false` will suppress the file list altogether.\n\nIf you want to adjust the pagination length you can do so with the `per_page` configuration option.\n\n![Screenshot of the Cached files list showing filtered results and pagination](http://amnuts.com/images/opcache/screenshot/cached-v3.png)\n\n#### Ignored files\n\nIf you have set up a list of files which you don't want cache by supplying an `opcache.blacklist_filename` value, then the list of files will be listed within this tab.\n\nIf you have not supplied that configuration option in the `php.ini` file then this tab will not be displayed.  If you set the `allow_filelist` configuration option to `false` then this tab will not be displayed irrespective of your ini setting.\n\n#### Preloaded files\n\nPHP 7.4 introduced the ability to pre-load a set of files on server start by way of the `opcache.preload` setting in your `php.ini` file.  If you have set that up then the list of files specifically pre-loaded will be listed within this tab.\n\nAs with the ignored file, if you have not supplied the ini setting, or the `allow_filelist` configuration option is `false`, then this tab will not be displayed.\n\n#### Reset the cache\n\nYou can reset the whole cache as well as force individual files, or groups of files, to become invalidated so that they will be cached again.\n\nResetting can be disabled with the use of the configuration options `allow_reset` and `allow_invalidate`.\n\n#### Real-time updates\n\nThe interface can poll every so often to get a fresh look at the opcache.  You can change how often this happens with the configuration option `refresh_time`, which is in seconds.\n\nWhen the real-time updates are active, the interface will automatically update all the values as needed.\n\nAlso, if you choose to invalidate any files or reset the cache it will do this without reloading the page, so the search term you've entered, or the page to which you've navigated do not get reset.  If the real-time update is not on then the page will reload on any invalidation usage.\n\n### Building it yourself\n\nThe interface has been designed around the principle of having just one file that anyone needs in order to get up and running.  To fulfil this, there's a template file, language files, jsx and css, which are all used in order to create the interface and they're brought together in the build process.\n\nThis build process will allow you to change the language used, how the required 3rd-party javascript libraries are included, the look and feel, or even the core components, should you wish.\n\n#### The build command\n\nTo run the build process, run the command `php ./build/build.php` from the repo root (you will need `nodejs` and `npm` already installed).  Once running, you should see the output something like:\n\n```\n🐢 Installing node modules\n🏗️ Building js and css\n🚀 Creating single build file\n🔗 Using remote js links from 'cloudflare'\n💯 Done!\n```\n\nThe build script will only need to install the `node_modules` once, so on subsequent builds it should be a fair bit quicker!\n\nThe build process will create a compiled css file at `build/interface.css` and the javascript of the interface will be in `build/interface.js`.  You could probably use both of these within your own frameworks and templating systems, should you wish.\n\n#### The style\n\nThe CSS for the interface is in the `build/_frontend/interface.scss` file.  Make changes there if you want to change the colours or formatting.\n\nIf you make any changes to the scss file then you'll need to run the build script in order to see the changes.\n\n#### The layout\n\nIf you want to change the interface itself, update the `build/_frontend/interface.jsx` file - it's basically a set of ReactJS components.  This is where you can change the widget layout, how the file list works, pagination, etc.\n\nRun the build script again should you make changes here. \n\n#### The javascript\n\nThe wrapper PHP template used in the build process, and that acts to pass various bits of data to the ReactJS side of things, is located at `build/template.phps`.  If you wanted to update the version of ReactJS used, or how the wrapper html is structured (such as wanting to pass additional things to the ReactJS side of things), then this would be the file you'd want to update. \n\nThe interface requires a few 3rd-party js files to function correctly.  You have the option of being able to change where these are fetched (between CloudFare, JSDelivr, and Unpkg), or you can have js js completely local and in-line (for example, you have CSP policies in place and the remote urls are not whitelisted).\n\nIn order to change the location of the 3rd-party resources, use the `-r` or `--remote-js` option followed by either `cloudflare`, `jsdelivr`, or `unpkg`.  For example, if you wanted to use _jsdelivr_ then you'd run the build command like this: `php ./build/build.php -r jsdelivr`.  This defaults to `cloudflare`.\n\nIf you wanted to have the js in-line, then you can use the `-j` or `--local-js` flag when building, such as `php ./build/build.php -j`.  This will fetch the remote script files and embed the js into main `index.php` file.  If you want to build it again with remote files, run the command again without the flag.  Fetching the files will take your `-r` option into consideration if you provide it.\n\n#### The language\n\nThere's an old saying that goes, \"If you know more than one language you're multilingual, if you don't you're British.\"  Not only is that a damning indictment of the British mentality towards other languages, but also goes to explain why the UI has only so far been in English - because I am, for all my sins, British.\n\nHowever, it is now possible to build the interface with a different language.  Currently, thanks to contributors, French and Spanish are also supported.  If anyone else wants to contribute additional language packs, please submit a PR! \n\nIf the language pack is in the `build/_languages/` directory then you can use that with the `-l` or `--lang` flag.  For example, if there is a `fr.json` language pack then you can use `php ./build/build.php -l fr` in order to build with that language.\n\nThere have been a few composer scripts added to help with the building.  They are, `composer build`, `composer build-french`, and `composer build-spanish`.\n\nIf you want to create a language file then `build/_languages/example.json` contains all you need.  It's a simple json structure with the key being the English version which matches what's in the UI, and the value is what you're converting it to - which in the example file is just blank.  If a value is empty or the index doesn't exist for a translation, then it'll just use the English version.  This gives you the ability to replace some or all of the interface strings as you see fit.\n\nTo get started with a new language, copy the `example.json` to the language you want that doesn't already exist - for example, `pt-br.json` or `pirate.json`.  Then fill in the translations into the values.  Once done, rebuild with `php ./build/build.php -l pt-br` or `php ./build/build.php -l pirate`.\n\n## Releases\n\n**Version 3.5.5**\\\nAdded Spanish translations thanks to @cvc90 (PR#110)\n\n**Version 3.5.4**\\\nBetter handling of whether JIT is enabled or disabled.  Now also shows _why_ it might be disabled even if you have the setting turned on.  The interface also disables the graph and memory stats correctly for JIT if it's disabled for any reason.\n\n**Version 3.5.3**\\\nWorked around some inconsistencies with links in the opcache documentation on php.net.\n\n**Version 3.5.2**\\\nRemoved some warnings for PHP 8.2 by dropping the `namespace` and `use` statements in the bundled `index.php` file.\n\n**Version 3.5.1**\\\nThis is just 3.5.0 but with corrected version tags to make Packagist happy and correct my mistake. :facepalm:\n\n**Version 3.5.0**\\\nThis version changes how the build process includes the javascript.\n* The `-j`/`--local-js` flag now embeds the javascript into the `index.php` file rather than having them as a separate files\n* The `-r`/`--remote-js` option has been added to allow you to decide where you get the 3rd-party files from (either when fetched locally or when added as remote script links), with `cloudflare`, `jsdelivr`, or `unpkg` being available options\n* CloudFlare has been set as the default for the remote js links\n* Added PR#94 from @M-Falken\n* Added PR#95 from @firassziedan\n\n**Version 3.4.0**\\\nThis version adds a little more info about the files in the cache, and allows a bit more configuration though the config and build script.\n* Added new `datetime_format` config option for flexible formatting of date/time values\n* Added the cached file's `modified` date/time to the output (when the file was either added or updated)\n* You can now build the `index.php` file with the js files local rather than remote urls\n* Added PR#83 from @Stevemoretz\n* Added the ability to build the interface with a different language.  If there's a language you want, and it's not there, please make a PR!\n* Added French language pack from @bbalet (PR#91)\n\n**Version 3.3.1**\\\nJust a few minor tweaks:\n* Added more of an explanation to the JIT value\n* Replaced date functions with \\DateTime and related classes\n* Updated README with troubleshooting and sponsorship info (and refined header levels)\n\n**Version 3.3.0**\\\nMostly added JIT information for PHP 8:\n* Added JIT buffer graph (optionally able to turn it off)\n* Added JIT information to the memory usage panel\n* Improved the JIT information shown in the directives\n* Fixed a long outstanding interface bug that allowed you to see the 'invalidate all' link even if invalidation option was `false`\n\nIf you want to enable JIT you have to put in a value for the [opcache.jit_buffer_size](https://www.php.net/manual/en/opcache.configuration.php#ini.opcache.jit-buffer-size) ini setting, else it's disabled by default.\n\nIf you're not using PHP 8, the interface will compensate and not show the additional JIT information.\n\n**Version 3.2.1**\\\nMinor maintenance release to:\n* Put back \"spaceship operator\" so PHP8 doesn't give deprecation warnings (must have been accidentally removed in a previous commit)\n* More refined axios usage when it comes to parameters\n* A little extra formatting on the opcache optimization levels\n\n**Version 3.2.0**\\\nUpdated ReactJS to latest and used minified versions and made slight improvement to sort option when no pagination is present.\n\n**Version 3.1.0**\\\nAdded the ability to sort the cached file list in a variety of ways.\n\n**Version 3.0.1**\\\nA minor update that will use http or https to get the javascript libraries, depending on what you're using.\n\n**Version 3.0.0**\\\nAlthough the interface looks mostly the same, it's had a complete re-write under the hood!  Some of the more notable changes are:\n* New namespace for the base service class which ensure composer compatibility\n* You can now paginate the cached files list to make it easier to render a large file list\n* Any scripts that have been preloaded are displayed in a tab\n* Any file paths ignored are displayed in a tab\n* You can now invalidate all the files matching a search in one go\n* jQuery has been removed; the whole interface is now using ReactJS and more modern javascript (so only modern browsers)\n* The CSS is now using SASS and is now much easier to change all the colours of the interface as you wish\n* SVGs are now used for any icons or gauge graphs\n* A more responsive interface when the 'enable real-time' is activated\n* Build script added to compile the ReactJS and SASS and put them into the single, simple, gui script\n\n**Version 2.5.4**\\\nRefined placement of initial css namespace to play nicely within Moodle plugin and possibly other systems.  Also tweaked some CSS.\n\n**Version 2.5.3**\\\nCSS class names have been added and style rules updated to use them.\n\n**Version 2.5.2**\\\nHotfix for the optimisation_level values that was put out in v2.5.1.\n\n**Version 2.5.1**\\\nA couple bug fixes and improvement on the optimisation level details.\n* optimisation_level now shows the levels of optimisations that will be performed rather than an abstract number\n* Fixed issue #43\n* Fixed issue #44\n\n**Version 2.5.0**\\\nAdded a new highlight chart to show the cached keys percentage with options to turn on/off the individual highlight graphs. \n\n**Version 2.4.1**\\\nMostly bug fixes\n* `memory_consumption` and `max_file_size` config settings now display as human-readable sizes\n* four missing directives have been included\n* better handling if `file_cache_only` is active\n* cache-control header set to not cache the page\n\n**Version 2.4.0**\\\nAdds cookie store for the real-time state allowing real-time to be activated on load.  Cookie name and TTL length can be adjusted in the config\n\n**Version 2.3.0**\\\nAdds information for interned strings and PHP 5.4 compatibility\n\n**Version 2.2.2**\\\nBrings in optimisations for the file listing when filtering\n\n**Version 2.2.1**\\\nHas the gauges now updating with the real-time pulse and a couple rounding issues fixed\n\n**Version 2.2.0**\\\nProvides the ability to turn on/off the file list (default is on)\n\n**Version 2.1.0**\\\nNow provides a much easier way to configure some options, be it the poll time, toggling the ability to reset the cache, real-time updates, etc. It also allows you to show the big values (memory usage and hit rate) as gauge graphs instead of big numbers.\n\n**Version 2.0.0**\\\nIntroduces the use of React.js provides the ability to seamlessly update more of the information in real-time (well, every five seconds by default) - so now the files as well as the overview get refreshed. There is an updated look, removing the gradients and going for a flatter feel. And the code in general has had an overhaul.\n\nReleases of the GUI are available at:\n\nhttps://github.com/amnuts/opcache-gui/releases/\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Use of PHP-FPM\n\nA number of people have questioned whether the opcache-gui is working on their instance of PHP-FPM, as the files shown don't appear to be everything that's cached, and that's different to what Apache might show.\n\nEssentially, that's expected behaviour.  And thanks to a great comment from contributor [Michalng](https://github.com/amnuts/opcache-gui/issues/78#issuecomment-1008015099), this explanation should cover the difference:\n\n> The interface can only show what it knows about the OPcache usage of its own OPcache instance, hence when it's accessed through Apache with mod_php, then it can only see the OPcache usage of that Apache webserver OPcache instance.  When it's accessed with classic CGI, it can only see itself being cached as a new PHP and OPcache instance is created, in which case OPcache itself often doesn't make sense.\n> \n> To be able to monitor and manage the OPcache for all web applications, all need to use the same FastCGI, i.e. PHP-FPM instance.\n> \n> In case of Apache, one then often needs to actively configure it to not use it's internal mod_php but send PHP handler requests to the shared PHP-FPM server via mod_proxy_fcgi, which also requires using the event MPM.  That is generally seen as the preferred setup nowadays, especially for high traffic websites.  This is because every single incoming request with MPM prefork + mod_php creates an own child process taking additional time and memory, while with event MPM and dedicated PHP-FPM server a (usually) already waiting handler thread is used on Apache and on PHP end, consuming nearly no additional memory or time for process spawning.\n\n\n### Making is compatible with PHP 7.0\n\nThe script requires PHP 7.1 or above.  I'm not tempted to downgrade the code to make it compatible with version 7.0, and hopefully most people would have upgraded by now. But I really do appreciate that sometimes people just don't have the ability to change the version of PHP they use because it's out of their control.  So if you're one of the unlucky ones, you can make the following changes to `index.php` (or `Service.php` and run the build script).  For the lines:\n\n```\npublic function getOption(?string $name = null)\n\npublic function getData(?string $section = null, ?string $property = null)\n\npublic function resetCache(?string $file = null): bool\n```\n\nIt'll just be a case of removing the `?` from each of the params.\n"
