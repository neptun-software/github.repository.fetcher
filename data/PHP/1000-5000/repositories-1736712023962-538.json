Details in [the config reference](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel/reference/config#theme).\n- **Configurable strategies**: You can now configure strategies individually, by using the _tuple_ format. A tuple is an array with two elements; the first is the strategy class, and the second is the settings array. For instance, you can configure response calls to only be used on certain endpoints:\n  ```php\n  'responses' => [\n      Strategies\\Responses\\UseResponseAttributes::class,\n      [\n        Strategies\\Responses\\ResponseCalls::class,\n        ['only' => ['GET *']],\n      ]\n  ],\n  ```\n- **Disable strategies per endpoint**: All strategies (including custom strategies) now support the `only` and `except` settings, allowing you to specify the routes you want them to be applied to, or the opposite.\n    ```php\n  'bodyParameters' => [\n      [\n        Strategies\\BodyParameters\\GetFromInlineValidator::class,\n        ['except' => ['POST /special-endpoint']],\n      ],\n      [\n        App\\Docs\\Strategies\\SomeCoolStuff::class,\n        ['only' => ['POST /cool-endpoint']],\n      ],\n  ],\n  ```\n- **Easily override returned values**: The new `override` strategy (also a tuple) is a simple way to say \"merge these values into the result of other strategies\", without having to write a whole strategy. A common use case is for adding headers:\n  ```php\n  'headers' => [\n      Strategies\\Responses\\UseHeaderAttribute::class,\n      [\n        'override',\n        [\n          'Content-Type' => 'application/json'],\n          'Accept' => 'application/json'],\n      ]\n  ],\n  ```\n- **Better route matching**: Route matching now works with both method and URL. Previously, in you could only specify route name or URL. Now you can also specify \"GET /path\", \"GET path\", or \"GET pa*\".\n\n# 4.27.0 (21 December 2023)\n## Modified\n- Allow Symfony v7\n\n# 4.26.0 (21 November 2023)\n## Added\n- Support specifying Example: null in annotations ([#755](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/755)\n- Include database-generated values in models created via factoryCreate ([#753](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/753)\n\n## Fixed\n- Parsing of nested fields in validation rules ([#749](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/749))\n- Enum values not displaying in nested objects ([#740](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/740))\n- Enum values not getting written to HTML ([#759](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/759))\n\n\n# 4.25.0 (30 September 2023)\n## Added\n- Support wildcards in `groups.order` (top-level only) ([#723](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/731))\n\n# 4.24.0 (16 September 2023)\n## Added\n- Support dependency injection in FormRequests ([84078358ce](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/commit/84078358ce32ff0656a9ab03f062e952f721f1a2))\n- Include `auth.extra_info` in OpenAPI security scheme ([#727](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/727))\n- Support dynamic base URL ([#723](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/723))\n\n## Fixed\n- Generate proper sample for array of objects ([#720](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/720))\n\n# 4.23.1 (25 August 2023)\n## Fixed\n- Break in attributes due to enum support ([4c49e81e0](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/commit/4c49e81e0a6f4a257c3945a139b9a3bf35d85b2b))\n\n# 4.23.0 (24 August 2023)\n## Added\n- Support for enums: you can now specify the allowed values of a parameter ([#713](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/713))\n\n## Modified\n- Exclude Authorization header from generated OpenAPI spec, per spec ([#714](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/714))\n\n## Fixed\n- Improve endpointId generation ([#700](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/700))\n- Improve empty checks in OpenAPI spec generation ([#712](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/712))\n- Don't export auth.use_value to Postman ([6a9d51b3a2](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/commit/6a9d51b3a215a89e8b8af47f796ffaa10993c171))\n\n# 4.22.0 (1 July 2023)\n## Added\n- Make included package attributes extensible ([#680](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/680))\n\n## Fixed\n- Ensure example code supports multipart/form-data without files ([#685](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/685))\n- Fix path traversal on Laravel 10 ([#686](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/686))\n- Properly support floats in docs UI ([#693](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/693))\n- Properly normalise URLs with multi-word Eloquent parameters ([#670](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/670))\n- Also show empty array query parameters in Postman ([#691](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/691))\n\n\n# 4.21.2 (5 June 2023)\n## Fixed\n- Typehint interface in CustomTranslationsLoader for maximum compatibility ([#679](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/679))\n\n\n# 4.21.1 (3 June 2023)\n## Fixed\n- Load translations on demand to get around false negative for `runningInConsole()` ([963340f2](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/commit/963340f2bea654bb267286f807bcdf15b699d06e))\n- Correctly set pagination data on collections in `#[ResponseFromApiResource]` ([d53776bee](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/commit/d53776bee25daff8f0070e49a32b127b4de21c9c))\n\n# 4.21.0 (29 May 2023)\n## Added\n- API resources: Infer model name from `@mixin` ([f0ed9565](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/commit/f0ed95653b401b188e76e6ba9057406710f2cc2b))\n- New translation layer ([#673](https://github.com/knuckleswtf/scribe/pull/673))\n  - This fixes the problems with the recently introduced localization feature, by switching to a custom translation system. Users should delete the `en.json` file, if they had previously published it.

Featuring subgroups, easier sorting, and an automated upgrade command.\n\nScribe helps you generate API documentation for humans from your Laravel/Lumen/[Dingo](https://github.com/dingo/api) codebase. See a live example at [demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf](https://demo.scribe.knuckles.wtf).\n\n## Features\n- Useful output:\n  - Pretty single-page HTML doc, with human-friendly text, code samples, and in-browser API tester (\"Try It Out\")\n  - Generates Postman collection and OpenAPI spec\n- Smarts. Scribe can:\n  - extract request parameter details from FormRequests or validation rules\n  - safely call API endpoints to get sample responses\n  - generate sample responses from Eloquent API Resources or Transformers\n- Customisable to different levels:\n  - Customise the UI by adjusting text, ordering, examples, or change the UI itself\n  - Add custom strategies to adjust how data is extracted\n  - Statically define extra endpoints or information that isn't in your codebase\n\n> 👋 Scribe helps you generate docs automatically, but if you really want to make friendly, maintainable and testable API docs, there's some more things you need to know. So I made [a course](https://shalvah.teachable.com/p/api-documentation-for-developers?utm_source=scribe-laravel&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=none) for you.🤗\n\n## Documentation\nCheck out the documentation at [scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel](http://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel).\n\nIf you're coming from `mpociot/laravel-apidoc-generator`, first migrate [to v3](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel/3.x/migrating-apidoc), then [to v4](https://scribe.knuckles.wtf/laravel/migrating-v4).\n\n## Contributing\nContributing is easy!
