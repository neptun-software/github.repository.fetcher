Serving\nmultiple websites, each with one or more hostnames from the same codebase. But\nwith clear separation of assets, database and the ability to override logic per\ntenant.\n\nSuitable for marketing companies that like to re-use functionality\nfor different clients or start-ups building the next software as a\n service.\n\n---\n\nOffers:\n\n- Integration with the awesome Laravel framework.\n- Event driven, extensible architecture.\n- Close - optional - integration into the web server.\n- The ability to add tenant specific configs, code, routes etc.\n\nDatabase separation methods:\n\n- One system database and separated tenant databases (default).\n- Table prefixed in the system database.\n- Or .. manually, the way you want, by listening to an event.\n\n[Complete documentation](https://tenancy.dev) covers more than just the\n installation and configuration.\n\n## Requirements, recommended environment\n\n- Laravel 9.0+.\n- PHP 8.0+\n- Apache or Nginx.\n- MySQL, MariaDB, or PostgreSQL.\n\nPlease read the full [requirements in the documentation](https://tenancy.dev/docs/hyn/5.4/requirements).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\ncomposer require hyn/multi-tenant\n```\n\n### Automatic service registration\n\nUsing [auto discovery](https://medium.com/@taylorotwell/package-auto-discovery-in-laravel-5-5-ea9e3ab20518), the\ntenancy package will be auto detected by Laravel automatically.\n\n#### Manual service registration\n\nIn case you want to disable webserver integration or prefer manual integration,\nset the `dont-discover` in your application composer.json, like so:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"extra\": {\n        \"laravel\": {\n            \"dont-discover\": [\n                \"hyn/multi-tenant\"\n            ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIf you disable auto discovery you are able to configure the providers by yourself.\n\nRegister the service provider in your `config/app.php`:\n\n```php\n    'providers' => [\n        // [..]\n        // Hyn multi tenancy.\n        Hyn\\Tenancy\\Providers\\TenancyProvider::class,\n        // Hyn multi tenancy webserver integration.\n        Hyn\\Tenancy\\Providers\\WebserverProvider::class,\n    ],\n```\n\n### Deploy configuration\n\nFirst publish the configuration and migration files so you can modify it to your needs:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan vendor:publish --tag tenancy\n```\n\nOpen the `config/tenancy.php` and `config/webserver.php` file and modify to your needs.\n\n> Make sure your system connection has been configured in `database.php`. In case you didn't override the system connection name the `default` connection is used.\n\nNow run:\n\n```bash\nphp artisan migrate --database=system\n```\n\nThis will run the required system database migrations.\n\n---\n\n## Backers\n\nThank you to all our backers! 🙏 [[Become a backer](https://opencollective.com/tenancy#backer)]\n\n<a href=\"https://opencollective.com/tenancy#backers\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/tenancy/backers.svg?width=890\"></a>\n\n\n## Sponsors\n\nSupport this project by becoming a sponsor.
