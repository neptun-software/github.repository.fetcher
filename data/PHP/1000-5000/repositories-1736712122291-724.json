This is required for non-autoincrement PK's.\n* `ORM`: Fixed a NestedSets bug that caused the tree-id not to be set on multi-tree models.\n* `ORM`: Fixed bug that allowed Models derived from a database view to be updated (causing a DB error).\n* `ORM`: Allow `is_changed()` to run observers before comparing, to prevent it always returning True when using the Typing observer bidirectionally.\n* `ORM`: Fixed bug in which not all Model properties were initialized on a `forge()` with partial data.\n\n## v1.8.1\n\n### Security advisories\n\n* [**SEC-CORE-008**]:  Crypt encryption has been compromised!\n\nSee [the website](https://fuelphp.com/security-advisories) for more information about reported security issues and their status.\n\n### Important fixes, changes, notes. Read them carefully.\n\n* The code has been scanned for new warnings emitted by PHP 7.1.\n* Support for PHPUnit v6 has been added.\n* Support for php-fpm has been improved.\n* Function overloading for multibyte functions is no longer supported.\n* A workaround for PHP bug 55701 has been added.\n\n### Security related\n\nThe AES encryption used by the `Crypt` class has been compromised, as reported by Felix Widemann and Nils Rokita from Hamburg University. They have proven that with a powerful GPU, any encoded string can be decoded using brute force in a few minutes. If your application relies on the `Crypt` class (and most do, because the session cookie is using `Crypt` to encode it), upgrading your applications is highly advised!\n\nIf you manually want to convert data, for example because you have them stored in the database, simply use:\n````\n$new = \\Crypt::encode(\\Crypt::decode($old));\n````\nIt will detect if the string is using the old encryption or the new encryption. Your `crypt.php` containing the keys will be automatically updated as well (assuming the application has write rights to the file).\n\n**Please note** that due to the stronger encryption mechanism used, the encrypted strings are longer. This might be an issue where you have limited space available, for example is fixed or max width database fields, a session cookie that is already approaching the 4Kb limit, etc. So check the requirements of your application before upgrading!\n\n### Backward compatibility notes\n\n* When you post a form that exceeds `max_input_vars`, in some PHP 7.x versions the excess values were silently dropped, causing incorrect application behavior. `Input` now emits an E_WARNING if PHP doesn't do so.\n* The `Session` classes have been refactored. The methods `create()`/`read()` and `write()` are removed, and `start()` and `close()` added to more closely mimic native session behavior.\n* Database results can now be returned in list or collection (cached) form. A list can only be iterated over, a collection has direct (array) access. By default a collection is returned to retain BC with 1.8.0, but in most cases, a list is faster if random access isn't needed, especially if the resultset is big.\n* Function overloading for multibyte functions is no longer supported. When you have this enabled in your PHP config, Fuel will refuse to start.\n* If you require multibyte agnostic string functions for the functions of type 2 (see http://php.net/manual/en/mbstring.overload.php), use the methods in the `Str` class instead.\n\n### System changes\n\n* Markdown has been updated to v1.7.0.\n* Monolog has been updated to v1.18  (latest composer version).\n* PHPSecLib has been updated to v2.* (latest composer version).\n* URI parsing has been refactored for better NGINX and php-fpm support.\n* The autoloader has been patched to better support classnames in local charactersets.\n\n### Specific classes\n\n* `Asset`: You can now call custom defined asset types the same way as you would built-in types (js,css,img).\n* `Config`: `load()` has been refactored. It no longer overwrites on subsequent loads unless you want to. It also no longer returns `false` in that case, but always returns the loaded config.\n* `Crypt`: Has been rewritten using Sodium. Decrypting old encoded strings is transparent, and will be converted on encrypting.\n* `Date`: `create_from_string()` no longer allows you to create timestamps from before the Unix Epoch, which wasn't supported, and caused weird things to happen...\n* `DB`: you can now use `on_open()` and `on_close()` when creating JOIN clauses.\n* `DB`: UPDATE now supports the same JOIN clauses as SELECT.\n* `DB`: Database result objects are now sanitized automatically when passed to a View.\n* `DB`: You can now choose to return database results as a list (can only be looped over in sequence) or a collection (has random access). A list uses a lot less memory with large resultsets.\n* `DB`: Introduced a `cache()` method to return a list as a collection.\n* `DBUtil`: Now has a `list_indexes()` method.\n* `Fieldset`: Fixed invalid HTML for tabular forms being generated when it contained hidden columns.\n* `Fieldset`: Tabular forms now have built-in support for pagination.\n* `File`: Fixed several bugs that could cause errors when `open_basedir` was in effect.\n* `File`: Fixed broken file locking when using `open_file()`. Lock type validation added.\n* `Form`: Attribute usage with both configured attributes and passed attributes on `open()` calls has been fixed.\n* `Format`: Fixed a bug in which importing a multi-line CSV file could cause data loss.\n* `Image`: Alphablending has been fixed for Imagick.\n* `Image`: The Imagick driver now takes EXIF autorotation data into account, mimicing GD behaviour.\n* `Input`: Only parses raw input when PHP hasn't done so (p.e. on put, patch or delete requests).\n* `Input`: A new `raw()` method has been introduced to access the raw PHP input data (from php://input).\n* `Log`: Error and Exception objects are now passed on to Monolog for more detailing logging options.\n* `Model_Crud`: `count()` now uses the defined database connection, if available.\n* `Model_Crud`: Freezing/unfreezing error fixed when unserializing data into an object.\n* `Module`: You can now configure that you want routes loaded from the module when you load a module.\n* `Pagination`: You can now specify the starting page (number, or 'first' or 'last') when no page number is present in the URL.\n* `Security`: You can now configure NOT to rotate the CSRF token after validation.\n* `Security`: `set_token()` is now a public method, so a token can be rotated manually.\n* `Session`: Broken `destroy()` method has been fixed.\n* `Session`: You can now create a session instance without implicitly starting it.\n* `Session`: You can now reset an active session to an empty state.\n* `View`: Fixed unsanitizing of Traversable objects.\n\n### Packages\n\n* `Auth`: Fixed a bug in the validation rules of the User model.\n* `Auth`: When checking for access, you can now also pass the area name only (matches any right assigned in that area).\n* `Auth`: For security reasons, OpAuths response has been changed from serialized to jsob. This response is now supported.\n* `Oil`: Improved Model and Migration generation.\n* `Oil`: Improved index support when generating migrations from an existing database table.\n* `Oil`: Generated controllers now support pagination on their index page.\n* `Oil`: Generating from existing tables now yield more details about the column.\n* `Parser`: Markdown views no longer uses a dedicated version of Markdown, but the version installed via Composer.\n* `Parser`: Creating a parser view object without a view name passed no longer triggers an exception.\n* `Parser`: Support added for Handlebars templates though the LightnCandy composerpackage.\n* `Orm`: `forge()` now accepts an object implementing ArrayAccess to add data to the ORM object.\n* `Orm`: `Observer_Typing` now supports the fieldtype `encrypt` to transparently encrypt/decrypt data going into the database.\n* `Orm`: `Observer_Typing` now support a field definition 'db_decimals', which you can use if your internal representation is different from the column definition (so objects aren't marked as changed incorrectly).\n* `Orm`: Added a 'caching' config key to the ORM config, to configure default object caching behaviour.\n* `Orm`: Now has a `caching()` method to enable or disable ORM object caching.\n* `Orm`: Now has a `flush_cache()` method to flush the loaded ORM object cache.\n* `Orm`: You can now disconnect related objects by assigning `null` or `array()` to the relation, which behaves identical to using `unset()`.\n* `Email`: Mailgun email header generation has been improved.\n\n## v1.8.0\n\n### Important fixes, changes, notes. Read them carefully.\n\nThis version provides full compatibility with PHP 7. To achieve this, the \\Fuel\\Error class had to be renamed to \\Fuel\\Errorhandler. The new error handler has full support for PHP 7's new Error exceptions. If your application calls the Error class directly, or has extended the Error class, make sure you make the appropriate changes after you have upgraded!\n\nThe oil installer has been updated to use composer to install Fuel, and to provide better support for MacOS.\n\n### Backward compatibility notes\n\n* The included PHPSecLib version has been swapped by the composer package. If your application creates instances of PHPSecLib classes, check your code for compatibility issues, for example with the use of namespaces.\n\n### Removed code (because it was deprecated in v1.7.3 or earlier)\n\n* The old \"mysql\" DB driver has been removed because of removal in recent PHP versions. You can keep using `mysqli` if for some reason you don't want to use PDO. A new \"mysql\" driver has been introduced that uses PDO underneath. This should be transparent for most applications.\n\n### Security related\n\n* Because of the swap to the composer PHPSecLib package, the `pbkdf2()` method that was added to the code by the Fuel team is no longer available. Fuel itself now uses the PHP `hash_pbkdf2()` function. If you are using a PHP version < 5.5.0, this function is emulated in base.php.\n* When using file based session, an additional check has been added to make sure the session file is loaded from the configured path.\n* The `Security::clean_input()` now has support for `ArrayAccess` and `Traversable` classes, and now fully recurses into these classes and arrays for a full deep clean.\n* `Security::generate_token()` now uses `random_bytes()`, `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` if available, and uses `hash_algos()` with SHA to generate the token hash.\n\n### System changes\n\n* The database classes have been refactored. `Database_Query` is now properly extendable, and `DBUtil` schema manipulations have been abstracted in order to support multiple DB platforms.\n* New drivers have been added for \"dblib\" (MS-SQL/Sybase), \"sqlsrv\" (MS-SQL on Windows) and \"SQLite\".\n* The framework now supports generic HTTP status 400 messages through the new `HttpBadRequestException` exception.\n* When a database migration is run, and the database schema is ahead of the migration configuration file, the status is synced before any migrations are run. This makes sure migrations don't run twice, which may happen when you update multiple application instances using a shared clustered database.\n* You can now correctly use \"hybrid\" controller (like \"\\Controller\\Something_Class\") names as documented.\n* new function `get_composer()` allows direct access to the Composer Autoloader instance.\n* The core's \"base.php\" code has been optimized for PHP 5.6+.\n* A new route keyword \":everything\" has been added, which complements \":any\" by also matching with \"nothing\".\n\n### Specific classes\n\n* The Agent class now supports the definition of an HTTP proxy for downloading the browscap file.\n* An issue in the Agent class is fixed where loading the browscap file could fail if it was defined as type \"local\".\n* `Arr::key_exists()` now has support for classes implementing `ArrayAccess`.\n* Asset now has a new method `add_type()` to define new types besides \"js\", \"css\" and \"img\". You need to pass a closure that is used to render the HTML for the given type.\n* Asset is now more compatible with Windows platforms when it comes to generating paths and URL's (correct use of slash vs backslash).\n* The Cache file driver has been improved to solve some locking race conditions.\n* Config class no longer caches the result of config keys defined as a closure. Closures are now evaluated at runtime instead of at load time.\n* Fixed a bug in `Controller_Rest` that would cause the HTTP status code to be overwritten when detecting an incorrect return format in production mode.\n* `Controller_Rest` now returns HTTP status 200 by default.\n* When calling the `Database` method `count_last_query()`, any ORDER BY is now stripped from the COUNT query to improve performance.\n* Return type detection has been improved for `DB::query()` calls, for SQL statements like \"DESCRIBE\", \"EXECUTE\", \"EXPLAIN\" and \"SHOW\".\n* `Date::range_to_array()` could return unexpected values when using more complex intervals. This has been fixed.\n* Added support for \"runtime-created functions\" in Debug detailed output.\n* Fixed a bug in `File::create_dir()` that causes directory creation to fail if the directory had the same name as its parent.\n* `Form::open()` can now automatically add a CSRF key field when the config key \"security.csrf_auto_token\" is set.\n* Lang now has a new method `set_lang()`, which allows you to switch the active language, optionally reloading all already loaded language files in this new language.\n* Migrate can now detect circular dependencies (two migrations depending on each other), and will now bail out with a loop detection error message.\n* Migration tasks can now define `before()` and `after()` methods. If either returns false, the migration is skipped. In case of `after()`, that implies the migration is reverted.\n* Mongo_Db has a new `dump()` method to allow dumping a collection or collections for backup purposes.\n* The `Response` class now has a new `set_headers()` method to set multiple headers in one go.\n* `Request_Curl` now returns the complete \"raw\" response in the response variable \"response\", which can be accessed in case of a returned http status >= 400.\n* `Request_Curl` now allows you to use fully qualified option names to be set (those starting with \"CURLOPT_\").\n* The Router now also returns the path of the controller on a found route match.\n* The Security class can now throw an `HttpBadRequestException` instead of a generic `Security Exception` when CSRF validation fails.\n* The Session file driver has been improved to solve some locking race conditions, and an additional validation of the session payload on session load.\n* The \"randomness\" of generated session ID's has been improved by using `Security::generate_token()` to generate them.\n* The Str class now checks if mbstring functions are available before using them.\n* Theme is now more compatible with Windows platforms when it comes to generating paths and URL's (correct use of slash vs backslash).\n* Validation `valid_date` rule can now handle incomplete date/time formats properly by using defaults for missing values.\n* You can now control the behaviour of the View class on closures assigned to a View variable through the config key \"filter_closures\".\n* For View variables supporting the `Sanitation` interface, sanitation is disabled after rendering the view to return the object in its original state.\n\n### Packages\n\n* Auth: login drivers now uses the internal PHP function `hash_pbkdf2()` function to hash passwords.\n* Auth: the Opauth driver will now pass a \"group_id\" back in the result if the login provider supplies this value in its response.\n* Auth: the Opauth driver now has a `get_instance()` method to return the current Opauth instance.\n* Auth: migrations now use the configured \"db_connection\" from the simpleauth/ormauth config, if defined.\n* Auth: `auth_check()` now also accepts the name of the login driver (as a string), besides the login driver instance.\n* Auth: updated the Auth classes to support the PHPSecLib composer package.\n* Email: Fixed bug in text wrapping where spaces could be stripped from HTML tags.\n* Email: Added a check on the availability of mbstring extensions before its functions are used.\n* Oil: migrate now has a new \"--installed\" option, which only runs migrations for packages and modules defined in the \"always_load\" section of the config. You can use it in conjunction with \"--modules\" and \"--packages\" to include some manually loaded modules or packages.\n* Oil: new \"--with-test\" option to scaffolding will generate corresponding test classes for each class generated.\n* Oil: \"fromdb\" task has a new \"migration\" command that allows you to generate migrations from an existing database. NOTE: these need to be checked as not all details can be retrieved from an existing table!\n* Orm: Fixed SQL generation error when `DB::expression()` was used at the left-hand side of a query statement.\n* Orm: Fixed a decimal point positioning issue in the Typing observer.\n* Orm: Fixed a problem in the Temporal model where the incorrect primary key values where used when generating a WHERE clause.\n* Orm: Added the option to `dump_tree()` to include a path URI, mainly useful when working with nested sets.\n* Orm: The typing observer can now handle floats in all locales (the decimal point is comma problem).\n* Orm: Implemented a workaround for slow access of large array entries by reference (see https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=68624)\n* Orm: A bug that caused related data in a many-many relation to be incorrectly hydrated has been fixed.\n* Parser: It is now possible to load Mustache partials. If none are defined, the UTF-8 partial is loaded by default.\n* Parser: for View variables supporting the `Sanitation` interface, sanitation is disabled after rendering the view to return the object in its original state.\n* Parser: for jade templates, now the Talesoft Jade renderer is supported too, besides the already supported Everzet renderer.\n* Parser: fixed a bug that caused loading template files with multiple dots to fail.\n* Parser: Twig templates now have access to the `Auth::get()` method through \"auth_get\".\n\n## v1.7.3\n\n### Important fixes, changes, notes. Read them carefully.\n\nThis release is mainly a bugfix release, although some minor functionality was added as well. The main goal of this release is increased stability of the version 1 code, now that it is approaching the end of it's life-cycle.\n\nThe final version will be v1.8, which will be released at the same time the first version of Fuel v2 will be released. It will be an LTS version, no new functionality will be accepted on the codebase anymore, but will will keep releasing bugfixes and security fixes.\n\n### Backward compatibility notes\n\n* The FuelPHP framework is now entirely loaded using composer. A check has been added to the frontloader to make sure composer has run and all components are installed, and die with a proper error message if that is not the case. The default `minimum-stability` is set to `stable`, so you might want to have a look at that if needed.\n* Activating the framework autoloader has been moved from the App bootstrap to the frontloader (oil for cli, public/index.php for web requests). When you upgrade, make sure to update both the frontloaders, otherwise you will get exceptions when the autoloader is loaded twice.\n* When loading multiple modules or packages through the `load()` method, the result will now only be `true` if all could be succesfully loaded.\n* When Fuel is run is CLI mode, output buffering is now disabled. Note that it might still buffer, for example because you have enabled buffering globally in your php.ini.\n* The `match_collection` validation rule now always returns `true` if no collection was passed to match against.\n\n### Removed code (because it was deprecated in v1.6 or earlier)\n\nn/a\n\n### Security related\n\n* PHPSecLib has been updated to a more recent version.\n* Htmlawed has been updated to version 1.1.19.\n\n### System changes\n\n* The dependency with `FuelPHP\\Upload` is now with version 2.0.2.\n* The frontloader now has a generic Exception catching mechanism. For every Exception caught you can have the frontloader route to a route entry of your choice. By default, these are defined: `HttpNotFoundException (_404_ route)`, `HttpNoAccessException (_403_ route)` and the `HttpServerErrorException (_500_ route)`.\n* The finder caching system has been updated to avoid incorrect cache hits when loading files from modules or packages.\n* Module and package paths are now forced to be lowercase to comply with the standards.\n* You can now configure additional paths to be cleaned, to avoid giving away FQFN in error messages.\n* When running migrations, your `up()` or `down()` method can return false to signal it can't execute the method at that point in time. Migrations that use this method are now automatically re-tried in a second migration run. This helps with dependencies, to make sure migrations run in the correct sequence (for example if an app migration requires a package migration to run first because it needs access to its tables).\n\n### Specific classes\n\n* __Cache__: The XCache `delete_all()` method now actually deletes it all.\n* __Config__: when using a database as backend storage, you can now specify the name of the database config that needs to be used to access the \"config\" table.\n* __Config__: you can now store config information in a memcached backend (think about persistency!).\n* __Controller_Hybrid__: calling a REST method from a browser now returns the correct result.\n* __Crypt__: can now be instantiated, if you need to use multiple crypt keysets in your application.\n* __DB__: `count_last_query()` now correctly handles SQL containing sub-queries.\n* __DB__: database result objects can now be assigned a custom sanitation for specific encoding/decoding logic when results are send to a View. This also means you will no longer get a \"database results are read-only\" exception when you do.\n* __Error__: the log level used for errors is now configurable.\n* __Form__: the `label()` method now has support for the \"for\" attribute.\n* __Format__: new parameter for `to_xml()` allows you to specify how booleans must be represented (0/1 vs false/true).\n* __Inflector__: the inflector ruleset has been moved to a lang file, so it can easily be\namended, and provide support for introducting non-english language rulesets.\n* __Input__: new `query_string()` method to return the main requests query string.\n* __Input__: a header value lookup is now done in a case-insensitive manner.\n* __Lang__: now allows you to load the same lang filename for different languages concurrently.\n* __Lang__: `load()` now has support for dot-notation when loading into an existing group.\n* __Log__: Monolog initialisation has moved to a separate method, making it easier to overload it.\n* __Migrate__: will now autoload a module or a package before it executes its migrations.\n* __Module__: when unloading a module, the routes defined by the module will be correctly removed.\n* __Pagination__: page and item calculations have been improved, to allow more flexibility in passing page data to the object.\n* __Presenter__: now supports the \"::\" notation to force loading a presenter from a module.\n* __Response__: now has loop detection for `redirect_back()`.\n* __Session__: driver garbage collection has moved to a separate method, making it easier to overload it.\n* __Session__: the `rotation_time` configuration key can now be set to false to completely disable automatic session id rotation. Use with care!\n* __Theme__: you can now specify the other in which partials must be rendered for output.

Read them carefully.\n\n##### Viewmodel\n\nAs of 1.7.2, the Viewmodel class is deprecated, and replaced by the Presenter class. Functionality has remained largely the same, and a Viewmodel alias is present to maintain backward compatibility.\n\nIt has proven difficult to explain what a Viewmodel is and does, and why you should use it. Also having a classes/view and a views folder was very confusing for a lot of people. It is also a step closer to Fuel v2, there this class is also called Presenter.\n\n### Backward compatibility notes\n\n##### Request_Curl\n\nAs a result of the security issue mentioned below, the auto-format of the response in the `Request_Curl` class is now disabled by default, as it is possible for a malicious site to construct a response of a specific reponse type that can lead to code execution. This means that if you use `Request_Curl`, you have to either enable this manually in your code (**ONLY** if you absolutely trust the site you connect to!), or add code to validate the response before you process it.\n\n##### Validation\n\nThe validation rule `required` rule no longer treats an input value `false` as a value, so passing this value will now trigger a validation error.\n\n##### Database\n\nThe PDO driver now returns the error code of the underlying database driver back as the error code in the `Database_Exception`, instead of the PDO error code. This allows you to act on specific platform errors.\n\nIt also means you loose access to the original generic PDO error code, which you can work around by retrieving the current PDO database connection (through the `connection()` method on the database object) and call PDO's `errorCode()` method to retrieve the original generic PDO error code.\n\n### Removed code (because it was deprecated in v1.7.1 or earlier)\n\nNone.\n\n### Security related\n\n##### Request_Curl\n\nThere was one security advisory issued for 1.7.1, which also impact all previous versions from 1.1 onwards (see http://fuelphp.com/security-advisories). The issue is mitigated in 1.7.2, it is strongly advised that you upgrade as soon as possible, or alternatively follow the advice in the advisory.\n\n##### Database\n\nA potentional vulnerability was discovered in the way column name quoting was done. This has been fixed. This means that coding SQL functions manually was something you could get away with earlier now require you to use DB::expr() to encapsulate the function.\n````php\n// old code, no longer works\n$result = DB::select(\"LOWER \\\"field\\\")\")->from($table)->execute();\n\n// has to be replaced by\n$result = DB::select(DB::Expr(\"LOWER \\\"field\\\")\"))->from($table)->execute();\n````\n\n##### Errors\n\nError messages are now escaped, to prevent a possible XSS through the generated error. Note that it is best practice not to display error messages in a production environment, so the possible risk for XSS is deemed to be very low.\n\n### System changes\n\n* A possible XSS vulnerabity in the Profiler output has been fixed.\n* The `import()` function can now also import third-party classes in APPPATH/vendor.\n* When using multiple DB connections, the profiler now shows the connection used for the query.\n* The Profiler now html encodes the output to avoid incorrect handling of the ampersand.\n* The internal Markdown class has been removed, and replaced by the Composer library.\n* Some methods were still defined as `private`. This has been changed to `protected` to allow extension.\n* Fully namespaced controllers are now supported. Now you can use class names like Controller\\Foo\\Bar, Controller_Foo_Bar, or Controller\\Foo_Bar.\n* The Database layer now has support for nested transactions, either through native SQL support, or via SAVEPOINTS.\n* The __Agent__ class has been switched back to the original browscap.org URL's.\n* Saving a __Lang__ or __Config__ file will now flush the APC and/or Opcode cache.\n* Double quotes inside an HTML tag attribute value are now escaped.\n* Debug logging has been added to the Session classes to aid in debugging session loss.\n* GZIP compression is now automatically disabled if the client indicates it doesn't support it.\n* Unit tests have been adapted where needed to support PHPUnit 4.\n* The `html_tag` helper function now generates compliant HTML.\n* Several pieces of file handling code has been modified to handle Windows file paths better.\n* The Autoloader now thows an exception if the class file can be found, but it doesn't contain the class expected.\n* The Autoloader now supports loading Traits.\n* The shutdown handler now logs any error if it fails to shutdown properly.\n* The included PHPSecLib version has been upgraded to the July 1st version of the php5 branch.\n* Unit testing now has support for AspectMock.\n* An entry to the phpunit xml has been added to run tests in modules.\n\n### Specific classes\n\n* __Agent__: Now correctly uses the

Read them carefully.\n\n* The index.php has been updated to make sure the Response body is rendered, and rendered only once. When upgrading to 1.7.1, **don't forget** to apply these changes!\n* When using the REST controller and returning an array as a response, the controller now checks if the response format is compatible. If not, it will return an error messsage and set a 406 HTTP status when in production mode. In other modes, it will return a warning and a JSON encoded dump of the array.\n\n### Backward compatibility notes\n\nNone.\n\n### Removed code (because it was deprecated in v1.7 or earlier)\n\nNone.\n\n### Security related\n\nThere were one security advisory issued for 1.7, which also impact all previous versions (see http://fuelphp.com/security-advisories). These issues are addressed in 1.7.1, it is strongly advised that you upgrade as soon as possible.\n\n### System changes\n\nA new **Sanitization** interface has been introduced to the core. Objects can implement this interface, and when you pass such an object to a View, the object will not be cleaned, but the individual properties will be cleaned by the object itself when the properties are requested by the view.\n\nORM and Model_Crud models now implement the sanitization interface by default, and when enabled, they will return a cleaned copy of the property, instead of the property itself. This means you can now pass ORM model objects to Views, without the ORM object being destroyed.\n\n### Specific classes\n\n* __Cache_Storage_Redis__: Support for non-default Redis DB configs has been fixed.\n* __Arr__: `get()` now allows you to get array values using a key that contains a dot.\n* __Arr__: `search()` now has a new parameter to enforce a strict search.\n* __Asset__: `css()` now accepts the 'type' attribute.\n* __DB__: Now allows a DB connection to be set, to make sure SQL is compiled using the correct driver.\n* __DB__: You can now `disconnect()` and `connect()`, allowing you to reconnect when the connection has dropped.\n* __DBUtil__: `set_connection()` now accepts `null` to reset the connection instance set previously.\n* __DBUtil__: `add_foreign_key()` now has support for custom DB connections.\n* __DBUtil__: `create_index` now allows you to create a PRIMARY KEY index.\n* __DBUtil__: `drop_index` now allows you to drop a PRIMARY KEY index.\n* __File__: `download()` will now be executed after cookies have been written.\n* __Form__: `select()` now accepts zero or null as selected value.\n* __Format__: `from_xml()` now has support for XML namespaces.\n* __Format__: `to_json()` now accepts JSON encoding options, with configured default options.\n* __Fuel__: Make sure the locale is set before processing 'always_load'.\n* __Image__: `create_hex_color()` now correctly processes the alpha value.\n* __Image__: `convert_number()` can now deal properly with numbers using a decimal comma.\n* __Image__: Imagemagick driver now correctly stores the image size in its cache.\n* __Input__: `uri()` now always returns the URI with a leading slash.\n* __Input__: You can now control double decoding of urlencoded forms.\n* __Lang__: No longer uses a fixed path delimiter, causing issues on Windows.\n* __Lang__: When multiple languages are defined, the files are now loaded in the correct order.\n* __Migrate__: Now displays the correct migration version when migrating down.\n* __Migrate__: Now checks for existence of packages and modules before attempting to migrate them.\n* __Model_Crud__: Now implements lazy sanitation when an object is passed to a View.\n* __Theme__: You can now call `render()` more than once.\n* __Uri__: When $_GET is reassembled, it will now be security cleaned.\n\n### Packages\n\n* __Auth__: Problems with direct updates of permission join tables (PK=FK) have been fixed.\n* __Auth__: The `multiple-logins` config setting is now ignored unless there actually are multiple login drivers.\n* __Email__: A background color (#aabbcc) in an img tag is no longer seen as an attachment.\n* __Parser__: `auth_has_access` has been added as a Twig function.\n* __Oil__: Improved error reporting when it is unable to parse the given field definition.\n* __Oil__: When running a module task, the module path is now added at the front of the finder path list.\n* __Oil__: Duplicate migration filename detection has been fixed.\n* __Oil__: Refine will no longer dump the callstack when an exception occurs in production mode.\n* __Oil__: Generating a drop table migration has been fixed.\n* __Orm__: Models now implement lazy sanitation when an object is passed to a View.\n* __Orm__: Missing config for Temporal models has been fixed.\n* __Orm__: Model_Temporal `find_revision()` no longer throws an exception when no revision could be found.\n* __Orm__: The `UpdatedAt` observer now has the option to mark the object as updated if a related object was changed.\n* __Orm__: The `Slug` observer now has the option to define a custom separator.\n\n## v1.7\n\n[Full List of core changes since 1.6.1](https://github.com/fuel/core/compare/1.6/master...1.7/master)\n\n### Important fixes, changes, notes. Read them carefully.\n\n* A fix has been added to deal with PHP bugs #42098/#54054, which cause an SPL autoloader to malfunction when trying to autoload from an exception handler. This will fix erradic \"class not found\" messages when processing exceptions.\n* __File::close_file()__ was broken when using locking. This has been fixed.\n* __Date::test_format()__ no longer resets the current timezone to UTC.\n* Output buffering is now disabled when in CLI mode. This allows you to get messages from your tasks in realtime, instead of having to wait until the task has finished.\n* A bug in all session drivers (except cookie) that caused the session timestamp not to be updated has been fixed. The session will now not expire as long as there is activity within the expiration timeout.\n* PHP E_ERROR's are now reported as \"Fatal error\".\n* Profiler data will no longer be added to the output if the request is an ajax call.\n* The finder now checks for \"?:\\\" to detect a Windows path, so that one-letter module names can be used in finder filenames (\"?:filename\").\n* Where relevant calls to `file_exists()` have been changed to `is_file()` for performance reasons.\n* Where relevant calls to `call_user_func_array()` have been changed to `call_fuel_func_array()`, our internal equivalent which is about 30% faster.\n* Lots of bugfixes in the __Auth__ package, especially in relation to OpAuth and the Ormauth drivers.\n* Lots of bugfixes in the __Orm__ package, especially related to Model_Soft and Model_Nestedset.\n\n### Backward compatibility notes\n\n* The CSV configuration for the Format class has been split into a separate config for imports and exports. Also, the default escape character has been changed from a backslash to a double quote, to be more standards compliant. If your application relies on the backslash, make sure to create a custom format config after you have upgraded.\n* The __Redis__ class has been renamed to __Redis_Db__, to avoid collisions with the __Redis__ PECL class, which seems to be installed by default on a lot of systems. If the PECL extension is not found, __Redis_Db__ will be aliased to __Redis__, to make sure existing applications that use the __Redis__ class don't break. If you use the __Redis__ class, it is advised that you change it to __Redis_Db__.\n* __Cookie::set()__ now returns `false` when called in CLI mode.\n\n### Removed code (because it was deprecated in v1.6 or earlier)\n\n* The __Event::shutdown()__ method has been removed. This is replaced by two events, 'shutdown' which can be used by applications to run code after the script has finished, and 'fuel-shutdown', which runs after the application shutdown events, will close any open session, and runs the framework cleanup.\n\n### Security related\n\nThere were two security advisories issued for 1.6.1, which also impact all previous versions (see http://fuelphp.com/security-advisories).

Read them carefully.\n\n* This release officially introduces Composer to FuelPHP. You will __have__ to install it, and run a 'php composer.phar update' to pull in any required packages. Without this step, __1.6 WILL NOT WORK!!!__\n* Class names in the __Auth__ package have been modified to match FuelPHP coding standards. Check your configuration ('SimpleAuth' is now 'Simpleauth'!) and any class extensions you have made.\n* The __Log__ functionality has been moved back in the core. If you are upgrading from 1.5, please remove the old 'Log' package from the ``always_load`` section in your ``config.php``, and remove the package from the packages folder.\n* The environment 'stage' has been renamed to 'staging', the corresponding constant to Fuel::STAGING.\n* You now get a proper error message if your PHP timezone settings are not correctly configured.\n* You now get a proper error message if there is an issue with rights to the log file.\n* All code that creates files or directories has been rewritten to properly set the configured permission mask without using `umask()`, which is not thread-safe.\n\n### Backward compability notes\n\n* The names of the __Auth__ classes have been changed to comply with FuelPHP coding standards (`Auth_Login_Simpleauth` instead of `Auth_Login_SimpleAuth`), this can cause a class-not-found error if you have extended an Auth class in your application.\n* The ORM `validation_observer` now has multiple events. Do not define it without specifying which events to call, as it would cause validation to be called twice!\n* The __Orm__ behaviour with regards to relation assignments has been changed. Now, when you do an unset(), a set to NULL or array(), or you assign a new value, the previous relation will be unset. Regardless of whether you had fetched that relation or not. This might impact your application if you have used this 'bug' as a shortcut to adding additional objects to an existing relation!\n\n### Removed code (because it was deprecated in v1.5 or earlier)\n\n* __Orm__: `find()` and `find(null)` functionality is now removed. Use `query()` instead.\n\n### Code deprecated in v1.6 (to be removed in the next release)\n\n* __ViewModel__: when determining the name of the ViewModel class to load, it will search for classes with and without the 'View_' prefix. This behaviour is deprecated, as of the next release ViewModel classes MUST be in classes/view, and MUST be prefixed with 'View_'.\n\n### Security related\n\n* The default security filters have been removed from the core configuration, to allow you to define your own security filters. **Note:** if you're migration from previous versions and relied on this default config, make sure your app config file has the default security filters defined!\n\n### System changes\n\n* The Markdown library has been upgraded to 1.2.6.\n* The cache option in the global configuration now correctly caches finder paths to speedup file lookups.\n* Controller methods can now return 'false' or 'array()' as valid values, for use in HMVC requests.\n* Exceptions in shutdown event are now properly caught and handled.\n\n### Specific classes\n\n* __Agent__: will now re-use an expired download if a new browscap file could not be downloaded.\n* __Arr__: New `search` method allows you to search for values in array structures, and get the (dot-notated) key returned.\n* __Arr__: New `unique` method allows you to de-dup an array. Like array_unique(), but this one supports objects and closures, and doesn't sort the source array first.\n* __Arr__: New `sum` method allows you to sum up specific values in a multi-dimensional array structure.\n* __Asset__: now generates the correct Asset URL when using a CDN.\n* __Controller_Rest__: now allows auth checks using a controller method (avoids `before()` or `router()` hacks).\n* __DB__: new `identifier` method allows you to properly quote an identifier for use in custom queries.\n* __DB__: the `Database_Transaction` class that was already deprecated in v1.2 has been removed. All drivers support transactions natively.\n* __DButil__: now supports the keyword \"PRIMARY KEY\" on field updates.\n* __Cache__: index mechanism has been refactored. Dependency checking now works properly when using APC, Memcached or Redis backends.\n* __Error__: a new configuration option allows you to render already generated output to be shown in error messages via the 'prior output' link, instead of the HTML.\n* __File__: `create_dir` method now works properly on Windows.\n* __Form__: `select` now doesn't use inline css to generate optgroups unless needed.\n* __Fieldset__: fixed generation of invalid labels.\n* __Html__: `anchor` method now generates URL's without a trailing slash.\n* __Input__: `uri` method now works properly on Windows.\n* __Lang__: `delete` method now works properly when passing a $group value.\n* __Pagination__: now generates the last link correctly.\n* __Profiler__: DB query profiling now includes a stack trace for every query to make it easier to find it in your code.\n* __Router__: now supports protocol specific routes (http/https) in verb based route notation.\n* __Upload__: has been rewritten to use the FuelPHP v2 composer library.\n* __Viewmodel__: now calls `before` before rendering the view, instead of when constructing the object.\n* __Viewmodel__: ViewModel class name is now correctly determined from the passed view name.\n* __Viewmodel__: Will now look in the global namespace for the ViewModel class if called from a module and not found in the module namespace.\n\n### Packages\n\n* __Auth__: Class names have been modified to match FuelPHP coding standards.\n* __Auth__: `update_user` now verifies if the new email address is unique before updating it.\n* __Auth__: Number of PBKDF2 iterations can now be configured in the auth config file.\n* __Auth__: Multiple concurrent user logins can now be configured through the driver configuration file.\n* __Auth__: Auth login drivers now set 'updated_at' correctly.\n* __Auth__: new `get` method allows unified access to all user properties.\n* __Auth__: new `groups` method which returns the list of all defined groups.\n* __Auth__: new `roles` method which returns the list of all defined roles.\n* __Auth__: new 'Ormauth' driver set that uses the database through ORM as datastore.\n* __Auth__: Package now contains migrations for both Simpleauth and Ormauth.\n* __Auth__: New 'Simple2Orm' task can migrate your existing Simpleauth config to Ormauth.\n* __Email__: Attachments can now be named.\n* __Log__: The Log package, introduced in 1.5 as a temporary solution, has been removed again.\n* __Oil__: Fixed redirect loop in the generated admin backend code.\n* __Oil__: Improved exception handling and reporting.\n* __Oil__: Added support for ORM soft-delete models.\n* __Oil__: Modified the scaffolding templates to work better with bootstrap.\n* __Oil__: New commandline options for PHPunit allow for more granular testing and logging.\n* __Orm__: Validation observer now supports 'before_insert' and 'before_update'.\n* __Orm__: Now correctly resets foreign keys if cascade_delete is false.\n* __Orm__: Added view support to count(), min() and max() queries.\n* __Orm__: min() and max() now return integers instead of strings.\n* __Orm__: Added temporal support (data versioning).\n* __Orm__: You can now test for existence of EAV attributes using isset().\n* __Orm__: Validation observer can now validate on insert and update too.\n* __Orm__: It is now allowed for models to have a FK as part of the PK.\n* __Orm__: You can now order a many_many result on an attribute in the through table.\n* __Orm__: You can now pass custom (non-column) data when forging a new model object.\n* __Orm__: Current relations are now properly unset when using unset() or a new assignment.\n* __Orm__: `from_array` now returns $this so you can chain on it.\n* __Orm__: `from_array` now allows you to load custom data.\n* __Orm__: `from_array` now allows you to load related objects from a multidimensional array.\n* __Orm__: Several speed improvements in Observer_Typing.\n* __Orm__: Observer_Typing float conversions are now locale aware.\n* __Orm__: Observer_Typing now uses property defaults on null values if defined.\n* __Orm__: Observer_Typing can now handle MySQL '0000-00-00 00:00:00' datetime values.\n* __Orm__: new `from_cache` method allows you to enable/disable object caching on a query.\n* __Orm__: 'join on' now works correctly as documented.\n* __Orm__: 'order_by' now works correctly when a subquery is generated.\n* __Orm__: `is_changed` now does loose-typing, so 1 => '1' doesn't trigger an update query anymore.\n* __Parser__: Added support for mthaml (HamlTwig)\n* __Parser__: Switched to using Composer for smarty, mustache, mthaml and twig template engines.\n* __Parser__: Markdown has been upgraded to 1.2.6.\n\n## v1.5\n\n[Full List of core changes since 1.4](https://github.com/fuel/core/compare/1.4/master...1.5/master)\n\n### Important fixes, changes, notes. Read them carefully.\n\n* The \"Undefined constant MYSQL_ATTR_COMPRESS\" issue that pops up under certain conditions has been fixed.\n* It has been reported that under certain circumstances there might be issues with serialized data stored in the Auth user table, field \"profile_fields\", and the \"payload\" field in the sessions table. It is strongly advised to define those columns as \"blob\" to avoid these issues.\n* A new `Log` package has been introduced in preparation for the transition to 2.0, which replaces the `Log` class.\n\n### Backward compability notes\n\n* __Uri::to_assoc()__ no longer throws an exception with uneven segments, but returns ``null`` as value of the last segment\n* ORM __Model::find()__ no longer accepts ``null`` as only parameter. If you want to use that, you are now REQUIRED to also pass the options array (or an empty array).\n* __Sessions__ have been refactored, all validation and validation data has been moved server side. Because of this, pre-1.5 sessions are not longer compatible.\n* The __Log__ class has been removed and replaced by the __log package__. If you have extended the `Log` class in your application, you will have to extend `\\Log\\Log` instead, and check the compatibility of your changes. If they are about logging to other locations, you might want to look into the Monolog stream handlers instead.\n\n### Removed code (because it was deprecated in v1.4 or earlier)\n\n* ORM __Model::find()__ can no longer be used to construct queries using method chaining. Use  __Model::query()__ instead.\n\n### System changes\n\n* __Controller_Hybrid__: Now sets the correct content-type header on empty responses.\n* __Controller_Rest__: Now sets the correct content-type header on empty responses.\n\n### Specific classes\n\n* __Agent__: Will now honour 301/302 redirects when trying to fetch the browscap file.\n* __Arr__: New ``filter_recursive`` method, a recursive version of PHP's ``array_filter()`` function.\n* __Debug:__ ``dump()`` method now html encodes string variables.\n* __Debug:__ ``dump()`` and ``inspect()`` can now be styled using CSS (a classname has been added to the div).\n* __Fieldset__: New ``set_tabular_form()`` method allows creation of one-to-many forms.\n* __Fieldset__: New ``get_tabular_form()`` method to check if a fieldset defines a tabular form.\n* __Image__: New ``flip()`` method for vertical/horizontal image flipping.\n* __Inflector__: ``friendly_title()`` now has an option to deal with non-ascii characters.\n* __Inflector__: ``pluralize()`` now has an count parameter to return a singular value if the count is 1.\n* __Migrate__: Now allows you to define the DB connection to be used for migrations in the global migrations config file.\n* __Model_Crud__: Now has a `$_write_connection` property to support master/slave database setups.\n* __Mongo_Db__: Will now log it's queries to the profiler if enabled.\n* __Mongo_Db__: Now has a method ``get_cursor()`` to directly get a mongodb cursor.\n* __Pagination__: Now support pagination using a Query String variable.\n* __Pagination__: Now has support for first/last page links.\n* __Response__: Will now add a \"Content-Length\" header when generating the output.\n* __Session__: Now correctly erases the session cookie on a ``destroy``.\n* __Session__: Now silently (re)creates the session if data is present by no session is created.\n* __Session__: Cookie encryption can now be disabled using a session configuration key.\n* __Session__: Session cookie now only contains the session id. Validation now happens with server-side data.\n* __Session__: New configuration key `expire_flash_after_get` controls `get_flash()` expiration.\n* __Session__: ``get_flash()`` now has to override the configured flash variable expiration rules.\n* __Session__: ``set_flash()`` now has to partial array dot-notation support.\n* __Uri__: ``to_assoc()`` now accepts a start parameter allowing you to skip leading segments.\n* __Validation__: Now has a new built-in rule 'numeric_between' allowing you to specify a range.\n* __Database_Query_Builder_Join__: Now supports both AND and ON chaining of join condition.\n\n### Packages\n\n* __Orm__: Supports the new tabular form fieldset in it's models.\n* __Orm__: ``find()`` options array now has support for 'group_by'.\n* __Orm__: New ``Model_Soft`` implements soft-delete functionality (thanks to Steve West).\n* __Orm__: ``from_array()`` can now also populate related objects.\n* __Orm__: `Model` now has a `$_write_connection` property to support master/slave database setups.\n* __Oil__: ``oil install`` now installs packages without 'fuel_' prefix too.\n* __Oil__: scaffolding now supports subdirectories.\n* __Oil__: Now has a config file that allows you to configure the location of phpunit.\n* __Oil__: Now has a task `fromdb` that can generate models, migrations, scaffolding or admin from an existing database.\n* __Parser__: Twig driver has been updated to work with Twig v1.12.0.\n\n## v1.4\n\n[Full List of core changes since 1.3](https://github.com/fuel/core/compare/1.3/master...1.4/master)\n\n### Important fixes or changes\n\n* fixed DB class error about missing __PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_COMPRESS__ constant\n* you are now __REQUIRED__ to set a correct php timezone. The FuelPHP default value of 'UTC' has been removed, as it would cause date conversion errors that are difficult to find. Most notable, you will have issues with session and cookie expiration.\n* __ALL__ default configuration has been moved to core/config. Only use the app/config folder for application specific overrides of default values, or for custom configuration.\n\n### Backward compability notes\n\nThis release features a new Pagination class that isn't completely backward compatible with the API from previous versions. We have put a lot of effort in emulating the old behaviour of the class, but as PHP doesn't support magic getters/setters for static properties, you'll have to replace those in your code manually when you upgrade to v1.4. The required changes can be found in the [documentation](http://docs.fuelphp.com/classes/pagination.html).\n\n### Removed code (because it was deprecated in v1.3)\n\n* Removed \"auto_encode_view_data\" config key, deprecated in v1.2\n* __Fuel__: Removed ``Fuel::add_module()``, deprecated in v1.2.

1.0.1](https://github.com/fuel/core/compare/1.0/master...1.1/master)\n\n### System changes\n\n* Deprication of `Request::show_404()`, replaced with `throw new HttpNotFoundException` that has a handle method to show the 404\n* Support for `handle()` method that is run when an exception isn't caught before `Error::exception_handler()` catches it.\n* Support for special `_404_` route now in `public/index.php` thus no longer part of the core but still supported as a 'official default'\n* Closures are now also supported in routes, thus routing to a Closure instead of a controler/method uri. Also added support for any type of callable in Route extensions you write yourself.\n* Closure support in all getters & setters: if you get a value and also input a default the default can also be a Closure and you'll get the result of that. For setters the input can also be a closure and the result of the Closure will be set. (except for `View::set()` as one might want to pass a closure to the View)\n* Moved the Environment setting from the `app/config/config.php` file to the `app/bootstrap.php` file.\n* All `factory()` methods have been renamed to `forge()`.  This name better states the method's function.  The `factory()` methods are still there for backwards compatibility, but are deprecated and will log warning messages when used.\n* The `$this->response` Response object is now deprecated.  Your action methods should return either a string, View object, ViewModel object or a Response object.\n* Added the `fuel/app/vendor` directory to the default install.\n* You can now have an unlimited number of sub-directories for your controllers. (e.g. `classes/controller/admin/users/groups.php` with a class name of `Controller_Admin_Users_Groups` would be at `site.com/admin/users/groups`)\n* There is no longer a default controller for directories.  It used to be that going to something like `site.com/admin` would bring up `Controller_Admin_Admin` in `classes/controller/admin/admin.php`.  Now you must place that controller at it's expected location `classes/controller/admin.php` with a name of `Controller_Admin`.\n* A `Controller::after()` method now gets passed the response of the controller, it must return that response (or modified) as well.\n* Added new *function* `get_real_class()` to which you can pass a classname and it will return the actual class, to be used on classes of which you're not sure whether it is an alias or not.\n* Module routes are prepended to the routes array when Fuel detects the fist URI segment as a module, therefor parsing them before an `(:any)` route in the app config.\n* Config is now environment aware and allows partial/full overwriting of the base config from subdirectories in the config dir named after the environment.\n* Added a new `Theme` class.  It allows you to easily add Theme support to your applications.\n* `Fuel_Exception` has been renamed to `FuelException`\n* `Fuel::find_file()` and related methods are now deprecated.  Use the `Finder` class instead (e.g. `Finder::search()`).\n* Migrations are now supported in Modules and Packages\n* Routing has 3 new shortcuts:\n\t* `:almun` matches all utf-8 alphabetical and numeric characters\n\t* `:num` matches all numeric characters.\n\t* `:alpha` matches all utf-8 alphabetical characters\n* Put the `Autoloader` class into `Fuel\\Core` to allow extending it, it must now be required in the app bootstrap file which is also the location where you must require your own extension.\n\n### Security related\n\n* Added Fuel's own response object class `Fuel\\Core\\Response` to default whitelist in `app/config/config.php` of objects that aren't encoded on output by the View when passed.\n* The `security.auto_encode_view_data` config option in `app/config/config.php` has been renamed to `security.auto_filter_output`.\n* `stdClass` was part of the default whitelisted classes from output encoding, this was a bug and it has been removed.\n\n### Specific classes\n\n* __Arr__: Added methods `Arr::get()`, `Arr::set()` and `Arr::prepend()`.\n* __Arr__: `Arr::element()` and `Arr::elements()` have been deprecated.  Use the new `Arr::get()` instead.\n* __Database__: Using transactions will no longer prevent exceptions, exceptions are thrown and should be handled by the dev. The `Database_Transaction` class has been deprecated as it has little use because of this change.\n* __File__: `File::read_dir()` (and related methods on Area and Directory handler) now return dirnames with directory separator suffix\n* __Fieldset_Field__: Parsing of validation rules has been moved from `Fieldset_Field::add_rule()` to `Validaton::_find_fule()`, from the outside the method still works the same but notices for inactive rules are now only shown when running the validation.\n* __Form__: Added inline error reporting, which must first be switched on in config and will replace an `{error_msg}` tag\n* __Form__: New default form template which puts it inside a table.\n* __Fuel__: Added `Fuel::value()` which checks if the given value is a Closure, and returns the result of the Closure if it is, otherwise, simply the value.\n* __Image__: No longer throws `Fuel_Exception` for any type of exception but instead `RuntimeException`, `InvalidArguementException` and `OutOfBoundsException` where appropriate.\n* __Input__: `Input::post(null)` doesn't work to get full post array anymore, just `Input::post()` without params - same for all other Input methods\n* __Input__: `Input::get_post()` has been deprecated and replaced by `Input::param()`.  It now also includes PUT and DELETE variables.\n* __Input / Uri__: `Uri::detect()` moved to `Input::uri()` as it is part of the input and thus should be part of the input class\n* __Request__: You can now also do external requests through the Request class, for now only a curl driver: `Request::forge('http//url', 'curl')` or `Request::forge('http//url', array('driver' => 'curl', 'method' => 'post', 'params' => array())`.\n* __Validation__: `Validation::errors()` is depricated and replaced by singular form `Validation::error()` to be more in line with other class methods\n* __Validation__: New 3rd parameter added to `Validation::run()` that allows adding callables for the duration of the run.\n* __View__: The view class has been refactored and works much better now.  Output filtering is vastly improved.\n* __View__: `View::capture()` has been split into two protected instance methods: `process_file()` and `get_data()`.  You will need to update your View class extensions.\n* __View__: `View::$auto_encode` has been removed.  It has been replaced but auto_filter, which is per-view instance.\n* __ViewModel__: Refactored the class internals to work more transparently with the `View`.\n* __ViewModel__: Deprecated `$this->_template` and renamed it to `$this->_view`.\n* __ViewModel__: Updated to work with the refactored `View` class.  Added `$this->bind()`.\n* __ViewModel__: Deprecated `$this->set_template()` and renamed it to `$this->set_view()`.\n* __Html__: Removed (not deprecated) the following methods: `Html::h()`, `Html::br()`, `Html::hr()`, `Html::nbs()`, `Html::title()`, `Html::header()`.  You should simply write the HTML yourself.\n* __Config__: Added Config file drivers for PHP, INI, JSON and Yaml.  They are detected by file extension (e.g. `Config::load('foo.yml')` will load and parse the Yaml).\n\n### Packages\n\n* __Auth__: Renamed default table name from `simpleusers` to `users`.\n* __Auth__: Added config options for DB connection and table columns used for fetching the user.\n* __Auth__: Removed default config for groups & roles in `simpleauth.php` config file, only commented out examples left.\n* __Orm__: Lots of tweaks to `Observer_Validation` related to changes to `Validation` & `Fieldset_Field` classes. Also changed it to only save properties that are actually changed.\n* __Orm__: The `ValidationFailed` thrown when the `Observer_Validation` fails now includes a reference to the Fieldset instance that failed: `$valfailed->get_fieldset();`\n* __Orm__: Added support for changing the type of join used when fetching relations, example: `Model_Example::query()->related('something', array('join_type' => 'inner'))->get();`\n* __Orm__: Observers are no longer singleton but one instance per model with per model settings, check docs for more info.\n* __Parser__: Added Parser package to the default install.\n* __Parser__: Mustache is now part of the Parser package by default.  Version 0.7.1.\n* __Email__: The Email package is added.\n\n## v1.0\n\n### Core\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/fuel/core/compare/v1.0-rc3...v1.0)\n\n### Auth\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/fuel/auth/compare/v1.0-rc3...v1.0)\n\n### Oil\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/fuel/oil/compare/v1.0-rc3...v1.0)\n\n### Orm\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/fuel/orm/compare/v1.0-rc3...v1.0)\n\n\n## v1.0-RC3\n\n### Core\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/fuel/core/compare/v1.0-rc2.1...v1.0-rc3)\n\n### Auth\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/fuel/auth/compare/v1.0-rc2...v1.0-rc3)\n\n### Oil\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/fuel/oil/compare/v1.0-rc2...v1.0-rc3)\n\n### Orm\n\n[Full Changelog](https://github.com/fuel/orm/compare/v1.0-rc2...v1.0-rc3)\n\n\n## v1.0-RC2.1\n\n### Core\n\n* Fixed a security issue where the URI was not being properly sanitized.\n\n## v1.0-RC2\n\n### Core\n\n* oil refine install now makes the config directory writable.

          "content": "# Testing FuelPHP\n\nFuelPHP uses [PHPUnit](https://github.com/sebastianbergmann/phpunit/) for it's Unit Testing needs. It must be installed for the tests to run.\n\n**NOTE: No code will be accepted without tests written.**\n\n## Running Tests\n\nRunning the unit tests is as simple as navigating to the root install folder on the command line and running the following:\n\n    $ php oil test\n\nThat's it! You can also tell it specific groups (which we will get into in minute) to run. For example to run only the core tests:\n\n    $ php oil test --group=Core\n\nAs you can see we've wrapped the phpunit command with our own Oil utility which will in time become more and more useful. If you wish to get right at the phpunit tests manually you can point it to our .xml configuration file:\n\n\t$ phpunit -c fuel/core/phpunit.xml --group Core\n\nThis may break or change in future versions so it's suggested you stick with using Oil for your testing.\n\n## Writing Tests\n\n### Where do they go?\n\nAll tests are to go in the **tests** folders inside their respective parent folder.  For instance:\n\n* App tests go in *fuel/app/tests*\n* Core tests go in *fuel/core/tests*\n* Package tests go in *fuel/packages/package_name/tests*\n\n### File / Class Naming\n\nThe Test class names should be in the form of **Tests_Whatever**.\n\nFilenames should be all lower case and be the class name minus the \"Tests_\" part.\n\nSome example names:\n\n    // Good\n    Tests_Arr in fuel/core/tests/arr.php\n    Tests_Image in fuel/core/tests/image.php\n    Tests_Fuel in fuel/core/tests/fuel.php\n\n    // Bad\n    Arrtests\n    Somestuff\n\n### Test Grouping\n\nAll tests inside the **core** folder must be in the **core** group.  A classes test's should also be grouped together under the name of the class.\n\nHere is an example of a core class test with proper DocBlocks:\n\n    /**\n     * Arr class tests\n     *\n     * @group Core\n     * @group Arr\n     */\n    class Tests_Arr extends TestCase {\n\n    \t/**\n    \t * Tests Arr::get()\n    \t *\n    \t * @test\n    \t */\n    \tpublic function test_get()\n    \t{\n    \t\t// Test code here\n    \t}\n    }\n\nAll App tests should be in the **app** group.\n\n### Namespaces\n\nAll **core** tests should be in the **Fuel\\Core** namespace.  This is so that we are sure we are testing the core classes,\nnot any extensions that may be in *app*.\n\nApp tests can be in any namespace.\n\n### What class do I extend?\n\nAll tests should extend the **Fuel\\Core\\TestCase** class.\n\n**NOTE: if you are in the Fuel\\Core namespace you can leave off the Fuel\\Core namespace and just extend **TestCase**.\n\n## Example\n\n    namespace Fuel\\Core;\n\n    /**\n     * Arr class tests\n     *\n     * @group Core\n     * @group Arr\n     */\n    class Tests_Arr extends TestCase {\n\n    \t/**\n    \t * Tests Arr::flatten_assoc()\n    \t *\n    \t * @test\n    \t */\n    \tpublic function test_flatten_assoc()\n    \t{\n    \t\t$people = array(\n    \t\t\tarray(\n    \t\t\t\t\"name\" => \"Jack\",\n    \t\t\t\t\"age\" => 21\n    \t\t\t),\n    \t\t\tarray(\n    \t\t\t\t\"name\" => \"Jill\",\n    \t\t\t\t\"age\" => 23\n    \t\t\t)\n    \t\t);\n\n    \t\t$expected = array(\n    \t\t\t\"0:name\" => \"Jack\",\n    \t\t\t\"0:age\" => 21,\n    \t\t\t\"1:name\" => \"Jill\",\n    \t\t\t\"1:age\" => 23\n    \t\t);\n\n    \t\t$output = Arr::flatten_assoc($people);\n    \t\t$this->assertEquals($expected, $output);\n    \t}\n\n    }\n\n"
