Large and \"breaking\" changes should be \ndiscussed ahead of time. **Please ask first**.\n\nHybridauth 3 is compatible with **PHP 5.4** and therefore all code supplied must stick to this requirement.\n\n**License**\n\nHybridauth PHP Library is released under the terms of MIT License: By contributing your code to the project, you agree to\nlicense your contribution under the MIT License. (which means, once you donate your code to the community, it become freely\navailable to everyone to use, or mis-use).\n"

You can also find complete Hybridauth documentation at https://hybridauth.github.io\n\n```php\n$config = [\n    'callback' => 'https://example.com/path/to/script.php',\n    'keys' => [\n        'key' => 'your-twitter-consumer-key',\n        'secret' => 'your-twitter-consumer-secret',\n    ],\n];\n\ntry {\n    $twitter = new Hybridauth\\Provider\\Twitter($config);\n\n    $twitter->authenticate();\n\n    $accessToken = $twitter->getAccessToken();\n    $userProfile = $twitter->getUserProfile();\n    $apiResponse = $twitter->apiRequest('statuses/home_timeline.json');\n}\ncatch (\\Exception $e) {\n    echo 'Oops, we ran into an issue! ' . $e->getMessage();\n}\n```\n\n#### Requirements\n\n* PHP 5.4+\n* PHP Session\n* PHP cURL\n\n#### Installation\n\nTo install Hybridauth we recommend [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), the now defacto dependency manager for PHP. Alternatively, you can download and use the latest release available at [Github](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/releases).\n\n#### Versions Status\n\n| Version | Status      | Repository              | Documentation           | PHP Version |\n|---------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|\n| 2.x     | Maintenance | [v2][hybridauth-2-repo] | [v2][hybridauth-2-docs] | >= 5.3      |\n| 3.x     | Development | [v3][hybridauth-3-repo] | [v3][hybridauth-3-docs] | >= 5.4      |\n| 4.x     | Future      | --                      | --                      | >= 7.3      |\n\n[hybridauth-2-repo]: https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/tree/v2\n[hybridauth-3-repo]: https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth/\n[hybridauth-2-docs]: https://hybridauth.github.io/hybridauth/\n[hybridauth-3-docs]: https://hybridauth.github.io/\n\n#### Questions, Help and Support?\n\nFor general questions (i.e, \"how-to\" questions), please consider using [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/hybridauth) instead of the Github issues tracker.
