I apologize for slowness to release updates. I'm hoping the Pro version can create a bit more motivation to dedicate time to this. I also finally have the build scripts available for download with the Pro version so you all can start addressing bugs yourselves with your own personalized boxes.\n\nThanks to the community for bug fixes and provisioning tips. Special shout-out to [@maxpou](https://github.com/maxpou) for completely killing it with community responses. \n"
