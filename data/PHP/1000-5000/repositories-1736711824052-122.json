By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\n    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."

The word \"Addy\" is internet slang for an email address, e.g.\n\n> \"My addy is being spammed. I should've kept it private.\"\n\n## Why did you make this site?\n\nI made this service after trying a few other options that do a similar thing. I was really interested in how they worked and loved the thought of protecting my real email addresses from spam.\n\nI also wanted to address some issues with other services such as:\n\n* Proprietary closed source code\n* Adverts, analytics and trackers used on the sites\n* No option to encrypt emails using a GPG/OpenPGP key\n* No option for multiple recipients\n\nI made the code open-source to show everyone what was going on behind the scenes and to allow others to help improve the application.\n\nI use this service myself for the vast majority of sites I'm signed up to.\n\n## Why should I use addy.io?\n\nThere are a number of reasons you should consider using this service:\n\n* Protect your real email address from spam by simply deactivating/deleting aliases that receive unsolicited emails\n* Identify who has sold your data by using a different email address for every site\n* Protect your identity in the event of a data breach by making it difficult for hackers to cross-reference your accounts\n* Prevent inbox snooping by encrypting all inbound emails using GPG/OpenPGP encryption\n* Update where emails are forwarded without having to go through and change your email address for each site individually\n* Reply to forwarded emails anonymously without revealing your true email address\n\n## Do you store emails?\n\nEmails are only ever stored in the event of a failed delivery, and only if you have this option enabled in your account settings.\n\n## What is a shared domain alias?\n\nA shared domain alias is any alias that has a domain name that is also shared with other users. For example anyone can generate an alias with the @anonaddy.me domain. Aliases with shared domain names must be pre-generated and cannot be created on-the-fly like standard aliases.\n\n## What is a standard alias?\n\nA standard alias is any alias that can be created on-the-fly. Automatic on-the-fly alias creation is only available for domains that are unique to you. For example, your unique username subdomain, any additional usernames or any custom domains. So if you signed up with the username \"johndoe\", any alias you create using @johndoe.anonaddy.com would be a standard alias (even if you've generated a Random Character/Random Word one).\n\n## Can I use my own domain?\n\nYes you can use your own domain name so you can also have *@example.com as your aliases. To do so you simply need to add a TXT record to verify your ownership of the domain. Then you will need to add an MX record to your domain so that our server can handle incoming emails. You can then add a few other records to enable sending from your domain too.\n\n## Can I add a domain and also use it as a recipient?\n\nNo, you cannot use the same domain as a custom domain and also for a recipient on addy.io.\n\ne.g if you add \"example.com\" as a custom domain, you cannot then add \"xyz@example.com\" as a recipient. This is because a domain cannot direct email to multiple locations simultaneously using MX records. So your email would arrive for \"example.com\" and then attempt to be forwarded to \"xyz@example.com\" which would create a loop.\n\nYou can instead use a subdomain for your custom domain, e.g. \"mail.example.com\" instead of \"example.com\", this would allow you to create *@mail.example.com for your aliases. More details can be found [here](https://addy.io/help/adding-a-custom-domain/).\n\n## Can I add a domain if I'm already using it for email somewhere else?\n\nIf you have a custom domain say **example.com** and you are already using it for email somewhere else e.g. ProtonMail or Namecheap then you cannot also use it simultaneously with addy.io.\n\nThis is because emails cannot be handled by multiple different mail servers at the same time, even if they have the same priority MX records. It can only be delivered to one mail server at a time which will typically be the MX record with the smallest number since this has the highest priority.\n\nYou can either:\n\n- Migrate your domain to addy.io by removing the current provider's MX records and adding addy.io's.\n- Or, if you would like to keep using your domain with your current email provider then I would recommend instead adding a subdomain of it to addy.io such as **mail.example.com**.\n\nUsing a subdomain will not interfere with your current email setup and you'll be able to create aliases ***@mail.example.com** through addy.io.\n\n## Why should I use this instead of a similar service?\n\nHere are a few reasons I can think of:\n\n* Bring your own GPG/OpenPGP key to encrypt your forwarded emails (and the option to replace subjects)\n* No adverts\n* No analytics or trackers (just server access logs)\n* No third party content\n* Open-source application code\n* No limitation on the number of aliases that can be created\n* Generous monthly bandwidth\n* Multiple domains to choose for aliases (currently anonaddy.com, anonaddy.me and more for paid plan users)\n* Ability to generate random character and random word aliases at shared domains\n* Ability to add additional usernames to compartmentalise aliases\n* New features added regularly\n\n## Is there a browser extension?\n\nYes there is an [open-source](https://github.com/anonaddy/browser-extension) browser extension available to download for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/addy_io/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/addyio-anonymous-email-fo/iadbdpnoknmbdeolbapdackdcogdmjpe) (also available on other chromium based browsers such as Brave and Vivaldi). You can use the extension to generate new aliases remotely.\n\n## Is there an Android app?\n\nYes, there is an excellent [open-source](https://gitlab.com/Stjin/anonaddy-android) Android app created by [Stjin](https://twitter.com/Stjinchan) that is available to download from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.stjin.anonaddy) (paid) and [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/host.stjin.anonaddy) (free). The developer of this app has put in a lot of time and effort so if you would like to support him please purchase the Play Store version.\n\nThere is also another [open-source](https://github.com/KhalidWar/anonaddy) Android app created by [KhalidWar](https://github.com/KhalidWar) available on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.khalidwar.anonaddy).\n\n## Is there an iOS app?\n\nYes, [KhalidWar's](https://github.com/KhalidWar) [open-source](https://github.com/KhalidWar/anonaddy) app from above is also available on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/addymanager/id1547461270).\n\n## Is there a Raycast extension?\n\nYes, [http.james'](https://httpjames.space/) [open-source](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/tree/cceffa51046266f25819f800316561b783c52663/extensions/anonaddy/) extension is available on the [Raycast Store](https://www.raycast.com/http.james/anonaddy).\n\n## How do I add my own GPG/OpenPGP key for encryption?\n\nOn the recipients page you simply need to click \"Add public key\" and paste in your **public** key data. Now all emails forwarded to you will be encrypted with your key. You can even hide and encrypt the subject as addy.io supports protected headers.\n\n## Are attachments encrypted too?\n\nYes attachments are part of the email body and are also encrypted if you have it enabled.\n\n## Are forwarded emails signed when encryption is enabled?\n\nYes when you have encryption enabled all forwarded emails are signed using our no-reply@addy.io private key.\n\nYou can add this key to your own keyring so that you can verify emails have come from us.\n\nThe fingerprint of the no-reply@addy.io key is \"26A987650243B28802524E2F809FD0D502E2F695\" you can find the key on [https://keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=26A987650243B28802524E2F809FD0D502E2F695).\n\n## Can I reply/send from aliases using encryption?\n\n1. If the person you are sending your message to **already uses GPG/OpenPGP encryption** then you can simply encrypt your reply/send from your alias using their public key.\n\n2. If the person you are sending your message to **does not use GPG/OpenPGP encryption** then you can instead encrypt your reply/send with the `no-reply@addy.io` [public key](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=26A987650243B28802524E2F809FD0D502E2F695) (<span class=\"break-words\">\"26A987650243B28802524E2F809FD0D502E2F695\"</span>). Your reply/send will then be **automatically decrypted** on the addy.io server before being sent on to the correct destination in clear text. This is useful if you wish to hide your replies/sends from your email provider such as Gmail.\n\n## Is my public GPG/OpenPGP key removed when I reply/send from an alias?\n\nYes, any attached GPG/OpenPGP public keys or GPG/OpenPGP signatures are automatically removed when replying or sending from an alias. This is to prevent you accidentally revealing your real email address which is usually shown as an identity in your public key.\n\n## Can I mark emails forwarded to me by addy.io as spam?\n\nNo, you must not mark messages forwarded to you by addy.io as spam as this can damage the reputation of the mail servers and is against the [terms and conditions](https://addy.io/terms/).\n\nIf an alias is receiving spam messages then please deactivate it or delete it.\n\naddy.io is signed up to multiple feedback loops (FBLs) that trigger a notification when any messages are marked as spam. Repeatedly marking messages as spam will result in your account being disabled.\n\n## Can I use aliases to create multiple accounts on other websites and services?\n\nNo, you must not use addy.io to create large numbers of accounts on other websites/services as this is against the [terms and conditions](https://addy.io/terms/).\n\n## Can I have multiple Free accounts?\n\nHaving multiple Free accounts is not considered an acceptable use of our service. Any users found to be abusing this rule may have their accounts disabled. This does not apply to those with a paid subscription.\n\n## What if I don't want anyone to link ownership of my aliases together?\n\nIf you're concerned that your aliases are all linked by your username e.g. @johndoe.anonaddy.com, then you have a couple of options:\n\n1. You can generate random character or random word aliases instead, these are all under a shared domain and cannot be linked to a user.\n2. You can add additional usernames and separate your aliases under each of them. e.g. you could have one username for personal stuff, another for work, another for hobbies etc.\n\n## Where is the server located?\n\nThe server is located in Amsterdam, Netherlands with [Greenhost.net](https://greenhost.net/). Greenhost focuses greatly on privacy and security and their servers run entirely on Dutch wind energy. The backup mail server is located in Warsaw, Poland with [UpCloud](https://upcloud.com).\n\n## What if I don't trust you?\n\nIt's good to keep your guard up when online so you should never trust anyone 100%. I'll try my best to be as honest and transparent as I can but if you still aren't convinced you can always just fire up your own server and self-host this application. You'll need to know about server administration and PHP.

This is to prevent anybody signing up with the same username in the future.\n* Any subscription information is deleted from the database\n\n## Does this work with any email provider?\n\nYes this will work with any provider, although I can't guarantee it won't land in spam initially.\n\n## How do I reply to a forwarded email?\n\nEach forwarded email has a From: header set. This header will look something like this:\n\nFrom: <<span class=\"break-words\"><alias+hello=example.com@johndoe.anonaddy.com></span>>\n\nWhere hello@example.com is the address of the person who sent you the email and alias@johndoe.anonaddy.com is the alias that forwarded you the email.\n\nAll you need to do is click reply in your email client or web interface and it will automatically fill the To: field with the correct address.\n\nTo check if a reply has worked properly check in your dashboard if the reply count has been incremented for that alias.\n\nFor further details please see this help article - [Replying to email using an alias](https://addy.io/help/replying-to-email-using-an-alias/).\n\n## I'm trying to reply/send from an alias but the email keeps coming back to me, what's wrong?\n\nIf you are trying to reply or send from an alias but the email keeps coming back to yourself then it is most likely because you are not sending the message from an email address that **is not listed as a verified recipient** on your addy.io account.\n\nIf you try to reply or send from an alias using an unverified email address then the message will simply be forwarded to you as it would be if it was sent by any other sender.\n\nPlease double check that you are indeed sending from a verified recipient email address by inspecting your sent items to see which address it was actually sent from.\n\n## I'm trying to reply/send from an alias but it is rejected, what's wrong?\n\nIf you see the rejection message `550 5.1.1 Recipient address rejected: Address does not exist` then this means that the alias has either been deleted or does not yet exist (and you do not have catch-all enabled), you must restore (or create) it before you can send/reply from it.\n\nIf you receive an email notification with the subject \"Attempted reply/send from alias has failed\" then it is usually because you have a verified recipient that is using your own domain which does not have a DMARC policy.\n\n> Note: This is referring to **your verified recipient address** on your addy.io account **and not** any of your custom domains or the email address that you are replying / sending to\n\nWhen replying or sending from an alias, **additional checks** are carried out to ensure it is not a spoofed email. Your addy.io recipient's email domain must pass DMARC checks in order to protect against spoofed emails and to make sure that the reply/send from attempt definitely came from your recipient.\n\nFor example if the verified recipient on your addy.io account is `hello@example.com` and you get this email notification then it is because the domain \"example.com\" does not have a DMARC policy in place.\n\nTo resolve this you simply need to add a DMARC record, for example:\n\n| Type | Host   | Value                       |\n|:-----|:-------|:----------------------------|\n| TXT  | _dmarc | \"v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; adkim=s\" |\n\n\nYou should also have SPF and DKIM records in place.\n\nTo learn more about DMARC please see this site - [https://dmarc.org/](https://dmarc.org/).\n\nIf your addy.io recipient is with a popular mail service provider for example: Gmail, Outlook, Tutanota, Mailbox.org, Protonmail etc. then they will already have a DMARC policy in place so you do not need to take any action.\n\n## I've been forwarded an email with a red warning banner saying it may have been spoofed, what does it mean?\n\nIf an incoming email looks like spam (for example, because it has failed its [DMARC](https://dmarc.org/overview/) check) then a red warning banner is added by addy.io before forwarding the message on to you. This warning banner is added in order to help protect you from any potential phishing attempts, for example someone pretending to be your bank.\n\nMost of the time this is nothing to worry about and is just because the sender has not correctly configured their DNS records.\n\nTo see why this banner was added you can view the headers of the received email and look for the header called 'X-AnonAddy-Authentication-Results'. This header shows the original email's authentication results and will show you why the email failed its DMARC checks.\n\n## Does addy.io strip out the banner information when I reply to an email?\n\nYes, the email banner \"This email was sent to...\" will be automatically removed when you reply to any messages. You can test this by replying to yourself from one of your aliases.\n\nMake sure not to alter or edit the email banner as this may cause issues when trying to match and remove it. You can still remove it manually from the quoted message of your reply if you wish.\n\n## How do I send email from an alias?\n\nThis works in the same way as replying to an email.\n\nLet's say that you have the alias **first@johndoe.anonaddy.com** and you want to send an email to **hello@example.com**.\n\nAll you need to do is enter the following in the To: field.\n\n<<span class=\"break-words\"><first+hello=example.com@johndoe.anonaddy.com></span>>\n\n> **Note**: you must send the email from a verified recipient on your account.\n\nThen send the email exactly as you would any other. To check that the email has sent successfully, look in your dashboard at the sent count column and see if it has been incremented for that alias.\n\nIf you want an easy way to construct the correct email address that you should send to you can click \"Send from\" next to any alias in the web application and after entering the destination address it will display the right email address to use.\n\nThis works exactly the same for shared domain aliases, additional usernames and custom domains.\n\nYou can even use the send from feature to create an alias on the fly that does not yet exist. This only works for standard aliases or those at custom domains that behave as a catch-all.\n\nYou must generate aliases that use shared domains (e.g. circus.waltz449@anonaddy.me) beforehand in order to be able to send from them.\n\nIf you need to send an email to an address with an extension e.g. **hello+whatever@example.com** then it's exactly the same method:\n\n<<span class=\"break-words\"><first+hello+whatever=example.com@johndoe.anonaddy.com></span>>\n\nJust enter the extension too!\n\nFor further details please see this help article - [Sending email from an alias](https://addy.io/help/sending-email-from-an-alias/).\n\n## Will people see my real email if I reply to a forwarded one?\n\nNo, your real email will not be shown, the email will look as if it has come from us instead. Just make sure not to include anything that might identify you when composing the reply, i.e. your full name.\n\n## Can emails have attachments?\n\nYes you can add attachments to emails forwarded and replies. Attachments count towards your bandwidth.\n\n## What is the max email size limit?\n\nThe max email size is currently set to 25MB (including attachments).\n\n## What happens if I have a subscription but then cancel it?\n\nIf you cancel your subscription it will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle, you will still be able to use your paid plan features until the billing cycle ends.\n\nA few days before your billing cycle ends you will receive an email letting you know the steps you need to take to prevent the loss of any emails. Shortly after ending the following will happen:\n\n* Any custom domains will be **deactivated**\n* Any additional usernames will be **deactivated**\n* If you have any more than **1 recipient** they will be **deleted**\n* Paid account settings will be reverted to default values\n* Any aliases using paid plan only domains will be **deactivated**\n* If you have any more than 10 aliases using a shared domain e.g. anonaddy.me they will be **deactivated**\n* If your account username has catch-all disabled then it will be enabled\n\nYou will not be able to activate any of the above again until you resubscribe.\n\n## If I subscribe will Stripe see my real email address?\n\nWhen you subscribe you can choose which email to provide to Stripe, feel free to use an alias. This email will be used for notifications from Stripe such as; if your card payment fails or if your card has expired.\n\n## Do you offer student discount?\n\nCurrently, addy.io does not offer any student discounts.\n\n## How do you prevent spammers?\n\nThe following is in place to help prevent spam:\n\n* Rspamd - Fast, free and open-source spam filtering system\n* DNS blacklist checks - spamhaus.org\n* SPF, DKIM - to check the SPF record on the sender's domain\n* DMARC - to check for email spoofing and reject emails that fail\n* FQDN - the sender must be using a valid fully qualified domain name\n* PTR record check - if the sender has no valid PTR record it is rejected\n\n## What do you use to do DNS lookups on domain names?\n\nThe server is running a local DNS caching server to improve the speed of queries.\n\n## Is there a limit to how many emails I can forward?\n\nNot unless you are really going to town. Each user is throttled to 200 emails per hour through the server.\n\n## Is there a limit to how many aliases I can create per hour?\n\nCurrently you are limited to creating 10 new aliases per hour on the free plan, 20 per hour on the Lite plan and 50 per hour on the Pro plan. If you try to create more than this the emails will be deferred until you are back below the limit.\n\n## How is my bandwidth calculated?\n\nEach time a new email is received Postfix calculates its size in bytes. A column in the database is then simply incremented by that size when the email is forwarded or a reply is sent. At the start of each month your bandwidth is reset to 0.\n\nI don't use rolling 30 day total as the only way to do this would be to log the date and size of every single email received.\n\nBlocked emails do not count towards your bandwidth (e.g. if an alias is inactive or deleted).\n\n## How many emails can I receive before I go over my bandwidth limit?\n\nThe average email is about 76800 bytes (75KB), this is roughly equivalent to 7,000 words in plain text. So the 10MB monthly allowance would be around 140 emails and the Lite plan's 100MB would be almost 1,400 emails.\n\n## What happens if I go over my bandwidth limit in a given month?\n\nIf you get close to your limit (over 80%) you'll be sent an email letting you know. If you continue and go over your limit the server will respond to any delivery attempts to your aliases with the following: `552 5.2.2 Recipient address rejected: User over quota` until your bandwidth resets the next month or you upgrade your plan.\n\n## Can I login using an additional username?\n\nYes, you can login with any of your usernames. You can add 5 additional username as a Lite user and up to 20 additional usernames as a Pro user for totals of 6 and 21 respectively (including the one you signed up with).\n\n## I'm not receiving any emails, what's wrong?\n\nPlease make sure to add no-reply@addy.io and any aliases you use to your address book and also to check your spam folder. Make sure to mark emails from addy.io as safe if they turn up in spam.\n\nIf an alias has been deleted and you try to send email to it, the emails will be rejected with an error message - \"550 5.1.1 Recipient address rejected: Address does not exist\".\n\nCheck that you have not deactivated the alias, custom domain or additional username. When any of these are deactivated, emails will be silently discarded, they will not be rejected or return any error message.\n\nThe sender of the email may be failing SPF, DMARC or DNS blacklist checks resulting in the email being rejected. The sender should also have correct reverse DNS setup and use a FQDN as their hostname.\n\nIf you are forwarding emails to an icloud.com email address some users are having issues with a small number of emails being rejected (often those from Facebook).\n\nFor some reason Apple seems to think these emails are spam/phishing and returns this error message:\n\n> Diagnostic-Code: smtp; 550 5.7.1 [CS01] Message rejected due to local policy.\n\nIf you are having issues with emails being rejected as \"possibly spammy\" by Google, iCloud or Microsoft then please try the following steps if you can:\n\n1. **Replace the email subject** by going to your settings in addy.io\n2. Try adding a GPG key and **enabling encryption**. This will prevent the email's content being scanned and reduce the chance of it being rejected.\n3. Enable the option to hide and encrypt the email subject\n4. Try disabling the banner information on forwarded emails\n5. Try adding the alias email (and/or domain) to your contact list (address book) or safe senders list if possible\n\nFor Outlook, Hotmail or MSN you can find instructions on how to add a domain to your safe senders list [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/safe-senders-in-outlook-com-470d4ee6-e3b6-402b-8cd9-a6f00eda7339).\n\nI will also soon be adding an option to change the format of the display from part of the \"From:\" header.\n\nIf neither of the above options work then please try changing to another recipient so that you can continue to receive emails.\n\nIf you still aren't receiving emails please contact me.\n\n## I'm having trouble logging in, what's wrong?\n\nIf you are having trouble logging in it will likely fall under one of the following scenarios:\n\n1. Incorrect username\n\nPlease make sure you are using your account username (e.g. johndoe) and not your email address to try to login.\n\n2. Forgotten password\n\nIf you've forgotten your password you can reset it by entering your username here - https://app.addy.io/password/reset\n\n3. Forgotten username\n\nIf you've forgotten your username you can request a reminder by entering your email address here - https://app.addy.io/username/reminder\n\n4. Lost 2FA device\n\nPlease use the backup code that you were shown when you enabled 2FA.\n\n5. Errors with hardware security key\n\nIf you have a YubiKey and are using Windows and have an issue with your personal password/PIN you may need to reset the key using the YubiKey manager software.\n\n## How do I know this site won't disappear next month?\n\nI am very passionate about this project. I use it myself every day and will be keeping it running indefinitely. The service also provides me with an income.\n\n## What happens to addy.io if you die?\n\nI do have someone in place who can keep the service running in the event of me not being here. They are able to continue paying for the servers that host addy.io and the domains that it uses. All addy.io domains also always have over 5 years until they expire.\n\nThey would make a Twitter announcement informing all users that they would be keeping the service running. You would then be able to decide whether you'd like to continue using addy.io or start to update your email addresses.\n\n## Is the application tested?\n\nYes it has over 200 automated PHPUnit tests written.\n\n## How do I host this myself?\n\nYou will need to set up your own server with Postfix so that you can pipe the received mail to the application. You can find more information here [https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy#self-hosting](https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy#self-hosting).\n\nFor those who prefer using Docker there is an image you can use here - [github.com/anonaddy/docker](https://github.com/anonaddy/docker).\n\n## Who's behind addy.io?\n\nMy name is Will Browning, I'm a web developer from the UK and an advocate for online privacy and open-source software.

These listings can easily be removed once you've correctly set up the server.\n\nIf the IP is on many blacklists specifically for sending out spam then it migt be best to destroy it and deploy a new one. You might notice that some providers such as Vultr have entire ranges of IPs listed.\n\nThroughout these instructions I will be running all commands as a sudo user called `johndoe`. The domain used will be `example.com` and the hostname `mail.example.com`. I'll be using Vultr for this example (Note: if you also use Vultr for managing DNS records they do not currently support TSLA records required for DANE).\n\nTo check your server's hostname run:\n\n```bash\nhostname -f\n```\n\nIf your hostname is not what it should be update it by running:\n\n```bash\nsudo hostnamectl set-hostname mail.example.com\n```\n\nMaking sure to replace mail.example.com with your own domain.\n\n## DNS records\n\nNow let's add some basic DNS records.\n\nWe'll start with the MX record. This tells email sent to your domain where it should go.\n\n```\nMX @ mail.example.com\n```\n\nWe want to direct it to our server's fully qualifed domain name (FQDN). Give it a priority of 10 (or just make sure it has the lowest priority if you have other MX records).\n\nIf you want to be able to also use wildcard subdomains e.g. (alias@username.example.com) then you also need to add a wildcard MX record:\n\n```\nMX * mail.example.com\n```\n\nThis will tell email sent to any subdomain of example.com to go to the same place.\n\nAdd a wildcard A and AAAA (if using IPv6) record too if you want to use all subdomains (or just an A record for unsubscribe.example.com if not).\n\n```\nA * <Your-IPv4-address>\nAAAA * <Your-IPv6-address>\n```\n\nIf you want to just use the example.com domain and not bother with subdomains then you can skip the wildcard MX, A, AAAA records above (you will still need to add MX and A/AAAA for unsubscribe.example.com though to handle deactivating aliases).\n\nNext we will add an explicit A record for the hostname `mail.example.com` and for where the web app will be located `app.example.com`\n\n```\nA mail.example.com <Your-IPv4-address>\nA app.example.com <Your-IPv4-address>\n```\n\nIf you are using IPv6 then you will also need to add an AAAA record\n\n```\nAAAA mail.example.com <Your-IPv6-address>\nAAAA app.example.com <Your-IPv6-address>\n```\n\nMake sure to replace the placeholders above with the actual IP address of your server.\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center mb-4\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/dns-records.png\" alt=\"DNS records\" title=\"DNS records\">\n</div>\n\nNow we need to set up the correct PTR record for reverse DNS lookups. This needs to be set as your FQDN (fully qualified domain name) which in our case is mail.example.com.\n\nOn your server run `host <Your-IPv4-address>` to check what it is.\n\nYou will likely need to login to your hosting provider to update your PTR record.\n\nIn Vultr you can update your reverse DNS by clicking on your server, then going to the settings tab, then IPv4 and click on the value in the \"Reverse DNS\" column.\n\nChange it to `mail.example.com`. Don't forget to update this for IPv6 if you are using it too.\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center mb-4\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/reverse-dns-ipv4.png\" alt=\"Reverse DNS IPv4\" title=\"Reverse DNS IPv4\">\n</div>\n\nYou can check that it is set correctly by entering your IPv4 and IPv6 addresses here [https://mxtoolbox.com/ReverseLookup.aspx](https://mxtoolbox.com/ReverseLookup.aspx).\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/reverse-dns-ipv6.png\" alt=\"Reverse DNS IPv6\" title=\"Reverse DNS IPv6\">\n</div>\n\n## Installing Postfix\n\nNow we're going to install our MTA (mail transfer agent) Postfix.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install postfix\n```\nFor configuration type select \"Internet Site\".\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center mb-4\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/postfix-install.png\" alt=\"Postfix install\" title=\"Postfix install\">\n</div>\n\nFor System mail name: enter \"example.com\" note the missing mail subdomain.\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center mb-4\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/postfix-install-2.png\" alt=\"Postfix install system name\" title=\"Postfix install system name\">\n</div>\n\nPostfix should now begin installing.\n\nIf you would like to check the version of Postfix that you are running you can do:\n\n```bash\nsudo postconf mail_version\n```\n\nAt the time of writing this I am running `mail_version = 3.6.4`.\n\nWe'll install an extension we will need later so that Postfix can query our database.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install postfix-mysql\n```\n\nNow let's update our Postfix config file.

(you can install git by running `sudo apt install git`)\n\n```bash\ncd ~\ngit clone https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh.git\ncd ./acme.sh\n./acme.sh --install\n```\n<div class=\"flex justify-center mb-4\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/acme-install.png\" alt=\"acme.sh install\" title=\"acme.sh install\">\n</div>\n\nYou should set up automatic DNS API integration for wildcard certs if you are using them, this will allow automatic renewal of your certificates.\n\n[https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh#8-automatic-dns-api-integration](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh#8-automatic-dns-api-integration)\n\nFor example, instructions for Vultr are here - [https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi#82-use-vultr-dns-api-to-automatically-issue-cert](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi#82-use-vultr-dns-api-to-automatically-issue-cert)\n\nI would run:\n\n```bash\nexport VULTR_API_KEY=\"<Your API key>\"\n```\n\nTo install the certificate run:\n\n```bash\n./acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d '*.example.com' --dns dns_vultr \\\n--keylength 4096 \\\n--key-file       /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.key  \\\n--fullchain-file /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.crt \\\n--reloadcmd     \"service nginx force-reload\"\n```\n\nMake sure to change example.com to your domain.\n\nYou might see the following error message \"Run reload cmd: service nginx force-reload nginx.service is not active, cannot reload.\", this can be ignored.\n\nYou can now type `exit` to go back to the `johndoe` user instead of `root`.\n\n## Installing MariaDB\n\nAt the time of writing this the latest stable release is v11.1. Make sure to check for any newer releases.\n\nFollow the instructions on this link to install MariaDB:\n\n[https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config&d=22.04+%22jammy%22&v=11.1&r_m=starburst](https://mariadb.org/download/?t=repo-config&d=22.04+%22jammy%22&v=11.1&r_m=starburst)\n\nMake sure it is running correctly and check the version\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl status mariadb\nsudo mariadb -V\n```\n\nAt the time of writing this I am using \"mariadb from 11.1.2-MariaDB, client 15.2\"\n\nWhen running securing mariadb Answer `no` for \"Switch to unix_socket authentication\" and `yes` for \"Change the root password?\" (Set a secure MySQL root password and make a note of it somewhere e.g. password manager.). Answer `yes` (default) to the other questions.\n\n```bash\nsudo mariadb-secure-installation\n```\n\nNext we're going to create the database and also a user with correct permissions.\n\n```bash\nsudo mariadb -u root -p\n```\nOnce in the MariaDB shell create a new database called anonaddy_database (or whatever you like)\n\n```sql\nCREATE DATABASE anonaddy_database DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;\n```\n\nThen create a new user and give them a strong password (replace below)\n\n```sql\nCREATE USER 'anonaddy'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'STRONG-PASSWORD-HERE';\n```\n\nGrant the user privileges for the new database.\n\n```sql\nGRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON anonaddy_database.* TO 'anonaddy'@'localhost';\n```\n\nNext flush privileges and exit the MariaDB shell.\n\n```sql\nFLUSH PRIVILEGES;\nexit\n```\n\nCreate a new file `/etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-alias-domains-and-subdomains.cf` and enter the following inside:\n\n```sql\nuser = anonaddy\npassword = your-database-password\nhosts = 127.0.0.1\ndbname = anonaddy_database\nquery = SELECT (SELECT 1 FROM usernames WHERE '%s' IN (CONCAT(username, '.example.com'))) AS usernames, (SELECT 1 FROM domains WHERE domain = '%s' AND domain_verified_at IS NOT NULL) AS domains LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nIf you need to add multiple domains then just update the above query to:\n\n```sql\nquery = SELECT (SELECT 1 FROM usernames WHERE '%s' IN (CONCAT(username, '.example.com'),CONCAT(username, '.example2.com'))) AS usernames, (SELECT 1 FROM domains WHERE domain = '%s' AND domain_verified_at IS NOT NULL) AS domains LIMIT 1;\n```\n\nThis file is responsible for determining whether the server should accept email for a certain domain/subdomain. If no results are found from the query then the email will not be accepted.\n\nThe reason these SQL queries are not all nicely formatted is because they have to be on one line.\n\nUpdate the permissions and the group of this file:\n\n```bash\nsudo chmod o= /etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-alias-domains-and-subdomains.cf\n\nsudo chgrp postfix /etc/postfix/mysql-virtual-alias-domains-and-subdomains.cf\n```\n\nLet's also restart Postfix now that we have created the files for it:\n\n```bash\nsudo service postfix restart\n```\n\n## Installing Redis\n\nRedis is an advanced key-value store that we will use for caching, sessions, queues and more. To install Redis, run the following commands (instructions from [https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/](https://redis.io/docs/getting-started/installation/install-redis-on-linux/)):\n\n```bash\n# Install prerequisites\nsudo apt install lsb-release curl gpg\n\ncurl -fsSL https://packages.redis.io/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg\n\necho \"deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/redis-archive-keyring.gpg] https://packages.redis.io/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/redis.list\n\nsudo apt update\n\nsudo apt install redis-server\n```\n\nNext edit the Redis config file.\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/redis/redis.conf\n```\n\nFind the line with `supervised auto` and update it to `supervised systemd`. Also make sure the line `bind 127.0.0.1 -::1` is present and uncommented which binds Redis to localhost.\n\nNext we will add a strong password for Redis in the same redis.conf file.\n\nFind the line `# requirepass foobared`, uncomment this line and change \"foobared\" to a very strong password. (You can generate one using `openssl rand 60 | openssl base64 -A`)\n\nSave the file and restart Redis to reflect the changes.\n\n```bash\nsudo service redis-server restart\n```\n\nNow run:\n\n```bash\nredis-cli\n```\n\nThen type `ping`. You'll be promted for the password we just added. You can enter `auth your-password` to authenticate.\n\nType `exit` to quit the redis-cli.\n\n## Installing Rspamd\n\nRspamd is a fast, free and open-source spam filtering system. It can also handle DKIM/ARC signing, SPF checks, DMARC checks, DKIM checks, RBLs and much more.\n\nTo install Rspamd run the following commands (instructions from [https://www.rspamd.com/downloads.html](https://www.rspamd.com/downloads.html)):\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install -y lsb-release wget gpg\n\nCODENAME=`lsb_release -c -s`\n\nsudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings\n\nwget -O- https://rspamd.com/apt-stable/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg > /dev/null\n\necho \"deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt-stable/ $CODENAME main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list\n\necho \"deb-src [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/rspamd.gpg] http://rspamd.com/apt-stable/ $CODENAME main\"  | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rspamd.list\n\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt --no-install-recommends install rspamd\n```\n\nNext let's use Rspamd to create a new DKIM key pair.\n\nFirst make a new directory:\n\n```bash\nsudo mkdir /var/lib/rspamd/dkim\n```\n\nChange the below command from `example.com` to your domain name:\n\n```bash\nsudo rspamadm dkim_keygen -s 'default' -b 2048 -d example.com -k /var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.key | sudo tee -a /var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.pub\n```\n\nSet the correct ownership and permissions:\n\n```bash\nsudo chown -R _rspamd: /var/lib/rspamd/dkim\nsudo chmod 750 /var/lib/rspamd/dkim\nsudo chmod 440 /var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.key /var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.pub\n```\n\nYou will now need to create a new TXT record for your domain for this key.\n\n```bash\nsudo cat /var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.pub\n```\n\n```\ndefault._domainkey IN TXT ( \"v=DKIM1;

p=none; sp=none; adkim=r; aspf=r; pct=100;\"\n```\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/dns-records-2.png\" alt=\"DNS records DMARC\" title=\"DNS records DMARC\">\n</div>\n\nNow we need to create a signing table to tell Rspamd which domains we want it to sign with DKIM and also which key to use.\n\nCreate a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/dkim_signing.conf` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\nsigning_table = [\n\"*@example.com example.com\",\n\"*@*.example.com example.com\",\n];\n\nkey_table = [\n\"example.com example.com:default:/var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.key\",\n];\n\nuse_domain = \"envelope\";\nallow_hdrfrom_mismatch = true;\nallow_hdrfrom_mismatch_sign_networks = true;\nallow_username_mismatch = true;\nuse_esld = true;\nsign_authenticated = false;\n```\n\nAs we want to use Authenticated Reply Chain (ARC) signing too, let's copy that file:\n\n```bash\nsudo cp /etc/rspamd/local.d/dkim_signing.conf /etc/rspamd/local.d/arc.conf\n```\n\nCreate a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/redis.conf` and enter the following inside (making sure to update with your Redis password set earlier):\n\n```\nwrite_servers = \"localhost\";\npassword = \"your-redis-password\";\nread_servers = \"localhost\";\n```\n\nCreate a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/classifier-bayes.conf` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\nbackend = \"redis\";\n```\n\nCreate a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/logging.inc` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\nlevel = \"error\";\ndebug_modules = [];\n```\n\nIf you want to enable greylisting (more details [here](https://www.rspamd.com/doc/modules/greylisting.html)) then create a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/greylist.conf` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\nservers = \"127.0.0.1:6379\";\n```\n\nCreate a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/history_redis.conf` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\nsubject_privacy = true;\n```\n\nNow let's setup the handling of DMARC for incoming messages, create a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/dmarc.conf` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\nactions = {\n  quarantine = \"add_header\";\n  reject = \"reject\";\n}\n```\n\nHere we are telling Rspamd to add a header to any message that fails DMARC checks and has a policy of `p=quarantine` and to reject any message that fails DMARC checks with a policy `p=reject`. You can change reject to \"add_header\"; too if you would still like to see these messages.\n\nNext we'll configure the headers to add, create a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/milter_headers.conf` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\nuse = [\"authentication-results\", \"remove-headers\", \"spam-header\", \"add_dmarc_allow_header\"];\n\nroutines {\n  remove-headers {\n    headers {\n      \"X-Spam\" = 0;\n      \"X-Spamd-Bar\" = 0;\n      \"X-Spam-Level\" = 0;\n      \"X-Spam-Status\" = 0;\n      \"X-Spam-Flag\" = 0;\n    }\n  }\n  authentication-results {\n    header = \"X-AnonAddy-Authentication-Results\";\n    remove = 0;\n  }\n  spam-header {\n    header = \"X-AnonAddy-Spam\";\n    value = \"Yes\";\n    remove = 0;\n  }\n}\n\ncustom {\n  add_dmarc_allow_header = <<EOD\nreturn function(task, common_meta)\n  if task:has_symbol('DMARC_POLICY_ALLOW') then\n    return nil,\n    {['X-AnonAddy-Dmarc-Allow'] = 'Yes'},\n    {['X-AnonAddy-Dmarc-Allow'] = 0},\n    {}\n  end\n\n  return nil,\n  {},\n  {['X-AnonAddy-Dmarc-Allow'] = 0},\n  {}\nend\nEOD;\n}\n```\n\nThe authentication results header will give information on whether the message passed SPF, DKIM and DMARC checks and the spam header will be added if it fails any of these.\n\nThe custom routine we've created `add_dmarc_allow_header` will simply add a header to messages that have the `DMARC_POLICY_ALLOW` symbol present Rspamd. We will use this to only allow replies / sends from aliases that are explicity permitted by their DMARC policy, in order to prevent anyone spoofing any of your recipient's email addresses.\n\nTo see the currently enabled modules in Rspamd we can run:\n\n```bash\nsudo rspamadm configdump -m\n```\n\nLet's disable a few modules to keep Rspamd nice and lightweight.\n\nWe can run the following command for each module we wish to disable.\n\n```bash\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/module_name.conf\n```\n\nLet's disable the following modules:\n\n```bash\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/fuzzy_check.conf\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/asn.conf\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/metadata_exporter.conf\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/trie.conf\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/neural.conf\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/chartable.conf\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/ratelimit.conf\necho \"enabled = false;\" | sudo tee -a /etc/rspamd/override.d/replies.conf\n```\n\nRestart Rspamd to reflect the changes.\n\n```bash\nsudo service rspamd restart\n```\n\nYou can view the Rspamd web interface by creating an SSH tunnel by running the following command on your local pc:\n\n```bash\nssh -L 11334:localhost:11334 johndoe@example.com\n```\n\nThen you will be able to visit [http://localhost:11334/](http://localhost:11334/) in your web browser.\n\nYou may need to change the scores for a couple of symbols to 0 since AnonAddy uses a different email in the display from and email from.\n\nCreate a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/groups.conf` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\ngroup \"headers\" {\n  symbols {\n    \"FAKE_REPLY\" {\n      weight = 0.0;\n    }\n\n    \"FROM_NEQ_DISPLAY_NAME\" {\n      weight = 0.0;\n    }\n\n    \"FORGED_RECIPIENTS\" {\n      weight = 0.0;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nRestart Rspamd to reflect the changes.\n\n```bash\nsudo service rspamd restart\n```\n\n## The web application\n\nNext let's get the actual AnonAddy application from GitHub.\n\n```bash\ncd /var/www/\ngit clone https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy.git\ncd /var/www/anonaddy\n```\n\nMake sure composer is installed (`composer -V`), if not then goto - [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/) for instructions.\n\nYou can add the following flags when running the composer-setup.php command to add it to your $PATH:\n\n```bash\nsudo php composer-setup.php --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer\n```\n\nBefore running the NVM install script below make sure that you have a `~/.bashrc` file. If not create one by running `touch ~/.bashrc` so that the NVM installer can be added to your $PATH. Also create a `~/.bash_profile` and add:\n\n```bash\nif [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then\n  . ~/.bashrc\nfi\n```\n\nMake sure node is installed (`node -v`) if not then install it using NVM - [https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04#option-3-installing-node-using-the-node-version-manager](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-on-ubuntu-22-04#option-3-installing-node-using-the-node-version-manager)\n\nAt the time of writing this I'm using the latest LTS - v18.18.2\n\nNext copy the .env.example file and update it with correct values (database password, app url, redis password etc.) then install the dependencies.\n\n```bash\ncd /var/www/anonaddy\n\ncp .env.example .env\nnano .env\n\ncomposer install --prefer-dist --no-dev -o && npm install\nnpm run production\n```\n\nMake sure to update the database settings, redis password and the AnonAddy variables. You can use Redis for queue, sessions and cache.\n\nWe'll set `ANONADDY_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT` shortly.\n\n`APP_KEY` will be generated in the next step, this is used by Laravel for securely encrypting values.\n\nFor more information on Laravel configuration please visit - [https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/configuration](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/configuration)\n\nFor the `ANONADDY_DKIM_SIGNING_KEY` you only need to fill in this variable if you plan to add any custom domains through the web application.\n\nYou can either use the same private DKIM signing key we generated earlier whilst setting up Rspamd.\n\nOr you can generate a new private/public keypair and give your user `johndoe` ownership of the private key.\n\nIf you want to use the same key we already generated then you will need to add `johndoe` to the `_rspamd` group by running:\n\n```\nsudo usermod -a -G _rspamd johndoe\n```\n\nMake sure to also run `sudo chmod g+r /var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.key` so that your johndoe user has read permissions for the file.\n\nYou may also need to run `sudo chmod g+x /var/lib/rspamd/dkim`.\n\nYou'll need to log out and back in again for the changes to take effect.\n\nYou can test it by running `cat /var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.key` as the johndoe user to see if it can be displayed.\n\nThen update your `.env` file.\n\n```\nANONADDY_DKIM_SIGNING_KEY=/var/lib/rspamd/dkim/example.com.default.key\n```\n\nThen we will generate an app key, migrate the database, link the storage directory, clear the cache and restart the queue.\n\n```bash\nphp artisan key:generate\nphp artisan migrate\nphp artisan storage:link\n\nphp artisan config:cache\nphp artisan view:cache\nphp artisan route:cache\nphp artisan queue:restart\n```\n\nWe also need to add a cronjob in order to run Laravel's schedules commands.\n\nType `crontab -e` in the terminal as your `johndoe` user.\n\nIn the file that is opened add the following line:\n\n```\n* * * * * php /var/www/anonaddy/artisan schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1\n```\n\nThis cronjob will run every minute which in turn runs the commands listed in `app/Console/Kernel.php` at the appropriate time.\n\n## Installing Supervisor\n\nWe will be using supervisor for keeping the Laravel queue worker alive.\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install supervisor\n```\n\nCreate a new configuration file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/supervisor/conf.d/anonaddy.conf\n```\n\nEnter the following inside (change user, command location and the number of processes if you need to):\n\n```\n[program:anonaddy]\nprocess_name=%(program_name)s_%(process_num)02d\ncommand=php /var/www/anonaddy/artisan queue:work redis --sleep=3 --tries=3\nautostart=true\nautorestart=true\nuser=johndoe\nnumprocs=8\nredirect_stderr=true\nstopwaitsecs=3600\n```\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center mb-4\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/supervisor.png\" alt=\"Supervisor config\" title=\"Supervisor config\">\n</div>\n\nThen run:\n\n```bash\nsudo supervisorctl reread\n\nsudo supervisorctl update\n\nsudo supervisorctl start anonaddy:*\n```\n\nRun `sudo service nginx start` to make sure Nginx is running.\n\n## Creating your account\n\nYou should now be able to visit `app.example.com` if you've set the correct DNS records.\n\nRegister an account and start using it straight away!\n\nYou can disable user registration after you've created your account to prevent anyone else from signing up.\n\nJust update the value of `ANONADDY_ENABLE_REGISTRATION` to false in your .env file (and then run the following commands to reflect the update).\n\n```bash\nphp artisan config:cache\nphp artisan view:cache\nphp artisan route:cache\n```\n\n## Adding your private key to sign emails\n\nIf you are using encryption and want to sign your forwarded emails then you'll need to create a new GPG key pair. **You must do this as the user that your web application is being run by**.\n\nTo do this we can run:\n\n```bash\ngpg --full-gen-key\n```\n\nYou will need to generate a key pair without giving it a password because php-gnupg is not able to use keys that are password protected. Leave the password blank when generating the key.\n\nIf you have issues creating the key with no passphrase then try the following command:\n\n```bash\ngpg --batch --gen-key <<EOF\n%no-protection\nKey-Type:1\nKey-Length:4096\nSubkey-Type:1\nSubkey-Length:4096\nName-Real: John Doe\nName-Email: mailer@example.com\nExpire-Date:0\nEOF\n```\n\nMake sure to replace **Name-Real** and **Name-Email** with your own values.\n\nTo find your key's fingerprint run:\n\n```bash\ngpg -k\n```\n\nThe fingerprint is 40 characters long and looks like this `26A987650243B28802524E2F809FD0D502E2F695`.\n\nThen update the value of `ANONADDY_SIGNING_KEY_FINGERPRINT=` in your .env file to match the fingerprint of your key.\n\nThen run `php artisan config:cache` to update.\n\n## Setting up a local caching DNS resolver\n\nThis is to speed up queries and to prevent you getting rate limited when querying DNSBLs (DNS black lists) etc.\n\nFollow the below blog post on how to install bind9.\n\n[https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/set-up-local-dns-resolver-ubuntu-20-04-bind9](https://www.linuxbabe.com/ubuntu/set-up-local-dns-resolver-ubuntu-20-04-bind9)\n\nNow open up `/etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf` and add these two lines below the ssl parameters.\n\n```\nresolver                    127.0.0.1 valid=86400s;\nresolver_timeout            5s;\n```\n\n<div class=\"flex justify-center mb-4\">\n  <img class=\"shadow\" src=\"https://addy.io/assets/img/nginx-resolver.png\" alt=\"Nginx resolver\" title=\"Nginx resolver\">\n</div>\n\nRestart nginx:\n\n```bash\nsudo service nginx restart\n```\n\nRestart the server by running `sudo reboot` and then SSH back in.\n\nNext to test if everything is working run:\n\n```bash\nhost -tTXT 2.0.0.127.multi.uribl.com\n```\n\nYou should see the response\n\n```bash\n2.0.0.127.multi.uribl.com descriptive text \"permanent testpoint\"\n```\n\nThis means you can query URIBL successfully now.\n\nCreate a new file `/etc/rspamd/local.d/options.inc` and enter the following inside:\n\n```\ndns {\n  nameserver = [\"127.0.0.1:53:1\"];\n}\n```\n\nThis will tell Rspamd to use our new local DNS resolver. Restart Rspamd to reflect the change.\n\n```bash\nsudo service rspamd restart\n```\n\n## Adding MTA Strict Transport Security and SMTP TLS Reporting\n\nMTA-STS allows mail service providers to declare their ability to receive Transport Layer Security (TLS) secure SMTP connections. It also allows them to specify whether sending SMTP servers should refuse to deliver to MX hosts that do not offer TLS with a trusted server certificate.\n\nLet's add a new Nginx block `/etc/nginx/conf.d/wildcard.example.com.conf`\n\n```\nserver {\n    listen 80;\n    listen [::]:80;\n\n    server_name *.example.com;\n    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;\n}\n\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl;\n    listen [::]:443 ssl;\n    server_name *.example.com;\n    server_tokens off;\n    http2 on;\n    add_header X-Frame-Options \"SAMEORIGIN\";\n    add_header X-XSS-Protection \"1; mode=block\";\n    add_header X-Content-Type-Options \"nosniff\";\n    add_header Strict-Transport-Security \"max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload\";\n    add_header Content-Security-Policy \"default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; img-src 'self' data:; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self'; object-src 'none'\";\n    add_header Referrer-Policy \"origin-when-cross-origin\";\n    add_header Expect-CT \"enforce, max-age=604800\";\n\n    index index.html;\n\n    charset utf-8;\n\n    ssl_certificate             /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.crt;\n    ssl_certificate_key         /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.key;\n    ssl_trusted_certificate     /root/.acme.sh/example.com/fullchain.cer;\n\n    ssl_prefer_server_ciphers   on;\n    ssl_session_timeout         5m;\n    ssl_protocols               TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;\n    ssl_stapling                on;\n    ssl_stapling_verify         on;\n    ssl_ciphers                 \"ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-ECDSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:ECDHE-RSA-CHACHA20-POLY1305:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384\";\n    ssl_ecdh_curve              secp384r1;\n    ssl_session_cache           shared:SSL:10m;\n    ssl_session_tickets         off;\n    ssl_dhparam                 /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        add_header Content-Type text/plain;\n        return 200 'Hello world';\n    }\n\n    location = /favicon.ico { return 204; access_log off; log_not_found off; }\n    location = /robots.txt  { access_log off; log_not_found off; }\n\n    location ~ /\\.(?!well-known).* {\n        deny all;\n    }\n\n    location ^~ /.well-known/mta-sts.txt {\n        try_files $uri @mta-sts;\n    }\n    location @mta-sts {\n        add_header Content-Type text/plain;\n        return 200 \"version: STSv1\n    mode: enforce\n    max_age: 10368000\n    mx: mail.example.com\\n\";\n    }\n}\n```\n\nReplace any mention of `example.com` with your own domain and restart Nginx:\n\n```bash\nsudo service nginx restart\n```\n\nNow we need to add a new TXT record for our domain:\n\nYou can use any unqiue value for the id, I've just used a UNIX timestamp that you can get by running the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\ndate +%s\n```\nThe name/host for this record is `_mta-sts`.\n\n```\nTXT _mta-sts \"v=STSv1; id=1603899738;\"\n```\n\nSMTP TLS Reporting is a standard that enables reporting of TLS connectivity problems experienced by applications that send email. It's easy to implement.\n\nAdd new TXT record to your domain with a name/host of `_smtp._tls`:\n\n```\nTXT _smtp._tls \"v=TLSRPTv1; rua=mailto:tlsrpt@example.com\"\n```\n\nYou can enter any email you like as the one to receive reports.\n\n## Enabling DANE by implementing DNSSEC and adding a TLSA record\n\nDNS Secturity Extensions (DNSSEC) protects the user from getting bad data from a signed zone by detecting the attack and preventing the user from receiving any tampered data.\n\nIn order to generate our TLSA record you can run the following command:\n\n```bash\nprintf '_25._tcp.%s. IN TLSA 3 1 1 %s\\n' \\\n        mail.example.com \\\n        $(openssl x509 -in /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.d/server.crt -noout -pubkey |\n            openssl pkey -pubin -outform DER |\n            openssl dgst -sha256 -binary |\n            hexdump -ve '/1 \"%02x\"')\n```\n\nOr you can use the following website to generate it - [https://www.huque.com/bin/gen_tlsa](https://www.huque.com/bin/gen_tlsa)\n\nAs mentioned earlier, some providers such as Vultr do not allow you to add a TLSA record via their DNS manager.\n\nYou can check if DANE is configured correctly using this site - [https://www.huque.com/bin/danecheck-smtp](https://www.huque.com/bin/danecheck-smtp)\n\n## Adding Certification Authority Authorization\n\nCertification Authority Authorization (CAA) is a standard that allows domain name owners to restrict which CAs are allowed to issue certificates for their domains. This can help to reduce the chance of misissuance, either accidentally or maliciously.\n\nSince our certificate is issued by Let's Encrypt we should add the following CAA records:\n\n```\nCAA @ 0 issue \"letsencrypt.org\"\n```\n\n```\nCAA @ 0 issuewild \"letsencrypt.org\"\n```\n\n```\nCAA @ 0 iodef \"mailto:caapolicy@example.com\"\n```\n\n## Updating\n\nBefore updating, **please check the release notes** on [GitHub](https://github.com/anonaddy/anonaddy/releases) for any **breaking changes**.\n\nTo update to the latest version run the following commands:\n\n```bash\n# Fetch the tags from the remote repository\ngit fetch --tags\n\n# Set a variable with the latest tag (release version)\ntag=$(git describe --tags `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`)\n\n# You can check the version by typing:\necho $tag\n\n# Checkout the latest release, note: if you have made any local changes they will be overwritten by this command\ngit checkout --force $tag -b $tag\n\n# Install dependencies\ncomposer install --prefer-dist --no-dev -o\nnpm install\n\n# Compile assets\nnpm run production\n\n# Run any database migrations\nphp artisan migrate --force\n\n# Cache config, events, routes and views\nphp artisan optimize\n\n# Restart queue workers to reflect changes\nphp artisan queue:restart\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into any problems then please check the following logs which should provide more information:\n\n- `/var/www/anonaddy/storage/logs/laravel*.log` - Web application error logs (any errors relating to issues with the web application)\n- `/var/log/mail.log` - Postfix mail logs (details of received and sent emails)\n- `/var/log/mail.err` - Postfix errors (errors relating to Postfix configuration)\n- `/var/log/php8.2-fpm.log` - PHP logs (logs relating to PHP FastCGI Process Manager)\n- `/var/log/nginx/access.log` - Nginx access logs (log of client requests)\n- `/var/log/nginx/error.log` - Nginx error logs (log of any server or request errors)\n- `/var/log/supervisor/*.log` - Supervisor logs (log of any web application queue issues)\n\nIf a queued job (e.g. forwarding an email) fails, it is stored in the `failed_jobs` table in the database and can be [retried](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x/queues#retrying-failed-jobs).\n\n## Credits\n\nA big thank you to Xiao Guoan over at [linuxbabe.com](https://www.linuxbabe.com/) for all of his amazing articles.
