This is a simple and standard guide to assist in how to contribute to this project.\n\n## How can I help?\n\nWell, you can:\n\n+ Tackle any [open issues](https://github.com/osiset/laravel-shopify/issues)\n+ Help review [pull requests](https://github.com/osiset/laravel-shopify/pulls)\n+ [Update documentation](https://github.com/osiset/laravel-shopify/wiki) in our wiki\n+ And more!\n\nYou don't have to be a superstar, or someone with experience, you can just dive in and help if you feel you can.\n\n## Adding a new feature?\n\nIts best to:\n\n1. Fork the repository (see adding upstream below)\n2. Create a branch such as `cool-new-feature`\n3. Create your code\n4. Create and run successful tests (see testing below)\n5. Submit a pull request\n\n## Found a bug?\n\nIts best to:\n\n1. Ensure the bug was not already reported by [searching all issues](https://github.com/osiset/laravel-shopify/issues?q=).\n2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one.\n    * Be sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible.\n\n## Tackling an open issue?\n\nIts best to:\n\n1. Fork the repository (see adding upstream below)\n2. Create a branch such as `issue-(issuenumber)-fix`\n3. Create your code\n4. Create and run successful tests (see testing below)\n5. Submit a pull request\n6. Comment on the issue\n\n## Misc\n\n### Adding upstream\n\nIf you're forking the repository and wish to keep your copy up-to-date with the master, ensure you run this command:\n\n`git remote add upstream git@github.com:osiset/laravel-shopify.git`\n\nYou can then update by simply running:\n\n`git checkout master && git pull upstream master`\n\n### Running tests\n\n#### Locally\n\nWe use PHPUnit to run tests. Simply run `composer install`.\n\nNext, run `vendor/bin/phpunit` and the rest will be taken care of. Upon any pull requests and merges.\n\nFor quicker tests, be sure to disable coverage with `vendor/bin/phpunit --no-coverage`.\n\n### Checking style\n\nWe use PHP-CS-Fixer to check for code style violations.\n\nTo lint the code, simply run `composer lint`.\n\n#### Actions\n\nWe also utilize Github Actions. Currently it will:\n\n1. Pull the package\n2. Test the package against a matrix of PHP and Laravel Versions\n3. Confirm coding styling is good\n4. Updates coverage results\n\n-----\n\nThat's it! Enjoy.\n"

A range of reasons have been given from the individuals; such as: their work has utilized the package for clients, the package has saved them time and money, it's assisted them in learning Laravel development/testing much better, and so on.\n\nPersonally, I have been opposed to opening up sponsorship or donations in the past because I've seen other repositories implement it, and end up regretting it because the community would expect things such as daily commits, or issues to be resolved same-day, etc. However, in talking to some individuals recently, it appears this is not the case, so I am now opening it up.\n\n## Value\n\nMost developers in the open source world are bogged down by full time jobs, family life, and of course one's own personal life. Working and maintaining open source projects means the developer has to sacrifice personal time... either very early mornings, evenings/weekends after work, or late at night.\n\nIt's often hard for developers to explain to their non-techy family why they need to sit in front of a computer at those odd hours, to work on \"free\" projects.\n\nSponsorship and donations not only help ease that conversation, but it also gives a nice \"thank you\" to the developers, just like buying them a cup of coffee or frosty mug of beer. It also gives confidence that what's being developed is helping others in a meaningful way.\n\n## Use of Funds\n\nAny donations received will be a great thank you, and contribute to the development of two repositories. This repository (osiset/laravel-shopify), and it's underlying API repository (osiset/basic-shopify-api).\n\nAny sponsorship or donation will also add the individual's Github profile to this file as a thank you, unless the individual wishes to remain anonymous.\n\n## How to Fund\n\nPlease see the `Sponsor` button at the top of this repository.\n\nCurrently `Github`, `Open Collective` and `Paypal.me` is supported.\n\n## Conditions of Funding\n\nIn sending any donations or sponsorship, please follow these asks:\n\n+ You do not expect or put pressure on the developers to contribute daily\n+ You do not expect or put pressure on the developers to solve an issue immediately\n+ You are sending on your own behalf or company behalf to contribute to the value of the repositories and as a thank you to the developers\n\n## Donators / Sponsors\n\n`APC` = `Annonymous Personal Contribution`\n`ACC` = `Annonymous Company Contribution`\n\n+ Markus Tripp - 2020\n+ ACC - 2020-07\n+ APC - 2020-06\n"
