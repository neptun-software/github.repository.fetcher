If you want to change the grammar, you need to modify the respective\n`<!--GRAMMAR` block and run `tools/grammar.php` to regenerate the rendered listings.\nIf you add or change headings, you need to regenerate the TOC using `tools/toc.php`.\nAdditionally `tools/check_refs.php` can be run to verify that all cross-references\nare valid.\n\nTo combine these three steps you can instead execute `tools/pre-commit`. To\nautomatically run it on every commit, create a symlink in the `.git/hooks` directory:\n\n```sh\nln -s -f tools/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit\n```\n\n## License for your Contributions\n\nAny contribution you provide to the Specification for PHP must adhere to the\nsame license as stated in the [LICENSE](LICENSE).\n"

Everything in the actual specification document must be ASCII only.\n3. The only allowed extensions to original Markdown are tables and code blocks\n   (indicated by three backticks).\n4. Style\n  * Use spaces to indent, not tabs.\n  * For headings, use prefixed hash symbols `# Example`, not underlining it\n    with `===`.\n  * Use of *inline* links `[example](http://example.org)` is preferred over\n    *reference* links `[example][xmpl]` unless used multiple times in a\n    paragraph or section. This is to allow for easier splitting and\n    reorganization of the document.\n  * Do not embed external images not hosted on [php.net](http://php.net)\n    infrastructure.\n  * Try to stick to 80 chars wide, if possible. This is not as strict as\n    in coding standard rules, but still easier to read most of the times.\n    This does only apply to text, not to code examples or tables.\n"
