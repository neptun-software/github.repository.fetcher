This is a rather large project\nand a single person can not work on it 24/7 to address all issues and\nfeature requests. If you feel comfortable with PHP and Smarty you should\nconsider following this contribution guide!\n\n## Getting Started\n\n* Make sure you have a [GitHub account][4].\n* Submit an [Issue][1] for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.\n  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.\n  * Make sure you fill in the earliest version that you know has the issue.\n* Fork the repository into your GitHub account\n\n## Making Changes\n\n* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.\n  * This is usually the `next` branch.\n  * Only target release branches if you are certain your fix must be on that\n    branch.\n  * To quickly create a topic branch based on `next`; `git branch\n    fix/next/my_contribution next` then checkout the new branch with `git\n    checkout fix/next/my_contribution`.  Please avoid working directly on the\n    `next` branch.\n* Make commits of logical units.\n* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.\n* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format.\n\n````\n    (#99999) Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete\n\n    Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING\n    document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the\n    contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like\n    based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the\n    problem by making the example concrete and imperative.\n\n    The first line is a real life imperative statement with an issue number\n    from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch,\n    why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.\n````\n\n## Submitting Changes\n\n* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n* Submit a pull request to the origin repository.\n* Update your issue that you have submitted code and are ready for it to be reviewed.\n  * Include a link to the pull request in the ticket\n\n# Additional Resources\n\n* [Issue Tracker][1]\n* [General GitHub documentation][2]\n* [GitHub pull request documentation][3]\n\n[1]: https://github.com/TheSerapher/php-mpos/issues \"Issue\"\n[2]: http://help.github.com/ \"GitHub documentation\"\n[3]: http://help.github.com/send-pull-requests/ \"GitHub pull request documentation\"\n[4]: https://github.com/signup/free \"GitHub account\"\n"

It was originally created by [TheSerapher](https://github.com/TheSerapher) and has hence grown quite large. It's now used by many pools out there and is a good starting point to learn more about mining and running pools in general. There is no active development done on the project by the orignal developers but we still merge PRs!\n\nDonations\n=========\n\nDonations to this project are going directly to [TheSerapher](https://github.com/TheSerapher), the original author of this project:\n\n* BTC address: `1HuYK6WPU8o3yWCrAaADDZPRpL5QiXitfv`\n* LTC address: `Lge95QR2frp9y1wJufjUPCycVsg5gLJPW8`\n\nWebsite Footer\n==============\n\nWhen you decide to use `MPOS` please be so kind and leave the footer intact. You are not the author of the software and should honor those that have worked on it. Keeping the footer intact helps spreading the word. Leaving the donation address untouched allows miners to donate to the author.\n\nPools running MPOS\n==================\n\nYou can find a list of active pools [here](https://github.com/TheSerapher/php-mpos/wiki/Pools).\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nThis setup has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04, Ubuntu 13.04 and CentOS.\nIt should also work on any related distribution (RHEL, Debian).\n\nBe aware that `MPOS` is **only** for pooled mining. Solo Mining is not\nsupported. They will never match an upstream share, solo miners do not create\nany shares, only blocks. Expect weird behavior if trying to mix them. See #299\nfor full information.\n\n* 64-bit system\n * Otherwise some coins will display wrong network hashrates\n* Apache2\n * libapache2-mod-php5\n* PHP 5.4+\n * php5-json\n * php5-mysqlnd\n * php5-memcached\n * php5-curl\n* MySQL Server\n * mysql-server\n* memcached\n* stratum-mining\n* litecoind\n\nFeatures\n========\n\nThe following feature have been implemented so far:\n\n* Fully re-written GUI with [Smarty][2] templates\n * Full file based template support\n* VARDIFF Support\n* Reward Systems\n * Propotional, PPS and PPLNS\n* New Theme\n * Live Dashboard\n * AJAX Support\n * Overhauled API\n * Bootstrap\n* Web User accounts\n * Re-Captcha protected registration form\n* Worker accounts\n * Worker activity\n * Worker hashrates\n* Pool statistics\n* Block statistics\n* Pool donations, bonuses, fees and block bonuses\n* Manual and auto payout\n* Transaction list\n* Admin Panel\n * Cron Monitoring Overview\n * User Listing including statistics\n * Wallet information\n * User Transactions\n * News Posts\n * Pool Settings\n * Pool Workers\n * User Reports\n* Notification system\n * IDLE Workers\n * New blocks found in pool\n * Auto Payout\n * Manual Payout\n* User-to-user Invitation System\n* Support for various coins via coin class and config\n * All scrypt coins\n * All sha256d coins\n * All x11 coins\n * Others may be supported by creating a custom coin class \n\nInstallation\n============\n\nPlease take a look at the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/TheSerapher/php-mpos/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide). This will give you an idea how to setup `MPOS`. Please be aware that the `master` branch is our currently considered stable system while `development` is used as a test bed for all upcoming changes for `master`. If you wish to run a stable, well tested system ensure you run `git checkout master`. If you decide to stick to the `development` branch with bleeding edge code and potential bugs, just `git clone` the project.\n\nCustomization\n=============\n\nThis project was meant to allow users to easily customize the system and templates. Hence no upstream framework was used to keep it as simple as possible.\nIf you are just using the system, there will be no need to adjust anything. Things will work out of the box! But if you plan on creating\nyour own theme, things are pretty easy:\n\n* Create a new theme folder in `templates/`\n* Create a new site_assets folder in `public/site_assets`\n* Create your own complete custom template or copy from an existing one\n* Change your theme in the `Admin Panel` and point it to the newly created folder\n\nThe good thing with this approach: You can keep the backend code updated! Since your new theme will never conflict with existing themes, a simple git pull will\nkeep your installation updated. You decide which new feature you'd like to integrate on your own theme. Bugfixes to the code will work out of the box!\n\nOther customizations are also possible but will require merging changes together. Usually users would not need to change the backend code unless they wish to work\non non-existing features in `MPOS`. For the vast majority, adjusting themes should be enough to highlight your pool from others.\n\nIn all that, I humbly ask to keep the `MPOS` author reference and Github URL intact.\n\nContributing\n============\n\nYou can contribute to this project in different ways:\n\n* Report outstanding issues and bugs by creating an [Issue][1]\n* Fork the project, create a branch and file a pull request **against development** to improve the code itself\n\nContact\n=======\n\nThis product is not actively developed anymore. For setup and installation support, please find help in other channels.\nThis projects issue tracker is used for bugs and issues with the core code, not for general help in setting up and running \npool.\n\nTeam Members\n============\n\nAuthor and Project Owner: [TheSerapher](https://github.com/TheSerapher) aka Sebastian Grewe\n\nPast developers that helped on MPOS in the early days:\n\n* [nrpatten](https://github.com/nrpatten)\n* [Aim](https://github.com/fspijkerman)\n* [raistlinthewiz](https://github.com/raistlinthewiz)\n* [xisi](https://github.com/xisi)\n* [nutnut](https://github.com/nutnut)\n* [obigal](https://github.com/obigal)\n* [iAmShorty](https://github.com/iAmShorty)\n* [rog1121](https://github.com/rog1121)\n* [neozonz](https://github.com/neozonz)\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nCopyright 2012, Sebastian Grewe\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n\n\n  [1]: https://github.com/TheSerapher/php-mpos/issues \"Issue\"\n  [2]: http://www.smarty.net/docs/en/ \"Smarty\"\n"
