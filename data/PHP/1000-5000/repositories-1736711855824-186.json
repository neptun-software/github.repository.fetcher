Run this command:\n\n```sh\ncomposer require facebook/graph-sdk\n```\n\nPlease be aware, that there are issues when using the Facebook SDK together with [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) 6.x. php-graph-sdk v5.x only works with Guzzle 5.x out of the box. However, [there is a workaround to make it work with Guzzle 6.x](https://www.sammyk.me/how-to-inject-your-own-http-client-in-the-facebook-php-sdk-v5#writing-a-guzzle-6-http-client-implementation-from-scratch).\n\n## Upgrading to v5.x\n\nUpgrading from v4.x? Facebook PHP SDK v5.x introduced breaking changes. Please [read the upgrade guide](https://www.sammyk.me/upgrading-the-facebook-php-sdk-from-v4-to-v5) before upgrading.\n\n## Usage\n\n> **Note:** This version of the Facebook SDK for PHP requires PHP 5.4 or greater.\n\nSimple GET example of a user's profile.\n\n```php\nrequire_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php'; // change path as needed\n\n$fb = new \\Facebook\\Facebook([\n  'app_id' => '{app-id}',\n  'app_secret' => '{app-secret}',\n  'default_graph_version' => 'v2.10',\n  //'default_access_token' => '{access-token}', // optional\n]);\n\n// Use one of the helper classes to get a Facebook\\Authentication\\AccessToken entity.\n//   $helper = $fb->getRedirectLoginHelper();\n//   $helper = $fb->getJavaScriptHelper();\n//   $helper = $fb->getCanvasHelper();\n//   $helper = $fb->getPageTabHelper();\n\ntry {\n  // Get the \\Facebook\\GraphNodes\\GraphUser object for the current user.\n  // If you provided a 'default_access_token', the '{access-token}' is optional.\n  $response = $fb->get('/me', '{access-token}');\n} catch(\\Facebook\\Exceptions\\FacebookResponseException $e) {\n  // When Graph returns an error\n  echo 'Graph returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();\n  exit;\n} catch(\\Facebook\\Exceptions\\FacebookSDKException $e) {\n  // When validation fails or other local issues\n  echo 'Facebook SDK returned an error: ' . $e->getMessage();\n  exit;\n}\n\n$me = $response->getGraphUser();\necho 'Logged in as ' . $me->getName();\n```\n\nComplete documentation, installation instructions, and examples are available [here](docs/).\n\n## Tests\n\n1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) is a prerequisite for running the tests. Install composer globally, then run `composer install` to install required files.\n2. Create a test app on [Facebook Developers](https://developers.facebook.com), then create `tests/FacebookTestCredentials.php` from `tests/FacebookTestCredentials.php.dist` and edit it to add your credentials.\n3. The tests can be executed by running this command from the root directory:\n\n```bash\n$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit\n```\n\nBy default the tests will send live HTTP requests to the Graph API. If you are without an internet connection you can skip these tests by excluding the `integration` group.\n\n```bash\n$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit --exclude-group integration\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nFor us to accept contributions you will have to first have signed the [Contributor License Agreement](https://developers.facebook.com/opensource/cla). Please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/facebook/php-graph-sdk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n## License\n\nPlease see the [license file](https://github.com/facebook/php-graph-sdk/blob/master/LICENSE) for more information.\n\n## Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you have found a security issue, please contact the maintainers directly at [me@sammyk.me](mailto:me@sammyk.me).\n"
