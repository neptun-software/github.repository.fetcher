They make the code freely available in the hope that it will be of use to other developers. It would be\r\nextremely unfair for them to suffer abuse or anger for their hard work.\r\n\r\nPlease be considerate towards maintainers when raising issues or presenting pull requests. Let's show the\r\nworld that developers are civilized and selfless people.\r\n\r\nIt's the duty of the maintainer to ensure that all submissions to the project are of sufficient\r\nquality to benefit the project. Many developers have different skillsets, strengths, and weaknesses. Respect the maintainer's decision, and do not be upset or abusive if your submission is not used.\r\n\r\n## Viability\r\n\r\nWhen requesting or submitting new features, first consider whether it might be useful to others. Open\r\nsource projects are used by many developers, who may have entirely different needs to your own. Think about\r\nwhether or not your feature is likely to be used by other users of the project.\r\n\r\n## Procedure\r\n\r\nBefore filing an issue:\r\n\r\n- Attempt to replicate the problem, to ensure that it wasn't a coincidental incident.\r\n- Check to make sure your feature suggestion isn't already present within the project.\r\n- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the bug doesn't have a fix in progress.\r\n- Check the pull requests tab to ensure that the feature isn't already in progress.\r\n\r\nBefore submitting a pull request:\r\n\r\n- Check the codebase to ensure that your feature doesn't already exist.\r\n- Check the pull requests to ensure that another person hasn't already submitted the feature or fix.\r\n\r\n## Run Tests\r\n\r\nThe full test suite requires PHP cli with mongodb extension and a running MongoDB server. A replica set is required for\r\ntesting transactions.\r\nDuplicate the `phpunit.xml.dist` file to `phpunit.xml` and edit the environment variables to match your setup.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ docker-compose run app\r\n```\r\n\r\nDocker can be slow to start. You can run the command `composer run test` locally or in a docker container.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ docker-compose run -it tests bash\r\n# Inside the container\r\n$ composer install\r\n$ composer run test\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor fixing style issues, you can run the PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer, some issues can't be fixed automatically:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ composer run cs:fix\r\n$ composer run cs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\nIf the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.\r\n\r\n- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://pear.php.net/package/PHP_CodeSniffer).\r\n\r\n- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.\r\n\r\n- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the documentation is kept up-to-date.\r\n\r\n- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.\r\n\r\n- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.\r\n\r\nHappy coding!\r\n\r\n## Releasing\r\n\r\nThe releases are created by the maintainers of the library. The process is documented in\r\nthe [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) file.\r\n"

For older versions of Laravel, please refer to the\n[old versions](https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/tree/3.9#laravel-version-compatibility).\n\n## Documentation\n\n- https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/php/laravel-mongodb/\n- https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/php/ \n\n## Release Integrity\n\nReleases are created automatically and the resulting release tag is signed using\nthe [PHP team's GPG key](https://pgp.mongodb.com/php-driver.asc). To verify the\ntag signature, download the key and import it using `gpg`:\n\n```shell\ngpg --import php-driver.asc\n```\n\nThen, in a local clone, verify the signature of a given tag (e.g. `4.4.0`):\n\n```shell\ngit show --show-signature 4.4.0\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Composer does not support verifying signatures as part of its installation\n> process.\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nThink you’ve found a bug in the library? Want to see a new feature? Please open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:\n\n- [Create an account and login.](https://jira.mongodb.org/)\n- Navigate to the [PHPORM](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PHPORM) project.\n- Click Create - Please provide as much information as possible about the issue type and how to reproduce it.\n\nNote: All reported issues in JIRA project are public.\n\nFor general questions and support requests, please use one of MongoDB's\n[Technical Support](https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/support/) channels.\n\n### Security Vulnerabilities\n\nIf you've identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other MongoDB\nproject, please report it according to the instructions in\n[Create a Vulnerability Report](https://mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report).\n\n## Development\n\nDevelopment is tracked in the\n[PHPORM](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/PHPORM/summary) project in MongoDB's\nJIRA. Documentation for contributing to this project may be found in\n[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n"

          "content": "# Releasing\n\nThe following steps outline the release process for both new minor versions and\npatch versions.\n\nThe command examples below assume that the canonical \"mongodb\" repository has\nthe remote name \"mongodb\". You may need to adjust these commands if you've given\nthe remote another name (e.g. \"upstream\"). The \"origin\" remote name was not used\nas it likely refers to your personal fork.\n\nIt helps to keep your own fork in sync with the \"mongodb\" repository (i.e. any\nbranches and tags on the main repository should also exist in your fork). This\nis left as an exercise to the reader.\n\n## Ensure PHP version compatibility\n\nEnsure that the test suite completes on supported versions of PHP.\n\n## Transition JIRA issues and version\n\nAll issues associated with the release version should be in the \"Closed\" state\nand have a resolution of \"Fixed\". Issues with other resolutions (e.g.\n\"Duplicate\", \"Works as Designed\") should be removed from the release version so\nthat they do not appear in the release notes.\n\nCheck the corresponding \"laravel-*.x\" fix version to see if it contains any\nissues that are resolved as \"Fixed\" and should be included in this release\nversion.\n\nUpdate the version's release date and status from the\n[Manage Versions](https://jira.mongodb.org/plugins/servlet/project-config/PHPORM/versions)\npage.\n\n## Trigger the release workflow\n\nReleases are done automatically through a GitHub Action. Visit the corresponding\n[Release New Version](https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/actions/workflows/release.yml)\nworkflow page to trigger a new build. Select the correct branch (e.g. `v4.5`)\nand trigger a new run using the \"Run workflow\" button. In the following prompt,\nenter the version number.\n\nThe automation will then create and push the necessary commits and tag, and create\na draft release. The release is created in a draft state and can be published\nonce the release notes have been updated.\n\n\n## Branch management\n\n# Creating a maintenance branch and updating default branch name\n\nWhen releasing a new major or minor version (e.g. 4.0.0), the default branch\nshould be renamed to the next version (e.g. 4.1). Renaming the default branch\nusing GitHub's UI ensures that all open pull request are changed to target the\nnew version.\n\nOnce the default branch has been renamed, create the maintenance branch for the\nversion to be released (e.g. 4.0):\n\n```console\n$ git checkout -b X.Y\n$ git push mongodb X.Y\n```\n\n### After releasing a patch version\n\nIf this was a patch release, the maintenance branch must be merged up to the\ndefault branch (e.g. 4.1):\n\n```console\n$ git checkout 4.1\n$ git pull mongodb 4.1\n$ git merge 4.0 --strategy=ours\n$ git push mongodb\n```\n\nThe `--strategy=ours` option ensures that all changes from the merged commits\nwill be ignored. This is OK because we previously ensured that the `4.1`\nbranch was up-to-date with all code changes in this maintenance branch before\ntagging.\n\n\n## Publish release notes\n\nUse the generated release note in [this form](https://github.com/mongodb/laravel-mongodb/releases/new).\n\nRelease announcements should also be posted in the [MongoDB Product & Driver Announcements: Driver Releases](https://mongodb.com/community/forums/tags/c/announcements/driver-releases/110/php) forum and shared on Twitter.\n"
