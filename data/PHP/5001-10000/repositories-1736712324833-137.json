This space and its related channels (such as pull requests, IRC channels, or mailing lists) may not be used to disparage another participant.\n-   Respect each other’s privacy. Do not post another participant’s private or personally identifiable information in public spaces without their permission.\n-   Respect each other’s boundaries. Do not use this space or any of its related channels to harass another participant.\n-   Be thoughtful about what you say. Do not post content that promotes, supports, or glorifies hatred.\n-   Be helpful. Offer constructive criticism or voice a dissenting opinion, but don’t be mean. Do not post threats of violence against others or promote or encourage others to engage in violence or illegal activity.\n-   Be lawful. Don’t post, link or attach content that violates third party intellectual property rights, has malicious intent or interferes with the security of the Phan project or contributors, or violates the law.\n\nExamples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to: offensive comments, verbal threats or demands, sexualized images, intimidation, stalking, sustained disruption of discussions, unwelcome sexual attention or approaches, violence, threats of violence, or violent or discriminatory language directed against another person or group.\n\nThe safety of everyone in the community is of paramount importance. This means this is not the appropriate forum for:\n\n-   Direct communication with a contributor once they have requested that you leave them alone (except for standard automated notifications as part of the contribution process); or,\n-   Engaging in inflammatory debates, doxxing or trolling, regardless of subject.\n\nDiscrimination, harassment or individual or coordinated attacks on contributors of any kind, whether directly or via ‘code language’ will not be tolerated.\n\nIf you are being harassed or discriminated against, if you notice that someone else is being harassed or discriminated against, or if you have any other concerns, please contact a member of Phan’s team.\nIf a participant violates this Code of Conduct, the Phan project’s members may take any action we deem appropriate,\nincluding warning the offender,\nblocking them from the current project or all Phan projects temporarily or permanently, and/or contacting law enforcement.\n"

These can be fixed automatically via the accompanying [IssueFixer](https://github.com/phan/phan/pull/4875/commits/8e22228cae7dcea529eb3c58cbd2b63832bf7595#diff-c4e601780333523f24a0d1d62084b5dabaf37126e7673183c153f36810feb217). [#4875](https://github.com/phan/phan/pull/4875)\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n- Add `override_return_types` to add types to all return types. Normally, Phan only adds inferred returned types when there is no `@return` type\n  or real return type signature. This setting can be disabled on individual methods by adding\n  `@phan-hardcode-return-type` to the doc comment.\n\n  Disabled by default. This is more useful with `--analyze-twice` and in conjunction with `PhoundPlugin` to\n  detect more callsite possibilities. See the [PR description](https://github.com/phan/phan/pull/4874) where\n  this setting was added for more details.\n\n  (Default: `false`)\n\n  Along with this change, we are analyzing the return types of traits a bit more aggressively now. [#4874](https://github.com/phan/phan/pull/4874)\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fix crash in PHP 8.4 due to deprecation warning about implicitly nullable parameters [#4875](https://github.com/phan/phan/pull/4875)\n\nMaintenance:\n- Update download links for php-ast zip files [#4876](https://github.com/phan/phan/pull/4876)\n\nJul 25 2024, Phan 5.4.4\n-----------------------\nNew features:\n- New plugin [PhoundPlugin](https://github.com/phan/phan/blob/3a17b9697c63b4807c6cddaa4112962e49cce5d0/src/Phan/Plugin/Internal/PhoundPlugin.php#L13-L31) to populate a sqlite database with callsites of all class elements. The database can be queried to find callsites of a given class element. This was actually introduced in 5.4.3, but not announced at the time.

(#4313)\n- Properly resolve template type when `getIterator` returns an `Iterator` that includes a template. (#4556)\n- Fix false positives such as `PhanTypeMismatchArgumentNullable` analyzing recursive call with parameter set to literal, without real type information. (#4550)\n  (e.g. `function ($retry = true) { if ($retry) {/*...*/} some_call_using_retry($retry); }`)\n- Properly detect `PhanUnusedVariable` in try-catch where catch always rethrows. (#4567)\n- Make read-only/write-only property detection more accurate for assignment operations (e.g. `+=`, `??=`) and increment/decrement operations.

(#4577)\n- Infer that variadic parameters can have string keys (as of php 8.0) (#4579)\n- Emit `PhanParamTooFewUnpack` and `PhanParamTooFewInternalUnpack` to indicate when argument unpacking may provide too few arguments to the called function. (#4577)\n- Support the non-standard `@no-named-arguments` PHPDoc comment on function-likes. (#4580, #4152)\n  Treat variadic parameters as list types when this annotation is used,\n  warn about unpacking string arguments or explicitly passing named arguments to functions using this declaration.\n- Warn about argument unpacking that may pass strings to internal functions (e.g. `var_dump(...['a' => 'unsupported'])`) (#4579)\n  New issue types: `PhanSuspiciousNamedArgumentVariadicInternalUnpack`\n- Support `@phan-type AliasName=UnionType` annotation in inline strings or element comments (#4562)\n\n  These aliases will apply to remaining statements in the current\n  **top-level namespace blocks,** similar to use statements, but can also be defined\n  in methods and apply to subsequent methods.\n\n  This can be of use in avoiding repetition of phpdoc for long type definitions.\n\n  ```php\n  // Alternate inline string version to work around php-ast limitations\n  '@phan-type UserData = array{name: string, id: int, createdAt: DateTime}';\n\n  /**\n   * @type-alias UserData = array{name: string, id: int, createdAt: DateTime}\n   * (applies to phpdoc in this and all subsequent AST nodes in the namespace block)\n   */\n  class ExampleElementWithPHPDoc {\n      /**\n       * @param UserData[] $users\n       * @return list<UserData>\n       */\n      public function filterUsers(array $values): array { /* ... */ }\n  }\n\n  // The UserData alias is still defined and can be used in other statements\n\n  namespace XYZ;\n  // The UserData alias is no longer defined in the new namespace block.\n  ```\n- When analyzing calls that modify variables as pass by reference, merge old types with existing types\n  to account for possibility of branches or early returns (#4602)\n\nPlugins:\n- Warn about non-empty try statements that are unlikely to throw in `EmptyStatementListPlugin` (#4555)\n- Warn in `AlwaysReturnPlugin` about functions/methods with no return type that have at least one return statement with an expression, but may fall through to the end of the function body without an explicit return (#4587)\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fix off-by-one error when inferring from comparison conditions such as `count($arr) > 0` and `count($arr) >= 1` that the array is non-empty.

(#4569)\n\nSep 14 2021, Phan 5.2.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew Features(Analysis):\n- Improve analysis of conditions detecting the empty/non-empty array. (#4523)\n  E.g. support `if ($x === []) {...} else {...}`, `if (count($x) > 0) {...} else {...}`, etc.\n- Raise severity of `PhanTypeNonVarPassByRef` to critical. It throws an Error in php 8.0+. (#3830)\n- Infer from conditions such as `in_array($var, $array, true)` that $array is a non-empty array and that $var is of a type found in the elements of $array. (#2511)\n\nPlugins:\n- Emit a proper warning when `InvokePHPNativeSyntaxCheckPlugin` is passed a path to a php binary that is missing or invalid (or if the syntax check crashed). (#4116)\n  Previously, Phan would crash with an error such as `fwrite(): write of 8196 bytes failed with errno=32 Broken pipe`\n- Fix false positive `PhanPluginMoreSpecificActualReturnType` for phpdoc array shape return type and returned generic array. (#4531)\n\nBug fixes:\n- Fix type inference logic that was looking for array specializations rather than array or any array subtype (#4512)\n- Fix false positive `PhanUnreferencedClosure`/`PhanUnreferencedFunction` seen when a closure/function name was passed to a function such as `uasort` that already had a plugin analyzing calls of the closure. (#4090, #4519)\n- Fix false positive/negative `PhanTypeMissingReturn*` instances. (#4537)\n\n  The check was wrong and should have been checking for a statement list that throws/exits.\n  Return statements can be omitted if a function unconditionally exits.\n\n  Also, check for the real `never` return type when emitting issues\n- Fix false positive `PhanPossiblyUndefinedGlobalVariable*` instance when `global $var` is used within a conditional. (#4539)\n- Fix false positive `PhanPluginRedundantAssignmentInLoop` instance when a variable is modified in a catch statement with a break/continue. (#4542)\n- Fix some incorrect line numbers in some plugin issues.\n- Fix crash seen when parsing intersection types containing union types such as `non-empty-array&array<'a'|'b'>` (#4544)\n\nMaintenance:\n- Fix old return type signature for `get_headers` (#3273)\n- Print instructions on how to upgrade php-ast to 1.0.11+ if an outdated version is installed. (#4532)\n\nAug 26 2021, Phan 5.2.0\n-----------------------\n\nPlugins:\n- Add `AddNeverReturnTypePlugin`` which will suggest adding a phpdoc return type of `@return never`.

(#4413)\n\nJul 24 2021, Phan 5.0.0a4\n-------------------------\n\nNew Features (Analysis):\n- Use the enum class declaration type (int, string, or absent) from AST version 85 to check if enum cases are valid. (#4313)\n  New issue types: `PhanSyntaxEnumCaseExpectedValue`, `PhanSyntaxEnumCaseUnexpectedValue`, `PhanTypeUnexpectedEnumCaseType`\n\nBackwards incompatible changes:\n- Bump the minimum required AST version from 80 to 85 (Required to analyze php 8.1 enum classes - 'type' was added in AST version 85).\n- In php 8.1, require php-ast 1.0.14 to natively parse AST version 85.\n\nMaintenance:\n- Upgrade tolerant-php-parser from 0.1.0 to 0.1.1 to prepare to support new php syntax in the polyfill/fallback parser.

(#4449)\n\nBug fixes:\n- Properly warn about referencing $this from a `static fn` declared in an instance method. (#4336)\n- Fix a crash getting template parameters of intersection types\n\nMay 30 2021, Phan 5.0.0a1\n-------------------------\n\nPhan 5 introduces support for intersection types, and improves the accuracy of type casting checks and type inference to catch more issues.\n\nThis is the unstable branch for alpha releases of Phan 5. Planned/remaining work is described in https://github.com/phan/phan/issues/4413\n\nIf you are migrating from Phan 4, it may be useful to set up or update a Phan [baseline file](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Phan-Config-Settings#baseline_path) to catch issues such as nullable type mismatches.\nhttps://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Tutorial-for-Analyzing-a-Large-Sloppy-Code-Base has other advice on setting up suppressions.\nFor example, Phan is now more consistently warning about nullable arguments (i.e. both `\\X|null` and `?\\X`) in a few cases where it may have not warned about passing `\\X|null` to a function that expects a non-null type.\n\nIf you are using plugins that are not part of Phan itself, they may have issues in Phan 5 due\nto additional required methods being added to many of Phan's methods.\n\nNew Features (Analysis):\n+ Support parsing intersection types in phpdoc and checking if intersection types satisfy type comparisons\n+ Support inferring intersection types from conditions such as `instanceof`\n+ Warn about impossible type combinations in phpdoc intersection types.\n  New issue types: `PhanImpossibleIntersectionType`\n+ Improve type checking precision for whether a type can cast to another type.\n+ Improve precision of checking if a type is a subtype of another type.\n+ Split out warnings about possibly invalid types for property access (non-object) and possibly invalid classes for property access\n  New issue types: `PhanPossiblyUndeclaredPropertyOfClass`\n+ Also check for partially invalid expressions for instance properties during assignment (`PhanPossiblyUndeclaredProperty*`)\n+ Treat `@template-covariant T` as an alias of `@template T` - Previously, that tag was not parsed and `T` would be treated like a (probably undeclared) classlike name. (#4432)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix wrong expression in issue message for PhanPossiblyNullTypeMismatchProperty (#4427)\n\nBreaking Changes:\n+ Many internal methods now require a mandatory `CodeBase` instance. This will affect third party plugins.\n+ Remove `--language-server-min-diagnostic-delay-ms`.\n\nMay 19 2021, Phan 4.0.7 (dev)\n-----------------------\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Fix an uncaught exception sometimes seen checking for issue suppressions when pcntl is unavailable.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Don't emit `PhanCompatibleNonCapturingCatch` when `minimum_target_php_version` is `'8.0'` or newer. (#4433)\n+ Stop ignoring `@return null` and `@param null $paramName` in phpdoc. (#4453)\n\n  Stop special casing `@param null` now that Phan allows many other literal types in param types.\n\nMay 19 2021, Phan 4.0.6\n-----------------------\n\nNew Features (Analysis):\n+ Partially support php 8.1 enums (#4313)\n  (infer the real type is the class type, that they cannot be instantiated, that enum values cannot be reused, and that class constants will exist for enum cases)\n\n  New issue types: `PhanReusedEnumCaseValue`, `PhanTypeInstantiateEnum`, `PhanTypeInvalidEnumCaseType`, `PhanSyntaxInconsistentEnum`,\n  `PhanInstanceMethodWithNoEnumCases`, `PhanInstanceMethodWithNoEnumCases`, `PhanEnumCannotHaveProperties`, `PhanUnreferencedEnumCase`,\n  `PhanEnumForbiddenMagicMethod`.\n+ Support php 7.4 covariant return types and contravariant parameter types when the configured or inferred `minimum_target_php_version` is `'7.4'` or newer (#3795)\n+ Add initial support for the php 8.1 `never` type (in real return types and phpdoc). (#4380)\n  Also add support for the phpdoc aliases `no-return`, `never-return`, and `never-returns`\n+ Support casting `iterable<K, V>` to `Traversable<K, V>` with `is_object` or `!is_array` checks\n+ Detect more types of expressions that never return when inferring types (e.g. when analyzing `?:`, `??` operators)\n+ Use php 8.1's tentative return types from reflection (`hasTentativeReturnType`, `getTentativeReturnType`) to assume real return types of internal functions/methods (#4400)\n\n  This can be disabled by setting `use_tentative_return_type` to `false` (e.g. when using subclasses of internal classes that return incompatible types).\n+ Warn about modifying properties of classes that are immutable at runtime (enums, internal classes such as `\\Closure` and `\\WeakRef`, etc.) (#4313)\n  New issue type: `PhanTypeModifyImmutableObjectProperty`\n\nDead code detection:\n+ Infer that functions with a return type of `never` (or phpdoc aliases such as `no-return`) are unreachable when performing control flow analysis.\n  This can be disabled by setting `dead_code_detection_treat_never_type_as_unreachable` to false\n\n  Note that control flow is only affected when `UseReturnValuePlugin` is enabled.\n\nPlugins:\n+ In `UseReturnValuePlugin`, also start warning about when using the result of an expression that evaluates to `never`\n  New issue types: `PhanUseReturnValueOfNever`\n\nBug fixes:\n+ As part of the work on php 7.4 contravariant parameter types,\n  don't automatically inherit inferred parameter types from ancestor classlikes when (1) there is no `@param` tag with a type for the parameter on the overriding method and (2) the ancestor parameter types are a subtype of the real parameter types unless\n\n  1. `@inheritDoc` is used.\n  2. This is a generic array type such as `array<string,mixed>` that is a specialization of an array type.\n     If you want to indicate that the overriding method can be any array type, add `@param array $paramName`.\n+ Change composer.json dependency on `composer/xdebug-handler` from `^2.0` to `^1.1|2.0` to avoid conflicting with other libraries or applications that depend on xdebug-handler 1.x (#4382)\n+ Support parsing multiple declare directives in the polyfill/fallback parser (#4160)\n\nApr 29 2021, Phan 4.0.5\n-----------------------\n\nNew Features (Analysis):\n+ Fix handling of some redundant condition checks involving `non-null-mixed` and `null` (#4388, #4391)\n+ Emit `PhanCompatibleSerializeInterfaceDeprecated` when a class implements Serializable without also implementing the `__serialize` and `__unserialize` methods as well. (#4387)\n  PHP 8.1 deprecates the `Serializable` interface when `__serialize` and `__unserialize` aren't also implemented to be used instead of `serialize`/`unserialize`.\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Warn about running phan with multiple processes without pcntl before the analysis phase starts.\n+ Start implementing `__serialize`/`__unserialize` in Phan itself in places that use `Serializable`.\n+ Use different static variables in different subclasses of `Phan\\Language\\Type` to account for changes in static variable inheritance in php 8.1. (#4379)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Allow `?T` to be used in parameter/property types with `@template T` (#4388)\n\nApr 14 2021, Phan 4.0.4\n-----------------------\n\nNew Features (CLI, Config):\n+ Support `--doc-comment` flag on `tool/make_stubs` to emit the doc comments Phan\n  is using for internal elements along with the stubs.\n  (these are the doc comments Phan would use for hover text in the language server)\n+ Allow `target_php_version` and `minimum_target_php_version` to be 8.1 or newer.\n\nNew Features (Analysis):\n+ Support the php 8.1 array unpacking with string keys RFC (#4358).\n  Don't emit warnings about array unpacking with string keys when `minimum_target_php_version` is '8.1' or newer.\n+ Support php 8.1 `array_is_list(array $array): bool` conditional and its negation.

(#4284)\n+ Don't suggest instance properties as alternatives to undefined variables inside of static methods.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Support a `non-null-mixed` type and change the way analysis involving nullability is checked for `mixed` (phpdoc and real). (#4278, #4276)\n\nNov 27 2020, Phan 3.2.6\n-----------------------\n\nNew features (Analysis):\n+ Update many more real parameter names to match php 8.0's parameter names for php's own internal methods. (#4263)\n+ Infer that an instance property exists for PHP 8.0 constructor property promotion. (#3938)\n+ Infer types of properties from arguments passed into constructor for PHP 8.0 constructor property promotion.

(#4203)\n  This may be useful in terminals or CI web pages that use white backgrounds.\n\nNew features (Analysis):\n+ Infer that `parent::someMethodReturningStaticType()` is a subtype of the current class, not just the parent class. (#4202)\n+ Support phpdoc `@abstract` or `@phan-abstract` on non-abstract class constants, properties, and methods\n  to indicate that the intent is for non-abstract subclasses to override the definition. (#2278, #2285)\n  New issue types: `PhanCommentAbstractOnInheritedConstant`, `PhanCommentAbstractOnInheritedProperty`, `PhanCommentOverrideOnNonOverrideProperty`\n\n  For example, code using `static::SOME_CONST` or `static::$SOME_PROPERTY` or `$this->someMethod()`\n  may declare a placeholder `@abstract` constant/property/method,\n  and use this annotation to ensure that all non-abstract subclasses override the constant/property/method\n  (if using real abstract methods is not practical for a use case)\n+ Warn about `@override` on properties that do not override an ancestor's property definition.\n  New issue type: `PhanCommentOverrideOnNonOverrideProperty`.\n  (Phan already warns for constants and methods)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Emit `PhanPluginUseReturnValueGenerator` for calling a function returning a generator without using the returned Generator. (#4013)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Properly analyze the right hand side for `$cond || throw ...;` (e.g. emit `PhanCompatibleThrowException`) (#4199)\n+ Don't infer implications of `left || right` on the right hand expression when the right hand side has no side effects.

(#4200)\n+ Increase the minimum requirements in composer.json to what Phan actually requires. (#4217)\n\nSep 19 2020, Phan 3.2.2\n-----------------------\n\nNew features (Analysis):\n+ Improve handling of missing argument info when analyzing calls to functions/methods.\n  This will result in better issue detection for inherited methods or methods which Phan does not have type info for.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix false positive `PhanUnusedVariable` in `for (; $loop; ...) {}` (#4191)\n+ Don't infer defaults of ancestor class properties when analyzing the implementation of `__construct`. (#4195)\n  This is only affects projects where the config setting `infer_default_properties_in_construct` is overridden to be enabled.\n+ Check `minimum_target_php_version` for more compatibility warnings about parameter types.\n\nSep 13 2020, Phan 3.2.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features (Analysis):\n+ Don't compare parameter types against alternate method signatures which have too many required parameters.\n  (e.g. warn about `max([])` but not `max([], [1])`)\n+ Support `/** @unused-param $param_name */` in doc comments as an additional way to support suppressing warnings about individual parameters being unused.\n+ Warn about loop conditions that potentially don't change due to the body of the loop.\n  This check uses heuristics and is prone to false positives.\n  New issue types: `PhanPossiblyInfiniteLoop`\n+ Treat `unset($x);` as shadowing variable definitions during dead code detection.\n+ Change the way `$i++`, `--$i`, etc. are analyzed during dead code detection\n+ Properly enable `allow_method_param_type_widening` by default when the inferred `minimum_target_php_version` is `'7.2'` or newer. (#4168)\n+ Start preparing for switching to AST version 80 in an upcoming Phan 4 release.

(#4147)\n\nNew features (Analysis):\n+ Emit `PhanCompatibleArrowFunction` if using arrow functions with a minimum target php version older than php 7.4.\n+ Emit `PhanCompatibleMatchExpression` if using match expressions with a minimum target php version older than php 8.0.\n+ Emit `PhanNoopRepeatedSilenceOperator` for `@@expr` or `@(@expr)`.\n  This is less efficient and only makes a difference in extremely rare edge cases.\n+ Avoid false positives for bitwise operations on floats such as unsigned 64-bit numbers (#4106)\n+ Incomplete support for analyzing calls with php 8.0's named arguments. (#4037)\n  New issue types: `PhanUndeclaredNamedArgument*`, `PhanDuplicateNamedArgument*`,\n  `PhanMissingNamedArgument*`,\n  `PhanDefinitelyDuplicateNamedArgument`, `PhanPositionalArgumentAfterNamedArgument`, and\n  `PhanArgumentUnpackingUsedWithNamedArgument`, `PhanSuspiciousNamedArgumentForVariadic`\n+ Incomplete support for analyzing uses of PHP 8.0's nullsafe operator(`?->`) for property reads and method calls. (#4067)\n+ Warn about using `@var` where `@param` should be used (#1366)\n+ Treat undefined variables as definitely null/undefined in various places\n  when they are used outside of loops and the global scope. (#4148)\n+ Don't warn about undeclared global constants after `defined()` conditions. (#3337)\n  Phan will infer a broad range of types for these constants that can't be narrowed.\n+ Parse `lowercase-string` and `non-empty-lowercase-string` in phpdoc for compatibility, but treat them like ordinary strings.\n+ Emit `PhanCompatibleTrailingCommaParameterList` and `PhanCompatibleTrailingCommaArgumentList` **when the polyfill is used**. (#2269)\n  Trailing commas in argument lists require a minimum target version of php 7.3+,\n  and trailing commas in parameters or closure use lists require php 8.0+.\n\n  This is only available in the polyfill because the native `php-ast` parser\n  exposes the information that php itself tracks internally,\n  and php deliberately does not track whether any of these node types have trailing commas.\n\n  There are already other ways to detect these backwards compatibility issues,\n  such as `--native-syntax-check path/to/php7.x`.\n+ Warn about variable definitions that are unused due to fallthroughs in switch statements. (#4162)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add more aliases to `DeprecateAliasPlugin`\n\nMiscellaneous:\n+ Raise the severity of `PhanUndeclaredConstant` and `PhanStaticCallToNonStatic` from normal to critical.\n  Undeclared constants will become a thrown `Error` at runtime in PHP 8.0+.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Suppress `PhanParamNameIndicatingUnused` in files loaded from `autoload_internal_extension_signatures`\n+ Improve compatibility of polyfill/fallback parser with php 8.0\n+ Also try to check against the realpath() of the current working directory when converting absolute paths\n  to relative paths.\n+ Generate baseline files with `/` instead of `\\` on Windows in `--save-baseline` (#4149)\n\nJul 31 2020, Phan 3.1.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features (CLI, Config):\n+ Add `--baseline-summary-type={ordered_by_count,ordered_by_type,none}` to control the generation\n  of the summary comment generated by `--save-baseline=path/to/baseline.php` (#4044)\n  (overrides the new `baseline_summary_type` config).\n  The default comment summary (`ordered_by_count`) is prone to merge conflicts in large projects.\n  This does not affect analysis.\n+ Add `tool/phan_repl_helpers.php`, a prototype tool that adds some functionality to `php -a`.\n  It can be required by running `require_once 'path/to/phan/tool/phan_repl_helpers.php'` during an interactive session.\n\n  - This replaces the readline code completion and adds autocomplete for `->` on global variables.\n    This is currently buggy and very limited, and is missing some of the code completion functionality that is available in `php -a`.\n    (And it's missing a lot of the code completion functionality from the language server)\n  - This adds a global function `help($element_name_or_object)`. Run `help('help')` for usage and examples.\n  - Future releases may advantage of Phan's parsing/analysis capabilities in more ways.\n  - Several alternatives to the php shell already exist, such as [psysh](https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh).\n    `tool/phan_repl_helpers.php` is an experiment in augmenting the interactive php shell, not an alternative shell.\n+ Update progress bar during class analysis phase. (#4099)\n\nNew features (Analysis):\n+ Support casting `iterable<SubClass>` to `iterable<BaseClass>` (#4089)\n+ Change phrasing for `analyze` phase in `--long-progress-bar` with `--analyze-twice`\n+ Add `PhanParamNameIndicatingUnused` and `PhanParamNameIndicatingUnusedInClosure`\n  to indicate that using parameter names(`$unused*`, `$_`) to indicate to Phan that a parameter is unused is no longer recommended. (#4097)\n  Suppressions or the `@param [Type] $param_name @unused-param` syntax can be used instead.\n  PHP 8.0 will introduce named argument support.\n+ Add a message to `PhanParamSignatureMismatch` indicating the cause of the issue being emitted. (#4103)\n  Note that `PhanParamSignaturePHPDocMismatch*` and `PhanParamSignatureReal*` have fewer false positives.\n+ Warn about invalid types in class constants. (#4104)\n  Emit `PhanUndeclaredTypeClassConstant` if undeclared types are seen in phpdoc for class constants.\n  Emit `PhanCommentObjectInClassConstantType` if object types are seen in phpdoc for class constants.\n+ Warn about `iterable<UndeclaredClass>` containing undeclared classes. (#4104)\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Include PHP keywords such as `__FILE__`, `switch`, `function`, etc. in suggestions for code completions.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Make `DuplicateExpressionPlugin` warn if adjacent statements are identical. (#4074)\n  New issue types: `PhanPluginDuplicateAdjacentStatement`.\n+ Consistently make `PhanPluginPrintfNonexistentArgument` have critical severity. (#4080)\n  Passing too few format string arguments (e.g. `printf(\"%s %s\", \"Hello,\")`) will be an `ArgumentCountError` in PHP 8.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix false positive `PhanParamSignatureMismatch` issues (#4103)\n+ Fix false positive `PhanParamSignaturePHPDocMismatchHasParamType` seen for magic method override of a real method with no real signature types. (#4103)\n\nJul 16 2020, Phan 3.1.0\n-----------------------\n\nNew features (CLI, Config):\n+ Add `--output-mode=verbose` to print the line of code which caused the issue to be emitted after the textual issue output.\n  This is only emitted if the line is not whitespace, could be read, and does not exceed the config setting `max_verbose_snippet_length`.\n+ Add `included_extension_subset` to limit Phan to using the reflection information to a subset of available extensions. (#4015)\n  This can be used to make Phan warn about using constants/functions/classes that are not in the target environment or dependency list\n  of a given PHP project/library.\n  Note that this may cause issues if a class from an extension in this list depends on classes from another extension that is outside of this list.\n\nNew features (Analysis):\n+ Don't emit `PhanTypeInvalidLeftOperandOfBitwiseOp` and other binary operation warnings for `mixed`\n+ Emit `PhanIncompatibleRealPropertyType` when real property types are incompatible (#4016)\n+ Change the way `PhanIncompatibleCompositionProp` is checked for. (#4024)\n  Only emit it when the property was redeclared in an inherited trait.\n+ Emit `PhanProvidingUnusedParameter` when passing an argument to a function with an optional parameter named `$unused*` or `$_`. (#4026)\n  This can also be suppressed on the functionlike's declaration, and should be suppressed if this does not match the project's parameter naming.\n  This is limited to functions with no overrides.\n+ Emit `PhanParamTooFewInPHPDoc` when a parameter that is marked with `@phan-mandatory-param` is not passed in. (#4026)\n  This is useful when needing to preserve method signature compatibility in a method override, or when a parameter will become mandatory in a future backwards incompatible release of a project.\n+ Emit `PhanTypeMismatchArgumentProbablyReal` instead of `PhanTypeMismatchArgument` when the inferred real type of an argument has nothing in common with the phpdoc type of a user-defined function/method.\n  This is usually a stronger indicator that the phpdoc parameter type is inaccurate/incomplete or the argument is incorrect.\n  (Overall, fixing phpdoc errors may help ensure compatibility long-term if the library/framework being used moves to real types (e.g. php 8.0 union types) in the future.)\n\n  **Note that Phan provides many ways to suppress issues (including the `--save-baseline=.phan/baseline.php` and `--load-baseline=.phan/baseline.php` functionality) in case\n  the switch to `ProbablyReal` introduces too many new issues in your codebase.**\n  (The new `ProbablyReal` issues are more severe than the original issue types.\n  When they're suppressed, the original less severe issue types will also be suppressed)\n+ Emit `PhanTypeMismatchReturnProbablyReal` instead of `PhanTypeMismatchReturn` when the inferred real return type has nothing in common with the declared phpdoc return type of a user-defined function/method. (#4028)\n+ Emit `PhanTypeMismatchPropertyProbablyReal` instead of `PhanTypeMismatchProperty` when the inferred assigned property type has nothing in common with a property's declared phpdoc type. (#4029)\n+ Emit `PhanTypeMismatchArgumentInternalProbablyReal` instead of `PhanTypeMismatchArgumentInternal` in a few more cases.\n+ Be stricter about checking if callables/closures have anything in common with other types.\n+ Preserve more specific phpdoc types when the php 8.0 `mixed` type is part of the real type set.\n+ Also emit `PhanPluginUseReturnValueNoopVoid` when a function/method's return type is implicitly void (#4049)\n+ Support `@param MyType $name one line description @unused-param` to suppress warnings about individual unused method parameters.\n  This is a new alias of `@phan-unused-param`.\n+ Support analyzing [PHP 8.0's match expression](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/match_expression_v2). (#3970)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Warn and skip checks instead of crashing when running `InlineHTMLPlugin` without the `tokenizer` extension installed. (#3998)\n+ Support throwing `\\Phan\\PluginV3\\UnloadablePluginException` instead of returning a plugin object in plugin files.\n+ When a plugin registers for a method definition with `AnalyzeFunctionCallCapability`, automatically register the same closure for all classlikes using the same inherited definition of that method. (#4021)\n+ Add `UnsafeCodePlugin` to warn about uses of `eval` or the backtick string shorthand for `shell_exec()`.\n+ Add `DeprecateAliasPlugin` to mark known aliases such as `sizeof()` or `join()` as deprecated.\n  Implement support for `--automatic-fix`.\n+ Add `PHPDocInWrongCommentPlugin` to warn about using `/*` instead of `/**` with phpdoc annotations supported by Phan.\n\nMiscellaneous\n+ Update more unit tests for php 8.0.\n+ Emit a warning and load an extremely limited polyfill for `filter_var` to parse integers/floats if the `filter` extension is not loaded.\n\nBug Fixes:\n+ Make suppressions on trait methods/properties consistently apply to the inherited definitions from classes/traits using those traits.\n+ Fix false positive where Phan would think that union types with real types containing `int` and other types had an impossible condition.\n  Fix another false positive checking if `?A|?B` can cast to another union type.\n\nJul 03 2020, Phan 3.0.5\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Add `-X` as an alias of `--dead-code-detection-prefer-false-positive`.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Emit `PhanTypeInvalidLeftOperandOfBitwiseOp` and `PhanTypeInvalidRightOperandOfBitwiseOp` for argument types to bitwise operations other than `int|string`.\n  (affects `^`, `|`, `&`, `^=`, `|=`, `&=`)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix false positives in php 8.0+ type checking against the real `mixed` type. (#3994)\n+ Fix unintentionally enabling GC when the `pcntl` extension is not enabled. (#4000)\n  It should only be enabled when running in daemon mode or as a language server.\n\nJul 01 2020, Phan 3.0.4\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Emit `PhanTypeVoidExpression` when using an expression returning `void` in places such as array keys/values.\n+ More accurately infer unspecified types when closures are used with `array_map` (#3973)\n+ Don't flatten array shapes and literal values passed to closures when analyzing closures. (Continue flattening for methods and global functions)\n+ Link to documentation for internal stubs as a suggestion for undeclared class issues when Phan has type information related to the class in its signature files.\n  See https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#undeclared_element\n+ Properly render the default values if available(`ReflectionParameter->isDefaultValueAvailable()`) in php 8.0+.\n+ Properly set the real union types based on reflection information for functions/methods in more edge cases.\n+ Properly infer that union types containing the empty array shape are possibly empty after sorting (#3980)\n+ Infer a more accurate real type set from unary ops `~`, `+`, and `-` (#3991)\n+ Improve ability to infer assignments within true branch of complex expressions in conditions such as `if (A && complex_expression) { } else { }` (#3992)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `ShortArrayPlugin`, to suggest using `[]` instead of `array()` or `list()`\n+ In `DuplicateExpressionPlugin`, emit `PhanPluginDuplicateExpressionAssignmentOperation` if `X = X op Y` is seen and it can be converted to `X op= Y` (#3985)\n  (excluding `??=` for now)\n+ Add `SimplifyExpressionPlugin`, to suggest shortening expressions such as `$realBool ? true : false` or `$realBool === false`\n+ Add `RemoveDebugStatementPlugin`, to suggest removing debugging output statements such as `echo`, `print`, `printf`, `fwrite(STDERR, ...)`, `var_export(...)`, inline html, etc.\n  This is only useful in applications or libraries that print output in only a few places, as a sanity check that debugging statements are not accidentally left in code.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Treat `@method static foo()` as an instance method returning the union type `static` (#3981)\n  Previously, Phan treated it like a static method with type `void` based on an earlier phpdoc spec.\n+ Fix the way that Phan inferred the `finally` block's exit status affected the `try` block. (#3987)\n\nJun 21 2020, Phan 3.0.3\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Include the most generic types when conditions such as `is_string()` to union types containing `mixed` (#3947)\n+ More aggressively infer that `while` and `for` loop bodies are executed at least once in functions outside of other loops (#3948)\n+ Infer the union type of `!$expr` from the type of `$expr` (#3948)\n+ Re-enable `simplify_ast` by default in `.phan/config.php` (#3944, #3945)\n+ Avoid false positives in `--constant-variable-detection` for `++`/`--`\n+ Make `if (!$nullableValue) { }` remove truthy literal scalar values such as `'value'` and `1` and `1.0` when they're nullable\n+ Emit `PhanTypeVoidArgument` when passing a void return value as a function argument (#3961)\n+ Correctly merge the possible union types of pass-by-reference variables (#3959)\n+ Improve php 8.0-dev shim support. Fix checking for array references and closure use references in php 8.0+.\n+ More aggressively check if expression results should be used for conditionals and binary operators.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `ConstantVariablePlugin` to point out places where variables are read when they have only one possible scalar value. (#3953)\n  This may help detect logic errors such as `$x === null ? json_encode($x) : 'default'` or code that could be simplified,\n  but most issues it emits wouldn't be worth fixing due to hurting readability or being false positives.\n+ Add `MergeVariableInfoCapability` for plugins to hook into ContextMergeVisitor and update data for a variable\n  when merging the outcome of different scopes. (#3956)\n+ Make `UseReturnValuePlugin` check if a method is declared as pure before using the dynamic checks based on percentage of\n  calls where the return value is used, if that option is enabled.\n+ In `DuplicateArrayKeyPlugin`, properly check for duplicate non-scalar cases.\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Fix bug where the Phan daemon would crash on the next request after analyzing a file outside of the project being analyzed,\n  when pcntl was disabled or unavailable (#3954)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix `PhanDebugAnnotation` output for variables after the first one in `@phan-debug-var $a, $b` (#3943)\n+ Use the correct constant to check if closure use variables are references in php 8.0+\n\nMiscellaneous:\n+ Update function signature stubs for the `memcache` PECL (#3841)\n\nJun 07 2020, Phan 3.0.2\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Add `--dead-code-detection-prefer-false-positive` to run dead code detection,\n  erring on the side of reporting potentially dead code even when it is possibly not dead.\n  (e.g. when methods of unknown objects are invoked, don't mark all methods with the same name as potentially used)\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Fix false positive `PhanAbstractStaticMethodCall` (#3935)\n  Also, properly emit `PhanAbstractStaticMethodCall` for a variable containing a string class name.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Fix incorrect check and suggestion for `PregRegexCheckerPlugin`'s warning if\n  `$` allows an optional newline before the end of the string when the configuration includes\n  `['plugin_config' => ['regex_warn_if_newline_allowed_at_end' => true]]`) (#3938)\n+ Add `BeforeLoopBodyAnalysisCapability` for plugins to analyze loop conditions before the body (#3936)\n+ Warn about suspicious param order for `str_contains`, `str_ends_with`, and `str_starts_with` in `SuspiciousParamOrderPlugin` (#3934)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Don't report unreferenced class properties of internal stub files during dead code detection\n  (i.e. files in `autoload_internal_extension_signatures`).\n+ Don't remove the leading directory separator when attempting to convert a file outside the project to a relative path.\n  (in cases where the directory is different but has the project's name as a prefix)\n\nJun 04 2020, Phan 3.0.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Support analysis of php 8.0's `mixed` type (#3899)\n  New issue types: `PhanCompatibleMixedType`, `PhanCompatibleUseMixed`.\n+ Treat `static` and `false` like real types and emit more severe issues in all php versions.\n+ Improve type inferences from negated type assertions (#3923)\n  (analyze more expression kinds, infer real types in more places)\n+ Warn about unnecessary use of `expr ?? null`. (#3925)\n  New issue types: `PhanCoalescingNeverUndefined`.\n+ Support PHP 8.0 non-capturing catches (#3907)\n  New issue types: `PhanCompatibleNonCapturingCatch`.\n+ Infer type of `$x->magicProp` from the signature of `__get`\n+ Treat functions/methods that are only called by themselves as unreferenced during dead code detection.\n+ Warn about `each()` being deprecated when the `target_php_version` is php 7.2+. (#2746)\n  This is special cased because PHP does not flag the function itself as deprecated in `ReflectionFunction`.\n  (PHP only emits the deprecation notice for `each()` once at runtime)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n+ Check for keys that are too long when computing levenshtein distances (when Phan suggests alternatives).\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `AnalyzeLiteralStatementCapability` for plugins to analyze no-op string literals (#3911)\n+ In `PregRegexCheckerPlugin`, warn if `$` allows an optional newline before the end of the string\n  when configuration includes `['plugin_config' => ['regex_warn_if_newline_allowed_at_end' => true]]`) (#3915)\n+ In `SuspiciousParamOrderPlugin`, warn if an argument has a near-exact name match for a parameter at a different position (#3929)\n  E.g. warn about calling `foo($b)` or `foo(true, $this->A)` for `function foo($a = false, $b = false)`.\n  New issue types: `PhanPluginSuspiciousParamPosition`, `PhanPluginSuspiciousParamPositionInternal`\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix false positive `PhanTypeMismatchPropertyDefault` involving php 7.4 typed properties with no default\n  and generic comments (#3917)\n+ Don't remove leading directory separator when attempting to convert a file outside the project to a relative path.\n\nMay 09 2020, Phan 3.0.0\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Config):\n+ Support `PHAN_COLOR_PROGRESS_BAR` as an environment variable to set the color of the progress bar.\n  Ansi color names (e.g. `light_blue`) or color codes (e.g. `94`) can be used. (See src/Phan/Output/Colorizing.php)\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Infer that `foreach` keys and values of possibly empty iterables are possibly undefined after the end of a loop. (#3898)\n+ Allow using the polyfill parser to parse internal stubs. (#3902)\n  (To support newer syntax such as union types, trailing commas in parameter lists, etc.)\n\nMay 02 2020, Phan 3.0.0-RC2\n-----------------------\n\nFix published GitHub release tag (used `master` instead of `v3`).\n\nMay 02 2020, Phan 3.0.0-RC1\n-----------------------\n\nBackwards incompatible changes:\n+ Drop PHP 7.1 support.  PHP 7.1 reached its end of life for security support in December 2019.\n  Many of Phan's dependencies no longer publish releases supporting php 7.1,\n  which will likely become a problem running Phan with future 8.x versions\n  (e.g. in the published phar releases).\n+ Drop PluginV2 support (which was deprecated in Phan 2) in favor of PluginV3.\n+ Remove deprecated classes and helper methods.\n\n??? ?? 2020, Phan 2.7.3 (dev)\n-----------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix handling of windows path separators in `phan_client`\n+ Fix a crash when emitting `PhanCompatibleAnyReturnTypePHP56` or `PhanCompatibleScalarTypePHP56` for methods with no parameters.\n\nMay 02 2020, Phan 2.7.2\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Config):\n+ Add a `--native-syntax-check=/path/to/php` option to enable `InvokePHPNativeSyntaxCheckPlugin`\n  and add that php binary to the `php_native_syntax_check_binaries` array of `plugin_config`\n  (treated here as initially being the empty array if not configured).\n\n  This CLI flag can be repeated to run PHP's native syntax checks with multiple php binaries.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Emit `PhanTypeInvalidThrowStatementNonThrowable` when throwing expressions that can't cast to `\\Throwable`. (#3853)\n+ Include the relevant expression in more issue messages for type errors. (#3844)\n+ Emit `PhanNoopSwitchCases` when a switch statement contains only the default case.\n+ Warn about unreferenced private methods of the same name as methods in ancestor classes, in dead code detection.\n+ Warn about useless loops. Phan considers loops useless when the following conditions hold:\n\n  1. Variables defined within the loop aren't used outside of the loop\n     (requires `unused_variable_detection` to be enabled whether or not there are actually variables)\n  2. It's likely that the statements within the loop have no side effects\n     (this is only inferred for a subset of expressions in code)\n\n     (Enabling the plugin `UseReturnValuePlugin` (and optionally `'plugin_config' => ['infer_pure_methods' = true]`) helps detect if function calls are useless)\n  3. The code is in a functionlike scope.\n\n  New issue types: `PhanSideEffectFreeForeachBody`, `PhanSideEffectFreeForBody`, `PhanSideEffectFreeWhileBody`, `PhanSideEffectFreeDoWhileBody`\n+ Infer that previous conditions are negated when analyzing the cases of a switch statement (#3866)\n+ Support using `throw` as an expression, for PHP 8.0 (#3849)\n  (e.g. `is_string($arg) || throw new InvalidArgumentException()`)\n  Emit `PhanCompatibleThrowException` when `throw` is used as an expression instead of a statement.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Emit `PhanPluginDuplicateCatchStatementBody` in `DuplicateExpressionPlugin` when a catch statement has the same body and variable name as an adjacent catch statement.\n  (This should be suppressed in projects that support php 7.0 or older)\n+ Add `PHP53CompatibilityPlugin` as a demo plugin to catch common incompatibilities with PHP 5.3. (#915)\n  New issue types: `PhanPluginCompatibilityArgumentUnpacking`, `PhanPluginCompatibilityArgumentUnpacking`, `PhanPluginCompatibilityArgumentUnpacking`\n+ Add `DuplicateConstantPlugin` to warn about duplicate constant names (`define('X', value)` or `const X = value`) in the same statement list.\n  This is only recommended in projects with files with too many global constants to track manually.\n\nBug Fixes:\n+ Fix a bug causing FQSEN names or namespaces to be converted to lowercase even if they were never lowercase in the codebase being analyzed (#3583)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n+ Replace `PhanTypeInvalidPropertyDefaultReal` with `TypeMismatchPropertyDefault` (emitted instead of `TypeMismatchProperty`)\n  and `TypeMismatchPropertyDefaultReal` (#3068)\n+ Speed up `ASTHasher` for floats and integers (affects code such as `DuplicateExpressionPlugin`)\n+ Call `uopz_allow_exit(true)` if uopz is enabled when initializing Phan. (#3880)\n  Running Phan with `uopz` is recommended against (unless debugging Phan itself), because `uopz` causes unpredictable behavior.\n  Use stubs or internal stubs instead.\n\nApr 11 2020, Phan 2.7.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Improve the output of `tool/make_stubs`. Use better defaults than `null`.\n  Render `unknown` for unknown defaults in `tool/make_stubs` and Phan's issue messages.\n  (`default` is a reserved keyword used in switch statements)\n\nBug Fixes:\n+ Work around unintentionally using `symfony/polyfill-72` for `spl_object_id` instead of Phan's polyfill.\n  The version used caused issues on 32-bit php 7.1 installations, and a slight slowdown in php 7.1.\n\nPlugins:\n+ PHP 8.0-dev compatibility fixes for `InvokePHPNativeSyntaxCheckPlugin` on Windows.\n+ Infer that some new functions in PHP 8.0-dev should be used in `UseReturnValuePlugin`\n+ Emit the line and expression of the duplicated array key or switch case (#3837)\n\nApr 01 2020, Phan 2.7.0\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Sort output of `--dump-ctags=basic` by element type before sorting by file name (#3811)\n  (e.g. make class and global function declarations the first tag type for a tag name)\n+ Colorize the output of `phan_client` by default for the default and text output modes. (#3808)\n  Add `phan --no-color` option to disable colors.\n+ Warn about invalid CLI flags in `phan_client` (#3776)\n+ Support representing more AST node types in issue messages. (#3783)\n+ Make some issue messages easier to read (#3745, #3636)\n+ Allow using `--minimum-severity=critical` instead of `--minimum-severity=10` (#3715)\n+ Use better placeholders for parameter default types than `null` in issue messages and hover text (#3736)\n+ Release `phantasm`, a prototype tool for assembling information about a codebase and aggressively optimizing it.\n  Currently, the only feature is replacing class constants with their values, when safe to do so.\n  More features (e.g. inlining methods, aggressively optimizing out getters/setters, etc.) are planned for the future.\n  See `tool/phantasm --help` for usage.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Improve analysis of php 7.4 typed properties.\n  Support extracting their real union types from Reflection information.\n  Infer the existence of properties that are not in `ReflectionClass->getPropertyDefaults()`\n  due to being uninitialized by default.\n+ Emit `PhanAbstractStaticMethodCall*` when calling an abstract static method statically. (#3799)\n+ Emit `PhanUndeclaredClassReference` instead of `PhanUndeclaredClassConstant` for `MissingClass::class`.\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Catch exception seen when printing debug info about not being able to parse a file.\n+ Warn when Phan's language server dependencies were installed for php 7.2+\n  but the language server gets run in php 7.1. (phpdocumentor/reflection-docblock 5.0 requires php 7.2)\n+ Immediately return cached hover text when the client repeats an identical hover request. (#3252)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n+ PHP 8.0-dev compatibility fixes, analysis for some new functions of PHP 8.0-dev.\n+ Add `symfony/polyfill-php72` dependency so that symfony 5 will work better in php 7.1.\n  The next Phan major release will drop support for php 7.1.\n\nMar 13 2020, Phan 2.6.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Add a `--dump-ctags=basic` flag to dump a `tags` file in the project root directory. (https://linux.die.net/man/1/ctags)\n  This is different from `tool/make_ctags_for_phan_project` - it has no external dependencies.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Infer that the real type set of the key in `foreach ($arrayVar as $key => ...)` is definitely an `int|string`\n  in places where Phan previously inferred the empty union type, improving redundant condition detection. (#3789)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix a crash in `phan --dead-code-detection` when a trait defines a real method and phpdoc `@method` of the same name (#3796)\n\nMiscellaneous:\n+ Also allow `netresearch/jsonmapper@^2.0` as a dependency when enforcing the minimum allowed version (#3801)\n\nMar 07 2020, Phan 2.6.0\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Show empty union types as `(empty union type)` in issue messages instead of as an empty string.\n+ Add a new CLI option `--analyze-twice` to run the analysis phase twice (#3743)\n\n  Phan infers additional type information for properties, return types, etc. while analyzing,\n  and this will help it detect more potential errors.\n  (on the first run, it would analyze files before some of those types were inferred)\n+ Add a CLI option `--analyze-all-files` to analyze all files, ignoring `exclude_analysis_file_list`.\n  This is potentially useful if third party dependencies are missing type information (also see `--analyze-twice`).\n+ Add `--dump-analyzed-file-list` to dump all files Phan would analyze to stdout.\n+ Add `allow_overriding_vague_return_types` to allow Phan to add inferred return types to functions/closures/methods declared with `@return mixed` or `@return object`.\n  This is disabled by default.\n\n  When this is enabled, it can be disabled for individual methods by adding `@phan-hardcode-return-type` to the comment of the method.\n  (if the method has any type declarations such as `@return mixed`)\n\n  Previously, Phan would only add inferred return types if there was no return type declaration.\n  (also see `--analyze-twice`)\n+ Also emit the code fragment for the argument in question in the `PhanTypeMismatchArgument` family of issue messages (#3779)\n+ Render a few more AST node kinds in code fragments in issue messages.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Support parsing php 8.0 union types (and the static return type) in the polyfill. (#3419, #3634)\n+ Emit `PhanCompatibleUnionType` and `PhanCompatibleStaticType` when the target php version is less than 8.0 and union types or static return types are seen. (#3419, #3634)\n+ Be more consistent when warning about issues in values of class constants, global constants, and property defaults.\n+ Infer key and element types from `iterator_to_array()`\n+ Infer that modification of or reading from static properties all use the same property declaration. (#3760)\n  Previously, Phan would track the static property's type separately for each subclass.\n  (static properties from traits become different instances, in each class using the trait)\n+ Make assignments to properties of the declaring class affect type inference for those properties when accessed on subclasses (#3760)\n\n  Note that Phan is only guaranteed to analyze files once, so if type information is missing,\n  the only way to ensure it's available is to add it to phpdoc (`UnknownElementTypePlugin` can help) or use `--analyze-twice`.\n+ Make internal checks if generic array types are strict subtypes of other types more accurate.\n  (e.g. `object[]` is not a strict subtype of `stdClass[]`, but `stdClass[]` is a strict subtype of `object[]`)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `UnknownClassElementAccessPlugin` to warn about cases where Phan can't infer which class an instance method is being called on.\n  (To work correctly, this plugin requires that Phan use a single analysis process)\n+ Add `MoreSpecificElementTypePlugin` to warn about functions/methods where the phpdoc/actual return type is vaguer than the types that are actually returned by a method. (#3751)\n  This is a work in progress, and has a lot of false positives.\n  (To work correctly, this plugin requires that Phan use a single analysis process)\n+ Fix crash in `PrintfCheckerPlugin` when analyzing code where `fprintf()` was passed an array instead of a format string.\n+ Emit `PhanTypeMissingReturnReal` instead of `PhanTypeMissingReturn` when there is a real return type signature. (#3716)\n+ Fix bug running `InvokePHPNativeSyntaxCheckPlugin` on Windows when PHP binary is in a path containing spaces. (#3766)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix bug causing Phan to fail to properly recursively analyze parameters of inherited methods (#3740)\n  (i.e. when the methods are called on the subclass)\n+ Fix ambiguity in the way `Closure():T[]` and `callable():T[]` are rendered in error messages. (#3731)\n  Either render it as `(Closure():T)[]` or `Closure():(T[])`\n+ Don't include both `.` and `vendor/x/y/` when initializing Phan configs with settings such as `--init --init-analyze-dir=.` (#3699)\n+ Be more consistent about resolving `static` in generators and template types.\n+ Infer the iterable value type for `Generator<V>`. It was previously only inferred when there were 2 or more template args in phpdoc.\n+ Don't let less specific type signatures such as `@param object $x` override the real type signature of `MyClass $x` (#3749)\n+ Support PHP 7.4's `??=` null coalescing assignment operator in the polyfill.\n+ Fix crash analyzing invalid nodes such as `2 = $x` in `RedundantAssignmentPlugin`.\n+ Fix crash inferring type of `isset ? 2 : 3` with `--use-fallback-parser` (#3767)\n+ Fix false positive unreferenced method warnings for methods from traits\n  when the methods were referenced in base classes or interfaces of classes using those traits.\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Various performance improvements for the language server/daemon with or without pcntl (#3758, #3769, #3771)\n\nFeb 20 2020, Phan 2.5.0\n-----------------------\n\nNew Features(CLI):\n+ Support using `directory_suppressions` in Phan baseline files in `--load-baseline`. (#3698)\n+ Improve error message for warnings about Phan being unable to read files in the analyzed directory.\n\nNew Features(Analysis):\n+ Instead of failing to parse intersection types in phpdoc entirely, parse them as if they were union types. (#1629)\n  The annotations `@phan-param`, `@phan-return`, `@phan-var`, etc. can be used to override the regular phpdoc in the various cases where this behavior causes problems.\n\n  **Future** Phan releases will likely about unsupported phpdoc (e.g. `int&string`) and have actual support for intersection types.\n+ Emit `PhanUndeclaredConstantOfClass` (severity critical) for undeclared class constants instead of `PhanUndeclaredConstant` (severity normal)\n  This should not be confused with `PhanUndeclaredClassConstant`, which already exists and refers to accessing class constants of classes that don't exist.\n+ Emit the expression that's an invalid object with issue types such as `PhanTypeExpectedObject*`, `PhanTypeInvalidInstanceof` (#3717)\n+ Emit `PhanCompatibleScalarTypePHP56` and `PhanCompatibleAnyReturnTypePHP56` for function signatures when `target_php_version` is `'5.6'` (#915)\n  (This also requires that `backward_compatibility_checks` be enabled.)\n+ Use more accurate line numbers for warnings about function parameters.\n+ When `assume_real_types_for_internal_functions` is on *and* a function has a non-empty return type in Reflection,\n  make Phan's known real type signatures override the real reflection return type information (useful when Phan infers `list<string>` and Reflection says `array`).\n  Phan previously used the type from Reflection.\n+ Normalize phpdoc parameter and return types when there is a corresponding real type in the signature. (#3725)\n  (e.g. convert `bool|false|null` to `?bool`)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `SubscribeEmitIssueCapability` to detect or suppress issues immediately before they are emitted. (#3719)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Don't include issues that weren't emitted in the file generated by `--save-baseline` (#3719)\n+ Fix incorrect file location for other definition in `PhanRedefinedClassReference` under some circumstances.\n+ Fix incorrect issue name: `PhanCompatibleNullableTypePHP71` should be named `PhanCompatibleObjectTypePHP71`\n+ Fix false positive `PhanPartialTypeMismatchProperty` when a php 7.4 typed property has a default expression value (#3725)\n\nFeb 13 2020, Phan 2.4.9\n-----------------------\n\nNew Features(Analysis):\n+ Infer that `class_exists` implies the first argument is a class-string,\n  and that `method_exists` implies the first argument is a class-string or an object. (#2804, #3058)\n\n  Note that Phan still does not infer that the class or method actually exists.\n+ Emit `PhanRedefineClass` on **all** occurrences of a duplicate class, not just the ones after the first occurrence of the class. (#511)\n+ Emit `PhanRedefineFunction` on **all** occurrences of a duplicate function/method, not just the ones after the first.\n+ Emit `PhanRedefinedClassReference` for many types of uses of user-defined classes that Phan has parsed multiple definitions of.\n  Phan will not warn about internal classes, because the duplicate definition is probably a polyfill.\n  (e.g. `new DuplicateClass()`, `DuplicateClass::someMethod()`)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix false positive `PhanParamSuspiciousOrder` for `preg_replace_callback` (#3680)\n+ Fix false positive `PhanUnanalyzableInheritance` for renamed methods from traits. (#3695)\n+ Fix false positive `PhanUndeclaredConstant` previously seen for inherited class constants in some parse orders. (#3706)\n+ Fix uncaught `TypeError` converting `iterable<T>` to nullable (#3709)\n\nJan 25 2020, Phan 2.4.8\n-----------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix bug introduced in 2.4.7 where there were more false positives when `--no-progress-bar` was used. (#3677)\n\nJan 22 2020, Phan 2.4.7\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Add an environment variable `PHAN_NO_UTF8=1` to always avoid UTF-8 in progress bars.\n  This may help with terminals or logs that have issues with UTF-8 output.\n  Error messages will continue to include UTF-8 when part of the error.\n+ Allow `phan --init` to complete even if composer.json has no configured `autoload` directories,\n  as long as at least one directory or file was configured.\n+ Add a setting `error_prone_truthy_condition_detection` that can be enabled to warn about error-prone truthiness/falsiness checks.  New issue types:\n  - `PhanSuspiciousTruthyCondition` (e.g. for `if ($x)` where `$x` is `object|int`)\n  - `PhanSuspiciousTruthyString` (e.g. for `?string` - `'0'` is also falsey in PHP)\n+ Limit calculation of max memory usage to the **running** worker processes with `--processes N` (#3606)\n+ Omit options that should almost always be on (e.g. `analyze_signature_compatibility`) from the output of `phan --init` (#3660)\n+ Allow `phan --init` to create config file with `target_php_version` of `'7.4'` or `'8.0'` based on composer.json (#3671)\n\nNew Features(Analysis):\n+ Infer that merging defined variables with possibly undefined variables is also possibly undefined. (#1942)\n+ Add a fallback when some types of conditional check results in a empty union type in a loop:\n  If all types assigned to the variable in a loop in a function are known,\n  then try applying the condition to the union of those types. (#3614)\n  (This approach was chosen because it needs to run only once per function)\n+ Infer that assignment operations (e.g. `+=`) create variables if they were undefined.\n+ Properly infer that class constants that weren't literal int/float/strings have real type sets in their union types.\n+ Normalize union types of generic array elements after fetching `$x[$offset]`.\n  (e.g. change `bool|false|null` to `?bool`)\n+ Normalize union types of result of `??` operator.\n+ Fix false positives in redundant condition detection for the real types of array accesses. (#3638, #3645, #3650)\n+ Support the `non-empty-string` type in phpdoc comments (neither `''` nor `'0'`).\n  Warn about redundant/impossible checks of `non-empty-string`.\n+ Support the `non-zero-int` type in phpdoc comments. Infer it in real types and warn about redundant checks for zero/truthiness.\n+ Support the the `non-empty-mixed` in phpdoc comments and in inferences.\n+ Fix false positives possibly undefined variable warnings after conditions\n  such as `if (X || count($x = []))`, `if (X && preg_match(..., $matches))`, etc.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix a crash analyzing assignment operations on `$GLOBALS` such as `$GLOBALS['var'] += expr;` (#3615)\n+ Fix false positive `Phan[Possibly]UndeclaredGlobalVariable` after conditions such as `assert($var instanceof MyClass` when the variable was not assigned to within the file or previously analyzed files.

(#3237)\n\n  Attempts to parse or analyze mixins can be disabled by setting `read_mixin_annotations` to `false` in your Phan config.\n+ Support `@readonly` as an alias of the `@phan-read-only` annotation.\n+ Also emit `PhanImpossibleTypeComparison` for `int === float` checks. (#3106)\n+ Emit `PhanSuspiciousMagicConstant` when using `__METHOD__` in a function instead of a method.\n+ Check return types and parameter types of global functions which Phan has signatures for,\n  when `ignore_undeclared_functions_with_known_signatures` is `false` and `PhanUndeclaredFunction` is emitted.

(#3198)\n\nOct 26 2019, Phan 2.4.0\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Support saving and loading baselines with `--save-baseline=.phan/baseline.php` and `--load-baseline=.phan/baseline.php`. (#2000)\n  `--save-baseline` will save all pre-existing issues for the provided analysis settings to a file.\n  When Phan is invoked later with `--load-baseline`, it will ignore any\n  issue kinds in the files from `file_suppressions` in the baseline.\n\n  This is useful for setting up analysis with Phan on a new project,\n  or when enabling stricter analysis settings.\n\n  Different baseline files can be used for different Phan configurations.\n  (e.g. `.phan/baseline_deadcode.php` for runs with `--dead-code-detection`)\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Fix edge cases in checking if some nullable types were possibly falsey\n  (`?true` and literal floats (e.g. `?1.1`))\n+ Emit `PhanCoalescingNeverNull` instead of `PhanCoalescingNeverNullIn*`\n  if it's impossible for the node kind to be null.

(#3396)\n+ Properly emit PhanPossiblyInfiniteRecursionSameParams for functions with varargs.\n+ Emit `PhanNoopNew` or `PhanNoopNewNoSideEffects` when an object is created with `new expr(...)` but the result is not used (#3410)\n  This can be suppressed for all instances of a class-like by adding the `@phan-constructor-used-for-side-effects` annotation to the class's doc comment.\n+ Emit `PhanPluginUseReturnValueInternalKnown` for unused results of function calls on the right-hand side of control flow operators (`??`/`?:`/`&&`/`||`) (#3408)\n\nOct 20 2019, Phan 2.3.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Instead of printing the full help when Phan CLI args or configuration is invalid,\n  print just the errors/warnings and instructions and `Type ./phan --help (or --extended-help) for usage.`\n+ Add an option `--debug-signal-handler` that can be used to diagnose\n  why Phan or a plugin is slow or hanging. (Requires the `pcntl` module)\n  This installs a signal handler that response to SIGINT (aka Ctrl-C), SIGUSR1, and SIGUSR2.\n+ Print a single backtrace in the crash reporter with the file, line, and arguments instead of multiple backtraces.\n+ Emit a warning suggesting using `--long-option` instead when `-long-option[=value]` is passed in.\n+ Change colorization of some error messages. Print some warnings to stderr instead of using `error_log()`.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Emit `PhanTypeMismatchPropertyRealByRef` or `PhanTypeMismatchPropertyByRef`\n  when potentially assigning an incompatible type to a php 7.4 typed property\n  (or a property with a phpdoc type).\n+ Warn about suspicious uses of `+` or `+=` on array shapes or lists. (#3364)\n  These operator will prefer the fields from the left hand side,\n  and will merge lists instead of concatenate them.\n  New issue types: `PhanSuspiciousBinaryAddLists`, `PhanUselessBinaryAddRight`\n+ Improvements to inferred types of `sort`, `array_merge`, etc. (#3354)\n+ Fix bug allowing any array shape type to cast to a list.\n+ Warn about unnecessary branches leading to identical return statements in pure functions, methods, and closures (#3383)\n  This check is only run on pure methods.\n\n  This requires that `UseReturnValuePlugin` be enabled and works best when `'plugin_config' => ['infer_pure_methods' => true]` is set.\n+ Allow `list<X>` to cast to `array{0:X, 1?:X}` (#3390)\n+ Speed up computing line numbers of diagnostics in the polyfill/fallback parser when there are multiple diagnostics.\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Reduce the CPU usage of the language server's main process when the `pcntl` module is used to fork analysis processes (Unix/Linux).\n+ Speed up serializing large responses in language server mode (e.g. when a string has an unmatched quote).\n\nOct 13 2019, Phan 2.3.0\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Limit --debug-emitted-issues to the files that weren't excluded from analysis.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Add support for `list<T>` and `non-empty-list<T>` in phpdoc and in inferred values.\n  These represent arrays with consecutive integer keys starting at 0 without any gaps (e.g. `function (string ...$args) {}`)\n+ Add support for `associative-array<T>` and `non-empty-associative-array<T>` in phpdoc and in inferred values. (#3357)\n\n  These are the opposite of `list<T>` and `non-empty-associative-list<T>`. `list` cannot cast to `associative-array` and vice-versa.\n  These represent arrays that are unlikely to end up with consecutive integer keys starting at 0 without any gaps.\n  `associative-array` is inferred after analyzing code such as the following:\n\n  - Expressions such as `[$uid1 => $value, $uid2 => $value2]` with unknown keys\n  - Unsetting an array key of a variable.\n  - Adding an unknown array key to an empty array.\n  - Certain built-in functions, such as `array_filter` or `array_unique`,\n    which don't preserve all keys and don't renumber array keys.\n\n  Note that `array<string, T>` is always treated like an associative array.\n\n  However, `T[]` (i.e. `array<mixed, T>`) is not treated like `associative-array<mixed, T>` (i.e. `associative-array<T>`).\n  Phan will warn about using the latter (`associative-array`) where a list is expected, but not the former (`array`).\n+ Allow omitting keys from array shapes for sequential array elements\n  (e.g. `array{stdClass, array}` is equivalent to `array{0:stdClass, 1:array}`).\n+ Add array key of array shapes in the same field order that php would for assignments such as `$x = [10]; $x[1] = 11;`. (#3359)\n+ Infer that arrays are non-empty after analyzing code such as `$x[expr] = expr` or `$x[] = expr`.\n+ Infer that arrays are possibly empty after analyzing code such as `unset($x[expr]);`.\n+ Fix false positives in redundant condition detection when the source union type contains the `mixed` type.\n\nOct 03 2019, Phan 2.2.13\n------------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Always print 100% in `--progress-bar` after completing any phase of analysis.\n  This is convenient for tools such as `tool/phoogle` that exit before starting the next phase.\n+ Add GraphML output support to `DependencyGraphPlugin`.\n  This allows `tool/pdep` output to be imported by Neo4j, Gephi and yEd\n+ Add json output and import to `tool/pdep`\n  For caching large graphs in order to generate multiple sub-graphs without re-scanning\n+ Add setting `infer_default_properties_in_construct`.\n  When this is enabled, infer that properties of `$this` are initialized to their default values at the start of `__construct()`. (#3213)\n  (this is limited to instance properties which are declared in the current class (i.e. not inherited)).\n  Off by default.\n+ Add a config setting `strict_object_checking`. (#3262)\n  When enabled, Phan will warn if some of the object types in the union type don't contain a property.\n  Additionally, warn about definite non-object types when accessing properties.\n  Also add `--strict-object-checking` to enable this setting.\n+ Add CLI option `--debug-emitted-issues={basic,verbose}` to print the stack trace of when Phan emitted the issue to stderr.\n  Useful for understanding why Phan emitted an issue.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Disable `simplify_ast` by default.\n  Phan's analysis of compound conditions and assignments/negations in conditions has improved enough that it should no longer be necessary.\n+ Import more specific phpdoc/real array return types for internal global functions from opcache.\n+ Emit `PhanUndeclaredVariable` and other warnings about arguments when there are too many parameters for methods. (#3245)\n+ Infer real types of array/iterable keys and values in more cases.\n+ Expose the last compilation warning seen when tokenizing or parsing with the native parser, if possible (#3263)\n  New issue types: `PhanSyntaxCompileWarning`\n  Additionally, expose the last compilation warning or deprecation notice seen when tokenizing in the polyfill.\n+ Improve inference of when the real result of a binary operation is a float. (#3256)\n+ Emit stricter warnings for more real type mismatches (#3256)\n  (e.g. emit `PhanTypeMismatchArgumentReal` for `float->int` when `strict_types=1`, `'literal string'->int`, etc.)\n+ Consistently infer that variadic parameters are arrays with integer keys. (#3294)\n+ Improve types inferred when the config setting `enable_extended_internal_return_type_plugins` is enabled.\n+ Speed up sorting the list of parsed files, and avoid unnecessary work in `--dump-parsed-file-list`.\n+ Emit `PhanEmptyForeach` and `PhanEmptyYieldFrom` when iterating over empty arrays.\n+ Infer that properties of `$this` are initialized to their default values at the start of `__construct()`. (#3213)\n  (this is limited to instance properties which are declared in the current class (i.e. not inherited)).\n  To disable this, set `infer_default_properties_in_construct` to false.\n+ Improve analysis of conditions on properties of `$this`, such as `if (isset($this->prop['field1']['field2']))` (#3295)\n+ Improve suggestions for `PhanUndeclaredFunction`.\n  Properly suggest similar global functions for non-fully qualified calls in namespaces.\n  Suggest `new ClassName()` as a suggestion for `ClassName()`.\n+ Improve suggestions for global constants (`PhanUndeclaredConstant`).\n  Suggest similar constant names case-insensitively within the same namespace or the global namespace.\n+ Suggest obvious getters and setters for instance properties in `PhanAccessPropertyProtected` and `PhanAccessPropertyPrivate` (#2540)\n+ When `strict_method_checking` is enabled,\n  warn if some of the **object** types in the union type don't contain that method. (#3262)\n+ Make stronger assumptions about real types of global constants.\n  Assume that constants defined with `define(...)` can have any non-object as its real type,\n  to avoid false positives in redundant condition detection.\n+ Properly infer that parameter defaults and global constants will resolve to `null` in some edge cases.\n+ Emit `PhanCompatibleDefaultEqualsNull` when using a different constant that resolves to null as the default of a non-nullable parameter. (#3307)\n+ Emit `PhanPossiblyInfiniteRecursionSameParams` when a function or method calls itself with the same parameter values it was declared with (in a branch). (#2893)\n  (This requires unused variable detection to be enabled, when there are 1 or more parameters)\n+ Analyze complex conditions such as `switch (true)`, `if (($x instanceof stdClass) == false)`, etc. (#3315)\n+ Add a `non-empty-array` type, for arrays that have 1 or more elements.\n  This gets inferred for checks such as `if ($array)`, `if (!empty($array))` (checks on `count()` are not supported yet)\n  (`non-empty-array<ValueT>` and `non-empty-array<KeyT, ValueT>` can also be used in phpdoc)\n+ Support checking if comparisons of types with more than one possible literal scalar are redundant/impossible.\n  Previously, Phan would only warn if both sides had exactly one possible scalar value.\n  (e.g. warn about `'string literal' >= $nullableBool`)\n+ Fix edge cases analyzing conditions on superglobals.\n+ Be more consistent about when PhanTypeArraySuspiciousNullable is emitted, e.g. for `?mixed`, `array|null`, etc.\n+ Fix false positive impossible condition for casting mixed to an array.\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Fix logged Error when language server receives `didChangeConfiguration` events. (this is a no-op)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Fix failure to emit `PhanPluginDescriptionlessComment*` when a description\n  would be automatically generated from the property or method's return type. (#3265)\n+ Support checking for duplicate phpdoc descriptions of properties or methods within a class in `HasPHPDocPlugin`.\n  Set `'plugin_config' => ['has_phpdoc_check_duplicates' => true]` to enable these checks.\n  (this skips deprecated methods/properties)\n+ Implement `LoopVariableReusePlugin`, to detect reusing loop variables in nested loops. (#3045)\n  (e.g. `for ($i = 0; $i < 10; $i++) { /* various code ... */ foreach ($array as $i => $value) { ... } }`)\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Make `\\Phan\\Library\\None` a singleton in internal uses.\n+ Normalize folders in the config file generated by `phan --init` in the vendor autoload directories.\n+ Update internal element types and documentation maps.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Consistently deduplicate the real type set of union types (fixes some false positives in redundant condition detection).\n+ Fix `\\Phan\\Debug`'s dumping representation of flags for `ast\\AST_DIM`, `ast\\AST_ARRAY_ELEM`,\n  `ast\\AST_PARAM`, `ast\\AST_ASSIGN_OP` (`??=`), and `ast\\AST_CONDITIONAL`.\n\n  This affects some crash reporting and tools such as `internal/dump_fallback_ast.php`\n+ Fix some infinite recursion edge cases caused parsing invalid recursive class inheritance. (#3264)\n\nSep 08 2019, Phan 2.2.12\n------------------------\n\nNew features(CLI):\n+ Improve error messages when the `--init-*` flags are provided without passing `--init`.

(e.g. `$this->foo->prop = 'x';` is allowed)\n  - This annotation does not imply that methods have no side effects (e.g. I/O, modifying global state)\n  - This annotation does not imply that methods have deterministic return values or that methods' results should be used.\n\n  `@phan-immutable` is an alias of `@phan-read-only`. `@phan-read-only` was previously supported on properties.\n+ Support `@phan-side-effect-free` annotation on class doc comments,\n  to indicate that all instances of the class are `@phan-immutable`\n  and that methods of the class are free of external side effects. (#3182)\n\n  - All instance properties are treated as read-only.\n  - Almost all instance methods are treated as `@phan-side-effect-free` - their return values must be used.\n    (excluding a few magic methods such as __wakeup, __set, etc.)\n    This does not imply that they are deterministic (e.g. `rand()`, `file_get_contents()`, and `microtime()` are allowed)\n+ Add `@phan-side-effect-free` as a clearer name of what `@phan-pure` implied for methods.\n+ Fix false positives for checking for redundant conditions with `iterable` and `is_iterable`.\n+ Properly infer real types for `is_resource` checks and other cases where UnionType::fromFullyQualifiedRealString() was used.\n+ Avoid false positives for the config setting `'assume_real_types_for_internal_functions'`.\n  Include all return types for many internal global functions for `--target-php-version` of `7.[0-4]`,\n  including those caused by invalid arguments or argument counts.\n+ Warn about division, modulo, and exponentiation by 0 (or by values that would cast to 0).\n+ Fix a bug converting absolute paths to relative paths when the project directory is a substring of a subdirectory (#3158)\n+ Show the real signature of the abstract method in PhanClassContainsAbstractMethod issues.

(#3082)\n  This can be used when the result should be treated exactly like the original type for static analysis.\n\nPlugins:\n+ In EmptyStatementListPlugin, warn about switch statements where all cases are no-ops. (#3030)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix infinite recursion seen when passing `void` to something expecting a non-null type.

(#3059)\n+ Infer that the `void` should be treated similarly to null\n  (in addition to existing checks, it's redundant to compare them to null).\n  Don't warn about `return null;` in functions/methods with phpdoc-only `@return void`.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `StrictComparisonPlugin`, which warns about the following issue types:\n\n  1. Using `in_array` or `array_search` without specifying `$strict`. (`PhanPluginComparisonNotStrictInCall`)\n  2. Using comparison or weak equality operators when both sides are possibly objects. (`PhanPluginComparisonObjectEqualityNotStrict`, `PhanPluginComparisonObjectOrdering`)\n+ Don't warn in `EmptyStatementListPlugin` if a TODO/FIXME/\"Deliberately empty\" comment is seen around the empty statement list. (#3036)\n  (This may miss some TODOs due to `php-ast` not providing the end line numbers)\n  The setting `'plugin_config' => ['empty_statement_list_ignore_todos' => true]` can be used to make it unconditionally warn about empty statement lists.\n+ Improve checks for UseReturnValuePlugin for functions where warning depend on their arg count (`call_user_func`, `trait`/`interface`/`class_exists`, `preg_match`, etc)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ When a typed property has an incompatible default, don't infer the union type from the default.

(#1640)\n  Note that this does not affect files within the issue message.\n+ Properly render the progress bar when Phan runs with multiple processes (#2928)\n+ Add an HTML output mode to generate an unstyled HTML fragment.\n  Example CSS styles can be generated with `internal/dump_html_styles.php`\n+ Add a `light` color scheme for white backgrounds.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Fix failure to infer real types when an invoked function or method had a phpdoc `@return` in addition to the real type.\n+ Infer union type from all classes that an instance method could possibly be, not just the first type seen in the expression's union type.

(e.g. `[1, 2, ...$arr1, 5]`) (#2779)\n  NOTE: This does not yet check all types of errors, some code is unmigrated, and the polyfill does not yet support this.\n+ Improve the check for invalid array unpacking in function calls with iterable/Traversable parameters. (#2779)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Improve help messages for `internal/dump_fallback_ast.php` (this tool may be of use when developing plugins)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Work around issues parsing binary operators in PHP 7.4-dev.\n  Note that the latest version of php-ast (currently 1.0.2-dev) should be installed if you are testing Phan with PHP 7.4-dev.\n\n13 May 2019, Phan 2.0.0-RC2\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Support analysis of PHP 7.4's short arrow function syntax (`fn ($arg) => expr`) (#2714)\n  (requires php-ast 1.0.2dev or newer)\n\n  Note that the polyfill does not yet support this syntax.\n+ Infer the return types of PHP 7.4's magic methods `__serialize()` and `__unserialize()`. (#2755)\n  Improve analysis of return types of other magic methods such as `__sleep()`.\n+ Support more of PHP 7.4's function signatures (e.g. `WeakReference`) (#2756)\n+ Improve detection of unused variables inside of loops/branches.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Detect some new php 7.3 functions (`array_key_first`, etc.) in `UseReturnValuePlugin`.\n+ Don't emit a `PhanNativePHPSyntaxCheckPlugin` error in `InvokePHPNativeSyntaxCheckPlugin` due to a shebang before `declare(strict_types=1)`\n+ Fix edge cases running `PhanNativePHPSyntaxCheckPlugin` on Windows (in language server/daemon mode)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Analyze the remaining expressions in a statement after emitting `PhanTraitParentReference` (#2750)\n+ Don't emit `PhanUndeclaredVariable` within a closure if a `use` variable was undefined outside of it. (#2716)\n\n09 May 2019, Phan 2.0.0-RC1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Enable language server features by default. (#2358)\n  `--language-server-disable-go-to-definition`, `--language-server-disable-hover`, and `--language-server-disable-completion`\n  can be used to disable those features.\n\nBackwards Incompatible Changes:\n+ Drop support for running Phan with PHP 7.0. (PHP 7.0 reached its end of life in December 2018)\n  Analyzing codebases with `--target-php-version 7.0` continues to be supported.\n+ Require php-ast 1.0.1 or newer (or the absence of php-ast with `--allow-polyfill-parser`)\n  Phan switched from using [AST version 50 to version 70](https://github.com/nikic/php-ast#ast-versioning).\n\nPlugins:\n+ Change `PluginV2` to `PluginV3`\n  `PluginV2` and its capabilities will continue to work to make migrating to Phan 2.x easier, but `PluginV2` is deprecated and will be removed in Phan 3.\n\n  `PluginV3` has the same APIs and capabilities as PluginV2, but uses PHP 7.1 signatures (`void`, `?MyClass`, etc.)\n+ Third party plugins may need to be upgraded to support changes in AST version 70, e.g. the new node kinds `AST_PROP_GROUP` and `AST_CLASS_NAME`\n+ Add `PHPDocToRealTypesPlugin` to suggest real types to replace (or use alongside) phpdoc return types.\n  This does not check that the phpdoc types are correct.\n\n  `--automatic-fix` can be used to automate making these changes for issues that are not suppressed.\n+ Add `PHPDocRedundantPlugin` to detect functions/methods/closures where the doc comment just repeats the types in the signature.\n  (or when other parts don't just repeat information, but the `@return void` at the end is redundant)\n+ Add a `BeforeAnalyzePhaseCapability`. Unlike `BeforeAnalyzeCapability`, this will run after methods are analyzed, not before.\n\n09 May 2019, Phan 1.3.4\n-----------------------\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix bug in Phan 1.3.3 causing polyfill parser to be used if the installed version of php-ast was older than 1.0.1.\n\n08 May 2019, Phan 1.3.3\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Make the progress bar guaranteed to display 100% at the end of the analysis phase (#2694)\n  Print a newline to stderr once Phan is done updating the progress bar.\n+ Add `maximum_recursion_depth` - This setting specifies the maximum recursion depth that\n  can be reached during re-analysis.\n  Default is 2.\n+ Add `--constant-variable-detection` - This checks for variables that can be replaced with literals or constants. (#2704)\n  This is almost entirely false positives in most coding styles, but may catch some dead code.\n+ Add `--language-server-disable-go-to-definition`, `--language-server-disable-hover`, and `--language-server-disable-completion`\n  (These are already disabled by default, but will be enabled by default in Phan 2.0)\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Emit `PhanDeprecatedClassConstant` for code using a constant marked with `@deprecated`.\n+ When recursively inferring the return type of `BaseClass::method()` from its return statements,\n  make that also affect the inherited copies of that method (`SubClass::method()`). (#2718)\n  This change is limited to methods with no return type in the phpdoc or real signature.\n+ Improve unused variable detection: Detect more unused variables for expressions such as `$x++` and `$x -= 2` (#2715)\n+ Fix false positive `PhanUnusedVariable` after assignment by reference (#2730)\n+ Warn about references, static variables, and uses of global variables that are probably unnecessary (never used/assigned to afterwards) (#2733)\n  New issue types: `PhanUnusedVariableReference`, `PhanUnusedVariableGlobal`,  `PhanUnusedVariableStatic`\n+ Warn about invalid AST nodes for defaults of properties and static variables. (#2732)\n+ Warn about union types on properties that might have an incomplete suffix. (e.g. `/** @var array<int, */`) (#2708)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add more forms of checks such as `$x !== null ? $x : null` to `PhanPluginDuplicateConditionalNullCoalescing` (#2691)\n\n28 Apr 2019, Phan 1.3.2\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Add `--debug`/`-D` flag to generate verbose debug output.\n  This is useful when looking into poor performance or unexpected behavior (e.g. infinite loops or crashes).\n+ Suggest similarly named plugins if `--plugin SomePluginName` refers to a built-in plugin that doesn't exist.\n+ Add `assume_no_external_class_overrides` - When enabled, Phan will more aggressively assume class elements aren't overridden.\n  - e.g. infer that non-final methods without return statements have type `void`.\n  Disabled by default.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Support locally tracking assignments to and conditionals on `$this->prop` inside of function scopes. (#805, #204)\n\n  This supports only one level of nesting. (i.e. Phan will not track `$this->prop->subProp` or `$this->prop['field']`)\n\n  Properties are deliberately tracked for just the variable `$this` (which can't be reassigned), and not other variables.\n+ Fix false positives with dead code detection for internal stubs in `autoload_internal_extension_signatures`. (#2605)\n+ Add a way to escape/unescape array shape keys (newlines, binary data, etc) (#1664)\n\n  e.g. `@return array{\\n\\r\\t\\x01\\\\:true}` in phpdoc would correspond to `return [\"\\n\\r\\t\\x01\\\\\" => true];`\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `FFIAnalysisPlugin` to avoid false positives in uses of PHP 7.4's `FFI\\CData`  (#2659)\n  (C data of scalar types may be read and assigned as regular PHP data. `$x = FFI::new(“int”); $x = 42;`)\n\n  Note that this is only implemented for variables right now.\n\n20 Apr 2019, Phan 1.3.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Fix false positive `PhanTypeMismatchReturnNullable` and `PhanTypeMismatchArgumentNullable` introduced in 1.3.0 (#2667)\n+ Emit `PhanPossiblyNullTypeMismatchProperty` instead of `PhanTypeMismatchProperty` when assigning `?T`\n  to a property expecting a compatible but non-nullable type.\n\n  (The same issue was already emitted when the internal union type representation was `T|null` (not `?T`) and strict property type checking was enabled)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `PossiblyStaticMethodPlugin` to detect instance methods that can be changed to static methods (#2609)\n+ Fix edge cases checking if left/right-hand side of binary operations are numbers in `NumericalComparisonPlugin`\n\n19 Apr 2019, Phan 1.3.0\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Fix false positive `UnusedSuppression` when a doc comment suppresses an issue about itself. (#2571)\n+ Improve analysis of argument unpacking with reference parameters, fix false positive `PhanTypeNonVarPassByRef` (#2646)\n+ In issue descriptions and suggestions, replace invalid utf-8 (and literal newlines) with placeholders (#2645)\n+ Suggest typo fixes in `PhanMisspelledAnnotation` for `@phan-*` annotations. (#2640)\n+ Emit `PhanUnreferencedClass` when the only references to a class or its elements are within that class.\n  Previously, it would fail to be emitted when a class referenced itself.\n+ Emit `PhanUnusedPublicNoOverrideMethodParameter` for method parameters that are not overridden and are not overrides. (#2539)\n\n  This is expected to have a lower false positive rate than `PhanUnusedPublicMethodParameter` because parameters\n  might be unused by some of the classes overriding/implementing a method.\n\n  Setting `unused_variable_detection_assume_override_exists` to true in `.phan/config.php` can be used to continue emitting the old issue names instead of `*NoOverride*` equivalents.\n+ Warn about more numeric operations(+, /, etc) on unknown strings and non-numeric literal strings (#2656)\n  The settings `scalar_implicit_cast` and `scalar_implicit_partial` affect this for the `string` union type but not for literals.\n+ Improve types inferred from checks such as `if (is_array($var['field'])) { use($var['field']); }` and `if ($var['field'] instanceof stdClass) {...}` (#2601)\n+ Infer that $varName is non-null and an object for conditions such as `if (isset($varName->field['prop']))`\n+ Be more consistent about warning when passing `?SomeClass` to a parameter expecting non-null `SomeClass`.\n+ Add `PhanTypeMismatchArgumentNullable*` and `PhanTypeMismatchReturnNullable` when the main reason the type check failed was nullability\n\n  Previously, Phan would fail to detect that some nullable class instances were incompatible with the non-null expected types in some cases.\n+ Improve analysis of negation of `instanceof` checks on nullable types. (#2663)\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Analyze new but unsaved files, if they would be analyzed by Phan once they actually were saved to disk.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Warn about assignments where the left-hand and right-hand side are the same expression in `DuplicateExpressionPlugin` (#2641)\n  New issue type: `PhanPluginDuplicateExpressionAssignment`\n\nDeprecations:\n+ Print a message to stderr if the installed php-ast version is older than 1.0.1.\n  A future major Phan version of Phan will probably depend on AST version 70 to support new syntax found in PHP 7.4.\n+ Print a message to stderr if the installed PHP version is 7.0.\n  A future major version of Phan will require PHP 7.1+ to run.\n\n  Phan will still continue to support setting `target_php_version` to `'7.0'` and `--target-php-version 7.0` in that release.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix edge cases in how Phan checks if files are in `exclude_analysis_directory_list` (#2651)\n+ Fix crash parsing comma in string literal in array shape (#2597)\n  (e.g. `@param array{0:'test,other'} $x`)\n\n06 Apr 2019, Phan 1.2.8\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI):\n+ Fix edge cases initializing directory list and target versions of config files (#2629, #2160)\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Support analyzing `if (false !== is_string($var))` and similar complex conditions. (#2613)\n+ Emit `PhanUnusedGotoLabel` for labels without a corresponding `goto` in the same function scope. (#2617)\n  (note that Phan does not understand the effects of goto on control flow)\n+ Don't emit `PhanUnreferencedClass` for anonymous classes. (#2604)\n+ Detect undeclared types in phpdoc callables and closures. (#2562)\n+ Warn about unreferenced PHPDoc `@property`/`@property-read`/`@property-write` annotations in `--dead-code-detection`.\n  New issue types: `PhanWriteOnlyPHPDocProperty`, `PhanReadOnlyPHPDocProperty`, `PhanUnreferencedPHPDocProperty`.\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Make escaped string arguments fit on a single line for more issue types.\n+ Rename `UseContantNoEffect` to `UseConstantNoEffect`.\n+ Rename `AddressableElement::isStrictlyMoreVisibileThan()` to `isStrictlyMoreVisibleThan`.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Fix edge case where `WhitespacePlugin` would not detect trailing whitespace.\n+ Detect `PhanPluginDuplicateSwitchCaseLooseEquality` in `DuplicateArrayKeyPlugin`. (#2310)\n  Warn about cases of switch cases that are loosely equivalent to earlier cases, and which might get unexpectedly missed because of that. (e.g. `0` and `'foo'`)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Catch and handle \"Cannot access parent when not in object context\" when parsing global functions incorrectly using `parent` parameter type. (#2619)\n+ Improve the performance of `--progress-bar` when the terminal width can't be computed by symfony. (#2634)\n\n22 Mar 2019, Phan 1.2.7\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI,Configs)\n+ Use a progress bar for `--progress-bar` on Windows instead of printing dots. (#2572)\n  Use ASCII characters for the progress bar instead of UTF-8 if the code page isn't utf-8 or if Phan can't infer the terminal's code page (e.g. in PHP < 7.1)\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Make \"Go to Definition\" work when the constructor of a user-defined class is inherited from an internal class. (#2598)\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Update tolerant-php-parser version to 0.0.17\n  (fix parsing of some edge cases, minor performance improvement, prepare to support php 7.4 in polyfill)\n+ Use paratest for phpunit tests in Travis/Appveyor\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Make the codeclimate plugin analyze the correct directory. Update the dependencies of the codeclimate plugin. (#2139)\n+ Fix false positive checking for undefined offset with `$foo['strVal']` when strings are in the union type of `$foo` (#2541)\n+ Fix crash in analysis of `call_user_func` (#2576)\n+ Fix a false positive PhanTypeInvalidDimOffset for `unset` on array fields in conditional branches. (#2591)\n+ Fix edge cases where types for variables inferred in one branch affect unrelated branches (#2593)\n\n09 Mar 2019, Phan 1.2.6\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI,Configs)\n+ Add config `enable_extended_internal_return_type_plugins` to more aggressively\n  infer literal values for functions such as `json_decode`, `strtolower`, `implode`, etc. (disabled by default),\n+ Make `--dead-code-detection` load `UnreachableCodePlugin` if that plugin isn't already loaded (#1824)\n+ Add `--automatic-fix` to fix any issues Phan is capable of fixing\n  (currently a prototype. Fixes are guessed based on line numbers).\n  This is currently limited to:\n  - unreferenced use statements on their own line (requires `--dead-code-detection`).\n  - issues emitted by `WhitespacePlugin` (#2523)\n  - unqualified global function calls/constant uses from namespaces (requires `NotFullyQualifiedUsagePlugin`)\n    (will do the wrong thing for functions that are both global and in the same namespace)\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Make Phan infer more precise literal types for internal constants such as `PHP_EOF`.\n  These depend on the PHP binary used to run Phan.\n\n  In most cases, that shouldn't matter.\n+ Emit `PhanPluginPrintfVariableFormatString` in `PrintfCheckerPlugin` if the inferred format string isn't a single literal (#2431)\n+ Don't emit `PhanWriteOnlyPrivateProperty` with dead code detection when at least one assignment is by reference (#1658)\n+ Allow a single hyphen between words in `@suppress issue-name` annotations (and `@phan-suppress-next-line issue-name`, etc.) (#2515)\n  Note that CamelCase issue names are conventional for Phan and its plugins.\n+ Emit `PhanCompatibleAutoload` when using `function __autoload() {}` instead of `spl_autoload_register() {}` (#2528)\n+ Be more aggressive about inferring that the result is `null` when accessing array offsets that don't exist. (#2541)\n+ Fix a false positive analyzing `array_map` when the closure has a dependent return type. (#2554)\n+ Emit `PhanNoopArrayAccess` when an array field is fetched but not used (#2538)\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Fix an error in the language server on didChangeConfiguration\n+ Show hover text of ancestors for class elements (methods, constants, and properties) when no summary is available for the class element. (#1945)\n\nMaintenance\n+ Don't exit if the AST version Phan uses (currently version 50) is deprecated by php-ast (#1134)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Write `PhanSelfCheckPlugin` for self-analysis of Phan and plugins for Phan. (#1576)\n  This warns if too many/too few arguments are provided for the issue template when emitting an issue.\n+ Add `AutomaticFixCapability` for plugins to provide fixes for issues for `--automatic-fix` (#2549)\n+ Change issue messages for closures in `UnknownElementTypePlugin` (#2543)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix bug: `--ignore-undeclared` failed to properly ignore undeclared elements since 1.2.3 (#2502)\n+ Fix false positive `PhanTypeInvalidDimOffset` for functions nested within other functions.\n+ Support commas in the union types of parameters of magic methods (#2507)\n+ Fix parsing `?(A|B|C)` (#2551)\n\n27 Feb 2019, Phan 1.2.5\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Cache ASTs generated by the polyfill to disk by default, improving performance of the polyfill parser.\n  (e.g. affects use cases where `php-ast` is not installed and `--use-polyfill-parser` is enabled).\n\n  ASTs generated by the native parser (`php-ast`) are not cached.\n\n  (For the language server/daemon mode, Phan stops reading from/writing to the cache after it finishes initializing)\n+ Be more consistent warning about invalid callables passed to internal functions such as `register_shutdown_function` (#2046)\n+ Add `@phan-suppress-next-next-line` to suppress issues on the line 2 lines below the comment. This is useful in block comments/doc comments. (#2470)\n+ Add `@phan-suppress-previous-line` to suppress issues on the line above the comment. (#2470)\n+ Detect `PhanRedefineClassConstant` and `PhanRedefineProperty` when class constants and properties are redefined. (#2492)\n\nNew features(CLI):\n+ Add `--disable-cache` to disable the disk cache of ASTs generated by the polyfill.\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Show plaintext summaries of internal classes, functions, methods, constants, and properties when hover text is requested.\n+ Show descriptions of superglobals and function parameters when hovering over a variable.\n\nMaintenance\n+ Render the constants in `PhanUndeclaredMagicConstant` as `__METHOD__` instead of `MAGIC_METHOD`\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `WhitespacePlugin` to check for trailing whitespace, tabs, and carriage returns in PHP files.\n+ Add `HandleLazyLoadInternalFunctionCapability` so that plugins can modify Phan's information about internal global functions when those functions are loaded after analysis starts.\n+ Add `SuspiciousParamOrderPlugin` which guesses if arguments to functions are out of order based on the names used in the argument expressions.\n\n  E.g. warns about invoking `function example($first, $second, $third)` as `example($mySecond, $myThird, $myFirst)`\n+ Warn if too many arguments are passed to `emitIssue`, `emitPluginIssue`, etc. (#2481)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Support parsing nullable template types in PHPDoc (e.g. `@return ?T`)\n+ Allow casting `null` to `?\\MyClass<\\Something>`.\n+ Fix false positive PhanUndeclaredMagicConstant for `__METHOD__` and `__FUNCTION__` in function/method parameters (#2490)\n+ More consistently emit `PhanParamReqAfterOpt` in methods (#1843).\n\n18 Feb 2019, Phan 1.2.4\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Inherit more specific phpdoc template types even when there are real types in the signature. (#2447)\n  e.g. inherit `@param MyClass<T>` and `@return MyClass<U>` from the\n  ancestor class of `function someMethod(MyClass $x) : MyClass {}`.\n\n  This is only done when each phpdoc type is compatible with the real signature type.\n+ Warn about `@var Type` without a variable name in doc comments of function-likes (#2445)\n+ Infer side effects of `array_push` and `array_unshift` on complex expressions such as properties. (#2365)\n+ Warn when a non-string is used as a property name for a dynamic property access (#1402)\n+ Don't emit `PhanAccessMethodProtected` for `if ($this instanceof OtherClasslike) { $this->protectedMethod(); }` (#2372)\n  (This only applies to uses of the variable `$this`, e.g. in closures or when checking interfaces)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Warn about unspecialized array types of elements in UnknownElementTypePlugin. `mixed[]` can be used when absolutely nothing is known about the array's key or value types.\n+ Warn about failing to use the return value of `var_export($value, true)` (and `print_r`) in `UseReturnValuePlugin` (#2391)\n+ Fix plugin causing `InvalidVariableIssetPlugin` to go into an infinite loop for `isset(self::CONST['offset'])` (#2446)\n\nMaintenance\n+ Limit frames of stack traces in crash reports to 1000 bytes of encoded data. (#2444)\n+ Support analysis of the upcoming php 7.4 `??=` operator (#2369)\n+ Add a `target_php_version` option for PHP 7.4.\n  This only affects inferred function signatures, and does not allow parsing newer syntax.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix a crash seen when parsing return typehint for `Closure` in a different case (e.g. `closure`) (#2438)\n+ Fix an issue loading the autoloader multiple times when the `vendor` folder is not lowercase on case-sensitive filesystems (#2440)\n+ Fix bug causing template types on methods to not work properly when inherited from a trait method.\n+ Catch and warn when declaring a constant that would conflict with built in keywords (true/false/null) and prevent it from affecting inferences. (#1642)\n\n10 Feb 2019, Phan 1.2.3\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI):\n+ Add `-I <file_list>` as an alias of `--include-analysis-file-list <file>`.\n+ Support repeating the include option (`-I <file_or_list> -I <file_or_list>`)\n  and the exclude option (`-3 <file_or_list> -3 <file_or_list>`).\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Inherit more specific phpdoc types even when there are real types in the signature. (#2409)\n  e.g. inherit `@param array<int,\\stdClass>` and `@return MyClass[]` from the\n  ancestor class of `function someMethod(array $x) : array {}`.\n\n  This is only done when each phpdoc type is compatible with the real signature type.\n+ Detect more expressions without side effects: `PhanNoopEmpty` and `PhanNoopIsset` (for `isset(expr)` and `empty(expr)`) (#2389)\n+ Also emit `PhanNoopBinaryOperator` for the `??`, `||`, and `&&` operators,\n  but only when the result is unused and the right-hand side has no obvious side effects. (#2389)\n+ Properly analyze effects of a property/field access expression as the key of a `foreach` statement. (#1601)\n+ Emit `PhanTypeInstantiateTrait` when calling `new TraitName()` (#2379)\n+ Emit `PhanTemplateTypeConstant` when using `@var T` on a class constant's doc comment.

(#857)\n\n02 Feb 2019, Phan 1.2.2\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI):\n+ Emit a warning to stderr if no files were parsed when Phan is invoked. (#2289)\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Add `@phan-extends` and `@extends` as an alias of `@inherits` (#2351)\n+ Make checks such as `$x !== 'a literal'` (and `!=`) remove the literal string/int type from the union type.

(#1915)\n\n  New issue type: `PhanInvalidWriteToTemporaryExpression`\n+ Fix a crash seen with --use-fallback-parser with an invalid expression after `new`\n+ Properly infer that closures have a class name of `Closure` for some issue types.\n  (e.g. `call_user_func([function() {}, 'invalidMethod'])`)\n+ Fix a bug analyzing nested assignment in conditionals (#1919)\n+ Don't include impossible types when analyzing assertions such as `is_string($var)` (#1932)\n\n26 Aug 2018, Phan 1.0.1\n-----------------------\n\nNew features(CLI,Configs)\n+ Support setting a `target_php_version` of PHP 7.3 in the config file or through `--target-php-version`.\n+ Assume that `__construct`, `__destruct`, `__set`, `__get`, `__unset`, `__clone`, and `__wakeup` have return types of void if unspecified.\n\nNew features(Analysis)\n+ Add function signatures for functions added/modified in PHP 7.3. (#1537)\n+ Improve the line number for warnings about unextractable `@property*` annotations.\n+ Make Phan aware that `$x` is not false inside of loops such as `while ($x = dynamic_value()) {...}` (#1646)\n+ Improve inferred types of `$x` in complex equality/inequality checks such as `if (($x = dynamic_value()) !== false) {...}`\n+ Make `!is_numeric` assertions remove `int` and `float` from the union type of an expression. (#1895)\n+ Preserve any matching original types in scalar type assertions (#1896)\n  (e.g. a variable `$x` of type `?int|?MyClass` will have type `int` after `assert(is_numeric($x))`)\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Add/modify various function, methods, and property type signatures.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add `UnknownElementTypePlugin` to warn about functions/methods\n  that have param/return types that Phan can't infer anything about.\n  (it can still infer some things in non-quick mode about parameters)\n\n  New issue types: `PhanPluginUnknownMethodReturnType`, `PhanPluginUnknownClosureReturnType`, `PhanPluginUnknownFunctionReturnType`, `PhanPluginUnknownPropertyType`\n+ Add `DuplicateExpressionPlugin` to warn about duplicated expressions such as:\n  - `X == X`, `X || X`, and many other binary operators (for operators where it is likely to be a bug)\n  - `X ? X : Y` (can often simplify to `X ?: Y`)\n  - `isset(X) ? X : Y` (can simplify to `??` in PHP 7)\n\n  New issue types: `PhanPluginDuplicateExpressionBinaryOp`, `PhanPluginDuplicateConditionalTernaryOperation`, `PhanPluginDuplicateConditionalNullCoalescing`\n+ Improve types inferred for `$matches` for PregRegexCheckerPlugin.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Properly handle `CompileError` (that are not the subclass `ParseError`). CompileError was added in PHP 7.3.\n  (Phan now logs these the same way it would log other syntax errors, instead of treating this like an unexpected Error.)\n+ Make sure that private methods that are generators, that are inherited from a trait, aren't treated like a `void`.\n+ Fix a crash analyzing a dynamic call to a static method, which occurred when dead code detection or reference tracking was enabled. (#1889)\n+ Don't accidentally emit false positive issues about operands of binary operators in certain contexts. (#1898)\n\n12 Aug 2018, Phan 1.0.0\n-----------------------\n\nThe Phan 1.0.0 release supports analysis of php 7.0-7.2, and can be executed with php 7.0+.\nThis release replaces the previous 0.12.x releases.\nBecause Phan uses PHP's Reflection APIs, it's recommended to use the same PHP minor version for analyzing the code as would be used to run the code.\n(For the small number of function/method signatures, etc., that were added or changed in each minor release of PHP.)\n\nPlugins:\n+ Plugins: Remove V1 plugins (and V1 plugin examples), as well as legacy plugin capabilities. (#249)\n  Third party plugin authors must use V2 of the plugin system.\n\n  Removed capabilities:\n\n  - `AnalyzeNodeCapability`, `LegacyAnalyzeNodeCapability`, `LegacyPostAnalyzeNodeCapability` (use `PostAnalyzeNodeCapability` instead)\n  - `LegacyPreAnalyzeNodeCapability` (use `PreAnalyzeNodeCapability` instead)\n+ API: Remove various methods that were deprecated. (#249)\n  Any plugins using those methods will need to be updated.\n  (e.g. `Config::getValue('config_value')` must be used instead of `Config::get()->config_value`)\n+ Config: Remove `progress_bar_sample_rate` (#249)\n  (`progress_bar_sample_interval` must be used instead if you want the progress bar to be faster or slower)\n+ Maintenance: Immediately report the exception and exit if any plugins threw an uncaught `Throwable` during initialization.\n  (E.g. this results in a better error message when a third party plugin requires PHP 7.1 syntax but PHP 7.0 is used to run Phan)\n\n21 Jul 2018, Phan 0.12.15\n-------------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis)\n+ Make Phan's unused variable detection also treat exception variables as variable definitions,\n  and warn if the caught exception is unused. (#1810)\n  New issue types: `PhanUnusedVariableCaughtException`\n+ Be more aggressive about inferring that a method has a void return type, when it is safe to do so\n+ Emit `PhanInvalidConstantExpression` in some places where PHP would emit `\"Constant expression contains invalid operations\"`\n\n  Phan will replace the default parameter type (or constant type) with `mixed` for constants and class constants.\n\n  Previously, this could cause Phan to crash, especially with `--use-fallback-parser` on invalid ASTs.\n+ Improve analysis of arguments passed to `implode()`\n\nNew features(CLI)\n+ Add `--daemonize-tcp-host` CLI option for specifying the hostname for daemon mode (#1868).\n  The default will remain `127.0.0.1` when not specified.\n  It can be overridden to values such as `0.0.0.0` (publicly accessible, e.g. for usage with Docker)\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Implement support for hover requests in the Language Server (#1738)\n\n  This will show a preview of the element definition (showing signature types instead of PHPDoc types)\n  along with the snippet of the element description from the doc comment.\n\n  Clients that use this should pass in the CLI option `--language-server-enable-hover` when starting the language server.\n\n  - Note that this implementation assumes that clients sanitize the mix of markdown and HTML before rendering it.\n  - Note that this may slow down some language server clients if they pause while waiting for the hover request to finish.\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Add a workaround for around a notice in PHP 7.3alpha4  (that Phan treats as fatal) (#1870)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix a bug in checking if nullable versions of specialized type were compatible with other nullable types. (#1839, #1852)\n  Phan now correctly allows the following type casts:\n\n  - `?1`               can cast to `?int`\n  - `?'a string'`      can cast to `?string`\n  - `?Closure(T1):T2`  can cast to `?Closure`\n  - `?callable(T1):T2` can cast to `?callable`,\n+ Make `exclude_file_list` work more consistently on Windows.\n\n08 Jul 2018, Phan 0.12.14\n-------------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs)\n+ Add `warn_about_undocumented_throw_statements` and `exception_classes_with_optional_throws_phpdoc` config. (#90)\n\n  If `warn_about_undocumented_throw_statements` is true, Phan will warn about uncaught throw statements that aren't documented in the function's PHPDoc.\n  (excluding classes listed in `exception_classes_with_optional_throws_phpdoc` and their subclasses)\n  This does not yet check function and method calls within the checked function that may themselves throw.\n\n  Add `warn_about_undocumented_exceptions_thrown_by_invoked_functions`.\n  If enabled (and `warn_about_undocumented_throw_statements` is enabled),\n  Phan will warn about function/closure/method invocations that have `@throws`\n  that aren't caught or documented in the invoking method.\n  New issue types: `PhanThrowTypeAbsent`, `PhanThrowTypeAbsentForCall`,\n  `PhanThrowTypeMismatch`, `PhanThrowTypeMismatchForCall`\n\n  Add `exception_classes_with_optional_throws_phpdoc` config.\n  Phan will not warn about lack of documentation of `@throws` for any of the configured classes or their subclasses.\n  The default is the empty array (Don't suppress any warnings.)\n  (E.g. Phan suppresses `['RuntimeException', 'AssertionError', 'TypeError']` for self-analysis)\n\nNew Features (Analysis):\n+ Warn when string literals refer to invalid class names (E.g. `$myClass::SOME_CONSTANT`). (#1794)\n  New issue types: `PhanTypeExpectedObjectOrClassNameInvalidName` (emitted if the name can't be used as a class)\n  This will also emit `PhanUndeclaredClass` if the class name could not be found.\n+ Make Phan aware that `$this` doesn't exist in a static closure (#768)\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Fix another rare bug that can cause crashes in the polyfill/fallback parser when parsing invalid or incomplete ASTs.\n+ Add a `--language-server-hide-category` setting to hide the issue category from diagnostic messages.\n+ Remove the numeric diagnostic code from the language server diagnostics (a.k.a. issues).\n  (Certain language clients such as LanguageClient-neovim would render that the code in the quickfix menu, wasting space)\n+ Support \"go to definition\" for union types within all code comment types  (#1704)\n  (e.g. can go to definition in `// some annotation or comment mentioning MyType`)\n\nNew features(Analysis)\n+ Support analysis of [`list()` reference assignment](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/list_reference_assignment) for php 7.3 (which is still in alpha). (#1537)\n+ Warn about invalid operands of the unary operators `+`, `-`, and `~`\n  New issue types: `PhanTypeInvalidUnaryOperandNumeric` and `PhanTypeInvalidUnaryOperandBitwiseNot` (#680)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Fix a bug causing Phan to infer extra wrong types (`ancestorClass[][]`) for `@return className[]` (#1822)\n+ Start warning about assignment operations (e.g. `+=`) when the modified variable isn't referenced later in the function.\n+ Make exceptions in `catch{}` always include the type `Throwable` even if the declared type doesn't. (#336)\n\n16 Jun 2018, Phan 0.12.13\n-------------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis)\n+ Support integer literals both in PHPDoc and in Phan's type system. (E.g. `@return -1|string`)\n  Include integer values in issue messages if the values are known.\n+ Support string literals both in PHPDoc and in Phan's type system. (E.g. `@return 'example\\n'`)\n  Phan can now infer possible variable values for dynamic function/method calls, etc.\n\n  Note: By default, Phan does not store representations of strings longer than 50 characters. This can be increased with the `'max_literal_string_type_length'` config.\n\n  Supported escape codes: `\\\\`, `\\'`, `\\r`, `\\n`, `\\t`, and hexadecimal (`\\xXX`).\n+ Improve inferred types of unary operators.\n+ Warn about using `void`/`iterable`/`object` in use statements based on `target_php_version`. (#449)\n  New issue types: `PhanCompatibleUseVoidPHP70`, `PhanCompatibleUseObjectPHP71`, `PhanCompatibleUseObjectPHP71`\n+ Warn about making overrides of inherited property and constants less visible (#788)\n  New issue types: `PhanPropertyAccessSignatureMismatch`, `PhanPropertyAccessSignatureMismatchInternal`,\n  `PhanConstantAccessSignatureMismatch`, `PhanConstantAccessSignatureMismatchInternal`.\n+ Warn about making static properties into non-static properties (and vice-versa) (#615)\n  New issue types: `PhanAccessNonStaticToStaticProperty`, `PhanAccessStaticToNonStaticProperty`\n+ Warn about inheriting from a class/trait/interface that has multiple possible definitions (#773)\n  New issue types: `PhanRedefinedExtendedClass`, `PhanRedefinedUsedTrait`, `PhanRedefinedInheritedInterface`\n+ Infer more accurate types for the side effects of assignment operators (i.e. `+=`, `.=`, etc) and other binary operations. (#1775)\n+ Warn about invalid arguments to binary operators or assignment operators.\n  New issue types: `PhanTypeInvalidLeftOperandOfAdd`,  `PhanTypeInvalidLeftOperandOfNumericOp`,\n                   `PhanTypeInvalidRightOperandOfAdd`, `PhanTypeInvalidRightOperandOfNumericOp`\n+ Warn about using negative string offsets and multiple catch exceptions in PHP 7.0 (if `target_php_version` is less than `'7.1'`). (#1771, #1778)\n  New issue types: `PhanCompatibleMultiExceptionCatchPHP70`, `PhanCompatibleNegativeStringOffset`.\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Update signature map with more accurate signatures (#1761)\n+ Upgrade tolerant-php-parser, making the polyfill/fallback able to parse PHP 7.1's multi exception catch.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Don't add more generic types to properties with more specific PHPDoc types (#1783).\n  For example, don't add `array` to a property declared with PHPDoc type `/** @var string[] */`\n+ Fix uncaught `AssertionError` when `parent` is used in PHPDoc (#1758)\n+ Fix various bugs that can cause crashes in the polyfill/fallback parser when parsing invalid or incomplete ASTs.\n+ Fix unparsable/invalid function signature entries of rarely used functions\n+ Warn about undefined variables on the left-hand side of assignment operations (e.g. `$x .= 'string'`) (#1613)\n\n08 Jun 2018, Phan 0.12.12\n-------------------------\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Increase the severity of some issues to critical\n  (if they are likely to cause runtime Errors in the latest PHP version).\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Allow suppressing `PhanTypeInvalidThrows*` with doc comment suppressions\n  in the phpdoc of a function/method/closure.\n+ Fix crashes when fork pool is used and some issue types are emitted (#1754)\n+ Catch uncaught exception for PhanContextNotObject when calling `instanceof self` outside a class scope (#1754)\n\n30 May 2018, Phan 0.12.11\n-------------------------\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Make the language server work more reliably when `pcntl` is unavailable. (E.g. on Windows) (#1739)\n+ By default, allow the language server and daemon mode to start with the fallback even if `pcntl` is unavailable.\n  (`--language-server-require-pcntl` can be used to make the language server refuse to start without `pcntl`)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Don't crash if `ext-tokenizer` isn't installed (#1747)\n+ Fix invalid output of `tool/make_stubs` for APCu (#1745)\n\n27 May 2018, Phan 0.12.10\n-------------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs)\n+ Add CLI flag `--unused-variable-detection`.\n+ Add config setting `unused_variable_detection` (disabled by default).\n  Unused variable detection can be enabled by `--unused-variable-detection`, `--dead-code-detection`, or the config.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Add built-in support for unused variable detection. (#345)\n  Currently, this is limited to analyzing inside of functions, methods, and closures.\n  This has some minor false positives with loops and conditional branches.\n\n  Warnings about unused parameters can be suppressed by adding `@phan-unused-param` on the same line as `@param`,\n  e.g. `@param MyClass $x @phan-unused-param`.\n  (as well as via standard issue suppression methods.)\n\n  The built in unused variable detection support will currently not warn about any of the following issue types, to reduce false positives.\n\n  - Variables beginning with `$unused` or `$raii` (case-insensitive)\n  - `$_` (the exact variable name)\n  - Superglobals, used globals (`global $myGlobal;`), and static variables within function scopes.\n  - Any references, globals, or static variables in a function scope.\n\n  New Issue types:\n  - `PhanUnusedVariable`,\n  - `PhanUnusedVariableValueOfForeachWithKey`, (has a high false positive rate)\n  - `PhanUnusedPublicMethodParameter`, `PhanUnusedPublicFinalMethodParameter`,\n  - `PhanUnusedProtectedMethodParameter`, `PhanUnusedProtectedFinalMethodParameter`,\n  - `PhanUnusedPrivateMethodParameter`, `PhanUnusedProtectedFinalMethodParameter`,\n  - `PhanUnusedClosureUseVariable`, `PhanUnusedClosureParameter`,\n  - `PhanUnusedGlobalFunctionParameter`\n\n  This is similar to the third party plugin `PhanUnusedVariable`.\n  The built-in support has the following changes:\n\n  - Emits fewer/different false positives (e.g. when analyzing loops), but also detects fewer potential issues.\n  - Reimplemented using visitors extensively (Similar to the code for `BlockAnalysisVisitor`)\n  - Uses a different data structure from `PhanUnusedVariable`.\n    This represents all definitions of a variable, instead of just the most recent one.\n    This approximately tracks the full graph of definitions and uses of variables within a function body.\n    (This allows warning about all unused definitions, or about definitions that are hidden by subsequent definitions)\n  - Integration: This is planned to be integrated with other features of Phan, e.g. \"Go to Definition\" for variables. (Planned for #1211 and #1705)\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Minor improvements to `UnusedSuppressionPlugin`\n\nMisc:\n+ Support  `composer.json`'s `vendor-dir` for `phan --init`\n\n22 May 2018, Phan 0.12.9\n------------------------\n\nNew features(CLI, Configs):\n+ Add CLI flag `--language-server-enable-go-to-definition`. See the section \"Language Server/Daemon mode\".\n+ Add Config setting `disable_line_based_suppression` to disable line-based suppression from internal comments. See the section \"New Features\"\n+ Add Config setting `disable_file_based_suppression` to disable file-based issue suppressions.\n\nNew features(Analysis):\n+ Make `@suppress`, `@phan-suppress`, `@phan-file-suppress` accept a comma separated issue list of issue types to suppress. (#1715)\n  Spaces aren't allowed before the commas.\n+ Implement `@phan-suppress-current-line` and `@phan-suppress-next-line` to suppress issues on the current or next line.\n\n  These can occur within any comment or doc comment (i.e. the comment types for `/*`, `//`, and `/**`)\n\n  These suppressions accept a comma separated list of issue type names.\n  Commas must be immediately after the previous issue type.\n\n  Note: Phan currently does not support inline comments anywhere else.\n  Phan also does not associate these inline comments with any information about the current scope.\n  This suppression is based on tokenizing the PHP file and determining the line based on that comment line.\n\n  Examples:\n\n  ```php\n  // @phan-suppress-next-line PhanUndeclaredVariable, PhanUndeclaredFunction optional reason goes here\n  $result = call_undefined_function() + $undefined_variable;\n\n  $closure();  /* @phan-suppress-current-line PhanParamTooFew optional reason for suppression */\n\n  /**\n   * This can also be used within doc comments:\n\n   * @phan-suppress-next-line PhanInvalidCommentForDeclarationType optional reason for suppression\n   * @property int $x\n   */\n  function my_example() {\n  }\n  ```\n\n  `PhanUnusedSuppressionPlugin` is capable of detecting if line-based suppressions are unused.\n+ Allow using `@phan-file-suppress` as a regular comment anywhere within a file (`//`, `/*`, or `/**` comments).\n  Previously, `@phan-file-suppress` could only be used inside the doc comment of an element.\n\n  `@phan-file-suppress` in no-op string literals will be deprecated in a future Phan release.\n+ Emit class name suggestions for undeclared types in param, property, return type, and thrown type declarations. (#1689)\n\n  Affects `PhanUndeclaredTypeParameter`, `PhanUndeclaredTypeProperty`, `PhanUndeclaredTypeReturnType`,\n  `PhanUndeclaredTypeThrowsType`, and `PhanInvalidThrowsIs*`\n+ Add `pretend_newer_core_methods_exist` config setting.\n  If this is set to true (the default),\n  and `target_php_version` is newer than the version used to run Phan,\n  Phan will act as though functions added in newer PHP versions exist.\n\n  Note: Currently only affects `Closure::fromCallable()`, which was added in PHP 7.1.\n  This setting will affect more functions and methods in the future.\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode:\n+ Support \"Go to definition\" for properties, classes, global/class constants, and methods/global functions (Issue #1483)\n  (Must pass the CLI option `--language-server-enable-go-to-definition` when starting the server to enable this)\n+ Support \"Go to type definition\" for variables, properties, classes, and methods/global functions (Issue #1702)\n  (Must pass the CLI option `--language-server-enable-go-to-definition` when starting the server to enable this)\n  Note that constants can't have object types in PHP, so there's no implementation of \"Go To Type Definition\" for those.\n\nPlugins:\n+ Add a new plugin capability `SuppressionCapability`\n  that allows users to suppress issues in additional ways. (#1070)\n+ Add a new plugin `SleepCheckerPlugin`. (PR #1696)\n  Warn about returning non-arrays in sleep,\n  as well as about returning array values with invalid property names.\n\n  Issue types: `SleepCheckerInvalidReturnStatement`, `SleepCheckerInvalidPropNameType`, `SleepCheckerInvalidPropName`,\n  `SleepCheckerMagicPropName`, and `SleepCheckerDynamicPropName`\n+ Make `PhanPregRegexCheckerPlugin` warn about the `/e` modifier on regexes (#1692)\n\nMisc:\n+ Add simple integration test for the language server mode.\n\nBug fixes:\n+ Be more consistent about emitting `PhanUndeclaredType*` for invalid types within array shapes.\n+ Avoid a crash when the left-hand side of an assignment is invalid. (#1693)\n+ Prevent an uncaught `TypeError` when integer variable names (e.g. `${42}`) are used in branches (Issue #1699)\n\n12 May 2018, Phan 0.12.8\n------------------------\n\nBug fixes\n+ Fix a crash that occurs when the `iterable<[KeyType,]ValueType>` annotation is used in phpdoc. (#1685)\n\n08 May 2018, Phan 0.12.7\n------------------------\n\nNew features:\n+ For `PhanUndeclaredMethod` and `PhanUndeclaredStaticMethod` issues, suggest visible methods (in the same class) with similar names.\n+ For `PhanUndeclaredConstant` issues (for class constants), suggest visible constants (in the same class) with similar names.\n+ For `PhanUndeclaredProperty` and `PhanUndeclaredStaticProperty` issues, suggest visible properties (in the same class) with similar names.\n+ When suggesting alternatives to undeclared classes,\n  also include suggestions for similar class names within the same namespace as the undeclared class.\n  (Comparing Levenshtein distance)\n\nLanguage Server/Daemon mode\n+ Make the latest version of `phan_client` include any suggestion alongside the issue message (for daemon mode).\n+ Include text from suggestions in Language Server Protocol output\n\nBug fixes\n+ Fix a bug generating variable suggestions when there were multiple similar variable names\n  (The suggestions that would show up might not be the best set of suggestions)\n+ Fix a crash in the tolerant-php-parser polyfill seen when typing out an echo statement\n+ Fix incorrect suggestions to use properties (of the same name) instead of undeclared variables in class scopes.\n  (Refer to static properties as `self::$name` and don't suggest inaccessible inherited private properties)\n+ Don't suggest obviously invalid alternatives to undeclared classes.\n  (E.g. don't suggest traits or interfaces for `new MisspelledClass`, don't suggest interfaces for static method invocations)\n\n06 May 2018, Phan 0.12.6\n------------------------\n\nNew features(Analysis)\n+ Warn about properties that are read but not written to when dead code detection is enabled\n  (Similar to existing warnings about properties that are written to but never read)\n  New issue types: `PhanReadOnlyPrivateProperty`, `PhanReadOnlyProtectedProperty`, `PhanReadOnlyPublicProperty`\n+ When warning about undeclared classes, mention any classes that have the same name (but a different namespace) as suggestions.\n\n  E.g. `test.php:26 PhanUndeclaredClassInstanceof Checking instanceof against undeclared class \\MyNS\\InvalidArgumentException (Did you mean class \\InvalidArgumentException)`\n+ When warning about undeclared variables (outside of the global scope), mention any variables that have similar names (based on case-insensitive Levenshtein distance) as suggestions.\n\n  In method scopes: If `$myName` is undeclared, but `$this->myName` is declared (or inherited), `$this->myName` will be one of the suggestions.\n+ Warn about string and numeric literals that are no-ops. (E.g. `<?php 'notEchoedStr'; \"notEchoed $x\"; ?>`)\n  New issue types: `PhanNoopStringLiteral`, `PhanNoopEncapsulatedStringLiteral`, `PhanNoopNumericLiteral`.\n\n  Note: This will not warn about Phan's [inline type checks via string literals](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code#inline-type-checks-via-string-literals)\n+ When returning an array literal (with known keys) directly,\n  make Phan infer the array literal's array shape type instead of a combination of generic array types.\n+ Make type casting rules stricter when checking if an array shape can cast to a given generic array type.\n  (E.g. `array{a:string,b:int}` can no longer cast to `array<string,int>`, but can cast to `array<string,int>|array<string,string>`).\n\n  E.g. Phan will now warn about `/** @return array<string,int> */ function example() { $result = ['a' => 'x', 'b' => 2]; return $result; }`\n+ Warn about invalid expressions/variables encapsulated within double-quoted strings or within heredoc strings.\n  New issue type: `TypeSuspiciousStringExpression` (May also emit `TypeConversionFromArray`)\n\n+ Add support for template params in iterable types in phpdoc. (#824)\n  Phan supports `iterable<TValue>` and `iterable<TKey, TValue>` syntaxes. (Where TKey and TValue are union types)\n  Phan will check that generic arrays and array shapes can cast to iterable template types.\n+ Add support for template syntax of Generator types in phpdoc. (#824)\n  Supported syntaxes are:\n\n  1. `\\Generator<TValue>`\n  2. `\\Generator<TKey,TValue>`\n  3. `\\Generator<TKey,TValue,TSend>` (TSend is the expected type of `$x` in `$x = yield;`)\n  4. `\\Generator<TKey,TValue,TSend,TReturn>` (TReturn is the expected type of `expr` in `return expr`)\n\n  New issue types: `PhanTypeMismatchGeneratorYieldValue`, `PhanTypeMismatchGeneratorYieldKey` (For comparing yield statements against the declared `TValue` and `TKey`)\n\n  Additionally, Phan will use `@return Generator|TValue[]` to analyze the yield statements\n  within a function/method body the same way as it would analyze `@return Generator<TValue>`.\n  (Analysis outside the method would not change)\n\n+ Add support for template params in Iterator and Traversable types in phpdoc. (#824)\n  NOTE: Internal subtypes of those classes (e.g. ArrayObject) are not supported yet.\n  Supported syntaxes are:\n\n  1. `Traversable<TValue>`/`Iterator<TValue>`\n  2. `Traversable<TKey,TValue>`/`Iterator<TKey,TValue>`\n\n+ Analyze `yield from` statements.\n\n  New issue types: `PhanTypeInvalidYieldFrom` (Emitted when the expression passed to `yield from` is not a Traversable or an array)\n\n  Warnings about the inferred keys/values of `yield from` being invalid reuse `PhanTypeMismatchGeneratorYieldValue` and `PhanTypeMismatchGeneratorYieldKey`\n+ Make the union types within the phpdoc template syntax of `iterator`/`Traversable`/`Iterator`/`Generator` affect analysis of the keys/values of `foreach` statements\n+ Improve Phan's analysis of array functions modifying arguments by reference, reducing false positives. (#1662)\n  Affects `array_shift`/`array_unshift`/`array_push`/`array_pop`/`array_splice`.\n\nMisc\n+ Infer that a falsey array is the empty array shape.\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Consistently warn about unreferenced declared properties (i.e. properties that are not magic or dynamically added).\n  Previously, Phan would just never warn if the class had a `__get()` method (as a heuristic).\n\n03 Apr 2018, Phan 0.12.5\n------------------------\n\nPlugins\n+ Add an option `'php_native_syntax_check_max_processes'` to `'plugin_config'` for `InvokePHPNativeSyntaxCheckPlugin`.\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Remove extra whitespace from messages of comment text in `UnextractableAnnotationElementName` (e.g. `\"\\r\"`)\n+ Fix bugs in `InvokePHPNativeSyntaxCheckPlugin`\n\n31 Mar 2018, Phan 0.12.4\n------------------------\n\nNew Features(CLI, Configs)\n+ Add a `strict_param_checking` config setting. (And a `--strict-param-checking` CLI flag)\n  If this is set to true, then Phan will warn if at least one of the types\n  in an argument's union type can't cast to the expected parameter type.\n  New issue types: `PhanPartialTypeMismatchArgument`, `PhanPossiblyNullTypeArgument`, and `PhanPossiblyFalseTypeArgument`\n  (along with equivalents for internal functions and methods)\n\n  Setting this to true will likely introduce large numbers of warnings.\n  Those issue types would need to be suppressed entirely,\n  or with `@phan-file-suppress`, or with `@suppress`.\n+ Add a `strict_property_checking` config setting. (And a `--strict-property-checking` CLI flag)\n  If this is set to true, then Phan will warn if at least one of the types\n  in an assignment's union type can't cast to the expected property type.\n  New issue types: `PhanPartialTypeMismatchProperty`, `PhanPossiblyNullTypeProperty`, and `PhanPossiblyFalseTypeProperty`\n\n  NOTE: This option does not make Phan check if all possible expressions have a given property, but may do that in the future.\n+ Add a `strict_return_checking` config setting. (And a `--strict-return-checking` CLI flag)\n  If this is set to true, then Phan will warn if at least one of the types\n  in a return statement's union type can't cast to the expected return type.\n  New issue types: `PhanPartialTypeMismatchReturn`, `PhanPossiblyNullTypeReturn`, and `PhanPossiblyFalseTypeReturn`\n\n  Setting this to true will likely introduce large numbers of warnings.\n  Those issue types would need to be suppressed entirely,\n  or with `@phan-file-suppress`, or with `@suppress`.\n+ Add a `--strict-type-checking` CLI flag, to enable all of the new strict property/param/return type checks.\n+ Add a `guess_unknown_parameter_type_using_default` config,\n  which can be enabled to make Phan more aggressively infer the types of undocumented optional parameters\n  from the parameter's default value.\n  E.g. `function($x = 'val')` would make Phan infer that the function expects $x to have a type of `string`, not `string|mixed`.\n\nPlugins\n+ Add a new plugin `InvokePHPNativeSyntaxCheckPlugin` on all analyzed files (but not files excluded from analysis) (#629)\n+ Add a new plugin capability `AfterAnalyzeFileCapability` that runs after a given file is analyzed.\n  This does not get invoked for files that are excluded from analysis, or for empty files.\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n+ Detect unreachable catch statements (#112)\n  (Check if an earlier catch statement caught an ancestor of a given catch statement)\n+ Support phpdoc3's `scalar` type in phpdoc. (#1589)\n  That type is equivalent to `bool|float|int|string`.\n+ Improve analysis of return statements with ternary conditionals (e.g. `return $a ?: $b`).\n+ Start analyzing negated `instanceof` conditionals such as `assert(!($x instanceof MyClass))`.\n+ Infer that the reference parameter's resulting type for `preg_match` is a `string[]`, not `array` (when possible)\n  (And that the type is `array{0:string,1:int}[]` when `PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE` is passed as a flag)\n+ Warn in more places when Phan can't extract union types or element identifiers from a doc comment.\n  New issue types: `UnextractableAnnotationElementName`, `UnextractableAnnotationSuffix`.\n  (E.g. warn about `@param int description` (ideally has param name) and `@return int?` (Phan doesn't parse the `?`, should be `@return ?int`))\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Don't emit false positive `PhanTypeArraySuspiciousNullable`, etc. for complex isset/empty/unset expressions. (#642)\n+ Analyze conditionals wrapped by `@(cond)` (e.g. `if (@array_key_exists('key', $array)) {...}`) (#1591)\n+ Appending an unknown type to an array shape should update Phan's inferred keys(int) and values(mixed) of an array. (#1560)\n+ Make line numbers for arguments more accurate\n+ Infer that the result of `|` or `&` on two strings is a string.\n+ Fix a crash caused by empty FQSENs for classlike names or function names (#1616)\n\n24 Mar 2018, Phan 0.12.3\n------------------------\n\nNew Features(CLI, Configs)\n+ Add `--polyfill-parse-all-element-doc-comments` for PHP 7.0.\n  If you're using the polyfill (e.g. using `--force-polyfill-parser`), this will parse doc comments on class constants in php 7.0.\n  (Normally, the polyfill wouldn't include that information, to closely imitate `php-ast`'s behavior)\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n+ Infer the type of `[]` as `array{}` (the empty array), not `array`. (#1382)\n+ Allow phpdoc `@param` array shapes to contain optional fields. (E.g. `array{requiredKey:int,optionalKey?:string}`) (#1382)\n  An array shape is now allowed to cast to another array shape, as long as the required fields are compatible with the target type,\n  and any optional fields from the target type are absent in the source type or compatible.\n+ In issue messages, represent closures by their signatures instead of as `\\closure_{hexdigits}`\n+ Emit `PhanTypeArrayUnsetSuspicious` when trying to unset the offset of something that isn't an array or array-like.\n+ Add limited support for analyzing `unset` on variables and the first dimension of arrays.\n  Unsetting variables does not yet work in conditional branches.\n+ Don't emit `PhanTypeInvalidDimOffset` in `isset`/`empty`/`unset`\n+ Improve Phan's analysis of loose equality (#1101)\n+ Add new issue types `PhanWriteOnlyPublicProperty`, `PhanWriteOnlyProtectedProperty`, and `PhanWriteOnlyPrivateProperty`,\n  which will be emitted on properties that are written to but never read from.\n  (Requires that dead code detection be enabled)\n+ Improve Phan's analysis of switch statements and fix bugs. (#1561)\n+ Add `PhanTypeSuspiciousEcho` to warn about suspicious types being passed to echo/print statements.\n  This now warns about booleans, arrays, resources, null, non-stringable classes, combinations of those types, etc.\n  (`var_export` or JSON encoding usually makes more sense for a boolean/null)\n+ Make Phan infer that top-level array keys for expressions such as `if (isset($x['keyName']))` exist and are non-null. (#1514)\n+ Make Phan infer that top-level array keys for expressions such as `if (array_key_exists('keyName', $x))` exist. (#1514)\n+ Make Phan aware of types after negated of `isset`/`array_key_exists` checks for array shapes (E.g. `if (!array_key_exists('keyName', $x)) { var_export($x['keyName']); }`)\n  Note: This will likely fail to warn if the variable is already a mix of generic arrays and array shapes.\n+ Make Phan check that types in `@throws` annotations are valid; don't warn about classes in `@throws` being unreferenced. (#1555)\n  New issue types: `PhanUndeclaredTypeThrowsType`, `PhanTypeInvalidThrowsNonObject`, `PhanTypeInvalidThrowsNonThrowable`, `PhanTypeInvalidThrowsIsTrait`, `PhanTypeInvalidThrowsIsInterface`\n\nNew types:\n+ Add `Closure` and `callable` with annotated param types and return to Phan's type system(#1578, #1581).\n  This is not a part of the phpdoc2 standard or any other standard.\n  These can be used in any phpdoc tags that Phan is aware of,\n  to indicate their expected types (`@param`, `@var`, `@return`, etc.)\n\n  Examples:\n\n  - `function(int $x) : ?int {return $x;}` has the type `Closure(int):?int`,\n    which can cast to `callable(int):?int`\n  - `function(array &$x) {$x[] = 2;}` has the type `Closure(array&):void`\n  - `function(int $i = 2, int ...$args) : void {}`\n    has the type `Closure(int=,int...):void`\n\n  Note: Complex return types such as `int[]` or `int|false`\n  **must** be surrounded by brackets to avoid potential ambiguities.\n\n  - e.g. `Closure(int|array): (int[])`\n  - e.g. `Closure(): (int|false)`\n  - e.g. `Closure(): (array{key:string})` is not ambiguous,\n    but the return type must be surrounded by brackets for now\n\n  Other notes:\n  - For now, the inner parameter list of `Closure(...)`\n    cannot contain the characters `(` or `)`\n    (or `,`, except to separate the arguments)\n    Future changes are planned to allow those characters.\n  - Phan treats `Closure(T)` as an alias of `Closure(T):void`\n  - Placeholder variable names can be part of these types,\n    similarly to `@method` (`Closure($unknown,int $count=0):T`\n    is equivalent to `Closure(mixed,int):T`\n\nMaintenance\n+ Add `--disable-usage-on-error` option to `phan_client` (#1540)\n+ Print directory which phan daemon is going to await analysis requests for (#1544)\n+ Upgrade the dependency `Microsoft/tolerant-php-parser` to 0.0.10 (includes minor bug fixes)\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Allow phpdoc `@param` array shapes to contain union types (#1382)\n+ Remove leading `./` from Phan's relative paths for files (#1548, #1538)\n+ Reduce false positives in dead code detection for constants/properties/methods.\n+ Don't warn when base classes access protected properties of their subclasses.\n\n02 Mar 2018, Phan 0.12.2\n------------------------\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n\n+ Emit `PhanTypeInvalidDimOffsetArrayDestructuring` when an unknown offset value is used in an array destructuring assignment (#1534, #1477)\n  (E.g. `foreach ($expr as ['key' => $value])`, `list($k) = [2]`, etc.)\n\nPlugins\n+ Add a new plugin capability `PostAnalyzeNodeCapability` (preferred) and `LegacyPostAnalyzeNodeCapability`.\n  These capabilities give plugins for post-order analysis access to a list of parent nodes,\n  instead of just the last parent node.\n  Plugin authors should use these instead of `AnalyzeNodeCapability` and `LegacyAnalyzeNodeCapability`.\n\n  (`parent_node_list` is set as an instance property on the visitor returned by PostAnalyzeNodeCapability\n  if the instance property was declared)\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Speed up analysis when quick mode isn't used.\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Reduce false positives in `PhanTypeInvalidDimOffset`\n+ Don't warn when adding new keys to an array when assigning multiple dimensions at once (#1518)\n+ Reduce false positives when a property's type gets inferred as an array shape(#1520)\n+ Reduce false positives when adding fields to an array in the global scope.\n+ Reduce false positives by converting array shapes to generic arrays before recursively analyzing method/function invocations (#1525)\n\n28 Feb 2018, Phan 0.12.1\n------------------------\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n+ Emit `PhanTypeInvalidDimOffset` when an unknown offset is fetched from an array shape type. (#1478)\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Fix an \"Undefined variable\" error when checking for php 7.1/7.0 incompatibilities in return types. (#1511)\n  Fix other crashes.\n\n25 Feb 2018, Phan 0.12.0\n------------------------\n\nThe Phan 0.12.0 release supports analysis of php 7.0-7.2, and can be executed with php 7.0+.\nThis release replaces the previous releases (The 0.11 releases for php 7.2, the 0.10 releases for php 7.1, and the 0.8 releases for php 7.0)\nBecause Phan uses Reflection, it's recommended to use the same PHP minor version for analyzing the code as would be used to run the code.\n(For the small number of function/method signatures, etc., that were added or changed in each minor release of PHP.)\n\nAfter upgrading Phan, projects using phan should add a `target_php_version` setting to their `.phan/config.php`.\n\nNew Features(CLI, Configs)\n+ Add a `target_php_version` config setting, which can be set to `'7.0'`, `'7.1'`, `'7.2'`, or `null`/`'native'`. (#1174)\n  This defaults to the same PHP minor version as the PHP binary used to run Phan.\n  `target_php_version` can be overridden via the CLI option `--target-php-version {7.0,7.1,7.2,native}`\n\n  NOTE: This setting does not let a PHP 7.0 installation parse PHP 7.1 nullable syntax or PHP 7.1 array destructuring syntax.\n\n  If you are unable to upgrade the PHP version used for analysis to php 7.1, the polyfill parser settings may help\n  (See `--force-polyfill-parser` or `--use-fallback-parser`. Those have a few known bugs in edge cases.)\n+ Add `--init` CLI flag and CLI options to affect the generated config. (#145)\n  (Options: `--init-level=1..5`, `--init-analyze-dir=path/to/src`, `--init-analyze-file=path/to/file.php`, `--init-no-composer`, `--init-overwrite`)\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n+ In doc comments, support `@phan-var`, `@phan-param`, `@phan-return`, `@phan-property`, and `@phan-method`. (#1470)\n  These annotations will take precedence over `@var`, `@param`, `@return`, `@property`, and `@method`.\n+ Support `@phan-suppress` as an alias of `@suppress`.\n+ Add a non-standard way to explicitly set var types inline.  (#890)\n  `; '@phan-var T $varName'; expression_using($varName);` and\n  `; '@phan-var-force T $varName'; expression_using($varName);`\n\n  If Phan sees a string literal containing `@phan-var` as a top-level statement of a statement list, it will immediately set the type of `$varName` to `T` without any type checks.\n  (`@phan-var-force T $x` will do the same thing, and will create the variable if it didn't already exist).\n\n  Note: Due to limitations of the `php-ast` parser, Phan isn't able to use inline doc comments, so this is the solution that was used instead.\n\n  Example Usage:\n\n  ```php\n  $values = mixed_expression();\n\n  // Note: This annotation must go **after** setting the variable.\n  // This has to be a string literal; phan cannot parse inline doc comments.\n  '@phan-var array<int,MyClass> $values';\n\n  foreach ($x as $instance) {\n      function_expecting_myclass($x);\n  }\n  ```\n+ Add a way to suppress issues for the entire file (including within methods, etc.) (#1190)\n  The `@phan-file-suppress` annotation can also be added to phpdoc for classes, etc.\n  This feature is recommended for use at the top of the file or on the first class in the file.\n  It may or may not affect statements above the suppression.\n  This feature may fail to catch certain issues emitted during the parse phase.\n\n  ```php\n  <?php\n  // Add a suppression for remaining statements in this file.\n  '@phan-file-suppress PhanUnreferencedUseNormal (description)';\n  use MyNS\\MyClass;\n  // ...\n\n  /** @SomeUnreadableAnnotation {MyClass} */\n  class Example { }\n  ```\n\n+ Add `CompatibleNullableTypePHP70`, `CompatibleShortArrayAssignPHP70`, `CompatibleKeyedArrayAssignPHP70`,\n  `CompatibleKeyedArrayAssignPHP70`, and `CompatibleIterableTypePHP70`, (#1174, #624, #449)\n  which are emitted when the `target_php_version` is less than '7.1'.\n+ Add `CompatibleObjectTypePHP71`, which is emitted for the `object` typehint when the `target_php_version`\n  is less than 7.2. (#1174, #827)\n+ Add `PhanTypeMismatchDimFetchNullable`, which is emitted if the non-null\n  version of the dimension type would be a valid index. (#1472)\n+ Emit `PhanTypeArraySuspiciousNullable` when accessing fields of a nullable array (now including `?(T[])`, etc.). (#1472)\n  (Stop emitting PhanTypeArraySuspicious for `?array`)\n+ Add `PhanNoopBinaryOperator` and `PhanNoopUnaryOperator` checks (#1404)\n+ Add `PhanCommentParamOutOfOrder` code style check. (#1401)\n  This checks that `@param` annotations appear in the same order as the real parameters.\n+ Detect unused imports (Does not parse inline doc comments) (#1095)\n  Added `PhanUnreferencedUseNormal`, `PhanUnreferencedUseFunction`, `PhanUnreferencedUseConstant`.\n\n  (Note that Phan does not parse inline doc comments, which may cause false positives for `PhanUnreferencedUseNormal`)\n+ Add `PhanTypeMismatchArrayDestructuringKey` checks for invalid array key types in list assignments (E.g. `list($x) = ['key' => 'value']` (#1383)\n\nLanguage Server\n+ Support running Language Server and daemon mode on Windows (#819)\n  (the `pcntl` dependency is no longer mandatory for running Phan as a server)\n  The `--language-server-allow-missing-pcntl` option must be set by the client.\n\n  When this fallback is used, Phan **manually** saves and restores the\n  data structures that store information about the project being analyzed.\n\n  This fallback is new and experimental.\n+ Make Phan Language Server analyze new files added to a project (Issue #920)\n+ Analyze all of the PHP files that are currently opened in the IDE\n  according to the language server client,\n  instead of just the most recently edited file (Issue #1147)\n  (E.g. analyze other files open in tabs or split windows)\n+ When closing or deleting a file, clear the issues that were emitted\n  for that file.\n+ If analysis requests (opening files, editing files, etc)\n  are arriving faster than Phan can analyze and generate responses,\n  then buffer the file changes (until end of input)\n  and then begin to generate analysis results.\n\n  Hopefully, this should reduce the necessity for limiting Phan to\n  analyzing only on save.\n\nBug fixes\n+ In files with multiple namespaces, don't use `use` statements from earlier namespaces. (#1096)\n+ Fix bugs analyzing code using functions/constants provided by group use statements, in addition to `use function` and `use const` statements.\n\n14 Feb 2018, Phan 0.11.3\n------------------------\n\n### Ported from Phan 0.10.5\n\nNew Features(CLI, Configs)\n+ Add `--allow-polyfill-parser` and `--force-polyfill-parser` options.\n  These allow Phan to be run without installing `php-ast`.\n\n  Using the native `php-ast` extension is still recommended.\n  The polyfill is slower and has several known bugs.\n\n  Additionally, the way doc comments are parsed by the polyfill is different.\n  Doc comments for elements such as closures may be parsed differently from `php-ast`\n\nMaintenance:\n+ Fix bugs in the `--use-fallback-parser` mode.\n  Upgrade the `tolerant-php-parser` dependency (contains bug fixes and performance improvements)\n\nBug fixes\n+ Fix a bug in `tool/make_stubs` when generating stubs of namespaced global functions.\n+ Fix a refactoring bug that caused methods and properties to fail to be inherited (#1456)\n+ If `ignore_undeclared_variables_in_global_scope` is true, then analyze `assert()`\n  and conditionals in the global scope as if the variable was defined after the check.\n\n11 Feb 2018, Phan 0.11.2\n------------------------\n\n### Ported from Phan 0.10.4\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n\n+ Support array key types of `int`, `string`, and `mixed` (i.e. `int|string`) in union types such as `array<int,T>` (#824)\n\n  Check that the array key types match when assigning expected param types, return types, property types, etc.\n  By default, an array with a key type of `int` can't cast to an array key type of `string`, or vice versa.\n  Mixed union types in keys can cast to/from any key type.\n\n  - To allow casting `array<int,T>` to `array<string,T>`, enable `scalar_array_key_cast` in your `.phan/config.php`.\n\n+ Warn when using the wrong type of array keys offsets to fetch from an array (E.g. `string` key for `array<int,T>`) (Issue #1390)\n+ Infer array key types of `int`, `string`, or `int|string` in `foreach` over arrays. (#1300)\n  (Phan's type system doesn't support inferring key types for `iterable` or `Traversable` right now)\n+ Support **parsing** PHPDoc array shapes\n  (E.g. a function expecting `['field' => 'a string']` can document this as `@param array{field:string}` $options)\n  For now, this is converted to generic arrays (Equivalent to `string[]`).\n\n  `[[0, ...], new stdClass]` would have type `array{0:int[], 1:string}`\n\n  - The field value types can be any union type.\n  - Field keys are currently limited to keys matching the regex `[-_.a-zA-Z0-9\\x7f-\\xff]+`. (Identifiers, numbers, '-', and '.')\n    Escape mechanisms such as backslashes (e.g. \"\\x20\" for \" \") may be supported in the future.\n+ Add `PhanTypeMismatchUnpackKey` and `PhanTypeMismatchUnpackValue` to analyze array unpacking operator (also known as splat) (#1384)\n\n  Emit `PhanTypeMismatchUnpackKey` when passing iterables/arrays with invalid keys to the unpacking operator (i.e. `...`).\n\n  Emit `PhanTypeMismatchUnpackValue` when passing values that aren't iterables or arrays to the unpacking operator.\n  (See https://secure.php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php#migration56.new-features.splat)\n+ When determining the union type of an array literal,\n  base it on the union types of **all** of the values (and all of the keys) instead of just the first 5 array elements.\n+ When determining the union type of the possible value types of an array literal,\n  combine the generic types into a union type instead of simplifying the types to `array`.\n  In practical terms, this means that `[1,2,'a']` is seen as `array<int,int|string>`,\n  which Phan represents as `array<int,int>|array<int,string>`.\n\n  In the previous Phan release, the union type of `[1,2,'a']` would be represented as `int[]|string[]`,\n  which is equivalent to `array<mixed,int>|array<mixed,string>`\n\n  Another example: `[$strKey => new MyClass(), $strKey2 => $unknown]` will be represented as\n  `array<string,MyClass>|array<string,mixed>`.\n  (If Phan can't infer the union type of a key or value, `mixed` gets added to that key or value.)\n+ Improve analysis of try/catch/finally blocks (#1408)\n  Analyze `catch` blocks with the inferences about the `try` block.\n  Analyze a `finally` block with the combined inferences from the `try` and `catch` blocks.\n+ Account for side effects of `&&` and `||` operators in expressions, outside of `if`/`assert` statements. (#1415)\n  E.g. `$isValid = ($x instanceof MyClass && $x->isValid())` will now consistently check that isValid() exists on MyClass.\n+ Improve analysis of expressions within conditionals, such as `if (!($x instanceof MyClass) || $x->method())`\n  or `if (!(cond($x) && othercond($x)))`\n\n  (Phan is now aware of the types of the right-hand side of `||` and `&&` in more cases)\n+ Add many param and return type signatures for internal functions and methods,\n  for params and return types that were previously untyped.\n  (Imported from docs.php.net's SVN repo)\n+ More precise analysis of the return types of `var_export()`, `print_r()`, and `json_decode()` (#1326, #1327)\n+ Improve type narrowing from `iterable` to `\\Traversable`/`array` (#1427)\n  This change affects `is_array()`/`is_object()` checks and their negations.\n+ Fix more edge cases which would cause Phan to fail to infer that properties, constants, or methods are inherited. (PR #1440 for issues #311, #1426, #454)\n\nPlugins\n+ Fix bugs in `NonBoolBranchPlugin` and `NonBoolInLogicalArithPlugin` (#1413, #1410)\n+ **Make UnionType instances immutable.**\n  This will affect plugins that used addType/addUnionType/removeType. withType/withUnionType/withoutType should be used instead.\n  To modify the type of elements(properties, method return types, parameters, variables, etc),\n  plugin authors should use `Element->setUnionType(plugin_modifier_function(Element->getUnionType()))`.\n\nLanguage server:\n+ Add a CLI option `--language-server-analyze-only-on-save` to prevent the client from sending change notifications. (#1325)\n  (Only notify the language server when the user saves a document)\n  This significantly reduces CPU usage, but clients won't get notifications about issues immediately.\n\nBug fixes\n+ Warn when attempting to call an instance method on an expression with type string (#1314).\n+ Fix a bug in `tool/make_stubs` when generating stubs of global functions.\n+ Fix some bugs that occurred when Phan resolved inherited class constants in class elements such as properties. (#537 and #454)\n+ Emit an issue when a function/method's parameter defaults refer to an undeclared class constant/global constant.\n\n20 Jan 2018, Phan 0.11.1\n------------------------\n\n### Ported from Phan 0.10.3\n\nNew Features(CLI, Configs)\n\n+ For `--fallback-parser`: Switch to [tolerant-php-parser](https://github.com/Microsoft/tolerant-php-parser)\n  as a dependency of the fallback implementation. (#1125)\n  This does a better job of generating PHP AST trees when attempting to parse code with a broader range of syntax errors.\n  Keep `PHP-Parser` as a dependency for now for parsing strings.\n\nMaintenance\n+ Various performance optimizations, including caching of inferred union types to avoid unnecessary recalculation.\n+ Make `phan_client` and the vim snippet in `plugins/vim/phansnippet.vim` more compatible with neovim\n+ Upgrade felixfbecker/advanced-json-rpc dependency to ^3.0.0 (#1354)\n+ Performance improvements.\n  Changed the internal representation of union types to no longer require `spl_object_id` or the polyfill.\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Allow `null` to be passed in where a union type of `mixed` was expected.\n+ Don't warn when passing `?T` (PHPDoc or real) where the PHPDoc type was `T|null`. (#609, #1090, #1192, #1337)\n  This is useful for expressions used for property assignments, return statements, function calls, etc.\n+ Fix a few of Phan's signatures for internal functions and methods.\n\n17 Nov 2017, Phan 0.11.0\n------------------------\n\nNew Features (Analysis of PHP 7.2)\n+ Support analyzing the `object` type hint in real function/method signatures. (#995)\n+ Allow widening an overriding method's param types in php 7.2 branch (#1256)\n  Phan continues warning about `ParamSignatureRealMismatchHasNoParamType` by default, in case a project needs to work with older php releases.\n  Add `'allow_method_param_type_widening' => true` if you wish for Phan to stop emitting that issue category.\n+ Miscellaneous function signature changes for analysis of PHP 7.2 codebases (#828)\n\n### Ported from Phan 0.10.2\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n+ Enable `simplify_ast` by default.\n  The new default value should reduce false positives when analyzing conditions of if statements. (#407, #1066)\n+ Support less ambiguous `?(T[])` and `(?T)[]` in phpdoc (#1213)\n  Note that `(S|T)[]` is **not** supported yet.\n+ Support alternate syntax `array<T>` and `array<Key, T>` in phpdoc (PR #1213)\n  Note that Phan ignores the provided value of `Key` completely right now (i.e. same as `T[]`); Key types will be supported in Phan 0.10.3.\n+ Speed up Phan analysis on small projects, reduce memory usage (Around 0.15 seconds and 15MB)\n  This was done by deferring loading the information about internal classes and functions until that information was needed for analysis.\n+ Analyze existence and usage of callables passed to (internal and user-defined) function&methods expecting callable. (#1194)\n  Analysis will now warn if the referenced function/method of a callable array/string\n  (passed to a function/method expecting a callable param) does not exist.\n\n  This change also reduces false positives in dead code detection (Passing in these callable arrays/strings counts as a reference now)\n+ Warn if attempting to read/write to a property or constant when the expression is a non-object. (or not a class name, for static elements) (#1268)\n+ Split `PhanUnreferencedClosure` out of `PhanUnreferencedFunction`. (Emitted by `--dead-code-detection`)\n+ Split `PhanUnreferencedMethod` into `PhanUnreferencedPublicMethod`, `PhanUnreferencedProtectedMethod`, and `PhanUnreferencedPrivateMethod`.\n+ Split errors for class constants out of `PhanUnreferencedConst`:\n  Add `PhanUnreferencedPublicClassConst`, `PhanUnreferencedProtectedClassConst`, and `PhanUnreferencedPrivateClassConst`.\n  `PhanUnreferencedConst` is now exclusively used for global constants.\n+ Analyze uses of `compact()` for undefined variables (#1089)\n+ Add `PhanParamSuspiciousOrder` to warn about mixing up variable and constant/literal arguments in calls to built in string/regex functions\n  (`explode`, `strpos`, `mb_strpos`, `preg_match`, etc.)\n+ Preserve the closure's function signature in the inferred return value of `Closure::bind()`. (#869)\n+ Support indicating that a reference parameter's input value is unused by writing `@phan-output-reference` on the same line as an `@param` annotation.\n  This indicates that Phan should not warn about the passed in type, and should not preserve the passed in type after the call to the function/method.\n  (In other words, Phan will analyze a user-defined reference parameter the same way as it would `$matches` in `preg_match($pattern, $string, $matches)`)\n  Example usage: `/** @param string $x @phan-output-reference */ function set_x(&$x) { $x = 'result'; }`\n+ Make phan infer unreachability from fatal errors such as `trigger_error($message, E_USER_ERROR);` (#1224)\n+ Add new issue types for places where an object would be expected:\n  `PhanTypeExpectedObjectPropAccess`, `PhanTypeExpectedObjectPropAccessButGotNull`, `PhanTypeExpectedObjectStaticPropAccess`,\n  `PhanTypeExpectedObject`, and `PhanTypeExpectedObjectOrClassName\n+ Emit more accurate line numbers for phpdoc comments, when warning about phpdoc in doc comments being invalid. (#1294)\n  This gives up and uses the element's line number if the phpdoc ends over 10 lines before the start of the element.\n+ Work on allowing union types to be part of template types in doc comments,\n  as well as types with template syntax.\n  (e.g. `array<int|string>` is now equivalent to `int[]|string[]`,\n  and `MyClass<T1|T2,T3|T4>` can now be parsed in doc comments)\n+ Disambiguate the nullable parameter in output.\n  E.g. an array of nullable integers will now be printed in error messages as `(?int)[]`\n  A nullable array of integers will continue to be printed in error messages as `?int[]`, and can be specified in PHPDoc as `?(int[])`.\n\nNew Features (CLI, Configs)\n+ Improve default update rate of `--progress-bar` (Update it every 0.10 seconds)\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Fixes bugs in `PrintfCheckerPlugin`: Alignment goes before width, and objects with __toString() can cast to %s. (#1225)\n+ Reduce false positives in analysis of gotos, blocks containing gotos anywhere may do something other than return or throw. (#1222)\n+ Fix a crash when a magic method with a return type has the same name as a real method.\n+ Allow methods to have weaker PHPdoc types than the overridden method in `PhanParamSignatureMismatch`. (#1253)\n  `PhanParamSignatureRealMismatch*` is unaffected, and will continue working the same way in Phan releases analyzing PHP < 7.2.\n+ Stop warning about `PhanParamSignatureMismatch`, etc. for private methods. The private methods don't affect each other. (#1250)\n+ Properly parse `?self` as a *nullable* instance of the current class in union types (#1264)\n+ Stop erroneously warning about inherited constants being unused in subclasses for dead code detection (#1260)\n+ For dead code detection, properly track uses of inherited class elements (methods, properties, classes) as uses of the original definition. (#1108)\n  Fix the way that uses of private/protected methods from traits were tracked.\n  Also, start warning about a subset of issues from interfaces and abstract classes (e.g. unused interface constants)\n+ Properly handle `static::class` as a class name in an array callable, or `static::method_name` in a string callable (#1232)\n+ Make `@template` tag for [Generic Types](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Generic-Types) case-sensitive. (#1243)\n+ Fix a bug causing Phan to infer an empty union type (which can cast to any type) for arrays with elements of empty union types. (#1296)\n\nPlugins\n+ Make DuplicateArrayKeyPlugin start warning about duplicate values of known global constants and class constants. (#1139)\n+ Make DuplicateArrayKeyPlugin start warning about case statements with duplicate values (This resolves constant values the same way as array key checks)\n+ Support `'plugins' => ['AlwaysReturnPlugin']` as shorthand for full relative path to a bundled plugin such as AlwaysReturnPlugin.php (#1209)\n\nMaintenance\n+ Performance improvements: Phan analysis is 13%-22% faster than 0.10.1, with `simplify_ast` enabled.\n+ Used PHP_CodeSniffer to automatically make Phan's source directory adhere closely to PSR-1 and PSR-2, making minor changes to many files.\n  (e.g. which line each brace goes on, etc.)\n+ Stop tracking references to internal (non user-defined) elements (constants, properties, functions, classes, and methods) during dead code detection.\n  (Dead code detection now requires an extra 15MB instead of 17MB for self-analysis)\n\n20 Oct 2017, Phan 0.10.1\n------------------------\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n+ Support `@return $this` in phpdoc for methods and magic methods.\n  (but not elsewhere. E.g. `@param $this $varName` is not supported, use `@param static $varName`) (#634)\n+ Check if functions/methods passed to `array_map` and `array_filter` are compatible with their arguments.\n  Recursively analyze the functions/methods passed to `array_map`/`array_filter` if no types were provided. (unless quick mode is being used)\n\nNew Features (CLI, Configs)\n\n+ Add Language Server Protocol support (Experimental) (#821)\n  Compatibility: Unix, Linux (depends on php `pcntl` extension).\n  This has the same analysis capabilities provided by [daemon mode](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Using-Phan-Daemon-Mode#using-phan_client-from-an-editor).\n  Supporting a standard protocol should make it easier to write extensions supporting Phan in various IDEs.\n  See https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/README.md\n+ Add config (`autoload_internal_extension_signatures`) to allow users to specify PHP extensions (modules) used by the analyzed project,\n  along with stubs for Phan to use (instead of ReflectionFunction, etc) if the PHP binary used to run Phan doesn't have those extensions enabled. (#627)\n  Add a script (`tool/make_stubs`) to output the contents of stubs to use for `autoload_internal_extension_signatures` (#627).\n+ By default, automatically restart Phan without Xdebug if Xdebug is enabled. (#1161)\n  If you wish to analyze a project using Xdebug's functions, set `autoload_internal_extension_signatures`\n  (e.g. `['xdebug' => 'vendor/phan/phan/.phan/internal_stubs/xdebug.phan_php']`)\n  If you wish to use Xdebug to debug Phan's analysis itself, set and export the environment variable `PHAN_ALLOW_XDEBUG=1`.\n+ Improve analysis of return types of `array_pop`, `array_shift`, `current`, `end`, `next`, `prev`, `reset`, `array_map`, `array_filter`, etc.\n  See `ArrayReturnTypeOverridePlugin.php.`\n  Phan can analyze callables (for `array_map`/`array_filter`) of `Closure` form, as well as strings/2-part arrays that are inlined.\n+ Add `--memory-limit` CLI option (e.g. `--memory-limit 500M`). If this option isn't provided, there is no memory limit. (#1148)\n\nMaintenance\n+ Document the `--disable-plugins` CLI flag.\n\nPlugins\n+ Add a new plugin capability `ReturnTypeOverrideCapability` which can override the return type of functions and methods on a case by case basis.\n  (e.g. based on one or more of the argument types or values) (related to #612, #1181)\n+ Add a new plugin capability `AnalyzeFunctionCallCapability` which can add logic to analyze calls to a small subset of functions.\n  (e.g. based on one or more of the argument types or values) (#1181)\n+ Make line numbers more accurate in `DuplicateArrayKeyPlugin`.\n+ Add `PregRegexCheckerPlugin` to check for invalid regexes. (uses `AnalyzeFunctionCallCapability`).\n  This plugin is able to resolve literals, global constants, and class constants as regexes.\n  See [the corresponding section of .phan/plugins/README.md](.phan/plugins/README.md#pregregexcheckerpluginphp)\n+ Add `PrintfCheckerPlugin` to check for invalid format strings or incorrect arguments in printf calls. (uses `AnalyzeFunctionCallCapability`)\n  This plugin is able to resolve literals, global constants, and class constants as format strings.\n  See [the corresponding section of .phan/plugins/README.md](.phan/plugins/README.md#printfcheckerpluginphp)\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Properly check for undeclared classes in arrays within phpdoc `@param`, `@property`, `@method`, `@var`, and `@return` (etc.) types.\n  Also, fix a bug in resolving namespaces of generic arrays that are nested 2 or more array levels deep.\n+ Fix uncaught TypeError when magic property has the same name as a property. (#1141)\n+ Make AlwaysReturnPlugin warn about functions/methods with real nullable return types failing to return a value.\n+ Change the behavior of the `-d` flag, make it change the current working directory to the provided directory.\n+ Properly set the real param type and return types of internal functions, in rare cases where that exists.\n+ Support analyzing the rare case of namespaced internal global functions (e.g. `\\ast\\parse_code($code, $version)`)\n+ Improve analysis of shorthand ternary operator: Remove false/null from cond_expr in `(cond_expr) ?: (false_expr)` (#1186)\n\n24 Sep 2017, Phan 0.10.0\n------------------------\n\nNew Features(Analysis)\n+ Check types of dimensions when using array access syntax (#406, #1093)\n  (E.g. for an `array`, check that the array dimension can cast to `int|string`)\n\nNew Features (CLI, Configs)\n+ Add option `ignore_undeclared_functions_with_known_signatures` which can be set to `false`\n  to always warn about global functions Phan has signatures for\n  but are unavailable in the current PHP process (and enabled extensions, and the project being analyzed) (#1080)\n  The default was/is to not warn, to reduce false positives.\n+ Add CLI flag `--use-fallback-parser` (Experimental).  If this flags is provided, then when Phan analyzes a syntactically invalid file,\n  it will try again with a parser which tolerates a few types of errors, and analyze the statements that could be parsed.\n  Useful in combination with daemon mode.\n+ Add `phpdoc_type_mapping` config setting.\n  Projects can override this to make Phan ignore or substitute non-standard phpdoc2 types and common typos (#294)\n  (E.g. `'phpdoc_type_mapping' => ['the' => '', 'unknown_type' => '', 'number' => 'int|float']`)\n\nMaintenance\n+ Increased minimum `ext-ast` version constraint to 0.1.5, switched to AST version 50.\n+ Update links to project from github.com/etsy/phan to github.com/phan/phan.\n+ Use the native `spl_object_id` function if it is available for the union type implementation.\n  This will make phan 10% faster in PHP 7.2.\n  (for PHP 7.1, https://github.com/runkit7/runkit_object_id 1.1.0+ also provides a native implementation of `spl_object_id`)\n+ Reduce memory usage by around 5% by tracking only the file and lines associated with variables, instead of a full Context object.\n\n\nPlugins\n+ Increased minimum `ext-ast` version constraint to 0.1.5, switched to AST version 50.\n  Third party plugins will need to create a different version, Decls were changed into regular Nodes\n+ Implement `AnalyzePropertyCapability` and `FinalizeProcessCapability`.\n  Make `UnusedSuppressionPlugin` start using `AnalyzePropertyCapability` and `FinalizeProcessCapability`.\n  Fix bug where `UnusedSuppressionPlugin` could run before the suppressed issues would be emitted,\n  making it falsely emit that suppressions were unused.\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Fix a few incorrect property names for Phan's signatures of internal classes (#1085)\n+ Fix bugs in lookup of relative and non-fully qualified class and function names (#1097)\n+ Fix a bug affecting analysis of code when `simplify_ast` is true.\n+ Fix uncaught NodeException when analyzing complex variables as references (#1116),\n  e.g. `function_expecting_reference($$x)`.\n\n15 Aug 2017, Phan 0.9.4\n-----------------------\n\nNew Features (Analysis)\n+ Check (the first 5) elements of returned arrays against the declared return union types, individually (Issue #935)\n  (E.g. `/** @return int[] */ function foo() {return [2, \"x\"]; }` will now warn with `PhanTypeMismatchReturn` about returning `string[]`)\n+ Check both sides of ternary conditionals against the declared return union types\n  (E.g. `function foo($x) : int {return is_string($x) ? $x : 0; }` will now warn with `PhanTypeMismatchReturn`\n  about returning a string).\n+ Improved analysis of negations of conditions within ternary conditional operators and else/else if statements. (Issue #538)\n  Support analysis of negation of the `||` operator. (E.g. `if (!(is_string($x) || is_int($x))) {...}`)\n+ Make phan aware of blocks of code which will unconditionally throw or return. (Issue #308, #817, #996, #956)\n\n  Don't infer variable types from blocks of code which unconditionally throw or return.\n\n  Infer the negation of type assertions from if statements that unconditionally throw/return/break/continue.\n  (E.g. `if (!is_string($x)) { return false; } functionUsingX($x);`)\n\n  When checking if a variable is defined by all branches of an if statement, ignore branches which unconditionally throw/return/break/continue.\n+ To reduce the false positives from analysis of the negation of type assertions,\n  normalize nullable/boolean union types after analyzing code branches (E.g. if/else) affecting the types of those variables.\n  (e.g. convert \"bool|false|null\" to \"?bool\")\n+ Add a new plugin file `AlwaysReturnPlugin`. (Issue #996)\n  This will add a stricter check that a function with a non-null return type *unconditionally* returns a value (or explicitly throws, or exit()s).\n  Currently, Phan just checks if a function *may* return, or unconditionally throws.\n+ Add a new plugin file `UnreachableCodePlugin` (in development).\n  This will warn about statements that appear to be unreachable\n  (statements occurring after unconditional return/break/throw/return/exit statements)\n\nNew Features (CLI, Configs)\n+ Add config setting `prefer_narrowed_phpdoc_return_type` (See \"New Features (CLI, Configs)),\n  which will use only the phpdoc return types for inferences, if they're narrowed.\n  This config is enabled by default, and requires `check_docblock_signature_return_type_match` to be enabled.\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Work around notice about COMPILER_HALT_OFFSET on Windows.\n+ Fixes #462 : Fix type inferences for instanceof for checks with dynamic class names are provided.\n  Valid class names are either a string or an instance of the class to check against.\n  Warn if the class name is definitely invalid.\n+ Fix false positives about undefined variables in isset()/empty() (Issue #1039)\n  (Fixes bug introduced in Phan 0.9.3)\n+ Fix false positive warnings about accessing protected methods from traits (Issue #1033)\n  Act as though the class which used a trait is the place where the method was defined,\n  so that method visibility checks work properly.\n  Additionally, fix false positive warnings about visibility of method aliases from traits.\n+ Warn about instantiation of class with inaccessible constructor (Issue #1043)\n+ Fix rare uncaught exceptions (Various)\n+ Make issues and plugin issues on properties consistently use suppressions from the plugin doc comment.\n\nChanges In Emitted Issues\n+ Improve `InvalidVariableIssetPlugin`. Change the names and messages for issue types.\n  Emit `PhanPluginUndeclaredVariableInIsset` and `PhanPluginComplexVariableIsset`\n  instead of `PhanUndeclaredVariable`.\n  Stop erroneously warning about valid property fetches and checks of fields of superglobals.\n\n0.9.3 Jul 11, 2017\n------------------\n\nNew Features (Analysis)\n+ Automatically inherit `@param` and `@return` types from parent methods.\n  This is controlled by the boolean config `inherit_phpdoc_types`, which is true by default.\n  `analyze_signature_compatibility` must also be set to true (default is true) for this step to be performed.\n+ Better analysis of calls to parent::__construct(). (Issue #852)\n+ Warn with `PhanAccessOwnConstructor` if directly invoking self::__construct or static::__construct in some cases (partial).\n+ Start analyzing the inside of for/while loops using the loop's condition (Issue #859)\n  (Inferences may leak to outside of those loops. `do{} while(cond)` is not specially analyzed yet)\n+ Improve analysis of types in expressions within compound conditions (Issue #847)\n  (E.g. `if (is_array($x) && fn_expecting_array($x)) {...}`)\n+ Evaluate the third part of a for loop with the context after the inner body is evaluated (Issue #477)\n+ Emit `PhanUndeclaredVariableDim` if adding an array field to an undeclared variable. (Issue #841)\n  Better analyze `list($var['field']) = values`\n+ Improve accuracy of `PhanTypeMismatchDeclaredReturn` (Move the check to after parse phase is finished)\n+ Enable `check_docblock_signature_return_type_match` and `check_docblock_signature_param_type_match` by default.\n  Improve performance of those checks.\n  Switch to checking individual types (of the union type) of the phpdoc types and emitting issues for each invalid part.\n+ Create `PhanTypeMismatchDeclaredParam` (Move the check to after parse phase is finished)\n  Also add config setting `prefer_narrowed_phpdoc_param_type` (See \"New Features (CLI, Configs))\n  This config is enabled by default.\n\n  Also create `PhanTypeMismatchDeclaredParamNullable` when params such as `function foo(string $x = null)`\n  are documented as the narrowed forms `@param null $x` or `@param string $x`.\n  Those should be changed to either `string|null` or `?string`.\n+ Detect undeclared return types at point of declaration, and emit `PhanUndeclaredTypeReturnType` (Issue #835)\n+ Create `PhanParamSignaturePHPDocMismatch*` issue types, for mismatches between `@method` and real signature/other `@method` tag.\n+ Create `PhanAccessWrongInheritanceCategory*` issue types to warn about classes extending a trait/interface instead of class, etc. (#873)\n+ Create `PhanExtendsFinalClass*` issue types to warn about classes extending from final classes.\n+ Create `PhanAccessOverridesFinalMethod*` issue types to warn about methods overriding final methods.\n+ Create `PhanTypeMagicVoidWithReturn` to warn if `void` methods such as `__construct`, `__set`, etc return a value that would be ignored. (Issue #913)\n+ Add check for `PhanTypeMissingReturn` within closures. Properly emit `PhanTypeMissingReturn` in functions/methods containing closures. (Issue #599)\n+ Improved checking for `PhanUndeclaredVariable` in array keys and conditional conditions. (Issue #912)\n+ Improved warnings and inferences about internal function references for functions such as `sort`, `preg_match` (Issue #871, #958)\n  Phan is now aware of many internal functions which normally ignore the original values of references passed in (E.g. `preg_match`)\n+ Properly when code attempts to access static/non-static properties as if they were non-static/static. (Issue #936)\n+ Create `PhanCommentOverrideOnNonOverrideMethod` and `PhanCommentOverrideOnNonOverrideConstant`. (Issue #926)\n  These issue types will be emitted if `@override` is part of doc comment of a method or class constant which doesn't override or implement anything.\n  (`@Override` and `@phan-override` can also be used as aliases of `@override`. `@override` is not currently part of any phpdoc standard.)\n+ Add `@phan-closure-scope`, which can be used to annotate closure definitions with the namespaced class it will be bound to (Issue #309, #590, #790)\n  (E.g. if the intent was that Closure->bindTo or Closure->bind would be called to bind it to `\\MyNS\\MyClass` (or an instance of that class),\n  then a closure could be declared as `/** @phan-closure-scope \\MyNS\\MyClass */ function() { $this->somePrivateMyClassMethod(); }`\n+ Add `Closure` as a first class type, (Previously, closures were treated as `callable` in some places) (Issue #978)\n\nNew Features (CLI, Configs)\n+ Create `check_docblock_signature_param_type_match` (similar to `check_docblock_signature_return_type_match`) config setting\n  to enable warning if phpdoc types are incompatible with the real types. True(enabled) by default.\n\n  Create `prefer_narrowed_phpdoc_param_type` config setting (True by default, requires `check_docblock_signature_return_type_match` to be enabled).\n  When it is true, Phan will analyze each function using the phpdoc param types instead of the provided signature types\n  if the possible phpdoc types are narrower and compatible with the signature.\n  (E.g. indicate that subclasses are expected over base classes, indicate that non-nullable is expected instead of nullable)\n  This affects analysis both inside and outside the method.\n\n  Aside: Phan currently defaults to preferring phpdoc type over real return type, and emits `PhanTypeMismatchDeclaredReturn` if the two are incompatible.\n+ Create `enable_class_alias_support` config setting (disabled by default), which enables analyzing basic usage of class_alias. (Issue #586)\n  Set it to true to enable it.\n  NOTE: this is still experimental.\n+ Warn to stderr about running Phan analysis with Xdebug (Issue #116)\n  The warning can be disabled by the Phan config setting `skip_slow_php_options_warning` to true.\n+ Add a config setting 'scalar_implicit_partial' to allow moving away from 'scalar_implicit_cast' (Issue #541)\n  This allows users to list out (and gradually remove) permitted scalar type casts.\n+ Add `null_casts_as_array` and `array_casts_as_null` settings, which can be used while migrating away from `null_casts_as_any_type`.\n  These will be checked if one of the types has a union type of `null`, as well as when checking if a nullable array can cast to a regular array.\n\nPlugins\n\n+ Redesign plugin system to be more efficient. (Issue #600)\n  New plugins should extend `\\Phan\\PluginV2` and implement the interfaces for capabilities they need to have,\n  such as `\\Phan\\PluginV2\\AnalyzeClassCapability`.\n  In the new plugin system, plugins will only be run when they need to (Phan no longer needs to invoke an empty method body).\n  Old subclasses of `\\Phan\\Plugin\\PluginImplementation` will continue to work, but will be less efficient.\n\nMaintenance\n+ Reduce memory usage by around 15% by using a more efficient representation of union types (PR #729).\n  The optional extension https://github.com/runkit7/runkit_object_id can be installed to boost performance by around 10%.\n+ Check method signatures compatibility against all overridden methods (e.g. interfaces with the same methods), not just the first ones (Issue #925)\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Work around known bugs in current releases of two PECL extensions (Issue #888, #889)\n+ Fix typo - Change `PhanParamSignatureRealMismatch` to `PhanParamSignatureRealMismatchReturnType`\n+ Consistently exit with non-zero exit code if there are multiple processes, and any process failed to return valid results. (Issue #868)\n+ Fixes #986 : PhanUndeclaredVariable used to fail to be emitted in some deeply nested expressions, such as `return $undefVar . 'suffix';`\n+ Make Phan infer the return types of closures, both for closures invoked inline and closures declared then invoked later (Issue #564)\n+ Phan now correctly analyze global functions for mismatches of phpdoc types and real parameter types.\n  Previously, it wouldn't emit warnings for global functions, only for methods.\n+ Don't add `mixed` to inferred union types of properties which already have non-empty phpdoc types. (Issue #512)\n  mixed would just result in Phan failing to emit any types of issues.\n+ When `simplify_ast` is true, simplify the ASTs parsed in the parse mode as well.\n  Makes analysis consistent when `quick_mode` is false (AST nodes from the parse phase would also be used in the analysis phase)\n+ Don't emit PhanTypeNonVarPassByRef on arguments that are function/method calls returning references. (Issue #236)\n+ Emit PhanContextNotObject more reliably when not in class scope.\n\nBackwards Incompatible Changes\n+ Fix categories of some issue types, renumber error ids for the pylint error formatter to be unique and consistent.\n\n0.9.2 Jun 13, 2017\n------------------\n\nNew Features (Analysis)\n+ Add `PhanParamSignatureRealMismatch*` (e.g. `ParamSignatureRealMismatchTooManyRequiredParameters`),\n  which ignores phpdoc types and imitates PHP's inheritance warning/error checks as closely as possible. (Issue #374)\n  This has a much lower rate of false positives than `PhanParamSignatureMismatch`, which is based on Liskov Substitution Principle and also accounts for phpdoc types.\n  (`PhanParamSignatureMismatch` continues to exist)\n+ Create `PhanUndeclaredStaticProperty` (Issue #610)\n  This is of higher severity than PhanUndeclaredProperty, because PHP 7 throws an Error.\n  Also add `PhanAccessPropertyStaticAsNonStatic`\n+ Supports magic instance/static `@method` annotations. (Issue #467)\n  This is enabled by default.\n+ Change the behavior of non-quick recursion (Affects emitted issues in large projects).\n  Improve performance of non-quick analysis by checking for redundant analysis steps\n  (E.g. calls from two different places passing the same union types for each parameter),\n  continuing to recurse when passing by reference.\n+ Support for checking for misuses of \"@internal\" annotations. Phan assumes this means it is internal to a namespace. (Issue #353)\n  This checks properties, methods, class constants, and classes.\n  (Adds `PhanAccessConstantInternal`, `PhanAccessClassInternal`, `PhanAccessClassConstantInternal`, `PhanAccessPropertyInternal`, `PhanAccessMethodInternal`)\n  (The implementation may change)\n+ Make conditionals such as `is_string` start applying to the condition in ternary operators (`$a ? $b : $c`)\n+ Treat `resource`, `object`, and `mixed` as native types only when they occur in phpdoc.\n  Outside of phpdoc (e.g. `$x instanceof resource`), analyze those names as if they were class names.\n+ Emit low severity issues if Phan can't extract types from phpdoc,\n  the phpdoc `@param` is out of sync with the code,\n  or if the phpdoc annotation doesn't apply to an element type (Issue #778)\n+ Allow inferring the type of variables from `===` conditionals such as `if ($x === true)`\n+ Add issue type for non-abstract classes containing abstract methods from itself or its ancestors\n  (`PhanClassContainsAbstractMethod`, `PhanClassContainsAbstractMethodInternal`)\n+ Partial support for handling trait adaptations (`as`/`insteadof`) when using traits (Issue #312)\n+ Start checking if uses of private/protected class methods *defined in a trait* are visible outside of that class.\n  Before, Phan would always assume they were visible, to reduce false positives.\n+ If Phan has inferred/been provided generic array types for a variable (e.g. `int[]`),\n  then analysis of the code within `if (is_array($x))` will act as though the type is `int[]`.\n  The checks `is_object` and `is_scalar` now also preserve known sub-types of the group of types.\n  (If Phan isn't aware of any sub-types, it will infer the generic version, e.g. `object`)\n+ Start checking if unanalyzable variable accesses such as `$$x` are very likely to be invalid or typos (e.g. $x is an object or array or null)\n  Emit `PhanTypeSuspiciousIndirectVariable` if those are seen. (PR #809)\n+ Add partial support for inferring the union types of the results of expressions such as `$x ^= 5` (e.g. in `foo($x ^= 5)`) (PR #809)\n+ Thoroughly analyze the methods declared within traits,\n  using only the information available within the trait. (Issue #800, PR #815)\n  If new emitted issues are seen, users can (1) add abstract methods to traits, (2) add `@method` annotations, or (3) add `@suppress` annotations.\n\nNew Features (CLI, Configs)\n+ (Linux/Unix only) Add Experimental Phan Daemon mode (PR #563 for Issue #22), which allows phan to run in the background, and accept TCP requests to analyze single files.\n  (The implementation currently requires the `pcntl` extension, which does not in Windows)\n  Server usage: `path/to/phan --daemonize-tcp-port 4846` (In the root directory of the project being analyzed)\n  Client usage: `path/to/phan_client --daemonize-tcp-port 4846 -l src/file1.php [ -l src/file2.php ]`\n+ Add `--color` CLI flag, with rudimentary unix terminal coloring for the plain text output formatter. (Issue #363)\n  Color schemes are customizable with `color_scheme`, in the config file.\n+ Add the `exclude_file_regex` config to exclude file paths based on a regular expression (e.g. tests or example files mixed with the codebase) (#635)\n  The regular expression is run against the relative path within the project.\n+ Add `--dump-parsed-file-list` option to print files which Phan would parse.\n+ Add experimental `simplify_ast` config, to simplify the AST into a form which improves Phan's type inference.\n  (E.g. handles some variable declarations within `if ()` statements.\n   Infers that $x is a string for constructs such as `if (!is_string($x)) {return;} function_using_x($x);`)\n  This is slow, and disabled by default.\n+ Add `--include-analysis-file-list` option to define files that will be included in static analysis, to the exclusion of others.\n+ Start emitting `PhanDeprecatedFunctionInternal` if an internal (to PHP) function/method is deprecated.\n  (Phan emits `PhanUndeclaredFunction` if a function/method was removed; Functions deprecated in PHP 5.x were removed in 7.0)\n\nMaintenance\n+ Update function signature map to analyze `iterable` and `is_iterable` from php 7.1\n+ Improve type inferences on functions with nullable default values.\n+ Update miscellaneous new functions in php 7.1 standard library (e.g. `getenv`)\n\nBug Fixes\n- Fix PhanTypeMismatchArgument, etc. for uses of `new static()`, static::CONST, etc in a method. (Issue #632)\n- Fix uncaught exception when conditional node is a scalar (Issue #613)\n- Existence of __get() no longer affects analyzing static properties. (Issue #610)\n- Phan can now detect the declaration of constants relative to a `use`d namespace (Issue #509)\n- Phan can now detect the declaration of functions relative to a `use`d namespace (Issue #510)\n- Fix a bug where the JSON output printer accidentally escaped some output (\"<\"), causing invalid JSON.\n- Fix a bug where a print/echo/method call erroneously marked methods/functions as having a return value. (Issue #811)\n- Improve analysis of SimpleXMLElement (Issues #542, #539)\n- Fix crash handling trait use aliases which change only the method's visibility (Issue #861)\n\nBackwards Incompatible Changes\n- Declarations of user-defined constants are now consistently\n  analyzed in a case-sensitive way.\n  This may affect projects using `define(name, value, case_insensitive = true)`.\n  Change the code being analyzed to exactly match the constant name in define())\n\n0.9.1 Mar 15, 2017\n------------------\n\nNew Features (Analysis)\n+ Conditions in `if(cond(A) && expr(A))` (e.g. `instanceof`, `is_string`, etc) now affect analysis of right-hand side of `&&` (PR #540)\n+ Add `PhanDeprecatedInterface` and `PhanDeprecatedTrait`, similar to `PhanDeprecatedClass`\n+ Supports magic `@property` annotations, with aliases `@property-read` and @property-write`. (Issue #386)\n  This is enabled by default.\n\n  Phan also supports the `@phan-forbid-undeclared-magic-properties` annotation,\n  which will make it warn about undeclared properties if no real property or `@property` annotation exists.\n\nNew Features (CLI, Configs)\n+ Add `--version` CLI flag\n+ Move some rare CLI options from `--help` into `--extended-help`\n\nMaintenance\n+ Improved stability of analyzing phpdoc and real nullable types (Issue #567)\n+ Fix type signatures Phan has for some internal methods.\n+ Improve CLI `--progress-bar` tracking by printing 0% immediately.\n+ Add Developer Certificate of Origin\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Fix uncaught issue exception analyzing class constants (Issue #551)\n+ Fix group use in ASTs\n+ Fix false positives checking if native types can cast to/from nullable native types (Issue #567, #582)\n+ Exit with non-zero exit code if an invalid CLI argument is passed to Phan\n\nBackwards Incompatible Changes\n+ Change the way that parameter's default values affect type inferences.\n  (May now add to the union type or ignore default values. Used to always add the default value types)\n  Add `@param` types if you encounter new issues.\n  This was done to avoid false positives in cases such as `function foo($maybeArray = false)`\n+ Increase minimum `ext-ast` version constraint to 0.1.4\n\n0.9.0 Feb 21, 2017\n------------------\n\nThe 0.9.x versions will be tracking syntax from PHP versions 7.1.x and is runnable on PHP 7.1+.\nPlease use version 0.8.x if you're using a version of PHP < 7.1.\n\nNew Features (Analysis)\n+ Support php 7.1 class constant visibility\n+ Support variadic phpdoc in `@param`, e.g. `@param string ...$args`\n  Avoid ambiguity by emitting `PhanTypeMismatchVariadicComment` and `PhanTypeMismatchVariadicParam`.\n+ Initial support for php 7.1 nullable types and void, both in phpdoc and real parameters.\n+ Initial support for php 7.1 `iterable` type\n+ Both conditions from `if(cond(A) && cond(B))` (e.g. `instanceof`, `is_string`, etc.) now affect analysis of the if element's block (PR #540)\n+ Apply conditionals such as `is_string` to type guards in ternary operators (Issue #465)\n+ Allow certain checks for removing null from Phan's inferred types, reducing false positives (E.g. `if(!is_null($x) && $x->method())`) (#518)\n+ Incomplete support for specifying the class scope in which a closure will be used/bound  (#309)\n+ Support `@return self` in class context\n\nNew Features (CLI, Configs)\n+ Introduce `check_docblock_signature_return_type_match` config (slow, disabled by default)\n  (Checks if the phpdoc types match up with declared return types)\n\nMaintenance\n+ Add Code of Conduct\n+ Fix type signatures for some internal methods and internal class properties.\n\nBug Fixes\n+ Allow asserting `object` is a specific object type without warning (Issue #516)\n+ Fix bugs in analysis of varargs within a function(Issue #516)\n+ Treat null defaults in functions and methods the same way (Issue #508)\n  In both, add null defaults to the UnionType only if there's already another type.\n  In both, add non-null defaults to the UnionType (Contains `mixed` if there weren't any explicit types)\n+ Specially handle phpdoc type aliases such as `boolean` only in phpdoc (Issue #471)\n  (Outside of phpdoc, it refers to a class with the name `boolean`)\n+ Add some internal classes other than `stdClass` which are allowed to have dynamic, undeclared properties (Issue #433)\n+ Fix assertion errors when passing references by reference (Issue #500)\n\nBackwards Incompatible Changes\n+ Requires newer `ext-ast` version (Must support version 35).\n\n0.8.3 Jan 26, 2017\n------------------\n\nThe 0.8.x versions will be tracking syntax from PHP versions 7.0.x and is runnable on PHP 7.0+.\nPlease use version 0.8.x if you're using a version of PHP < 7.1.\nFor best results, run version 0.8.x with PHP 7.0 if you are analyzing a codebase which normally runs on php <= 7.0\n(If php 7.1 is used, Phan will think that some new classes, methods, and functions exist or have different parameter lists because it gets this info from `Reflection`)\n\n???\n"

Once configured, you can run it via `./vendor/bin/phan`.\n\nPhan 5 depends on PHP 7.2+ with the [php-ast](https://github.com/nikic/php-ast) extension (1.1.1+ is preferred) and supports analyzing PHP version 7.0-8.2 syntax.\nInstallation instructions for php-ast can be found [here](https://github.com/nikic/php-ast#installation).\n(Phan can be used without php-ast by using the CLI option `--allow-polyfill-parser`, but there are slight differences in the parsing of doc comments)\n\n* **Alternative Installation Methods**<br />\n  See [Getting Started](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Getting-Started) for alternative methods of using\nPhan and details on how to configure Phan for your project.<br />\n* **Incrementally Strengthening Analysis**<br />\n  Take a look at [Incrementally Strengthening Analysis](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Incrementally-Strengthening-Analysis) for some tips on how to slowly ramp up the strictness of the analysis as your code becomes better equipped to be analyzed. <br />\n* **Installing Dependencies**<br />\n  Take a look at [Installing Phan Dependencies](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Getting-Started#installing-phan-dependencies) for help getting Phan's dependencies installed on your system.\n\nThe [Wiki has more information about using Phan](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki#using-phan).\n\n# Features\n\nPhan is able to perform the following kinds of analysis:\n\n* Check that all methods, functions, classes, traits, interfaces, constants, properties and variables are defined and accessible.\n* Check for type safety and arity issues on method/function/closure calls.\n* Check for PHP8/PHP7/PHP5 backward compatibility.\n* Check for features that weren't supported in older PHP 7.x minor releases (E.g. `object`, `void`, `iterable`, `?T`, `[$x] = ...;`, negative string offsets, multiple exception catches, etc.)\n* Check for sanity with array accesses.\n* Check for type safety on binary operations.\n* Check for valid and type safe return values on methods, functions, and closures.\n* Check for No-Ops on arrays, closures, constants, properties, variables, unary operators, and binary operators.\n* Check for unused/dead/[unreachable](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/v5/.phan/plugins#unreachablecodepluginphp) code. (Pass in `--dead-code-detection`)\n* Check for unused variables and parameters. (Pass in `--unused-variable-detection`)\n* Check for redundant or impossible conditions and pointless casts. (Pass in `--redundant-condition-detection`)\n* Check for unused `use` statements.\n  These and a few other issue types can be automatically fixed with `--automatic-fix`.\n* Check for classes, functions and methods being redefined.\n* Check for sanity with class inheritance (e.g. checks method signature compatibility).\n  Phan also checks for final classes/methods being overridden, that abstract methods are implemented, and that the implemented interface is really an interface (and so on).\n* Supports namespaces, traits and variadics.\n* Supports [Union Types](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/About-Union-Types).\n* Supports [Generic Types (i.e. `@template`)](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Generic-Types).\n* Supports generic arrays such as `int[]`, `UserObject[]`, `array<int,UserObject>`, etc..\n* Supports array shapes such as `array{key:string,otherKey:?stdClass}`, etc. (internally and in PHPDoc tags)\n  This also supports indicating that fields of an array shape are optional\n  via `array{requiredKey:string,optionalKey?:string}` (useful for `@param`)\n* Supports phpdoc [type annotations](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code).\n* Supports inheriting phpdoc type annotations.\n* Supports checking that phpdoc type annotations are a narrowed form (E.g. subclasses/subtypes) of the real type signatures\n* Supports inferring types from [assert() statements](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code) and conditionals in if elements/loops.\n* Supports [`@deprecated` annotation](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code#deprecated) for deprecating classes, methods and functions\n* Supports [`@internal` annotation](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code#internal) for elements (such as a constant, function, class, class constant, property or method) as internal to the package in which it's defined.\n* Supports `@suppress <ISSUE_TYPE>` annotations for [suppressing issues](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code#suppress).\n* Supports [magic @property annotations](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code#property) (`@property <union_type> <variable_name>`)\n* Supports [magic @method annotations](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code#method) (`@method <union_type> <method_name>(<union_type> <param1_name>)`)\n* Supports [`class_alias` annotations (experimental, off by default)](https://github.com/phan/phan/pull/586)\n* Supports indicating the class to which a closure will be bound, via `@phan-closure-scope` ([example](tests/files/src/0264_closure_override_context.php))\n* Supports analysis of closures and return types passed to `array_map`, `array_filter`, and other internal array functions.\n* Offers extensive configuration for weakening the analysis to make it useful on large sloppy code bases\n* Can be run on many cores. (requires `pcntl`)\n* Output is emitted in text, checkstyle, json, pylint, csv, or codeclimate formats.\n* Can run [user plugins on source for checks specific to your code](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Writing-Plugins-for-Phan).\n  [Phan includes various plugins you may wish to enable for your project](https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/v5/.phan/plugins#2-general-use-plugins).\n\nSee [Phan Issue Types](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Issue-Types-Caught-by-Phan) for descriptions\nand examples of all issues that can be detected by Phan.

The\neasiest way to tell Phan where to find source code is to [create a `.phan/config.php` file](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Getting-Started#creating-a-config-file).\nA simple `.phan/config.php` file might look something like the following.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n/**\n * This configuration will be read and overlaid on top of the\n * default configuration. Command line arguments will be applied\n * after this file is read.\n */\nreturn [\n\n    // Supported values: `'5.6'`, `'7.0'`, `'7.1'`, `'7.2'`, `'7.3'`, `'7.4'`,\n    // `'8.0'`, `'8.1'`, `'8.2'`, `'8.3'`, `null`.\n    // If this is set to `null`,\n    // then Phan assumes the PHP version which is closest to the minor version\n    // of the php executable used to execute Phan.\n    \"target_php_version\" => null,\n\n    // A list of directories that should be parsed for class and\n    // method information. After excluding the directories\n    // defined in exclude_analysis_directory_list, the remaining\n    // files will be statically analyzed for errors.\n    //\n    // Thus, both first-party and third-party code being used by\n    // your application should be included in this list.\n    'directory_list' => [\n        'src',\n        'vendor/symfony/console',\n    ],\n\n    // A directory list that defines files that will be excluded\n    // from static analysis, but whose class and method\n    // information should be included.\n    //\n    // Generally, you'll want to include the directories for\n    // third-party code (such as \"vendor/\") in this list.\n    //\n    // n.b.: If you'd like to parse but not analyze 3rd\n    //       party code, directories containing that code\n    //       should be added to the `directory_list` as\n    //       to `exclude_analysis_directory_list`.\n    \"exclude_analysis_directory_list\" => [\n        'vendor/'\n    ],\n\n    // A list of plugin files to execute.\n    // Plugins which are bundled with Phan can be added here by providing their name\n    // (e.g. 'AlwaysReturnPlugin')\n    //\n    // Documentation about available bundled plugins can be found\n    // at https://github.com/phan/phan/tree/v5/.phan/plugins\n    //\n    // Alternately, you can pass in the full path to a PHP file\n    // with the plugin's implementation.\n    // (e.g. 'vendor/phan/phan/.phan/plugins/AlwaysReturnPlugin.php')\n    'plugins' => [\n        // checks if a function, closure or method unconditionally returns.\n        // can also be written as 'vendor/phan/phan/.phan/plugins/AlwaysReturnPlugin.php'\n        'AlwaysReturnPlugin',\n        'DollarDollarPlugin',\n        'DuplicateArrayKeyPlugin',\n        'DuplicateExpressionPlugin',\n        'PregRegexCheckerPlugin',\n        'PrintfCheckerPlugin',\n        'SleepCheckerPlugin',\n        // Checks for syntactically unreachable statements in\n        // the global scope or function bodies.\n        'UnreachableCodePlugin',\n        'UseReturnValuePlugin',\n        'EmptyStatementListPlugin',\n        'LoopVariableReusePlugin',\n    ],\n];\n```\n\nTake a look at [Creating a Config File](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Getting-Started#creating-a-config-file) and\n[Incrementally Strengthening Analysis](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Incrementally-Strengthening-Analysis) for\nmore details.\n\nRunning `phan --help` will show [usage information and command-line options](./internal/CLI-HELP.md).\n\n## Annotating Your Source Code\n\nPhan reads and understands most [PHPDoc](http://www.phpdoc.org/docs/latest/guides/types.html)\ntype annotations including [Union Types](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/About-Union-Types)\n(like `int|MyClass|string|null`) and generic array types (like `int[]` or `string[]|MyClass[]` or `array<int,MyClass>`).\n\nTake a look at [Annotating Your Source Code](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Annotating-Your-Source-Code)\nand [About Union Types](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/About-Union-Types) for some help\ngetting started with defining types in your code.\n\nPhan supports `(int|string)[]` style annotations, and represents them internally as `int[]|string[]`\n(Both annotations are treated like array which may have integers and/or strings).\nWhen you have arrays of mixed types, just use `array`.\n\nThe following code shows off the various annotations that are supported.\n\n```php\n/**\n * @return void\n */\nfunction f() {}\n\n/** @deprecated */\nclass C {\n    /** @var int */\n    const C = 42;\n\n    /** @var string[]|null */\n    public $p = null;\n\n    /**\n     * @param int|null $p\n     * @return string[]|null\n     */\n    public static function f($p) {\n        if (is_null($p)) {\n            return null;\n        }\n\n        return array_map(\n            /** @param int $i */\n            function($i) {\n                return \"thing $i\";\n            },\n            range(0, $p)\n        );\n    }\n}\n```\n\nJust like in PHP, any type can be nulled in the function declaration which also\nmeans a null is allowed to be passed in for that parameter.\n\nPhan checks the type of every single element of arrays (Including keys and values).\nIn practical terms, this means that `[$int1=>$int2,$int3=>$int4,$int5=>$str6]` is seen as `array<int,int|string>`,\nwhich Phan represents as `array<int,int>|array<int,string>`.\n`[$strKey => new MyClass(), $strKey2 => $unknown]` will be represented as\n`array<string,MyClass>|array<string,mixed>`.\n\n- Literals such as `[12,'myString']` will be represented internally as array shapes such as `array{0:12,1:'myString'}`\n\n# Generating a file list\n\nThis static analyzer does not track includes or try to figure out autoloader magic. It treats\nall the files you throw at it as one big application. For code encapsulated in classes this\nworks well. For code running in the global scope it gets a bit tricky because order\nmatters. If you have an `index.php` including a file that sets a bunch of global variables and\nyou then try to access those after the `include(...)` in `index.php` the static analyzer won't\nknow anything about these.\n\nIn practical terms this simply means that you should put your entry points and any files\nsetting things in the global scope at the top of your file list. If you have a `config.php`\nthat sets global variables that everything else needs, then you should put that first in the list followed by your\nvarious entry points, then all your library files containing your classes.\n\n# Development\n\nTake a look at [Developer's Guide to Phan](https://github.com/phan/phan/wiki/Developer's-Guide-To-Phan) for help getting started hacking on Phan.\n\nWhen you find an issue, please take the time to create a tiny reproducing code snippet that illustrates\nthe bug. And once you have done that, fix it. Then turn your code snippet into a test and add it to\n[tests](tests) then `./test` and send a PR with your fix and test. Alternatively, you can open an Issue with\ndetails.\n\nTo run Phan's unit tests, just run `./test`.\n\nTo run all of Phan's unit tests and integration tests, run `./tests/run_all_tests.sh`\n\n# Code of Conduct\n\nWe are committed to fostering a welcoming community.
