We may choose not to accept pull requests that change files in the `src/data`\n   directory, since we generate these files based on our internal knowledge of\n   the AWS services. Please check in with us ahead of time if you find a mistake\n   or missing feature that would affect those files.\n6. If your code does not conform to the PSR standards, does not include adequate\n   tests, or does not contain a changelog document, we may ask you to update\n   your pull requests before we accept them. We also reserve the right to deny\n   any pull requests that do not align with our standards or goals.\n7. If you would like to implement support for a significant feature that is not\n   yet available in the SDK, please talk to us beforehand to avoid any\n   duplication of effort.\n8. We greatly appreciate contributions to our User Guide. The docs are written\n   as a [Sphinx][] website formatted with [reStructuredText][] (very similar to\n   Markdown). The User Guide is located in another repository. Please go to the \n   [awsdocs/aws-php-developers-guide](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-php-developers-guide/).  \n   repository to suggest edits for the User Guide.\n9. If you are working on the SDK, make sure to check out the `Makefile` for some\n   of the common tasks that we have to do.\n\n### Changelog Documents\n\nA changelog document is a small JSON blob placed in the `.changes/nextrelease`\nfolder. It should be named a clearly and uniquely, akin to a branch name. It\nconsists of a type, category, and description as follows:\n\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"type\": \"feature|enhancement|bugfix\",\n        \"category\": \"Target of Update\",\n        \"description\": \"English language simple description of your update.\"\n    }\n]\n```\n\n#### Changelog Types\n\n* `feature` - For major additive features, internal changes that have\noutward impact, or updates to the SDK foundations. This will result in a minor\nversion change.\n* `enhancement` - For minor additive features or incremental sized changes.\nThis will result in a patch version change.\n* `bugfix` - For minor changes that resolve an issue. This will result in a\npatch version change.\n* `documentation` - For updates to guides and documentation files only. This will\nresult in a patch version change.\n\n#### Changelog Categories\n\nA changelog document's `category` field should correspond to a Service subfolder\nof the `src` directory. If your update is for core components of the SDK, the\ncategory field should exist with the value set to an empty string `\"\"`.\n\n[issues]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues\n[pull-requests]: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/pulls\n[license]: http://aws.amazon.com/apache2.0/\n[cla]: https://github.com/aws/aws-cla/blob/master/amazon-single-contribution-license.txt\n[php-fig]: http://php-fig.org\n[cs-fixer]: http://cs.sensiolabs.org/\n[phpstan]: https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan\n[sphinx]: http://sphinx-doc.org/\n[restructuredtext]: http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html\n[docs-readme]: https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-php-developers-guide/blob/master/README.rst\n[markdown]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown\n"

The SDK is available via [Packagist] under the\n   [`aws/aws-sdk-php`][install-packagist] package. If Composer is installed globally on your system, you can run the following in the base directory of your project to add the SDK as a dependency:\n   ```\n   composer require aws/aws-sdk-php\n   ```\n   Please see the\n   [Installation section of the User Guide][docs-installation] for more\n   detailed information about installing the SDK through Composer and other\n   means.\n4. **Using the SDK** – The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK\n   is to read the [User Guide][docs-guide]. The\n   [Getting Started Guide][docs-quickstart] will help you become familiar with\n   the basic concepts.\n5. **Beta: Removing unused services** — To date, there are over 300 AWS services available for use with this SDK.\n   You will likely not need them all. If you use Composer and would like to learn more about this feature,\n    please read the [linked documentation][docs-script-composer].\n\n\n## Quick Examples\n\n### Create an Amazon S3 client\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Require the Composer autoloader.\nrequire 'vendor/autoload.php';\n\nuse Aws\\S3\\S3Client;\n\n// Instantiate an Amazon S3 client.\n$s3 = new S3Client([\n    'version' => 'latest',\n    'region'  => 'us-west-2'\n]);\n```\n\n### Upload a file to Amazon S3\n\n```php\n<?php\n// Upload a publicly accessible file. The file size and type are determined by the SDK.\ntry {\n    $s3->putObject([\n        'Bucket' => 'my-bucket',\n        'Key'    => 'my-object',\n        'Body'   => fopen('/path/to/file', 'r'),\n        'ACL'    => 'public-read',\n    ]);\n} catch (Aws\\S3\\Exception\\S3Exception $e) {\n    echo \"There was an error uploading the file.\\n\";\n}\n```\n\n## Getting Help\n\nPlease use these community resources for getting help. We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and have limited bandwidth to address them.\n\n* Ask a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and tag it with [`aws-php-sdk`](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-php-sdk)\n* Come join the AWS SDK for PHP [gitter](https://gitter.im/aws/aws-sdk-php)\n* Open a support ticket with [AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home/)\n* If it turns out that you may have found a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/issues/new/choose)\n\nThis SDK implements AWS service APIs. For general issues regarding the AWS services and their limitations, you may also take a look at the [Amazon Web Services Discussion Forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/).\n\n\n## Maintenance and support for SDK major versions\n\nFor information about maintenance and support for SDK major versions and their underlying dependencies, see the following in the [AWS SDKs and Tools Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/overview.html):\n\n* [AWS SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/maint-policy.html)\n* [AWS SDKs and Tools Version Support Matrix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/version-support-matrix.html)\n\n\n### Opening Issues\n\nIf you encounter a bug with `aws-sdk-php` we would like to hear about it. Search the existing issues and try to make sure your problem doesn’t already exist before opening a new issue. It’s helpful if you include the version of `aws-sdk-php`, PHP version and OS you’re using. Please include a stack trace and a simple workflow to reproduce the case when appropriate, too.\n\nThe GitHub issues are intended for bug reports and feature requests. For help and questions with using `aws-sdk-php` please make use of the resources listed in the Getting Help section.

          "content": "Upgrading Guide\n===============\n\nUpgrade from 2.x to 3.x\n-----------------------\n\nVersion 3 is a new major version of the SDK that represents a significant effort\nto improve the capabilities of the SDK, incorporate two years of customer\nfeedback, upgrade our dependencies, improve performance, and adopt the latest\nPHP standards.\n\nThe basic usage pattern of the SDK (i.e., `$result = $client->operation($params);`)\nhas not changed from Version 2 to Version 3, which should result in a fairly\nsmooth migration.\n\nFor details on how to migrate your code from Version 2 to Version 3, read the\n[Version 3 Migration Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/v3/guide/guide/migration.html).\n\nUpgrade from 2.7 to 2.8\n-----------------------\n\n### AWS Lambda\n\nVersion 2.8 is backward-compatible with version 2.7, except in the case of the \nAWS Lambda service. The Lambda service has changed their API significantly based\non customer feedback during their preview period. The `invokeAsync()` operation\nhas not changed, but many aspects of the API has.\n\nIf you would like to continue using the old 2014-11-11 previewAPI, you can\nconfigure this when you instantiate the `LambdaClient`:\n\n```php\nuse Aws\\Lambda\\LambdaClient;\n\n$client = LambdaClient::factory(array(\n    'version' => '2014-11-11',\n    // ...\n));\n```\n\n### Preparations for Version 3 of the SDK\n\nIn preparation for Version 3 of the AWS SDK for PHP:\n\n* We marked all of the \"facade\" classes and methods as deprecated, since they\n  will be removed.\n* We added the `getAwsErrorCode()`, `getAwsErrorType()` and `getAwsRequestId()`\n  methods to the `ServiceResponseException` to be forward-compatible with\n  Version 3's `AwsException` interface.\n* We advise against the use of any `Enum` class, since these will be removed.\n  Instead, use the literal value to which the enum corresponds.\n* We advise against the use of any granular service classes, since these will be\n  removed. Instead, catch the top-level service exception (e.g.,\n  `Aws\\S3\\Exception\\S3Exception`) and use the `getAwsErrorCode()` method if you\n  need to know the granular error code.\n\nUpgrade from 2.6 to 2.7\n-----------------------\n\nVersion 2.7 is backward-compatible with version 2.6. The version bump was\nnecessary in order to mark some things in the DynamoDb namespace as deprecated.\nSee the [CHANGELOG entry for 2.7.0](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/blob/v3/CHANGELOG.md#270-2014-10-08)\nfor more details.\n\nUpgrade from 2.5 to 2.6\n-----------------------\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Version 2.6 *is* backward-compatible with version 2.5, *unless* you are using the Amazon CloudSearch\nclient. If you are using CloudSearch, please read the next section carefully.\n\n### Amazon CloudSearch\n\nVersion 2.6 of the AWS SDK for PHP has been updated to use the 2013-01-01 API version of Amazon CloudSearch by default.\n\nThe 2013-01-01 API marks a significant upgrade of Amazon CloudSearch, but includes numerous breaking changes to the API.\nCloudSearch now supports 33 languages, highlighting, autocomplete suggestions, geospatial search, AWS IAM integration to\ncontrol access to domain configuration actions, and user configurable scaling and availability options. These new\nfeatures are reflected in the changes to the method and parameters of the CloudSearch client.\n\nFor details about the new API and how to update your usage of CloudSearch, please consult the [Configuration API\nReference for Amazon CloudSearch](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/configuration-api.html)\nand the guide for [Migrating to the Amazon CloudSearch 2013-01-01 API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide/migrating.html).\n\nIf you would like to continue using the older 2011-02-01 API, you can configure this when you instantiate the\n`CloudSearchClient`:\n\n```php\nuse Aws\\CloudSearch\\CloudSearchClient;\n\n$client = CloudSearchClient::factory(array(\n    'key'     => '<aws access key>',\n    'secret'  => '<aws secret key>',\n    'region'  => '<region name>',\n    'version' => '2011-02-01',\n));\n```\n\nUpgrade from 2.4 to 2.5\n-----------------------\n\n### Amazon EC2\n\nA small, backwards-incompatible change has been made to the Amazon EC2 API. The `LaunchConfiguration.MonitoringEnabled`\nparameter of the `RequestSpotInstances` operation has been change to `LaunchConfiguration.Monitoring.Enabled` See [this\ncommit](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-php/commit/36ae0f68d2a6dcc3bc28222f60ecb318449c4092#diff-bad2f6eac12565bb684f2015364c22bd)\nfor the exact change. You are only affected by this change if you are using this specific parameter. To fix your code to\nwork with the updated parameter, you will need to change the structure of your request slightly.\n\n```php\n// The OLD way\n$result = $ec2->requestSpotInstances(array(\n    // ...\n    'LaunchSpecification' => array(\n        // ...\n        'MonitoringEnabled' => true,\n        // ...\n    ),\n    // ...\n));\n\n// The NEW way\n$result = $ec2->requestSpotInstances(array(\n    // ...\n    'LaunchSpecification' => array(\n        // ...\n        'Monitoring' => array(\n            'Enabled' => true,\n        ),\n        // ...\n    ),\n    // ...\n));\n```\n\n### AWS CloudTrail\n\nAWS CloudTrail has made changes to their API. If you are not using the CloudTrail service, then you will not be\naffected by this change.\n\nHere is an excerpt (with minor modifications) directly from the [CloudTrail team's\nannouncement](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/ann.jspa?annID=2286) regarding this change:\n\n> [...] We have made some minor improvements/fixes to the service API, based on early feedback. The impact of these\n> changes to you depends on how you are currently interacting with the CloudTrail service. [...] If you have code that\n> calls the APIs below, you will need to make minor changes.\n>\n> There are two changes:\n>\n> 1) `CreateTrail` / `UpdateTrail`: These APIs originally took a single parameter, a `Trail` object. [...] We have\n> changed this so that you can now simply pass individual parameters directly to these APIs. The same applies to the\n> responses of these APIs, namely the APIs return individual fields directly [...]\n> 2) `GetTrailStatus`: The actual values of the fields returned and their data types were not all as intended. As such,\n> we are deprecating a set of fields, and adding a new set of replacement fields. The following fields are now\n> deprecated, and should no longer be used:\n>\n> * `LatestDeliveryAttemptTime` (String): Time CloudTrail most recently attempted to deliver a file to S3 configured\n>   bucket.\n> * `LatestNotificationAttemptTime` (String): As above, but for publishing a notification to configured SNS topic.\n> * `LatestDeliveryAttemptSucceeded` (String): This one had a mismatch between implementation and documentation. As\n>   documented: whether or not the latest file delivery was successful. As implemented: Time of most recent successful\n>   file delivery.\n> * `LatestNotificationAttemptSucceeded` (String): As above, but for SNS notifications.\n> * `TimeLoggingStarted` (String): Time `StartLogging` was most recently called. [...]\n> * `TimeLoggingStarted` (String): Time `StopLogging` was most recently called.\n>\n> The following fields are new, and replace the fields above:\n>\n> * `LatestDeliveryTime` (Date): Date/Time that CloudTrail most recently delivered a log file.\n> * `LatestNotificationTime` (Date): As above, for SNS notifications.\n> * `StartLoggingTime` (Date): Same as `TimeLoggingStarted`, but with more consistent naming, and correct data type.\n> * `StopLoggingTime` (Date): Same as `TimeLoggingStopped`, but with more consistent naming, and correct data type.\n>\n> Note that `LatestDeliveryAttemptSucceeded` and `LatestNotificationAttemptSucceeded` have no direct replacement. To\n> query whether everything is configured correctly for log file delivery, it is sufficient to query LatestDeliveryError,\n> and if non-empty that means that there is a configuration problem preventing CloudTrail from being able to deliver\n> logs successfully. Basically either the bucket doesn’t exist, or CloudTrail doesn’t have sufficient permissions to\n> write to the configured path in the bucket. Likewise for `LatestNotificationAttemptSucceeded`.\n>\n> The deprecated fields will be removed in the future, no earlier than February 15. Both set of fields will coexist on\n> the service during this period to give those who are using the deprecated fields time to switch over to the use the\n> new fields. However new SDKs and CLIs will remove the deprecated fields sooner than that. Previous SDK and CLI\n> versions will continue to work until the deprecated fields are removed from the service.\n>\n> We apologize for any inconvenience, and appreciate your understanding as we make these adjustments to improve the\n> long-term usability of the CloudTrail APIs.\n\nWe are marking this as a breaking change now, preemptive of the February 15th cutoff, and we encourage everyone to\nupdate their code now. The changes to how you use `createTrail()` and `updateTrail()` are easy changes:\n\n```php\n// The OLD way\n$cloudTrail->createTrail(array(\n    'trail' => array(\n        'Name'         => 'TRAIL_NAME',\n        'S3BucketName' => 'BUCKET_NAME',\n    )\n));\n\n// The NEW way\n$cloudTrail->createTrail(array(\n    'Name'         => 'TRAIL_NAME',\n    'S3BucketName' => 'BUCKET_NAME',\n));\n```\n\n### China (Beijing) Region / Signatures\n\nThis release adds support for the new China (Beijing) Region. This region requires that Signature V4 be used for both\nAmazon S3 and Amazon EC2 requests. We've added support for Signature V4 in both of these services for clients\nconfigured for this region. While doing this work, we did some refactoring to the signature classes and also removed\nsupport for Signature V3, as it is no longer needed. Unless you are explicitly referencing Signature V3 or explicitly\ninteracting with signature objects, these changes should not affect you.\n\nUpgrade from 2.3 to 2.4\n-----------------------\n\n### Amazon CloudFront Client\n\nThe new 2013-05-12 API version of Amazon CloudFront includes support for custom SSL certificates via the\n`ViewerCertificate` parameter, but also introduces breaking changes to the API. Version 2.4 of the SDK now ships with\ntwo versions of the Amazon CloudFront service description, one for the new 2013-05-12 API and one for the next most\nrecent 2012-05-05 API. The SDK defaults to using the newest API version, so CloudFront users may experience a breaking\nchange to their projects when upgrading. This can be easily circumvented by switching back to the 2012-05-05 API by\nusing the `version` option when instantiating the CloudFront client.\n\n### Guzzle 3.7\n\nVersion 2.4 of the AWS SDK for PHP requires at least version 3.7 of Guzzle.\n\nUpgrade from 2.2 to 2.3\n-----------------------\n\n### Amazon DynamoDB Client\n\nThe newly released 2012-08-10 API version of the Amazon DynamoDB service includes the new Local Secondary Indexes\nfeature, but also introduces breaking changes to the API. The most notable change is in the way that you specify keys\nwhen creating tables and retrieving items. Version 2.3 of the SDK now ships with 2 versions of the DynamoDB service\ndescription, one for the new 2012-08-10 API and one for the next most recent 2011-12-05 API. The SDK defaults to using\nthe newest API version, so DynamoDB users may experience a breaking change to their projects when upgrading. This can be\neasily fixed by switching back to the 2011-12-05 API by using the new `version` configuration setting when instantiating\nthe DynamoDB client.\n\n```php\nuse Aws\\DynamoDb\\DynamoDbClient;\n\n$client = DynamoDbClient::factory(array(\n    'key'     => '<aws access key>',\n    'secret'  => '<aws secret key>',\n    'region'  => '<region name>',\n    'version' => '2011-12-05'\n));\n```\n\nIf you are using a config file with `Aws\\Common\\Aws`, then you can modify your file like the following.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"includes\": [\"_aws\"],\n    \"services\": {\n        \"default_settings\": {\n            \"params\": {\n                \"key\": \"<aws access key>\",\n                \"secret\": \"<aws secret key>\",\n                \"region\": \"<region name>\"\n            }\n        },\n        \"dynamodb\": {\n            \"extends\": \"dynamodb\",\n            \"params\": {\n                \"version\": \"2011-12-05\"\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThe [SDK user guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-sdk-php/guide/latest/index.html) has a guide and examples for both\nversions of the API.\n\n### Guzzle 3.4.1\n\nVersion 2.3 of the AWS SDK for PHP requires at least version 3.4.1 of Guzzle.\n\nUpgrade from 2.1 to 2.2\n-----------------------\n\n### Full Service Coverage\n\nThe AWS SDK for PHP now supports the full set of AWS services.\n\n### Guzzle 3.3\n\nVersion 2.2 of the AWS SDK for PHP requires at least version 3.3 of Guzzle.\n\nUpgrade from 2.0 to 2.1\n-----------------------\n\n### General\n\nService descriptions are now versioned under the Resources/ directory of each client.\n\n### Waiters\n\nWaiters now require an associative array as input for the underlying operation performed by a waiter. The configuration\nsystem for waiters under 2.0.x utilized strings to determine the parameters used to create an operation. For example,\nwhen waiting for an object to exist with Amazon S3, you would pass a string containing the bucket name concatenated\nwith the object name using a '/' separator (e.g. 'foo/baz'). In the 2.1 release, these parameters are now more\nexplicitly tied to the underlying operation utilized by a waiter. For example, to use the ObjectExists waiter of\nAmazon S3 pass an associative array of `array('Bucket' => 'foo', 'Key' => 'baz')`. These options match the option names\nand rules associated with the HeadObject operation performed by the waiter. The API documentation of each client\ndescribes the waiters associated with the client and what underlying operation is responsible for waiting on the\nresource. Waiter specific options like the maximum number of attempts (max_attempts) or interval to wait between\nretries (interval) can be specified in this same configuration array by prefixing the keys with `waiter.`.\n\nWaiters can also be invoked using magic methods on the client. These magic methods are listed in each client's docblock\nusing `@method` tags.\n\n```php\n$s3Client->waitUntilObjectExists(array(\n    'Bucket' => 'foo',\n    'Key' => 'bar',\n    'waiter.max_attempts' => 3\n));\n```\n"
