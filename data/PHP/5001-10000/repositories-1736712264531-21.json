As an alternative,\n    we also provide this meta package that will install all stable components at\n    once. Installing this is only recommended for quick prototyping, as the list\n    of stable components may change over time.\n    In other words, this meta package does not contain any source code and\n    instead only consists of links to all our main components, see also our\n    [list of components](https://reactphp.org/#core-components) for more details.\n\n## 0.4.2 (2014-12-11)\n\n**Real Split**: The one where we tag the change where the master repo pulls in all the split components.\n\nNew component releases are now tagged and released in their respective\ncomponent repository.

At its core\nis an event loop, on top of which it provides low-level utilities, such as:\nStreams abstraction, async DNS resolver, network client/server, HTTP\nclient/server and interaction with processes. Third-party libraries can use these\ncomponents to create async network clients/servers and more.\n\n```php\n<?php\n\n// $ composer require react/http react/socket # install example using Composer\n// $ php example.php # run example on command line, requires no additional web server\n\nrequire __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';\n\n$server = new React\\Http\\HttpServer(function (Psr\\Http\\Message\\ServerRequestInterface $request) {\n    return React\\Http\\Message\\Response::plaintext(\n        \"Hello World!\\n\"\n    );\n});\n\n$socket = new React\\Socket\\SocketServer('127.0.0.1:8080');\n$server->listen($socket);\n\necho \"Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080\" . PHP_EOL;\n```\n\nThis simple web server written in ReactPHP responds with \"Hello World!\" for every request.\n\nReactPHP is production ready and battle-tested with millions of installations\nfrom all kinds of projects around the world. Its event-driven architecture makes\nit a perfect fit for efficient network servers and clients handling hundreds or\nthousands of concurrent connections, long-running applications and many other\nforms of cooperative multitasking with non-blocking I/O operations. What makes\nReactPHP special is its vivid ecosystem with hundreds of third-party libraries\nallowing you to integrate with many existing systems, such as common network\nservices, database systems and other third-party APIs.\n\n* **Production ready** and battle-tested.\n* **Rock-solid** with stable long-term support (LTS) releases.\n* **Requires no extensions** and runs on any platform - no excuses!\n* Takes advantage of **optional extensions** to get better performance when available.\n* **Highly recommends latest version of PHP 7+** for best performance and support.\n* **Supports legacy PHP 5.3+ and HHVM** for maximum compatibility.\n* **Well designed** and **reusable components**.\n* **Decoupled parts** so they can be replaced by alternate implementations.\n* Carefully **tested** (unit & functional).\n* Promotes **standard PSRs** where possible for maximum interoperability.\n* Aims to be **technology neutral**, so you can use your preferred application stack.\n* Small **core team of professionals** supported by **large network** of outside contributors.\n\nReactPHP is non-blocking by default. Use workers for blocking I/O.\nThe event loop is based on the reactor pattern (hence the name) and strongly\ninspired by libraries such as EventMachine (Ruby), Twisted (Python) and\nNode.js (V8).\n\n> This repository you're currently looking at is mostly used as a meta\n  repository to discuss and plan all things @ReactPHP.

Installing this is only recommended for quick prototyping,\nas the list of stable components may change over time. This meta package can be\ninstalled like this:\n\n```bash\n# quick protoyping only: install all stable components\ncomposer require react/react:^1.4\n```\n\nFor more details, check out [ReactPHP's homepage](https://reactphp.org/) for\nquickstart examples and usage details.\n\nSee also the combined [changelog for all ReactPHP components](https://reactphp.org/changelog.html)\nfor details about version upgrades.\n\n## Support\n\nDo you have a question and need help with ReactPHP? Don't worry, we're here to help!\n\nAs a first step, check the elaborate documentation that comes with each\ncomponent (see links to individual documentation for each component above).\nIf you find your question is not answered within the documentation, there's a\nfair chance that it may be relevant to more people. Please do not hesitate to\nfile your question as an issue in the relevant component so others can also\nparticipate.\n\nYou can also check out our official [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/reactphp/reactphp).\nMost of the people involved in this project are available in this chat room, so many\nquestions get answered in a few minutes to some hours. We also use this chat room\nto announce all new releases and ongoing development efforts, so consider\nstaying in this chat room for a little longer.\n\nAlso follow [@reactphp](https://twitter.com/reactphp) on Twitter for updates.\nWe use this mostly for noteworthy, bigger updates and to keep the community\nupdated about ongoing development efforts. You can always use the `#reactphp`\nhashtag if you have anything to share!\n\nWe're a very open project and we prefer public communication whenever possible,\nso that more people can participate and help getting the best solutions available.\nAt the same time, we realize that some things are better addressed in private.\nWhether you just want to say *thank you*, want to report a security issue or\nwant to help sponsor a certain feature development, you can reach out to the\ncore team in private by sending an email to `support@reactphp.org`. Please keep in\nmind that we're a small team of volunteers and do our best to support anybody\nreaching out.\n\nDo you want to support ReactPHP? Awesome! Let's start with letting the the world\nknow why you think ReactPHP is awesome and try to help others getting on board!\nSend a tweet, write a blog post, give a talk at your local user group or\nconference or even write a book. There are many ways you can help. You can\nalways reach out to us in private and help others in our support channels.\nThank you!\n\n## Tests\n\nTo run the test suite, you first need to clone this repo and then install all\ndependencies [through Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):\n\n```bash\ncomposer install\n```\n\nTo run the test suite, go to the project root and run:\n\n```bash\nvendor/bin/phpunit\n```\n\nThe test suite also contains a number of functional integration tests that rely\non a stable internet connection. Due to the vast number of integration tests,\nthese are skipped by default during CI runs. If you also do not want to run these,\nthey can simply be skipped like this:\n\n```bash\nvendor/bin/phpunit --exclude-group internet\n```\n\n## License\n\nMIT, see LICENSE.\n"
