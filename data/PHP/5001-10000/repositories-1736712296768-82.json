Showdown 1.8.6, DOMpurify 1.0.5 & Prettify 453bd5f\n* CHANGED: Refactored JavaScript code, making it modular with private and public functions, making it much easier to maintain (#178)\n* FIXED: To

certain formats there is now a generic `[formatter_options]` section where formats can be added to the displayed format drop down menu. A `defaultformatter` can be set, it defaults to \"plaintext\". The `syntaxhighlighting` configuration got deprecated.\n* `zerobin.js` got a major refactoring:\n  * moved from global namespace into anonymous function\n  * events are no longer set via \"onclick\" attributes in the templates, but bound by from JS side\n  * for simpler maintenance the functions were grouped into objects: zerobin (display logic, event handling), filter (compression,\nencryption), i18n (translation, counterpart of i18n.php) and helper (stateless utilities)\n* Wiki pages were added to address common topics:\n  * [Upgrading from ZeroBin 0.19 Alpha](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Upgrading-from-ZeroBin-0.19-Alpha)\n  * [Directory of public PrivateBin servers](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/PrivateBin-Directory)\n  * [Translation](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Translation)\n  * [Templates](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Templates)\n\n## 0.20 (2015-09-03):\n* ADDED: Password protected pastes (optional)\n* ADDED: configuration options for highlighting, password, discussions, expiration times, rate limiting\n* ADDED: JSON-only retrieval of paste incl. discussion, used to be able to refresh paste when posting a comment\n* ADDED: bootstrap CSS based template\n* CHANGED: \"Burn after reading\" pastes are now deleted only after the paste was successfully decrypted via callback. This prevents accidental deletion by chatbots following URLs and the like. Usage of a password is suggested to ensure only the desired recipient is able to encrypt it.\n* CHANGED: the \"opendiscussion\" option now only controls if the discussion checkbox is preselected. Use \"discussion = false\" to disable the discussion feature completely (which also removes the checkbox from the template).\n* FIXING: Behaviour of several conflicting configuration options. As a general measure unit tests for 9 of the options and all their possible configurations were added via a unit test generator.\n* updated JS libraries: jquery to 1.11.3, sjcl to 1.0.2, base64.js to 2.1.9, deflate to 0.5, inflate to 0.3 and prettify to latest\n* generally improved documentation, both inline phpdoc / JSdoc source code documentation, as well as Wiki pages on installation, configuration, development and JSON-API\n\n## Alpha 0.19 (2013-07-05):\n* Corrected XSS security flaw which affected IE<10. Other browsers were not affected.\n* Corrected spacing display in IE<10.\n\n## Alpha 0.18 (2013-02-24):\n* ADDED: The resulting URL is automatically selected after pressing \"Send\". You just have to press CTRL+C.\n* ADDED: Automatic syntax highlighting for 53 languages using highlight.js\n* ADDED: \"5 minutes\" and \"1 week\" expirations.\n* ADDED: \"Raw text\" button.\n* jQuery upgraded to 1.9.1\n* sjcl upgraded to GitHub master 2013-02-23\n* base64.js upgraded to 1.7\n* FIXED: Dates in discussion are now proper local dates.\n* ADDED: Robot meta tags in HTML to prevent search engines indexing.\n* ADDED: Better json checking (including entropy).\n* ADDED: Added version to js/css assets URLs in order to prevent some abusive caches to serve an obsolete version of these files when ZeroBin is upgraded.\n* \"Burn after reading\" option has been moved out of Expiration combo to a separate checkbox. Reason is: You can prevent a read-once paste to be available ad vitam eternam on the net.\n\n## Alpha 0.17 (2013-02-23):\n* ADDED: Deletion URL.\n* small refactoring.\n* improved regex checks.\n* larger server alt on installation.\n\n## Alpha 0.16:\n* FIXED minor php warnings.\n* FIXED: zerobin.js reformated and properly commented.\n* FIXED: Directory structure re-organized.\n* CHANGED: URL shortening button was removed. (It was bad for privacy.)\n\n## Alpha 0.15 (2012-04-20):\n* FIXED: 2 minor corrections to avoid notices in php log.\n* FIXED: Sources converted to UTF-8.\n\n## Alpha 0.14 (2012-04-20):\n* ADDED: GD presence is checked.\n* CHANGED: Traffic limiter data files moved to data/ (→easier rights management)\n* ADDED: \"Burn after reading\" implemented. Opening the URL will display the paste and immediately destroy it on server.\n\n## Alpha 0.13 (2012-04-18):\n* FIXED: ''imageantialias()'' call removed because it's not really usefull and can be a problem on most hosts (if GD is not compiled in php).\n* FIXED: $error not properly initialized in index.php\n\n## Alpha 0.12 (2012-04-18):\n  ## DISCUSSIONS ! Now you can enable discussions on your pastes. Of course, posted comments and nickname are also encrypted and the server cannot see them.\n* This feature implies a change in storage format. You will have to delete all previous pastes in your ZeroBin.\n* Added [[php:vizhash_gd|Vizhash]] as avatars, so you can match posters IP addresses without revealing them. (Same image = same IP). Of course the IP address cannot be deduced from the Vizhash.\n* Remaining time before expiration is now displayed.\n* Explicit tags were added to CSS and jQuery selectors (eg. div#aaa instead of #aaa) to speed up browser.\n* Better cleaning of the URL (to make sure the key is not broken by some stupid redirection service)\n\n## Alpha 0.11 (2012-04-12):\n* Automatically ignore parameters (such as &utm_source=...) added //after// the anchor by some stupid Web 2.0 services.\n* First public release.\n\n## Alpha 0.10 (2012-04-12):\n* IE9 does not seem to correctly support ''pre-wrap'' either. Special handling mode activated for all version of IE<10. (Note: ALL other browsers correctly support this feature.)\n\n## Alpha 0.9 (2012-04-11):\n* Oh bummer... IE 8 is as shitty as IE6/7: Its does not seem to support ''white-space:pre-wrap'' correctly. I had to activate the special handling mode. I still have to test IE 9.\n\n## Alpha 0.8 (2012-04-11):\n* Source code not published yet.\n* Interface completely redesigned. Icons added.\n* Now properly supports IE6/7 (ugly display, but it works. \"Clone\" button is disabled though.)\n* Added one level of depth for storage directories (This is better for higher load servers).\n* php version is now checked (min: 5.2.6)\n* Better checks on posted json data on server.\n* Added \"1 year\" expiration.\n* URLs are now converted to clickable links. This include http, https, ftp and magnet links.\n* Clickable links include ''rel=\"nofollow\"'' to discourage SEO.\n* On my public service (http://sebsauvage.net/paste/)\n  * All data will be deleted (you were warned - this is a test service)\n  * Default paste expiration is now 1 month to prevent clogging-up my host.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\nWhen we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\nTo protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\nFor example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\nWe protect your rights with two steps: **(1)** copyright the software, and\n**(2)** offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\nAlso, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\nFinally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\nThe precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n### TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n**0.** This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The “Program”, below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a “work based on the Program”\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term “modification”.)  Each licensee is addressed as “you”.\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n**1.** You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n**2.** You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n* **a)** You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\nstating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n* **b)** You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\nwhole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\npart thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\nparties under the terms of this License.\n* **c)** If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\nwhen run, you must cause it, when started running for such\ninteractive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\nannouncement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\nnotice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\na warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\nthese conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\nLicense.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\ndoes not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\nthe Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n**3.** You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n* **a)** Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n* **b)** Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\nyears, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\ncost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\nmachine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\ndistributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\ncustomarily used for software interchange; or,\n* **c)** Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\nto distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\nallowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\nreceived the program in object code or executable form with such\nan offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n**4.** You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n**5.** You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n**6.** Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n**7.** If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n**8.** If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n**9.** The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and “any\nlater version”, you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n**10.** If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n### NO WARRANTY\n\n**11.** BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n**12.** IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\nEND OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n## BSD 3-Clause License for Showdown\n\nShowdown Copyright © 2007, John Fraser\n<http://www.attacklab.net/>\nAll rights reserved.\n\nOriginal Markdown copyright © 2004, John Gruber\n<http://daringfireball.net/>\nAll rights reserved.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n* Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this\n  list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n* Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,\n  this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation\n  and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\n* Neither the name \"Markdown\" nor the names of its contributors may be used\n  to endorse or promote products derived from this software without specific\n  prior written permission.\n\nThis software is provided by the copyright holders and contributors \"as is\" and\nany express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, the implied\nwarranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose are\ndisclaimed.

In all other cases the Licensor\n       expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n### Section 3 – License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following\nconditions.\n\na. ___Attribution.___\n\n    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:\n\n        A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the\n           Licensed Material:\n\n            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any\n               others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable\n               manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n               designated);\n\n            ii. a copyright notice;\n\n            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;\n\n            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent\n               reasonably practicable;\n\n        B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an\n           indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n        C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,\n           and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public\n           License.\n\n    2.

For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the\n       conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes\n       the required information.\n\n    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information\n       required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.\n\n    4.

You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a\n   substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your\nobligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other\nCopyright and Similar Rights.\n\n### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\na. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent\n   possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,\n   and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the\n   Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This\n   includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness\n   for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other\n   defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known\n   or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or\n   in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__\n\nb. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on\n   any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for\n   any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,\n   exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this\n   Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been\n   advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where\n   a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation\n   may not apply to You.__\n\nc. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall\n   be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely\n   approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.\n\n### Section 6 – Term and Termination.\n\na. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights\n   licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then\n   Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.\n\nb. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section\n   6(a), it reinstates:\n\n    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured\n       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or\n\n    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the\n    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public\n    License.\n\nc. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material\n   under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material\n   at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.\n\nd. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.\n\n### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.\n\na. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or\n   conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\nb. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed\n   Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and\n   conditions of this Public License.\n\n### Section 8 – Interpretation.\n\na. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be\n   interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of\n   the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under\n   this Public License.\n\nb. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed\n   unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent\n   necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it\n   shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the\n   enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.\n\nc. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to\n   comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.\n\nd. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a\n   limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to\n   the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction\n   or authority.\n"

PrivateBin was\nrefactored to allow easier and cleaner extensions and has many additional\nfeatures. It is, however, still fully compatible to the original ZeroBin 0.19\ndata storage scheme. Therefore, such installations can be upgraded to PrivateBin\nwithout losing any data.\n\n## What PrivateBin provides\n\n+ As a server administrator you don't have to worry if your users post content\n  that is considered illegal in your country. You have plausible deniability of\n  any of the pastes content. If requested or enforced, you can delete any paste\n  from your system.\n\n+ Pastebin-like system to store text documents, code samples, etc.\n\n+ Encryption of data sent to server.\n\n+ Possibility to set a password which is required to read the paste. It further\n  protects a paste and prevents people stumbling upon your paste's link\n  from being able to read it without the password.\n\n## What it doesn't provide\n\n- As a user you have to trust the server administrator not to inject any\n  malicious code. For security, a PrivateBin installation *has to be used over*\n  *HTTPS*! Otherwise you would also have to trust your internet provider, and\n  any jurisdiction the traffic passes through. Additionally the instance should\n  be secured by\n  [HSTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security). It can\n  use traditional certificate authorities and/or use a\n  [DNSSEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System_Security_Extensions)\n  protected\n  [DANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS-based_Authentication_of_Named_Entities)\n  record.\n\n- The \"key\" used to encrypt the paste is part of the URL. If you publicly post\n  the URL of a paste that is not password-protected, anyone can read it.\n  Use a password if you want your paste to remain private. In that case, make\n  sure to use a strong password and share it privately and end-to-end-encrypted.\n\n- A server admin can be forced to hand over access logs to the authorities.\n  PrivateBin encrypts your text and the discussion contents, but who accessed a\n  paste (first) might still be disclosed via access logs.\n\n- In case of a server breach your data is secure as it is only stored encrypted\n  on the server. However, the server could be abused or the server admin could\n  be legally forced into sending malicious code to their users, which logs\n  the decryption key and sends it to a server when a user accesses a paste.\n  Therefore, do not access any PrivateBin instance if you think it has been\n  compromised. As long as no user accesses this instance with a previously\n  generated URL, the content can't be decrypted.\n\n## Options\n\nSome features are optional and can be enabled or disabled in the [configuration\nfile](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration):\n\n* Password protection\n\n* Discussions, anonymous or with nicknames and IP based identicons or vizhashes\n\n* Expiration times, including a \"forever\" and \"burn after reading\" option\n\n* Markdown format support for HTML formatted pastes, including preview function\n\n* Syntax highlighting for source code using prettify.js, including 4 prettify\n  themes\n\n* File upload support, image, media and PDF preview (disabled by default, size\n  limit adjustable)\n\n* Templates: By default there are bootstrap CSS, darkstrap and \"classic ZeroBin\"\n  to choose from and it is easy to adapt these to your own websites layout or\n  create your own.\n\n* Translation system and automatic browser language detection (if enabled in\n  browser)\n\n* Language selection (disabled by default, as it uses a session cookie)\n\n* QR code for paste URLs, to easily transfer them over to mobile devices\n\n## Further resources\n\n* [FAQ](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/FAQ)\n\n* [Installation guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/blob/master/doc/Installation.md#installation)\n\n* [Configuration guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Configuration)\n\n* [Templates](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Templates)\n\n* [Translation guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Translation)\n\n* [Developer guide](https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/Development)\n\nRun into any issues?
