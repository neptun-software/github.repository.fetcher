          "content": "# Code of conduct\n\nThis document is a close copy of <https://nextcloud.com/contribute/code-of-conduct/>, adapted only to speak to and of the Roundcube community. Roundcube is part of the bigger Nextcloud community since 2023, but deserves to be addressed directly.\n\n## Preamble\n\nIn the Roundcube community, participants from all over the world come together to create Free Software for a free internet. This is made possible by the support, hard work and enthusiasm of thousands of people, including those who create and use Roundcube software.\n\nThis document offers some guidance to ensure Roundcube participants can cooperate effectively in a positive and inspiring atmosphere, and to explain how together we can strengthen and support each other.\n\nThis Code of Conduct is shared by all contributors and users who engage with the Roundcube team and its community services.\n\nIf you ever experience an uncomfortable or threatening situation, please speak up: conduct@nextcloud.com. The team behind that address also cares for the Roundcube community.\n\n## Overview\n\nThis Code of Conduct presents a summary of the shared values and “common sense” thinking in our community. The basic social ingredients that hold our project together include:\n\n* Be considerate\n* Be respectful\n* Be collaborative\n* Be pragmatic\n* Support others in the community\n* Get support from others in the community\n\n### Our community\n\nOur community is made up of several groups of individuals and organizations which can roughly be divided into two groups:\n\n* Contributors, or those who add value to the project through improving Roundcube software and its services\n* Users, or those who add value to the project through their support as consumers of Roundcube software\n\nThis Code of Conduct reflects the agreed standards of behavior for members of the Roundcube community, in any forum, mailing list, wiki, web site, IRC channel, public meeting or private correspondence within the context of the Roundcube team and its services.\n\nThe community acts according to the standards written down in this Code of Conduct and will defend these standards for the benefit of the community. Leaders of any group, such as moderators of mailing lists, IRC channels, forums, etc., will exercise the right to suspend access to any person who persistently breaks our shared Code of Conduct.\n\n## Be considerate\n\nYour actions and work will affect and be used by other people and you in turn will depend on the work and actions of others. Any decision you take will affect other community members, and we expect you to take those consequences into account when making decisions.\n\nAs a contributor, ensure that you give full credit for the work of others and bear in mind how your changes affect others. It is also expected that you try to follow the development schedule and guidelines.\n\nAs a user, remember that contributors work hard on their part of Roundcube and take great pride in it. If you are frustrated your problems are more likely to be resolved if you can give accurate and well-mannered information to all concerned.\n\n## Be respectful\n\nIn order for the Roundcube community to stay healthy its members must feel comfortable and accepted. Treating one another with respect is absolutely necessary for this. In a disagreement, in the first instance assume that people mean well.\n\nWe do not tolerate personal attacks, racism, sexism or any other form of discrimination. Disagreement is inevitable, from time to time, but respect for the views of others will go a long way to winning respect for your own view.\n\nRespecting other people, their work, their contributions and assuming well-meaning motivation will make community members feel comfortable and safe and will result in motivation and productivity.\n\nWe expect members of our community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors, users and communities. Remember that Roundcube is an international project and that you may be unaware of important aspects of other cultures.\n\n## Be collaborative\n\nThe Free Software Movement depends on collaboration: it helps limit duplication of effort while improving the quality of the software produced. In order to avoid misunderstanding, try to be clear and concise when requesting help or giving it. Remember it is easy to misunderstand emails (especially when they are not written in your mother tongue). Ask for clarifications if unsure how something is meant; remember the first rule - assume in the first instance that people mean well.\n\nAs a contributor, you should aim to collaborate with other community members, as well as with other communities that are interested in or depend on the work you do. Your work should be transparent and be fed back into the community when available, not just when Roundcube releases. If you wish to work on something new in existing projects, keep those projects informed of your ideas and progress.\n\nIt may not always be possible to reach consensus on the implementation of an idea, so dont feel obliged to achieve this before you begin. However, always ensure that you keep the outside world informed of your work, and publish it in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss and contribute to your efforts.\n\nContributors on every project come and go. When you leave or disengage from the project, in whole or in part, you should do so with pride about what you have achieved and by acting responsibly towards others who come after you to continue the project.\n\nAs a user, your feedback is important, as is its form. Poorly thought out comments can cause pain and the demotivation of other community members, but considerate discussion of problems can bring positive results. An encouraging word works wonders.\n\n## Be pragmatic\n\nRoundcube is a pragmatic community. We value tangible results over having the last word in a discussion. We defend our core values like freedom and respectful collaboration, but we dont let arguments about minor issues get in the way of achieving more important results.\n\nWe are open to suggestions and welcome solutions regardless of their origin. When in doubt support a solution which helps getting things done over one which has theoretical merits, but isnt being worked on. Use the tools and methods which help getting the job done. Let decisions be taken by those who do the work.\n\n## Support others in the community\n\nOur community is made strong by mutual respect, collaboration and pragmatic, responsible behavior. Sometimes there are situations where this has to be defended and other community members need help.\n\nIf you witness others being attacked, think first about how you can offer them personal support. If you feel that the situation is beyond your ability to help individually, go privately to the victim and ask if some form of official intervention is needed.\n\nSimilarly you should support anyone who appears to be in danger of burning out, either through work-related stress or personal problems.\n\nWhen problems do arise, consider respectfully reminding those involved of our shared Code of Conduct as a first action. Leaders are defined by their actions, and can help set a good example by working to resolve issues in the spirit of this Code of Conduct before they escalate.\n\n## Get support from others in the community\n\nDisagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time. Our community is no exception to the rule. The goal is not to avoid disagreements or differing views but to resolve them constructively. You should turn to the community to seek advice and to resolve disagreements and where possible consult the team most directly involved.\n\nThink deeply before turning a disagreement into a public dispute. If necessary request mediation, trying to resolve differences in a less highly-emotional medium. If you do feel that you or your work is being attacked, take your time to breathe through before writing heated replies. Consider a 24 hour moratorium if emotional language is being used - a cooling off period is sometimes all that is needed. If you really want to go a different way, then we encourage you to publish your ideas and your work, so that it can be tried and tested.\n\nThis document is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution - Share Alike 3.0 License.\n\nThe authors of this document would like to thank the Roundcube and the Nextcloud community and those who have worked to create such a dynamic environment to share in and who offered their thoughts and wisdom in the authoring of this document. We would also like to thank other vibrant communities that have helped shape this document with their own examples, especially KDE.\n"

          "content": "INTRODUCTION\n============\n\nThis file describes the basic steps to install Roundcube Webmail on your\nweb server. For additional information, please also consult the project's\nwiki page at https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki\n\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n============\n\n* An IMAP, HTTP and SMTP server\n* .htaccess support allowing overrides for DirectoryIndex\n* PHP Version 7.3 or greater including:\n   - PCRE, DOM, JSON, Session, Sockets, OpenSSL, Mbstring, Filter, Ctype, Intl (required)\n   - PHP PDO with driver for either MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite (required)\n   - Iconv, Zip, Fileinfo, Exif (recommended)\n   - LDAP for LDAP addressbook support (optional)\n   - GD, Imagick, XMLWriter (optional: thumbnails generation, QR-code)\n* PEAR and PEAR packages distributed with Roundcube or external.\n  See composer.json for the list of required packages.\n* php.ini options:\n   - memory_limit > 16MB\n   - file_uploads enabled (for uploading attachments and import files)\n   - session.auto_start disabled\n   - suhosin.session.encrypt disabled\n   - mbstring.func_overload disabled\n   - pcre.backtrack_limit >= 100000\n* A MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite v3 support in PHP - with permission to create tables\n* Composer installed either locally or globally (https://getcomposer.org)\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n============\n\n1. Decompress and put this folder somewhere inside your document root.\n  Note: Make sure files have proper owner/group for your setup. If you use\n  tar command `--no-same-owner` option might be helpful.\n2. In case you don't use the so-called \"complete\" release package,\n  you have to install PHP and javascript dependencies.\n  2.1. Install PHP dependencies using composer:\n    - get composer from https://getcomposer.org/download/\n    - if you want to use LDAP address books, enable the LDAP libraries in your\n      composer.json file by moving the items from \"suggest\" to the \"require\"\n      section (remove the explanation texts after the version!).\n    - run `php composer.phar update --no-dev`\n  2.2. Install Javascript dependencies by executing `bin/install-jsdeps.sh` script.\n  2.3. Install some developer tools by executing `npm install`.\n3. Make sure that the following directories (and the files within)\n   are writable by the webserver\n   - /temp\n   - /logs\n4. Create a new database and a database user for Roundcube (see DATABASE SETUP)\n5. Point your browser to http://url-to-roundcube/installer/\n6. Follow the instructions of the install script (or see MANUAL CONFIGURATION)\n7. After creating and testing the configuration, remove the installer directory\n   ------------------------------------------\n   IMPORTANT: REMOVE THE INSTALLER DIRECTORY!\n   ------------------------------------------\n8. If you use git sources, compile css files for the Elastic skin as described\n   in the skins/elastic/README.md file.\n9. Check Known Issues section of this file\n\n\nCONFIGURATION HINTS\n===================\n\nIMPORTANT! Read all comments in defaults.inc.php, understand them\nand configure your installation to be not surprised by default behaviour.\n\nRoundcube writes internal errors to the 'errors.log' log file located in the logs\ndirectory which can be configured in config/config.inc.php. If you want ordinary\nPHP errors to be logged there as well, set error_log in php.ini or .htaccess file.\nExamine the log_driver config value for other options.\n\nRoundcube forces display_errors=Off and log_errors=On.\n\nBy default the session cookie settings of PHP are not modified by Roundcube.\nHowever if you want to limit the session cookies to the directory where\nRoundcube resides you can set session.cookie_path in the php.ini or .htaccess file.\n\nMore about PHP settings: https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Installation#php-configuration\n\n\nDATABASE SETUP\n==============\n\nNote: Database for Roundcube must use UTF-8 character set.\nNote: See defaults.inc.php file for examples of DSN configuration.\n\n* MySQL\n-------\nSetting up the mysql database can be done by creating an empty database,\nimporting the table layout and granting the proper permissions to the\nroundcube user. Here is an example of that procedure:\n\n# mysql\n> CREATE DATABASE roundcubemail CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;\n> CREATE USER roundcube@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password';\n> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON roundcubemail.* TO roundcube@localhost;\n> quit\n\nNote 1: 'password' is the master password for the roundcube user. It is strongly\nrecommended you replace this with a more secure password. Please keep in\nmind that you must specify this password later in 'config/config.inc.php'.\n\nNote 2: When using MySQL < 5.7.7 or MariaDB < 10.2.2 it is required to configure\nthe database engine with:\n    innodb_large_prefix=1\n    innodb_file_per_table=1\n    innodb_file_format=Barracuda\n\nNow you can run the Installer or configure the database access options in\n'config/config.inc.php' and run: `bin/initdb.sh --dir=SQL`.\n\n\n* SQLite\n--------\nVersions of sqlite database engine older than 3.6.19 aren't supported.\nDatabase file and structure is created automatically by Roundcube.\nMake sure your configuration points to some file location and that the\nwebserver can write to the file and the directory containing the file.\n\n\n* PostgreSQL\n------------\nTo use Roundcube with PostgreSQL support you have to follow these\nsimple steps, which have to be done as the postgres system user (or\nwhich ever is the database superuser):\n\n$ createuser -P roundcube\n$ createdb -O roundcube -E UNICODE roundcubemail\n\nNote: in some system configurations you might need to add '-U postgres' to\ncreateuser and createdb commands.\n\nNow you can run the Installer or configure the database access options in\n'config/config.inc.php' and run: `bin/initdb.sh --dir=SQL`.\n\n\nDatabase cleaning\n-----------------\nTo keep your database slick and clean we recommend to periodically execute\nbin/cleandb.sh which finally removes all records that are marked as deleted.\nBest solution is to install a cronjob running this script daily.\n\n\nMANUAL CONFIGURATION\n====================\n\nFirst of all, copy the sample configuration file config/config.inc.php.sample\nto config/config.inc.php and make the necessary adjustments according to your\nenvironment and your needs. More configuration options can be copied from the\nconfig/defaults.inc.php file into your local config.inc.php file as needed.\nRead the comments above the individual configuration options to find out what\nthey do or read https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Installation\nfor even more guidance.\n\nThe maximum size of email attachments and other file uploads is controlled by\nPHP settings: upload_max_filesize and post_max_size. Read more about PHP\nsettings at https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/wiki/Installation#php-configuration.\n\n\nSECURE YOUR INSTALLATION\n========================\n\nAccess through the webserver to the following directories should be denied:\n\n  /config\n  /temp\n  /logs\n\nRoundcube uses .htaccess files to protect these directories, so be sure to\nallow override of the Limit directives to get them taken into account. The\npackage also ships a .htaccess file in the root directory which defines some\nrewrite rules. In order to properly secure your installation, please enable\nmod_rewrite for Apache webserver and double check access to the above listed\ndirectories and their contents is denied.\n\nNOTE: In Apache 2.4, support for .htaccess files has been disabled by\ndefault. Therefore you first need to enable this in your Apache main or\nvirtual host config by with:\n\n  AllowOverride all\n\nFor non-apache web servers add equivalent configuration parameters to deny\ndirect access to these private resources.\n\nIt is also recommended to change the document root to <install path>/public_html\nafter installation if Roundcube runs at root of a dedicated virtual host. This\nwill automatically keep sensitive files out of reach for http requests.\n\nCONTENT-SECURITY-POLICY\n-----------------------\n\nIf you use a Content-Security-Policy, please note that Roundcube *requires* the\n`script-src` parameter to include `'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'`. No external\nsources are required (by default).\n\n\nUPGRADING\n=========\n\nIf you already have a previous version of Roundcube installed,\nplease refer to the instructions in UPGRADING guide.\n\n\nOPTIMISING\n==========\n\nThere are two forms of optimization here, compression and caching, both aimed\nat increasing an end user's experience using Roundcube Webmail. Compression\nallows the static web pages to be delivered with less bandwidth. The index.php\nof Roundcube Webmail already enables compression on its output. The settings\nbelow allow compression to occur for all static files. Caching sets HTTP\nresponse headers that enable a user's web client to understand what is static\nand how to cache it.\n\nThe caching directives used are:\n * Etags - sets at tag so the client can request is the page has changed\n * Cache-control - defines the age of the page and that the page is 'public'\n   This enables clients to cache javascript files that don't have private\n   information between sessions even if using HTTPS. It also allows proxies\n   to share the same cached page between users.\n * Expires - provides another hint to increase the lifetime of static pages.\n\nFor more information refer to RFC 2616.\n\nSide effects:\n-------------\nThese directives are designed for production use. If you are using this in\na development environment you may get horribly confused if your webclient\nis caching stuff that you changed on the server. Disabling the expires\nparts below should save you some grief.\n\nIf you are changing the skins, it is recommended that you copy content to\na different directory apart from 'default'.\n\nApache:\n-------\nTo enable these features in apache the following modules need to be enabled:\n * mod_deflate\n * mod_expires\n * mod_headers\n\nThe optimization is already included in the .htaccess file in the top\ndirectory of your installation.\n\nLighttpd:\n---------\nWith Lighttpd the addition of Expire: tags by mod_expire is incompatible with\nthe addition of \"Cache-control: public\". Using Cache-control 'public' is\nused below as it is assumed to give a better caching result.\n\nEnable modules in server.modules:\n    \"mod_setenv\"\n    \"mod_compress\"\n\nMod_compress is a server side cache of compressed files to improve its performance.\n\n$HTTP[\"host\"] == \"www.example.com\" {\n\n    static-file.etags = \"enable\"\n    # http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Etag.use-mtimeDetails\n    etag.use-mtime = \"enable\"\n\n    # http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs:ModSetEnv\n    $HTTP[\"url\"] =~ \"^/roundcubemail/(plugins|skins|program)\" {\n        setenv.add-response-header  = ( \"Cache-Control\" => \"public, max-age=2592000\")\n    }\n\n    # http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/lighttpd/wiki/Docs:ModCompress\n    # set compress.cache-dir to somewhere outside the docroot.\n    compress.cache-dir   = var.statedir + \"/cache/compress\"\n\n    compress.filetype = (\"text/plain\", \"text/html\", \"text/javascript\", \"text/css\", \"text/xml\", \"image/gif\", \"image/png\")\n}\n\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n============\n\nInstallations with uw-imap server should set imap_disabled_caps = array('ESEARCH')\nin main configuration file. ESEARCH implementation in this server is broken (#1489184).\n\nPHP >= 5.6 validates the ssl certificates by default. It means that\nif IMAP/SMTP certificates are self-signed or use wrong host name you'll get\nconnection errors. A solution in such cases is to set imap_conn_options,\nsmtp_conn_options and managesieve_conn_options in a way described in config/defaults.inc.php.\n\nIf you have problems with temp files or non-working logs make sure temp and logs folders\nare writeable to the user used by http server. Access to them may also be blocked by\nSELINUX. Here's some sample commands for SELINUX:\n\n    $ semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t \"/path_to_roundcube/logs(/.*)?\"\n    $ semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t \"/path_to_roundcube/temp(/.*)?\"\n    $ restorecon -Rv /path_to_roundcube/\n\nMicrosoft IIS Server by default does not support WOFF fonts used in Elastic skin. It might be\nneeded to add following MIME Types definitions (via web.config or IIS Manager):\n\n    .woff   application/font-woff\n    .woff2  application/font-woff2\n\nWhen installing on Windows be aware we're using symbolic links which may need an additional\nattention. See https://github.com/roundcube/roundcubemail/issues/7151.\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

It's not recommended to replace an existing installation\nof Roundcube with this version. Also using a separate database for this\ninstallation is highly recommended.\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n------------\nRoundcube Webmail is a browser-based multilingual IMAP client with an\napplication-like user interface. It provides full functionality you expect\nfrom an email client, including MIME support, address book, folder management,\nmessage searching and spell checking. Roundcube Webmail is written in PHP and\nrequires the MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL or SQLite database. With its plugin API it \nis easily extendable and the user interface is fully customizable using skins.\n\nThe code designed to run on a webserver is mainly written in PHP and Javascript.\nIt includes a custom framework with an IMAP library derived from [IlohaMail][iloha]\nand requires a set of external libraries (see composer.json and jsdeps.json files).\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n------------\nFor detailed instructions on how to install Roundcube webmail on your server,\nplease refer to the INSTALL document in the same directory as this document.\n\nIf you're updating an older version of Roundcube please follow the steps\ndescribed in the UPGRADING file.\n\n\nBROWSER SUPPORT\n---------------\nRoundcube uses jQuery 3.x (and other libs) for its client and therefore\ninherits the browser support from there. This currently includes:\n\n- Chrome: (Current - 1) and Current\n- Edge: (Current - 1) and Current\n- Firefox: (Current - 1) and Current, ESR\n- Internet Explorer: 11+\n- Safari: (Current - 1) and Current\n- Opera: Current\n\n\nLICENSE\n-------\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License (**with exceptions\nfor skins & plugins**) as published by the Free Software Foundation,\neither version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The tone of a conversation influences its outcome, and also the tone of the next conversation. Even people writing rudely sometime calm down if they get a polite response, and if not, other people read our statements, too, and adjust their tone.\n* Always thank others for their work. They used their time and energy to contribute something, which is great already!\n* Keep descriptions comprehensible and accurate. Tending to written statements expresses respect for all our time and helps to avoid misinterpretation.\n* Explain yourself. Text-only communication can often come across as rude since there is no facial expression and tone of voice, so do the extra step and write longer sentences.\n* Use (your own) pull requests. Don't push to other people's or mutually used branches. You might break something, or create unexpected code conflicts for others. Pull requests can be opened targetting other people's branches, too.\n* Ask others politely to follow these rules, if they don't. We all a human and make errors, we all can learn.\n\nSometimes a quick, informal exchange can help to avoid confusion or anger. The [\"Background chat\" channel](https://cloud.nextcloud.com/call/1280760291) is available for that purpose.\n"

          "content": "UPGRADING instructions\n======================\n\nFollow these instructions if upgrading from a previous version\nof Roundcube Webmail. We recommend to carefully backup the existing\ninstallation as well as the database before going through the following steps.\n\nUsing the update script\n-----------------------\nThere is a shell script (for unix based systems) that does the job for you.\nTo use it, unpack the archive of the new Roundcube version to a temporary location\n(don't replace the Roundcube installation you want to update)\nand cd into that directory. From there, run the following command in a shell:\n\n  ./bin/installto.sh <TARGET-FOLDER>\n\nFor <TARGET-FOLDER> you specify the path to the Roundcube installation\nwhich should be updated. The update script will then copy all new files to the\ntarget location and check and update the configuration and database schema.\nAfter all is done, the temporary folder with the new Roundcube files can be\nremoved again.\n\nWARNING: Make sure files have proper owner/group for your setup. If you use\n         tar to extract the package, `--no-same-owner` option might be helpful.\nWARNING: See Post-Upgrade Activities section below.\nWARNING: If you use MySQL < 5.7.7 or MariaDB < 10.2.2 make sure to configure it with:\n            innodb_large_prefix=1\n            innodb_file_per_table=1\n            innodb_file_format=Barracuda\n\n\nUpdating manually\n-----------------\nIf you don't have shell access to the Roundcube installation or if not running\nit on a unix system, you need to do the following operations by hand:\n\n1. Replace index.php and all files in\n   - ./bin/\n   - ./SQL/\n   - ./program/\n   - ./installer/\n2. Replace the configuration defaults files:\n   - config/defaults.inc.php\n   - config/mimetypes.php\n3. rsync the contents of the following folders from your installation\n   directory into the target folder:\n   ./skins/\n   ./plugins/\n   ./vendor/\n4. Update dependencies:\n4a. If you previously installed plugins through composer, update dependencies\n   by running `php composer.phar update --no-dev`.\n4b. Install/update dependencies using composer:\n   - get composer from https://getcomposer.org/download/\n   - if you want to use LDAP address books, enable the LDAP libraries in your\n     composer.json file by moving the items from \"suggest\" to the \"require\"\n     section (remove the explanation texts after the version!).\n   - run `php composer.phar update --no-dev`.\n4c. If you use git sources or the release package without dependencies\n   update javascript dependencies by executing `bin/install-jsdeps.sh` script.\n4d. If you use git sources, install developer tools using `npm install`.\n4e. If you use git sources, compile css files for the Elastic skin as described\n   in the skins/elastic/README.md file.\n5. Run `./bin/update.sh` from the commandline OR\n   open http://url-to-roundcube/installer/ in a browser and choose \"3 Test config\".\n   To enable the latter one, you have to temporary set 'enable_installer'\n   to true in your local config/config.inc.php file.\n   WARNING: See SQLite database upgrade below.\n6. Let the update script/installer check your configuration and\n   update your config files and database schema as suggested by the updater.\n7. Make sure 'enable_installer' is set to false again.\n8. See Post-Upgrade Activities section.\n\n\nPost-Upgrade Activities\n-----------------------\n1. Check system requirements in INSTALL file.\n2. If you're using build-in addressbook, run indexing script /bin/indexcontacts.sh.\n3. When upgrading from version older than 0.6-beta you should make sure\n   your folder settings contain namespace prefix. For example Courier users\n   should add INBOX. prefix to folder names in main configuration file.\n4. When upgrading from version older than 1.4.0 make sure old files\n   in configured temp_dir are removed. Since this version we use constant filename\n   prefix and do not remove files not starting with \"RCMTEMP\".\n\n\nSQLite database upgrade\n-----------------------\n\nVersions older than 0.9 were supporting SQLite v2 only. Newer versions require\ndatabase in v3 format. The best what you can do is to convert database file\nto the new format using command line tools:\n\nsqlite OLD.DB .dump | sqlite3 NEW.DB\n\n\nOther tools\n-----------\nIn case you need to only update the database schema you can use updatedb.sh script.\nFor example, to update the Roundcube core database run:\n\n  ./bin/updatedb.sh --package=roundcube --dir=SQL\n"
