All described in detail below.\n\n- [Replicate macOS setup](#clean-install--replicate-my-macos-fully)\n- [macOS Apps](#macos-apps)\n- [macOS CLIs](#macos-clis)\n- [macOS Config](#macos-config)\n- [iOS Apps](#ios-apps)\n- [iOS Widgets](#ios-widgets)\n- [iOS Shortcuts](#ios-shortcuts)\n- [iOS Control Center](#ios-control-center)\n- [Discuss macOS/iOS](#discuss-macosios)\n- [Contribute](#contribute)\n\n## Replicate macOS setup\n\n[This](https://learnany.notion.site/Mac-clean-setup-ee58edc4a991483491333e9e3fc20292) lists all settings I use on macOS.\n\nSee [.flox](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/.flox) repo as it lists my global env setup for all executables/daemons I run.\n\nThere is currently no automated way to replicate below setup so you would have to manually download apps, symlink configs etc.\n\n## macOS Apps\n\n[This](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/161e9a719b22c23af10a6eeeb2d08040) shows all apps I have in my `/Applications`. Below is description of apps I do use:\n\n- [Karabiner](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/karabiner/) is core tool I use to remap my keyboard. It's the tool on which my entire mac workflow is built. All keys on my keyboard are dual purpose keys. Press once, it enters the key, hold together with another key and do custom action. I have 100's of these custom actions all within 1 second of activation for me. i.e. `a+w` is `control+w` or `w+k` opens Safari. See [karabiner/karabiner.edn](karabiner/karabiner.edn) for config.\n- [Alfred](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/alfred) / [Raycast](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/raycast) for everything search related.\n- [Keyboard Maestro](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/) for all automation needs that are not search related. Both Alfred/Raycast and KM are activated from Karabiner directly. I share all my KM macros [here](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros). One example of KM macro is [using AppleScript](https://www.macobserver.com/tips/quick-tip/change-light-dark-mode-applescript-app/) to switch [between light/dark macOS appearances](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/status/1311336647338983432). As appearances are switched, the themes get updated accordingly on most apps.\n- [BetterTouchTool](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/bettertouchtool) for custom trackpad gestures. Specifically love three finger swipe left/right to move between tabs in [Safari](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/web/browsers/safari). Three finger swipe up to create new tab. Three down to close. Four finger swipe global swipe to show Safari. Four to right to open [Cursor](https://cursor.sh). Four left to open [Warp](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/shell/warp).\n- [Fantastical](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/fantastical) to manage my calendar and events.\n- [CleanShot](https://getcleanshot.com) for quick editing of screenshots/screencasts.\n- [Transmission](https://www.transmissionbt.com/) for downloading [torrents](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/networking/peer-to-peer/bittorrent).\n- [1Password](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/1password) to keep all passwords and secret info. I prefer to use Passkeys or Single Sign On via GitHub/Google.\n- [Cursor](https://www.cursor.sh/) as my main code editor. Use many [VSCode extensions](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/text-editors/vs-code/vs-code-extensions) with it. Keep my UI minimal and useful.\n- [Sublime Merge](https://www.sublimemerge.com) as visual Git client. It gives nice overview of files changed, what branches exist and more. I have custom actions bound to go through Git tasks fast.\n- [Warp](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/shell/warp) as primary terminal together with [Fish Shell](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/unix/shell/fish). I also use [Ghostty](https://mitchellh.com/ghostty) as side terminal for background servers and things.\n- [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) to search APIs fast.\n- [Xcode Beta](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/macOS/apps/xcode/) to write swift code.\n- [Telegram](https://wiki.nikiv.dev/tools/telegram) as my main messenger.
