For more\ndetails see https://packages.cisofy.com to install and upgrade Lynis.\n\n\nUpgrade tips\n============\n\nDefault profile and custom profiles:\nSettings of multiple profiles can now be merged. Instead of making changes to\ndefault.prf, copy your changes to custom.prf. Use 'lynis show profiles' to show\nany detected profiles. Only include your changes in custom.prf, to keep the\nconfiguration clean and tidy. They will then overwrite the defaults. Use\n'lynis show settings' to see if they are applied.\n\nCheck your cron jobs:\nWhen using --quiet, the output will be really quiet now. Use --show-warnings-only\nif you still want to see the warnings. Lynis will now exit with error 0, even\nwhen warnings have been found. Use option error-on-warnings=yes (custom.prf) to\nexit with code 78 when it has any warnings.\n\n\nDetails\n=======\n\nAnsible\n-------\nNew Ansible examples for deployment: https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis-ansible\n\n\nDatabases\n---------\nLynis will check also for DB2 instances and report the status.\n\n\nDeveloper Mode\n--------------\nWith this release the developer mode is introduced. It can be activated with the\n--developer option, or developer-mode=yes in profile. In development mode, some\ndetails are displayed on screen, to help testing of existing or new tests.\n\nTo get easy access, a new profile has been added (developer.prf).\n\nExamples:\nlynis audit system --profile developer.prf\nlynis audit system --developer\n\nA new software development kit (SDK) for Lynis is available on GitHub. This will\nhelp contributors and developers to test software quality, including linting and\nrunning unit tests. The devkit also supports building DEB and RPM files for easy\ndeployment. The repository can be found on https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis-sdk\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\nTemplate files have been updated to provide better examples on how to create\ncustom tests and plugins.\n\nTo simplify the usage of Lynis, a new helper utility has been added: show.\nThis helper will show help, or values (e.g. version, plugin directories, etc).\nSome examples include: lynis show options, lynis show commands, lynis show\nversion, etc. See lynis show for all available details.\n\n\nFile Systems\n------------\nThe XFS file system detection has been added. Mount points /dev/shm and /var/tmp\nare now checked for their options. Comparison of the mount options has been\nimproved. A new test has been added to check if /var/tmp has been bound to /tmp.\n\n\nLanguage Support\n----------------\nLynis now supports language translations, with the language profile option.\nInitial languages: Dutch (nl), English (en), French (fr).\n\nYou can help by translating the language files in the db directory.\n\n\nMac OS X Improvements\n---------------------\nPackage manager Brew has been added\n\n\nnginx\n-----\nShow suggestion when weak protocol is used, like SSLv2 or SSLv3. The protocols\nare now also parsed and stored as details in the report file.\n\n\nPackages\n--------\nSystems running CentOS, Debian, openSUSE, RHEL, Ubuntu and others, may now use\nour own software repository: https://packages.cisofy.com\n\nPerformance\n-----------\nSeveral performance improvements have been implemented. This includes rewriting\ntests to invoke less commands and enhanced hardware detection at the beginning.\n\n\nPlugins\n-------\nYou can set the plugin directory now also via a profile. First match wins.\nPriority: 1) argument, 2) profile, 3) default\n\n--plugindir is now an alias for --plugin-dir\n\n\nProfiles\n--------\nLynis now support multiple profiles. By using a file 'custom.prf', it allows to\ninherit values first from default.prf, then merge it with custom.prf.\n\nSeveral tests have been altered to support multiple profiles.\n\nNew profile options:\n  quick=yes|no (similar to --quick)\n  developer (see Developer section)\n  check-value\n\n\nRemote scanning\n---------------\nAlthough Lynis is a aimed on running on local hosts, there is still an ongoing\ndemand for running remote scans. With 'lynis audit system remote' tips are now\nprovides to perform such a scan via SSH.\n\n\nSoftware\n--------\nZypper calls are now marked with a non-interactive flag to prevent it waiting for\nany interactive input.\n\n\nSolaris\n-------\nImprove execution for Solaris systems.\n\n\nSSH\n---\nThe configuration of SSH is now parsed from the SSH daemon directly. This enables\nhandling with new defaults more easily, as OpenSSH sometimes introduces new keys,\nor change their default value between versions.\n\n\nSystemd\n-------\nAdded support for detecting systemd and reporting it as a service manager. The\nsystemd plugin has been released as a community plugin.\n\n\nUploads\n-------\nSolved a bug which added the proxy configuration twice.\n\nProfile options: upload-tool and upload-tool-arguments\n\n\nGeneral Improvements\n--------------------\nThe screen output has been improved, to show more meaningful things when some\nparameters are missing. Several old variables and lines have been cleaned up.\n\nThe Display function now allows the --debug flag. This helps in showing some\nlines on screen, which would normally be hidden (e.g. items not found or\nmatched).\n\nLogging has been improved in different areas, like cleaning up and add more\nrelevant messages where needed.\n\nThe interface colors have been changed, to make it more obvious how the software\ncan be used. Also the wait line between categories have been altered, to properly\ndisplay on systems with a white background.\n\nWhen no auditor name has been specified, it will say that instead of unknown.\n\nFunctions file has been cleaned up, including adding developer debug information\nwhen old functions are still be used. Later on these functions will be deleted,\nand therefore placed at the bottom.\n\n\nProgram Options\n---------------\n* --developer           - Enable developer mode\n* --verbose             - Show more details on screen, reduce in normal mode\n* --show-warnings-only  - Only show warnings on screen\n* --skip-plugins        - Disable running any plugins (alias: --no-plugins)\n* --quiet               - Changed: become really quiet\n* --config              - Removed: use 'lynis show profiles' instead\n\n\nFunctions\n---------\n* AddSetting            - New function to store settings (lynis show settings)\n* ContainsString        - New function to search for a string in another one\n* Display               - Added --debug, showing details on screen in debug mode\n                        - Reset indentation for lines which are too long\n* DisplayToolTip        - New function to display tooltips\n* IsDebug               - Check for usage of --debug\n* IsDeveloperMode       - Status for development and debugging (--developer)\n* IsDeveloperVersion    - Check if release is still under development\n* IsRunning             - Added return state\n* IsVerbose             - Check for usage of --verbose\n* IsOwnedByRoot         - Check ownership of files and directories\n* IsWorldWritable       - Improved test with additional details\n* PortIsListening       - Check if a service it listening to a specified port\n* SkipAtomicTest        - Allow smaller tests to be skipped (e.g. SSH-7408)\n\n\nTests\n-----\n* AUTH-9234 - Test for minimal UID in /etc/login.defs when available\n* AUTH-9254 - Allow allow root to use this test, due to permissions\n* AUTH-9262 - Restructure of test, support for pwquality PAM\n* AUTH-9288 - Only check for accounts which have a maximum password age set\n* AUTH-9308 - Check for systemd targets\n* BANN-7119 - /etc/motd test disabled\n* BANN-7122 - /motd content test disabled\n* BOOT-5122 - Extended GRUB password check\n* BOOT-5184 - Improve file permissions check for CentOS 7 machines\n* DBS-1860  - Check for status of DB2\n* CRYP-7902 - Improved logging\n* FILE-6354 - Restrict searching in /tmp to mount point only\n* FILE-6372 - Properly checking for /etc/fstab now, ignore comments\n* FILE-6374 - Added /dev/shm and /var/tmp\n* FILE-6374 - New test for /var/tmp\n* FILE-6430 - New test for detecting specific filesystems\n* FILE-7524 - Support for multiple profiles\n* HTTP-6632 - Fix for proper detection of Apache modules\n* HTTP-6642 - Test disabled\n* HTTP-6710 - Trigger suggestion when weak protocols SSLv2/SSLv3 are used\n* KRNL-5788 - Support for kernel with grsecurity patches (linux-image-grsec)\n* KRNL-5820 - Improved logging for test\n* KRNL-6000 - Allow multiple profiles to be used, store more details\n* LOGG-2190 - Improvements for Fail2Ban and cron-related files\n* NETW-3014 - Support for multiple profiles\n* PKGS-7303 - Added Brew package manager\n* PKGS-7354 - Test for DNF repoquery plugin before using it\n* PKGS-7381 - Check for vuln.xml file\n* PRNT-2306 - Check if files are readable before parsing them\n* PROC-3612 - Removed wchan output to prevent grsecurity issues\n* SCHD-7702 - Test for running cron daemon\n* SCHD-7704 - Test ownership of cronjob files\n* SSH-7408  - Show weak configurations of SSH on screen as a suggestion\n* TOOL-5102 - Test for Fail2ban tooling\n* TOOL-5190 - Test for intrusion detection or prevention system\n\n\nPlugins\n-------\n* PLGN-1602 - Marked as root-only\n* PLGN-2612 - Marked as root-only\n* PLGN-2804 - Marked as root-only\n* PLGN-3202 - Marked as root-only\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLynis 2.2.0 (2016-03-18)\n\nWe are proud to present this new release of Lynis. It is a major upgrade, and the\nresult of many months of work. This version includes new features and tests, and\nmany small enhancements. We encourage all to test and upgrade to this latest\nrelease.\n\n* Highlights\n------------\nThe biggest change in this release is the optimization of several functions. It\nallows for better detection, and dealing with the quirks, of every single\noperating system. Some functions were fortified to handle unexpected results\nbetter, like missing a particular binary, or not returning the hostname.\n\nThis release also enables tests to be shorter, by adding new functions. Some\nfunctions were renamed or slightly changed, to provide more value to the tooling.\nAnother big change in this release is a wide set of optimizations and quality\ntesting. Outdated pieces were removed, or rewritten, to support features seen in\nnewer distributions.\n\nIn the area of compliance, adjustments have been made to start supporting more\nin-depth testing for this. Ideal for companies who have a particular compliance\nneed, or want to test and enforce the system hardening levels of their systems.\n\nLast but not least, many small changes make this software easier to use. On\nour website we added new guides to provide help and support.\n\nWe like to thank our contributors, in particular Kamil Boratyński, Steve Bosek,\nand Eric Light. Their contributions helped us greatly shaping this release.\n\n\nBelow are the changes per category:\n\n* Automation tools\n------------------\nDetection for CFEngine has been improved. Also additional logging and reporting\nof automation tools.\n\n* Authentication\n----------------\nDepending on the operating system, Lynis now tries to determine if failed logins\nare properly logged. This includes checking for /etc/login.defs file [AUTH-9408].\nMerged previous password check for Solaris into test AUTH-9228. User ids on AIX\nwill be gathered and added to the report [AUTH-9234].\n\nNew plugin is introduced to analyze PAM settings. It including items like:\n\n- Two-factor authentication methods\n- Minimum password length, password strength and protection status against brute\n  force cracking\n- Password history\n\nReport option: auth_failed_logins_logged\n\n* Boot\n------\nAdded detection for Mac OSX boot loader. Initial support to test UEFI settings,\nincluding Secure Boot option. Options boot_uefi_booted and\nboot_uefi_booted_secure added to report file\n\n* Compliance\n------------\nThis release prepares for upcoming extensions to assist with compliance testing.\nThe profile has a new option, which can be used to define what standards should\nbe tested for, if any test is available. The related option is:\ncompliance_standards\n\nRight now these standards can be selected:\n- CIS benchmarks\n- HIPAA\n- ISO27001/ISO27002\n- PCI DSS\n\nNote that additional tests will be implemented in future releases and then tagged\nto these particular standards.\n\n* DNS and Name services\n-----------------------\nSupport added for Unbound DNS caching tool [NAME-4034], including a configuration\ncheck [NAME-4036].\n\nRecord if a name caching utility is being used like nscd or Unbound. Also logging\nto report as field name_cache_used\n\n* Firewalls\n-----------\nTest for IPFW firewall on FreeBSD has been improved: status of pflogd will no\nlonger be displayed, when pf is not available.\n\nNew test FIRE-4532 introduced for detection of the Mac OS X application firewall.\nAlso, the status of application firewalls is audited now.\n\nFIRE-4508 is another new test, which tests chains of iptables and their default\npolicy (ACCEPT or DROP). This release also supports the upcoming nftables\ntechnology with new test FIRE-4536. It is expected that it will replace iptables\nlater on, so this test will perform a status check. Additional FIRE-4548 will\nperform a version detection of the userland utility nft and determine if there\nare any rules configured.\n\nRenamed FIRE-4511 to FIRE-4502.\n\n* File Integrity Monitoring\n---------------------------\nTest added to include osqueryd as a supported tool.\n\n* Hardware\n----------\nDetection of firewire is enhanced (both ohci and core detected).\n\n* Logging\n---------\nExtended the test syslog-ng logging to remote systems. The log Lynis itself\nproduces is also enhanced, to be more detailed for several tests.\n\n* Malware\n---------\nESET and LMD (Linux Malware Detect) have been added. Discovered malware scanners\nare also logged to the report.\n\n* Mount points\n--------------\nFILE-6374 is expanded to test for multiple common mount points and define best\npractice mount flags.\n\n* Networking\n------------\nBest practices for IPv6 configuration on Linux are now collected. Also network\ninterface names from most operating systems.\n\n* Operating systems\n-------------------\nImproved support for Debian 8 systems, and displaying Gentoo for Gentoo-based\nsystems. Detection of VMware release has been added. Boot loader exception is not\nlonger displayed when only a subset of tests is performed. FreeBSD systems can\nnow use service command to gather information about enabled services.\n\nSeveral paths have been added to allow better detection on systems running\nFreeBSD and others.\n\n* Passwords\n-----------\nAUTH-9286 change has been extended to both capture minimum and password age.\n\n* Proxy support\n---------------\nA proxy can now be specified in the profile, to allow uploads via a HTTP or SOCKS\nproxy.\n\n* Service Managers\n------------------\nSystemV init is now detected.\n\n* Software and Packages\n-----------------------\nNow information will be logged when vulnerable software packages were found.\nSupport for DNF (Dandified YUM) for Fedora systems has been added. This is done\nin several tests: PKGS-7350 (installed packages), PKGS-7352 (security notices),\nPKGS-7354 (integrity tests).\n\n* SSH\n-----\nMultiple configuration tests of SSH are now merged into SSH-7408. This enables\neasier testing later on and reduces repetition.\n\n* Virtual machines and Containers\n---------------------------------\nDetection of virtual machines has been extended in several ways. Now VMware tools\n(vmtoolsd) are detected and machine state is improved with tools like Puppet\nFacter, dmidecode, and lscpu. Properly detect Docker on CoreOS systems, where it\nbefore gave error as it found directory /usr/libexec/docker. Check file\npermissions for Docker files, like the socket file [CONT-8108].\n\n* Individual tests\n------------------\n[AUTH-9204] Exclude NIS entries to avoid false positives\n[AUTH-9230] Removed test as it was merged into AUTH-9228\n[AUTH-9234] Support for AIX added\n[AUTH-9288] Test for expired passwords\n[AUTH-9328] Show correct message when no umask is found in /etc/profile.

It includes several new features, to\nsimplify or improve auditing on Unix based systems, including BSD, Linux,\nMac OS and more traditional systems like AIX, HPUX and Solaris.\n\nNew features and many improvements are the reason for the bump to a major\nrelease, also a beginning of a new era. Many tools to audit or harden systems\nhave being released, yet none have been maintained over a long period of time.\n\nLynis Support and Feedback\n--------------------------\nThis software is supported and under development by CISOfy. By providing a\ndual license, this software is kept up-to-date and enhanced. Both customers\nand the community, benefit from this licensing. This release is available\nthanks to your input and feedback.\n\nLynis Helpers\n-------------\nNew in this release is the support for helpers. Small utilities which enhance\nLynis by providing a single goal. The first helper available is to audit\nDocker build files.\n\nLynis Improved OS support\n-------------------------\nMany changes have been implemented to better support Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD\nDragonBSD and OpenBSD in particular. Upcoming releases will include smaller\n\"improvement rounds\" for other systems as well.\n\nLynis New technologies\n----------------------\nMore utilities and technologies are supported now. Technologies and tools\nlike systemd, Docker, nftables.\n\nLynis Lynis Enterprise\n----------------------\nAs this code is shared, customers have an additional option to define to\nwhat server they want to upload the audit results. Also, commercial plugins\nhave been bundled.\n\nLynis New parameters\n--------------------\nSeveral new options have been added:\n* --dump-options (see all options)\n* --report-file (define a different location for the report file)\n\nLynis General\n-------------\nDocumentation on the website has been extended: https://cisofy.com/support/\nThe man page, Lynis binary and several tests have improved texts.\n\nThis release is exceptional in that it includes many changes.

Also useful are the README file and the log file\n     (default: /var/log/lynis.log). Or check out the documentation on the\n     website: https://cisofy.com/support/\n\n  Q: I can't find any configuration file for Lynis, where is it?\n  A: Lynis uses profiles. A profile is similar to a configuration file and\n     determines how a security scan should be performed. Profiles are usually\n     stored in /etc/lynis or can be found using 'lynis show profiles'.\n\n  Q: My version is outdated, what can I do to upgrade?\n     Check out the upgrade guide: https://cisofy.com/documentation/lynis/upgrading/\n\n  Q: Why is there no port/package for my operating system?\n  A: Because there is no maintainer for it yet. If you have the time to keep\n     the port/package current for your preferred operating system, let us know.\n\n  Q: What to do with the report files?\n  A: The output could be used for monitoring (baseline checks). For users of the\n     Lynis Enterprise Suite, they will be used to upload data.\n\n\n\n[+] Bugs or issues\n-------------------------------\n  Q: Where can I report an issue or bug?\n  A: GitHub, or use the developer e-mail address lynis-dev@cisofy.com\n\n\n\n[+] Usage problems\n-------------------------------\n  Q: Lynis hangs while testing the group files (grpck)\n  A: Run the grpck command manually. It will most likely need user input, to\n     repair incorrect groups.\n\n  Q: Lynis doesn't display all messages on a white background\n  A: White text is used for general (and important) messages. Most terminals\n     have a dark background, so it gives extra attention to the message. However\n     if you have a white background (for example Mac OS X), you can run Lynis\n     with --no-colors to strip colors or --reverse-colors to reverse the color\n     scheme. Another option is to change your terminal colors within Mac OS.\n\n  Q: Some tests take very long to finish, what to do?\n  A: Use a second console (or connection) and check the output of ps/lsof etc,\n     to see the status of the active subroutine. If a specific test hangs for a\n     very long time, try to kill that specific process (ie grpck) and see if\n     Lynis continues. Afterwards, run the command manually to see the cause.\n     Check the log file for additional information. Usually the last few lines\n     will indicate what test is stuck.\n\n  Q: When running Lynis, it shows me the usage help even while using correct\n     parameters, why?\n  A: This can happen with alternative shells. Try using a different shell to\n     invoke Lynis (example: bash lynis audit system).\n\n  Q: One or more tests are giving incorrect output. How to solve that?\n  A: Check the log file. If that also has incorrect data, let us know via GitHub\n     or use the developer e-mail address.\n\n  Q: The program takes long to complete and also uses too much resources. Can it\n     be tuned?\n  A: The time it takes to complete depends on the amount of tests to run.\n     However the resources it take can be slightly lowered by increasing the\n     pause_between_tests profile option. Keep in mind this increases the total\n     length of the scan to complete.\n\n\n\n[+] Network related issues\n-------------------------------\n\n  Q: Lynis reports promiscuous interfaces, but they are needed for normal operation,\n     how can I hide this warning?\n  A: Whitelist the interface in the profile file (if_promisc).\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n Lynis - Copyright 2007-2021, Michael Boelen, CISOfy - https://cisofy.com\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.

See CONTRIBUTING.md\n  for more information about how to submit them.\n\n\n[+] Support\n-------------------------------\n\n  Lynis is tested on most common operating systems. The documentation (README,\n  FAQ) and the debugging information (/var/log/lynis.log), should cover most\n  questions and problems. Bugs can be reported via GitHub, or sending an e-mail\n  to the lynis-dev address above.\n\n  Commercial features and support is available via CISOfy. This includes support\n  for compliance testing, a web-based interface, reporting, and more.\n  \n  For more information see https://cisofy.com/lynis-enterprise/ or use the\n  contact details at https://cisofy.com/contact/\n\n\n\n[+] Upgrade to Lynis Enterprise\n-------------------------------\n\n  Individuals and companies which use this software for more than 10 systems, should\n  think about the value of this tool in their job. To support ongoing development on\n  this tool we have a commercial version available. Lynis Enterprise Suite uses\n  Lynis to audit systems, but also provides malware scanning, intrusion detection\n  and has additional guidance. For all features, please see our website:\n  https://cisofy.com/lynis-enterprise/\n\n\n\n[+] Thanks\n-------------------------------\n\n  Thanks to the community for using and supporting open source software.\n  Many comments, bugs/patches and questions are the key to success and ongoing\n  motivation in developing tools like this.\n\n\n\n================================================================================\n Lynis - Copyright 2007-2016, Michael Boelen and CISOfy - https://cisofy.com\n"

It performs an **in-depth security scan** and runs on the system itself. The primary goal is to test security defenses and **provide tips for further system hardening**. It will also scan for general system information, vulnerable software packages, and possible configuration issues. Lynis was commonly used by system administrators and auditors to assess the security defenses of their systems. Besides the \"blue team,\" nowadays penetration testers also have Lynis in their toolkit.\n\nWe believe software should be **simple**, **updated on a regular basis**, and **open**. You should be able to trust, understand, and have the option to change the software. Many agree with us, as the software is being used by thousands every day to protect their systems.\n\n## Goals\n\nThe main goals are:\n- Automated security auditing\n- Compliance testing (e.g. ISO27001, PCI-DSS, HIPAA)\n- Vulnerability detection\n\nThe software (also) assists with:\n- Configuration and asset management\n- Software patch management\n- System hardening\n- Penetration testing (privilege escalation)\n- Intrusion detection\n\n### Audience\n\nTypical users of the software:\n- System administrators\n- Auditors\n- Security officers\n- Penetration testers\n- Security professionals\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are multiple options available to install Lynis.\n\n### Software Package\n\nFor systems running Linux, BSD, and macOS, there is typically a package available. This is the preferred method of obtaining Lynis, as it is quick to install and easy to update. The Lynis project itself also provides [packages](https://packages.cisofy.com/) in RPM or DEB format suitable for systems systems running:\n`CentOS`, `Debian`, `Fedora`, `OEL`, `openSUSE`, `RHEL`, `Ubuntu`, and others.\n\nSome distributions may also have Lynis in their software repository: [![Repology](https://repology.org/badge/tiny-repos/lynis.svg)](https://repology.org/project/lynis/versions)\n\nNote: Some distributions don't provide an up-to-date version. In that case it is better to use the CISOfy software repository, download the tarball from the website, or download the latest GitHub release.\n\n### Git\n\nThe very latest developments can be obtained via git.\n\n1. Clone or download the project files (**no compilation nor installation** is required) ;\n\n        git clone https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis\n\n2. Execute:\n\n        cd lynis && ./lynis audit system\n\nIf you want to run the software as `root` (or sudo), we suggest changing the ownership of the files. Use `chown -R 0:0` to recursively alter the owner and group and set it to user ID `0` (`root`). Otherwise Lynis will warn you about the file permissions. After all, you are executing files owned by a non-privileged user.\n\n\n### Enterprise Version\n\nThis software component is also part of an enterprise solution. Same quality, yet with more functionality.\n\nFocus areas include compliance (`PCI DSS`, `HIPAA`, `ISO27001`, and others). The Enterprise version comes with:\n* a web interface;\n* dashboard and reporting;\n* hardening snippets;\n* improvement plan (based on risk);\n* commercial support.\n\n## Documentation\nFull documentation: https://cisofy.com/documentation/lynis/.\n\n## Customization\nIf you want to create your own tests, have a look at the [Lynis software development kit](https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis-sdk).\n\n## Security\nWe participate in the [CII best practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/projects/96) badge program of the Linux Foundation.\n\n## Media and Awards\nLynis is collecting some awards along the way and we are proud of that.\n\n* 2016\n  * [Best of Open Source Software Awards 2016](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3121251/open-source-tools/bossie-awards-2016-the-best-open-source-networking-and-security-software.html#slide13).\n  * Article by TechRepublic, considering Lynis a \"must-have\" tool: [How to quickly audit a Linux system from the command line](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-quickly-audit-a-linux-system-from-the-command-line/)\n  * [![ToolsWatch Best Tools (top 10)](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/toptools/2016.svg)](https://www.toolswatch.org/2017/02/2016-top-security-tools-as-voted-by-toolswatch-org-readers/)\n\n* 2015\n  * [![ToolsWatch Best Tools (second place)](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/toptools/2015.svg)](https://www.toolswatch.org/2016/02/2015-top-security-tools-as-voted-by-toolswatch-org-readers/)\n  * [Best of Open Source Software Awards 2015](http://www.idgenterprise.com/news/press-release/infoworld-announces-the-2015-best-of-open-source-software-awards/) ([mirror](https://web.archive.org/web/20210313082124/https://www.idg.com/news/infoworld-announces-the-2015-best-of-open-source-software-awards/)).\n\n* 2014\n  * [![ToolsWatch Best Tools (third place)](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/toptools/2014.svg)](https://www.toolswatch.org/2015/01/2014-top-security-tools-as-voted-by-toolswatch-org-readers/)\n\n* 2013\n  * [![ToolsWatch Best Tools (sixth place)](https://www.toolswatch.org/badges/toptools/2013.svg)](https://www.toolswatch.org/2013/12/2013-top-security-tools-as-voted-by-toolswatch-org-readers/)\n\n## Contribute\n\n> We love contributors.\n\nDo you have something to share?

The tool checks the system and the software configuration, to see if\nthere is any room for improvement the security defenses. All details are stored\nin a log file. Findings and other discovered data is stored in a report file.\nThis can be used to compare differences between audits. \\fBLynis\\fP can run\ninteractively or as a cronjob. Root permissions (e.g. sudo) are not required,\nhowever provide more details during the audit.\n.PP\nThe following system areas may be checked:\n.IP\n\\- Boot loader files\n.IP\n\\- Configuration files\n.IP\n\\- Software packages\n.IP\n\\- Directories and files related to logging and auditing\n.IP\n\n.SH \"FIRST TIME USAGE\"\nWhen running \\fBLynis\\fP for the first time, run: lynis audit system\n\n.SH \"COMMANDS\"\n.IP \"audit \\<type\\>\"\nPerform an audit of the selected type\n.IP \"upload-only\"\nUpload the available report data file\n\nSee HELPERS section for more commands.\n\n.SH \"SCAN TYPES\"\n\n.IP \"audit system\"\nPerforms a system audit, which is the most common audit.\n.IP \"audit system remote \\<host\\>\"\nProvide commands to do a remote scan.\n.PP\nFor more scan modes, see the helper utilities.\n\n.SH \"OPTIONS\"\n\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-auditor <name>\nDefine the name of the auditor/pentester. When a full name is used, add double\nquotes, like \"Your Name\".\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-cronjob\nPerform automatic scan with cron safe options (no colors, no questions, no\nbreaks).\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-debug\nDisplay debug information to screen for troubleshooting purposes.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-developer\nDisplay detailed information useful for developers when creating tests.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-forensics\nPerform the audit on a running or mounted system (see \\-\\-rootdir)\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-help\nShow available commands and most-used options.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-logfile </path/to/logfile>\nDefines location and name of log file, instead of default /var/log/lynis.log.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-man\nShow the man page. Useful for systems that do not have the man page installed.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-no\\-colors\nDisable colored output.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-no\\-log\nRedirect all logging information to /dev/null, prevents sensitive information to\nbe written to disk.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-no\\-plugins\nDo not run any of the enabled plugins.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-pentest\nRun a non-privileged scan, usually used for penetration testing. Some of the\ntests will be skipped if they require root permissions.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-plugin\\-dir </path/to/plugins>\nDefine location where plugins can be found.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-profile <file>\nProvide alternative profile to perform the scan.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-quick (\\-Q)\nDo a quick scan (default: don't wait for user input).\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-quiet (\\-q)\nRun quietly and do not show anything to the screen. Will also enable quick mode.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-report\\-file <file>\nProvide an alternative name for report file.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-reverse\\-colors\nOptimize screen output for light backgrounds.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-tests TEST-IDs\nOnly run the specific test(s). When using multiple tests, add quotes around the\nline.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-tests\\-from\\-category \"<category>\"\nTests are only performed if they belong to the defined category. Use the command\n\\ 'show categories' to determine all valid options.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-tests\\-from\\-group \"<group>\"\nSimilar to \\-\\-tests\\-from\\-category. Only perform tests from a particular group.\nUse 'show groups' to determine valid options.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-use-cwd\nRun from the current working directory.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-upload\nUpload data to Lynis Enterprise server (profile option: upload=yes).\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-verbose\nShow more details on screen, such as components that could not found. These\ndetails are hidden by default.\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-wait\nWait for user to continue. This adds a break after each section (opposed of\n\\-\\-quick).\n.TP\n.B \\-\\-warnings\\-only\nRun quietly, except show warnings.\n.RE\n.PP\n.RS\nMultiple parameters are allowed, though some parameters can only be used together\nwith others. When running Lynis without any parameters, help will be shown and\nthe program will exit.\n.RE\n.PP\n.SH \"HELPERS\"\nLynis has special helpers to do certain tasks. This way the framework of Lynis is\nused, while at the same time storing most of the functionality in a separated\nfile. This speeds up execution and keeps the code clean.\n\n.IP \"audit\"\nRun audit on the system or on other targets\n.IP \"configure \\<parameter\\>\"\nChange or add settings to the config file\n.IP \"generate \\<parameter\\>\"\nGenerate specific details such as host IDs\n.IP \"show \\<parameter\\>\"\nShow information, such as configuration and paths\n.IP \"update \\<parameter\\>\"\nPerform activities regarding updating\n.PP\nTo use a helper, run 'lynis' followed by the helper name.\n\n.SH \"EXIT CODES\"\nLynis uses exit codes to signal any invoking script. Currently the following codes are used:\n.IP 0\nProgram exited normally\n.IP 1\nFatal error\n.IP 64\nAn unknown parameter is used, or incomplete\n.IP 65\nIncorrect data encountered\n.IP 66\nCan't open file or directory\n.IP 78\nLynis found 1 or more warnings or configurations errors (with error-on-warnings=yes)\n\n.SH \"BUGS\"\nBugs can be reported via GitHub at https://github.com/CISOfy/lynis or via support@cisofy.com\n\n.SH \"DOCUMENTATION\"\nSupporting documentation can be found via https://cisofy.com/support/\n\n.SH \"LICENSING\"\nLynis is licensed as GPLv3. The tool was created by Michael Boelen in 2007. Since 2013 its development has been taken over by CISOfy under the management of Michael Boelen. Plugins may have a different license.\n\n.SH \"CONTACT INFORMATION\"\nSupport requests and project related questions can be addressed via e-mail: lynis-dev@cisofy.com.\n"
