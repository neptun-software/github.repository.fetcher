          "content": "# Contributing\n\nFirst and foremost, thanks for the help, I appreciate all of the contributions, and the awesome-zsh-plugins list wouldn't be nearly as complete without them. You may add to the list by submitting a pull request or adding a link in an issue.\n\nI want to be clear that real, useful PRs are always welcome. _But_ if you came here just to make a useless PR because you watched that idiot CodeWithHarry's youtube video, _I will report it to DigitalOcean_, you will be disqualified from Hacktoberfest and you won't get the free stuff you're trying for._\n\n## Entry Guidelines\n\n### General\n\n- Please make sure all new framework, plugin, themes or completions entries have a license file. Some users are particular about the code they use and want to be sure they are compliant with licensing, so please make sure it's easy for them to determine what the license is. I am aware that there are existing entries without licenses, they were added before I instituted the license policy.\n\n- Please make sure new entries have a readme. While obviously it's good to read the source code for things we're adding to our environment, it's even better if users can get an overall idea of what a plugin does so they know if it is even potentially useful to them first.\n\n- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional.\n\n- The list is split into sections for frameworks, plugins, themes and completions, please add your entries to the appropriate section(s). If an entry is a plugin that provides both plugin functionality and tab completions, add it to the plugins section. If an entry is a plugin that provides both plugin functionality and a theme, please add it to the theme section. The completions section is meant for projects that only provide extra tab completions.\n\n- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line, with capitalization consistent with the other entries in the section.\n\n- Each entry should be a single line that ends in a period. This makes keeping the sections sorted easier.\n\n- Plugin, theme and completions entries _must_ be a single line and be added in alphabetical order in their respective sections of the list. We let GitHub's markdown formatter handle adding any required line breaks rather than embedding line breaks in the entries ourselves, this also allows us to work correctly with any browser window width.\n\n- For consistency, please use all caps for ZSH in all entry descriptions.\n\n- Each entry should be limited to one link, and that link should be the first part of the line. It is ok to submit more than one entry in a PR.\n\n- Please make sure all framework, plugin, themes or completions list entries are sorted _alphabetically_.\n- The link should be named the name of the package or project. Please remove any leading or trailing `zsh-plugin`, `zsh-theme` from the visible portion of the link.\n\n- Your PR should pass the Github Action checks. If the checks show an error that you didn't add (a previous plugin entry has gone 404, for example) you don't _have_ to fix those errors, though I'll certainly appreciate the help if you do, or if you create an issue documenting the problem so I can fix it.\n\n### Themes\n\n- If you're submitting a theme, please make sure that the theme repo has a screen shot so that list users can tell what it looks like before installing it.\n\n- It is fine to have multiple new entries in a single PR. Just make sure they all have readmes and licenses, and screenshots for theme entries.\n\n- No need to squash commits. It is fine to have multiple commits in a PR.\n\n## To remove an entry\n\nOpen an issue to discuss why the entry should be removed, and optionally create a PR.\n\nEntries that have gone 404 do not require an issue to remove - just make a PR.\n"

It uses [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) to manage bundles and [oh-my-zsh](ohmyz.sh). Can load bundles conditionally. By default it includes the powerlevel9k theme, autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting and [fzf-widgets](https://github.com/ytet5uy4/fzf-widgets) and [fzf-marks](https://github.com/urbainvaes/fzf-marks). Fully customizable.\n\n### [ant-zsh](https://github.com/anthraxx/ant-zsh)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/anthraxx/ant-zsh)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/anthraxx/ant-zsh)\n\n**Ant-zsh** is a tiny and lightweight ZSH configuration environment for special customization needs. It includes plugins, themes and a basic convenient setup.\n\n### [antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/getantibody/antibody)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/getantibody/antibody)\n\n**Antibody** is a faster and simpler [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) written in Golang. More details are available at [http://getantibody.github.io/](http://getantibody.github.io/).\n\n### [antidote](https://getantidote.github.io/)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/mattmc3/antidote)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/mattmc3/antidote)\n\n**Antidote** is a ZSH plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about performance.\n\nIt is fast because it can do things concurrently, and generates an ultra-fast static plugin file that you can include in your ZSH config.\n\nIt is written natively in ZSH, is well tested, and picks up where [Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) left off.\n\n[use-omz](https://github.com/getantidote/use-omz) enables easy use of [Oh-My-ZSH](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) with antidote.\n\n### [antigen-hs](https://github.com/Tarrasch/antigen-hs)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Tarrasch/antigen-hs)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Tarrasch/antigen-hs)\n\n**antigen-hs** is a replacement for [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) optimized for a low overhead when starting up a `zsh` session. It will automatically clone plugins for you.\n\n### [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/zsh-users/antigen)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zsh-users/antigen)\n\n**Antigen** is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (ZSH) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to ZSH, what Vundle is to vim. Antigen can load oh-my-zsh themes and plugins and will automatically clone them for you.\n\n### [ax-zsh](https://github.com/alexbarton/ax-zsh)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/alexbarton/ax-zsh)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/alexbarton/ax-zsh)\n\n**Ax-ZSH** is a modular configuration system for ZSH. It provides sane defaults and is extendable by plugins.\n\n**Ax-ZSH** integrates well with [Powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) and other extensions, including plugins compatible with [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).\n\n### [deer](https://github.com/ArtixLabs/deer)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ArtixLabs/deer)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ArtixLabs/deer)\n\nA minimalist ZSH plugin manager.\n\n### [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/dotphiles/dotzsh)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/dotphiles/dotzsh)\n\n**Dotzsh** strives to be platform and version independent. Some functionality may be lost when running under older versions of ZSH, but it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OSes without problems.\n\n### [fresh](https://github.com/freshshell/fresh)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/freshshell/fresh)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/freshshell/fresh)\n\n**fresh** is a tool to source shell configuration (aliases, functions, etc) from others into your own configuration files. We also support files such as ackrc and gitconfig. Think of it as [Bundler](https://bundler.io) for your dot files.\n\n### [gh-source](https://github.com/Yarden-zamir/gh-source)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/Yarden-zamir/gh-source) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Yarden-zamir/gh-source)\n\n\n**gh-source** is a plugin manager for people who don't like plugin managers. It's a simple shell function that downloads and installs plugins from GitHub as part of the sourcing step. It's designed to be used with `zsh`, but it should work with any shell.\n\n### [miniplug](https://sr.ht/~yerinalexey/miniplug)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/yerinalexey/miniplug) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/yerinalexey/miniplug)\n\n**miniplug** is a minimalistic plugin manager for ZSH.\n\n- No crashes or double plugin loading when re-sourcing `.zshrc`\n- Unlike other frameworks, Miniplug does not pollute your `$PATH`\n- Only does the bare minimum for managing plugins\n\n### [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ohmyzsh/oh-my-zsh)\n\n\n**oh-my-zsh** is a community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration. Includes 120+ optional plugins (rails, `git`, macOS, `hub`, `capistrano`, `brew`, `ant`, MacPorts, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community.\n\n### [PMS](https://github.com/JoshuaEstes/pms)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/JoshuaEstes/pms)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/JoshuaEstes/pms)\n\nPMS allows you to manage your shell in a way to that helps decrease setup time and increases your productivity. It has support for themes (change the way your shell looks), plugins (adds functionality to your shell), and dotfile management.\n\nThe PMS framework also allows you to use the same framework in different shells. Use ZSH on your personal laptop, and use `bash` on remote servers. Wanna try `fish`? Go ahead, try out different shells.\n\n### [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/sorin-ionescu/prezto)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/sorin-ionescu/prezto)\n\n**Prezto** enriches the ZSH command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes.

The downside is that you have to refresh the init script manually with `zgenom reset` whenever you update your plugin list in your `.zshrc`.\n\nZgenom can load [oh-my-zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)-compatible and [prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)-compatible plugins and themes, and will automagically `git clone` plugins for you when you add them to your plugin list.\n\n### [zilsh](https://github.com/zilsh/zilsh)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/zilsh/zilsh)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zilsh/zilsh)\n\n**zilsh** is a ZSH config system that aims to appeal more to power-users and follow the simplistic approach of vim-pathogen.\n\n### [zim](https://github.com/zimfw/zimfw)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/zimfw/zimfw)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zimfw/zimfw)\n\n**Zim** is a ZSH configuration framework with blazing speed and modular extensions.\n\n### [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/zdharma-continuum/zinit) ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zdharma-continuum/zinit)\n\n\n**Zinit** is an innovative and probably (because of the Turbo) the fastest plugin manager with support for:\n\n- Turbo mode – 80% faster ZSH startup! for example: instead of 200 ms, it'll be 40 ms\n- Completion management (selectively disable and enable completions)\n- Snippets (↔ regular files downloaded via-URL, e.g.: scripts) and through them Oh My Zsh and Prezto plugins support (→ low overhead)\n- Annexes (↔ Zinit extensions)\n- Reports (from the plugin loads – plugins are no longer black boxes)\n- Plugin unloading (allows e.g.: dynamic theme switching)\n- `bindkey` capturing and remapping\n- packages\n- Clean `fpath` (the array `$fpath` is not being used to add completions and autoload functions, hence it stays concise, not bloated)\n- Services ↔ a single-instance, background plugins\n- Also, in general: all the mechanisms from the ZSH Plugin Standard – Zinit is a reference implementation of the standard.\n\nThe project is very active – currently > 3100 commits.\n\n### [zinit-4](https://github.com/psprint/Zinit-4)\n![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/psprint/Zinit-4)\n ![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/psprint/Zinit-4)\n\nThis is Zinit 4 from the [original author](https://github.com/psprint), who once removed the [Zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit) repository from GitHub.

It adds minimal overhead during shell session startup because it generates a load script only when you change your plugin list, and that load script is sourced during startup instead of being recalculated every time.\n\n### [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)\n\nMost of these plugins can be installed by adding `antigen bundle githubuser/reponame` to your .zshrc file. Antigen will handle cloning the plugin for you automatically the next time you start `zsh`. You can also add the plugin to a running ZSH with `antigen bundle githubuser/reponame` for testing before adding it to your `.zshrc`.\n\n### [dotzsh](https://github.com/dotphiles/dotzsh)\n\n1. Clone new plugins into `.zsh.local/modules`\n2. Load the plugin module in `.zshrc`\n3. Open a new ZSH terminal window or tab\n\n### [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)\n\n1. `cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins`\n2. `git clone repo`\n3. Add the repo to your plugin list\n\n### [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto)\n\n1. Clone the plugin into your prezto modules directory\n2. Add the plugin to your `.zpreztorc` file\n3. Open a new terminal window or tab\n\n### [Zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)\n\nZgen is not being actively maintained. I recommend that you switch to the [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) fork, which is.\n\n### [Zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom)\n\nMost of these plugins can be installed by adding `zgenom load githubuser/reponame` to your `.zshrc` file in the same function you're doing your other `zgenom load` calls in.\n\nZgenom will automatically clone the plugin repositories for you when you do a `zgenom save`.\n\n### [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)\n\nMost of these plugins can be installed by adding `zplug \"githubuser/reponame\"` to your `.zshrc` file.\n\n### [zpm](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/zpm)\n\nMost of these plugins can be installed by adding `zpm load \"githubuser/reponame\"` to your `.zshrc` file.\n\n## Writing New Plugins and Themes\n\nI've documented some recommendations for writing new plugin and themes [here](https://github.com/unixorn/awesome-zsh-plugins/blob/master/Writing_Plugins_and_Themes.md).\n\nThere is also a more detailed [Zsh Plugin Standard](https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html).\n\n## Other Resources\n\n### ZSH Tools\n\n- [argcomplete](https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete) - Generates tab completions for programs using Python's `argparse` module.\n- [crazy-complete](https://github.com/crazy-complete/crazy-complete) - Every program should have autocompletion in the shell to enhance user experience and productivity. `crazy-complete` helps solve this task by generating robust and reliable autocompletion scripts.\n- [manpage-completion-generator](https://github.com/umlx5h/zsh-manpage-completion-generator) - Generats ZSH completions from man pages.

Make using your plugin easier for end users and put the plugin file at the root level of your plugin repository instead of hiding it in a subdirectory. This allows [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) users to install it with a simple `git clone git@github.com:you/yourplugin.git` in their `custom/plugins` directory and also lets [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) and [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) users let the framework automatically clone the repository without having to specify a subdirectory path.\n\n2. Only put one plugin or theme in a repository. This makes using it a simple `git clone` for [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) users, and simpler for other framework users as well - they won't have to specify a subdirectory, just username/reponame.\n\n3. Only oh-my-zsh sets the `${ZSH_CUSTOM}` variable. Relying on your plugin being in `${ZSH_CUSTOM}/yourPluginName` will make your plugin not work with anything but oh-my-zsh. The [ZSH Plugin Standard](https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html#zero-handling) has sample code to make it easy to find your plugin's home directory in a cross-framework way and won't break when a user inevitably renames your plugin directory.\n\n4. Don't assume your plugin will be checked out into a directory with the same name you gave the plugin. This is another case where `$(dirname ${0})` will work and `${ZSH_CUSTOM}/hardcoded-directory-name` will fail miserably.\n\n5. Use `yourplugin.plugin.zsh` for the main plugin file. This is what [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) looks for. [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen), [zgenom](https://github.com/jandamm/zgenom) and most other ZSH frameworks will also automatically find and load that filename.\n\n6. If you’re making a theme, include a screenshot so prospective users can see what it looks like without having to install it. If it relies on Powerline-compatible fonts or Nerdfonts, put that in the readme.\n\n7. If your plugin adds any of its subdirectories to the user's `fpath`, make sure those subdirectories only contain function definition files. This allows for frameworks to correctly [zcompile all functions](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Doc/Release/Functions.html#Autoloading-Functions). Please don't make your plugin add its root directory to the `fpath` - this will cause problems with `zcompile`.\n\n8. If your plugin adds aliases or functions that rely on a given program to be installed, check for the program and only add them when it's present. Same if it only works on one OS - check for the OS first. Example:\n\n```sh\nfunction has_command() {\n  which \"$@\" > /dev/null 2>&1\n}\nif has_command pbcopy; then\n   # On macOS, make ^Y yank the selection to the system clipboard. On Linux you can alias pbcopy to `xclip -selection clipboard` or corresponding tool.\n   fzf_default_opts+=(\"--bind 'ctrl-y:execute-silent(echo {+} | pbcopy)'\")\nfi\n```\n\n9. Leave ZSH settings alone.\n\n   - If you're using `setopt` to override the user's existing settings, you _will_ break someone's workflow. If you feel you absolutely must tweak `setopt` settings, make sure there's an easy way to disable your overrides - consider looking for a file named `~/.YOURPLUGIN_disable_SETTINGSNAME`.\n   - If you're touching the magic ZSH settings variables like `HISTSIZE`, _only do it if the variable is unset_. Wrap it in a `if [[ -z \"$VARNAME\" ]]; then` block so you don't step on a user's existing settings.\n\n10. Don't forget to add a license. A lot of people won't use anything that doesn't have a license. [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com) is a good tool to help you pick one if you don't already have something specific in mind.\n\n11. Look at the [ZSH Plugin Standard](https://zdharma-continuum.github.io/Zsh-100-Commits-Club/Zsh-Plugin-Standard.html). It has a lot of good suggestions.\n\n12.
