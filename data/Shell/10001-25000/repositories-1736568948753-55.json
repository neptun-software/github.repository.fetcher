Many of these detectable errors, like [buffer overflow], can have\nserious security implications. Google has found [thousands] of security\nvulnerabilities and stability bugs by deploying [guided in-process fuzzing of\nChrome components], and we now want to share that service with the open source\ncommunity.\n\n[Fuzz testing]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzz_testing\n[buffer overflow]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffer_overflow\n[thousands]: https://issues.chromium.org/issues?q=label:Stability-LibFuzzer%20-status:Duplicate,WontFix\n[guided in-process fuzzing of Chrome components]: https://security.googleblog.com/2016/08/guided-in-process-fuzzing-of-chrome.html\n\nIn cooperation with the [Core Infrastructure Initiative] and the [OpenSSF],\nOSS-Fuzz aims to make common open source software more secure and stable by\ncombining modern fuzzing techniques with scalable, distributed execution.\nProjects that do not qualify for OSS-Fuzz (e.g. closed source) can run their own\ninstances of [ClusterFuzz] or [ClusterFuzzLite].\n\n[Core Infrastructure Initiative]: https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/\n[OpenSSF]: https://www.openssf.org/\n\nWe support the [libFuzzer], [AFL++], and [Honggfuzz] fuzzing engines in\ncombination with [Sanitizers], as well as [ClusterFuzz], a distributed fuzzer\nexecution environment and reporting tool.\n\n[libFuzzer]: https://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html\n[AFL++]: https://github.com/AFLplusplus/AFLplusplus\n[Honggfuzz]: https://github.com/google/honggfuzz\n[Sanitizers]: https://github.com/google/sanitizers\n[ClusterFuzz]: https://github.com/google/clusterfuzz\n[ClusterFuzzLite]: https://google.github.io/clusterfuzzlite/\n\nCurrently, OSS-Fuzz supports C/C++, Rust, Go, Python, Java/JVM, and JavaScript code. Other languages\nsupported by [LLVM] may work too.
