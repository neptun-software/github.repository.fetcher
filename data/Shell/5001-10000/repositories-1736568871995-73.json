We suggest users switch to\n`Miniforge3` immediately. These installers will be retired from new releases\nafter January 2025. To assist in the migration, we will be introducing rollowing\nbrownouts to the latest Mambaforge installer. Installers up to version 24.5.0-1\nwill not have any brownouts. 24.5.0-1 will include a warning message.\nInstallers 2024.5.0-2 and later will have the following brownout schedule:\n\n* The installer will refuse to proceed every two weeks in October\n* The installer will refuse to proceed every ten days in November\n* The installer will refuse to proceed every five days in December\n* The installer will refuse to proceed in 2025+\n\nPrevious information:\n\nWith the [release](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/tag/23.3.1-0) of\n`Miniforge3-23.3.1-0`, that incorporated the changes in\n[#277](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/pull/277), the packages and\nconfiguration of `Mambaforge` and `Miniforge3` are now **identical**. The\nonly difference between the two is the name of the installer and, subsequently,\nthe default installation directory.\n\nWe recommend switching to `Miniforge3` immediately. These installers will be \nretired in January 2025. To assist in the migration to Miniforge3 for CI users, we've stopped\nthe latest Mambaforge (24.5+) installer from proceeding with following schedule\n\n* Every two weeks in October\n* Every ten days in November\n* Every five days in December\n* Never in 2025\n\nYou can still find the latest installers in the [24.9.2 release](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/tag/24.9.2-0).\n\n</details>\n\n## Install\n\n### Unix-like platforms (macOS & Linux)\n\nDownload the installer using curl or wget or your favorite program and run the script.\nFor eg:\n\n    curl -L -O \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"\n    bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\n\nor\n\n    wget \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"\n    bash Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\n\n#### Uninstallation\n\nUninstalling Miniforge means removing the files that were created during the installation process.\nYou will typically want to remove:\n\n1. Any modifications to your shell rc files that were made by Miniforge:\n\n```bash\n# Use this first command to see what rc files will be updated\nconda init --reverse --dry-run\n# Use this next command to take action on the rc files listed above\nconda init --reverse\n# Temporarily IGNORE the shell message\n#       'For changes to take effect, close and re-open your current shell.',\n# and CLOSE THE SHELL ONLY AFTER the 3rd step below is completed.\n```\n\n2. Remove the folder and all subfolders where the base environment for Miniforge was installed:\n\n```bash\nCONDA_BASE_ENVIRONMENT=$(conda info --base)\necho The next command will delete all files in ${CONDA_BASE_ENVIRONMENT}\n# Warning, the rm command below is irreversible!\n# check the output of the echo command above\n# To make sure you are deleting the correct directory\nrm -rf ${CONDA_BASE_ENVIRONMENT}\n```\n\n3. Any global conda configuration files that are left behind.\n\n```bash\necho ${HOME}/.condarc will be removed if it exists\nrm -f \"${HOME}/.condarc\"\necho ${HOME}/.conda and underlying files will be removed if they exist.\nrm -fr ${HOME}/.conda\n```\n\n### Windows\n\nDownload and execute the Windows installer. Follow the prompts, taking note of the options to\n\"Create start menu shortcuts\" and \"Add Miniforge3 to my PATH environment variable\". The latter is\nnot selected by default due to potential conflicts with other software. Without Miniforge3 on the\npath, the most convenient way to use the installed software (such as commands `conda` and `mamba`)\nwill be via the \"Miniforge Prompt\" installed to the start menu.\n\nThere are known issues with the usage of special characters and spaces in\nthe installation location, see for example\nhttps://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/issues/484.\nWe recommend users install in a directory without any such characters in the name.\n\n### Non-interactive install\n\nFor non-interactive usage one can use the batch install option:\n\n    bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -b  # or similar for other installers for unix platforms\n\nLook at the extra options by running the following:\n\n    bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh -h\n\nor if you are on windows, run:\n\n    start /wait \"\" Miniforge3-Windows-x86_64.exe /InstallationType=JustMe /RegisterPython=0 /S /D=%UserProfile%\\Miniforge3\n\n### Downloading the installer as part of a CI pipeline\n\nIf you wish to download the appropriate installer through the command line in a\nmore automated fashion, you may wish to a command similar to\n\nFor Linux, any architecture, use the following command\n\n    wget -O Miniforge3.sh \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-$(uname)-$(uname -m).sh\"\n\n\nFor macOS, any architecture, use the following command\n\n    curl -fsSLo Miniforge3.sh \"https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-MacOSX-$(uname -m).sh\"\n\nThis will download the appropriate installer for the present architecture with\nthe filename ``Miniforge3.sh``. Run the shell script with the command in batch\nmode with the `-b` flash:\n\n    bash Miniforge3.sh -b -p \"${HOME}/conda\"\n\n`-p` is prefix option. A directory wil be created on `\"${HOME}/conda\"`.\n\nThen you should create the path to conda and activate conda.\nRun this command:\n\n    source \"${HOME}/conda/etc/profile.d/conda.sh\"\n    # For mamba support also run the following command\n    source \"${HOME}/conda/etc/profile.d/mamba.sh\"\n\nFinally, you can run the command to activate the base environment\n\n    conda activate\n\n\n### Homebrew\n\nOn macOS, you can install miniforge with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) by running\n\n    brew install miniforge\n\n## Usage\n\nIf Miniforge is on the system path (default on macOS and Linux), its versions of the\n[`conda`](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html#managing-environments) and\n[`mamba`](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/mamba.html#mamba-user-guide) programs can be used\nat any command prompt. The most notable difference is that the default channel for packages will be conda-forge.\n\nOn Windows, Miniforge is not added to the system path by default. In this case, `conda`/`mamba` cannot be used from\nordinary command prompts without the full path of the executables, e.g. `C:\\Users\\myusername\\miniforge3\\condabin\\conda`.\nInstead, it is recommended to use the Miniforge Prompt, available from the Start menu. If desired, the\n`C:\\Users\\myusername\\miniforge3\\condabin` folder may be added to the path environment variable\n[manually](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/office/developer/sharepoint-2010/ee537574(v=office.14)#to-add-a-path-to-the-path-environment-variable)\nafter installation so the software may be used more conveniently from any command prompt with limited chance of software conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n- [X] Automatic build of constructor.\n- [X] Automatic upload of constructor results.\n- [X] Automatic testing of constructor.\n- [ ] Integration with conda-forge's developer documentation.\n- [ ] Integration with conda-forge's official site.\n- [ ] Upstream to Anaconda ?\n\n## Testing\n\nAfter construction on the CI, the installer is tested against a range of distribution that match the installer architecture (`$ARCH`). For example when architecture is `aarch64`, the constructed installer is tested against:\n\n- Centos 7\n- Debian Bullseye (11)\n- Debian Bookworm (12)\n- Ubuntu 16.04 ([LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle))\n- Ubuntu 18.04 ([LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle))\n- Ubuntu 20.04 ([LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle))\n- Ubuntu 22.04 ([LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle))\n- Ubuntu 24.04 (Latest release -- also happens to be LTS)\n\n## Building a Miniforge Installer\n\nInstallers are built and uploaded via the CI but if you want to construct your own Miniforge installer, here is how:\n\n```bash\n# Configuration\nexport ARCH=aarch64\nexport DOCKERIMAGE=condaforge/linux-anvil-aarch64\n\nbash build_miniforge.sh\n```\n\n## Support for older operating systems\n\n### Support for macOS 10.9-10.12\nIf you require support for macOS 10.9 through 10.12 you may download version\n24.3.0-0 of miniforge available at \nhttps://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/tag/24.3.0-0\n\n### Support for glibc 2.12-2.16\n\nIf you require support for glibc 2.12 through 2.16 you may download version\n24.3.0-0 of miniforge available at \nhttps://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/tag/24.3.0-0\n\n## FAQ\n\n### What's the difference between Mambaforge and Miniforge?\n\nAfter the release of Miniforge 23.3.1 in August 2023, Miniforge and Mambaforge\nare essentially identical. The only difference is the name of the installer and\nsubsequently the default installation path.\n\nBefore that release, Miniforge only shipped conda, while Mambaforge added mamba\non top. Since Miniconda started shipping conda-libmamba-solver in July 2023,\nMiniforge followed suit and started shipping it too in August. At that point,\nsince conda-libmamba-solver depends on libmambapy, the only difference between\nMiniforge and Mambaforge was the presence of the mamba Python package. To\nminimize surprises, we decided to add mamba to Miniforge too.\n\n### Should I choose one or another going forward at the risk of one of them getting deprecated?\n\nAs of June 2024, Mambaforge is deprecated and will be retired in January 2025.\nWe recommend users switch to Miniforge3 immediately. For more details, please\nsee the note above.\n\n## Release\n\nTo release a new version of Miniforge:\n\n- Make a new pre-release on GitHub with name `$CONDA_VERSION-$BUILD_NUMBER`\n- Wait until all artifacts are uploaded by CI\n  - For each build, we upload 3 artifacts\n    1. One installer with the version name\n    2. One installer without the version name\n    3. The SHA256\n  - At the time of writing, the is a sum of 72 artifacts, and with the two sources, we expect a grand total of 74 artifacts.\n- Mark the pre-release as a release\n\nNOTE: using a pre-release is important to make sure the latest links work.\n\n## License\n\n[BSD 3-Clause](./LICENSE)\n\n## History\n\nRelevant conversations:\n\n- https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/issues/871#issue-496677528\n- https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge.github.io/pull/922\n"
