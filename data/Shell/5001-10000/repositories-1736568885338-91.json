It is educational and informative.\n\nExamples are not:\n\n* Full app deployments, ready to use, with no explanation. These\n  belong to [Helm charts](https://github.com/kubernetes/charts).\n* Simple toys to show how to use a Kubernetes feature. These belong in\n  the [user guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).\n* Demos that follow a script to show a Kubernetes feature in\n  action. Example: killing a node to demonstrate controller\n  self-healing.\n* A tutorial which guides the user through multiple progressively more\n  complex deployments to arrive at the final solution. An example\n  should just demonstrate how to setup the correct deployment\n\n## An Example Includes\n\n### Up front\n\n* Has a \"this is what you'll learn\" section.\n* Has a Table of Contents.\n* Has a section that brings up the app in the fewest number of\n  commands (TL;DR / quickstart), without cloning the repo (kubectl\n  apply -f http://...).\n* Points to documentation of prerequisites.\n  * [Create a cluster](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/running-locally.md) (e.g., single-node docker).\n  * [Setup kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).\n  * etc.\n* Should specify which release of Kubernetes is required and any other\n  prerequisites, such as DNS, a cloudprovider with PV provisioning, a\n  cloudprovider with external load balancers, etc.\n  * Point to general documentation about alternatives for those\n    mechanisms rather than present the alternatives in each example.\n  * Tries to balance between using new features, and being\n    compatible across environments.\n\n### Throughout\n\n* Should point to documentation on first mention:\n  [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/),\n  [pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/),\n  [services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/),\n  [deployments](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/),\n  [replication controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicationcontroller/),\n  [jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/),\n  [labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/),\n  [persistent volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/),\n  etc.\n* Most examples should be cloudprovider-independent (e.g., using PVCs, not PDs).\n  * Other examples with cloudprovider-specific bits could be somewhere else.\n* Actually show the app working -- console output, and or screenshots.\n  * Ascii animations and screencasts are recommended.\n* Follows [config best practices](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/).\n* Shouldn't duplicate the [user guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).\n* Docker images are pre-built, and source is contained in a subfolder.\n  * Source is the Dockerfile and any custom files needed beyond the\n    upstream app being packaged.\n  * Images are pushed to `gcr.io/google-samples`. Contact @jeffmendoza\n    to have an image pushed\n  * Images are tagged with a version (not latest) that is referenced\n    in the example config.\n* Only use the code highlighting types\n  [supported by Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge/wiki/list-of-supported-languages-and-lexers),\n  as this is what GitHub Pages uses.\n* Commands to be copied using the `shell` syntax highlighting type, and\n  do not include any kind of prompt.\n* Example output is in a separate block quote to distinguish it from\n  the command (which doesn't have a prompt).\n* When providing an example command or config for which the user is\n  expected to substitute text with something specific to them, use\n  angle brackets: `<IDENTIFIER>` for the text to be substituted.\n\n### At the end\n\n* Should have a section suggesting what to look at next, both in terms\n  of \"additional resources\" and \"what example to look at next\".\n\n\n<!-- BEGIN MUNGE: GENERATED_ANALYTICS -->\n[![Analytics](https://kubernetes-site.appspot.com/UA-36037335-10/GitHub/examples/guidelines.md?pixel)]()\n<!-- END MUNGE: GENERATED_ANALYTICS -->\n"
