That being said, there's a number of excellent books, listed below.\n\n### Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders\n\nüìñ [Turn the Ship Around!: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders](http://www.amazon.com/Turn-Ship-Around-Turning-Followers/dp/1591846404) is hands down my preferred management book.\n\nThis book made me truly understand what empowering local decision means. In particular, I liked how the author explains that the usual chain of command requires information to go up the chain, and decision to go down, which is insanely inefficient.\n\nIt provides great tools for managers to help their team members come up with their own decisions, in particular the notion of **deliberate action**. There's a also [a presentation](http://www.slideshare.net/micrimson/turn-the-ship-around-041614) that talks about the main concepts the author developed.\n\nThere are numerous cheesy management books and this is not one of them. The narration is great as well and the explanations are short, and to the point.\n\nYou can find a short summary in video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psAXMqxwol8)\n\n> ‚ÄúControl without competence is chaos.‚Äù\n\n‚Äî L. David Marquet, Turn the Ship Around!\n\n### Other generalist books\n\n- üìñ [The Advantage, Enhanced Edition: Why Organizational Health Trumps Everything Else In Business](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006ORWT3Y/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&btkr=1), Patrick M. Lencioni.\n  - The only way for people to embrace a message is to hear it over a period of time, in a variety of different situations, and preferably from different people. That‚Äôs why great leaders see themselves as Chief Reminding Officers as much as anything else.\n  - The best way to do cascading communication is face-to-face and live. Seeing a leader and hearing the tone of his or her voice is critical for employees, as is being able to ask a question or two.\n  - But then again, most organizations are unhealthy precisely because they aren‚Äôt doing the basic things, which require discipline, persistence, and follow-through more than sophistication or intelligence.\n- üìñ [Managing Humans: Biting and Humorous Tales of a Software Engineering Manager](https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Humans-Humorous-Software-Engineering/dp/1484221575): \"Read hilarious stories with serious lessons that Michael Lopp extracts from his varied and sometimes bizarre experiences as a manager at Apple, Pinterest, Palantir, Netscape, Symantec, Slack, and Borland. Many of the stories first appeared in primitive form in Lopp‚Äôs perennially popular blog, Rands in Repose.\"\n- üìñ Oren Ellenbogen, [Leading Snowflakes: the Engineering Manager Handbook](http://leadingsnowflakes.com/): some truly great content and concrete ideas to move from maker to manager mode, code reviewing your management decisions, delegating tasks without losing quality or visibility.\n- üìñ Adam Grant, [Give and Take: Why Helping Others Drives Our Success](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFPTSI0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1): \"This gem is a joy to read, and it shatters the myth that greed is the path to success.\", Robert Sutton.\n- üìñ Ken Blanchard, [Lead Like Jesus: Lessons from the Greatest Leadership Role Model of All Time](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VF62IO/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1).\n- üìñ Andrew S. Grove, [High Output Management](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B015VACHOK/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). A landmark book by Intel CEO Andy Grove. Introduced many of the management best practices such as 1-1, OKR.\n  - Managerial leverage measures the impact of what managers do to increase the output of their teams.\n  - You need to plan the way a fire department plans. It cannot anticipate where the next fire will be, so it has to shape an energetic and efficient team that is capable of responding to the unanticipated as well as to any ordinary event.\n  - Every hour of your day should be spent increasing the output or the value of the output of the people whom you‚Äôre responsible for.\n  - A common rule we should always try to heed is to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible.\n  - A genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. Obviously, you measure a salesman by the orders he gets (output), not by the calls he makes (activity).\n  - A manager‚Äôs output = The output of his organization + The output of the neighboring organizations under his influence.\n  - League standings are kept by team, not by individual. Business‚Äîand this means not just the business of commerce but the business of education, the business of government, the business of medicine‚Äîis a team activity. And, always, it takes a team to win.\n  - Your decision-making depends finally on how well you comprehend the facts and issues facing your business. This is why information-gathering is so important in a manager‚Äôs life.\n  - The lack of a decision is the same as a negative decision; no green light is a red light, and work can stop for a whole organization.\n  - Delegation without follow-through is abdication.\n  - Any decision be worked out and reached at the lowest competent level. The reason is that this is where it will be made by people who are closest to the situation and know the most about it.\n  - Self-confidence mostly comes from a gut-level realization that nobody has ever died from making a wrong business decision, or taking inappropriate action, or being overruled.\n  - A successful MBO [management by objective] system needs only to answer two questions: 1.¬†¬†Where do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective.) 2.¬†¬†How will I pace myself to see if I am getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results).\n  - The one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small. In practice, this is rare, and here, as elsewhere, we fall victim to our inability to say ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äîin this case, to too many objectives. We must realize‚Äîand act on the realization‚Äîthat if we try to focus on everything, we focus on nothing. A few extremely well-chosen objectives impart a clear message about what we say ‚Äúyes‚Äù to and what we say ‚Äúno‚Äù to‚Äîwhich is what we must have if an MBO system is to work.\n  - Alfred Sloan summed up decades of experience at General Motors by saying, ‚ÄúGood management rests on a reconciliation of centralization and decentralization.‚Äù Or, we might say, on a balancing act to get the best combination of responsiveness and leverage.\n  - I would like to propose Grove‚Äôs Law: All large organizations with a common business purpose end up in a hybrid organizational form.\n  - When a person is not doing his job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person either can‚Äôt do it or won‚Äôt do it; he is either not capable or not motivated.\n  - That variable is the task-relevant maturity (TRM) of the subordinates, which is a combination of the degree of their achievement orientation and readiness to take responsibility, as well as their education, training, and experience.\n  - When the TRM is low, the most effective approach is one that offers very precise and detailed instructions, wherein the supervisor tells the subordinate what needs to be done, when, and how: in other words, a highly structured approach. As the TRM of the subordinate grows, the most effective style moves from the structured to one more given to communication, emotional support, and encouragement.\n  - The responsibility for teaching the subordinate must be assumed by his supervisor, and not paid for by the customers of his organization, internal or external.\n  - At all times you should force yourself to assess performance, not potential.\n  - A manager generally has two ways to raise the level of individual performance of his subordinates: by increasing motivation, the desire of each person to do his job well, and by increasing individual capability, which is where training comes in.\n- üìñ Patrick Lencioni, [The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable](https://www.amazon.com/Five-Dysfunctions-Team-Leadership-Fable/dp/0787960756/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1500281191&sr=1-1&keywords=dysfunctions).\n- üìñ Work Rules!: Insights from Inside Google That Will Transform How You Live and Lead, Laszlo Bock. A pretty interesting description of Google's processes. A bit long at times.\n- üìñ [The Manager's Path](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-managers-path/9781491973882/) , Camille Fournier. A very practical book with lots of down-to-earth advices.\n- üìñ [Team Topologies](https://itrevolution.com/product/team-topologies/), from ITRevolution Press. Discusses the intricacies of managing Engineering Departments, and especially patterns for improving team interactions.\n- üìñ [The Effective Executive](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Executive-Definitive-Harperbusiness-Essentials/dp/0060833459) by Peter Drucker, Seminal Work in Management. Discusses challenges of management, especially managing Knowledge Workers. Proposes principles for effective decision-making and continued improvement of one's organization\n  - May also serve as grounding for growing beyond Engineering Management, as well as working with other departments.\n\nThere are some other more specific books quoted below.\n\nOther books I haven't read:\n\n- [Engineering Management for the Rest of Us](https://www.engmanagement.dev/)\n- [ZachGoldberg/Startup-CTO-Handbook](https://github.com/ZachGoldberg/Startup-CTO-Handbook/blob/main/StartupCTOHandbook.md)\n\n### Book reading lists\n\n- [Jason Evanish's list](https://jasonevanish.com/books/) (Lighthouse founder) is quite comprehensive.\n- [Holiday Book Recommendations for Engineering Managers, Software Engineers and Product Managers](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/holiday-tech-book-recommendations/#books-by-genre), Gergely Orosz\n- [Most Recommended Books to Make You a Better Engineering Manager](https://managersclub.com/most-recommended-books-engineering-leaders/)\n- [10 Must-Reads for Engineering Leaders](https://zaidesanton.substack.com/p/10-must-reads-for-engineering-leaders)\n\n## What is engineering management?\n\nHere are some generic resources:\n\n- [Unintuitive Things I‚Äôve Learned about Management](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/unintuitive-things-i-ve-learned-about-management-f2c42d68604b#.2z9av4pzs)\n- Lars Dalgaard, [Thoughts on Building Weatherproof Companies](http://a16z.com/2016/03/25/building-weatherproof-companies/): while originally aimed at startups CEOs, this article from Andreessen Horowitz's blog is a very inspiring read on what it takes to scale your team.\n\n### General management resources\n\n- [14 Points for Management](https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points) by W.

So the first step to achieving the results we really want is to fix the problem of believing that others are the source of all that ails us. It‚Äôs our dogmatic conviction that ‚Äúif we could just fix those losers, all would go better‚Äù that keeps us from taking action that could lead to dialogue and progress. Which is why it‚Äôs no surprise that those who are best at dialogue tend to turn this logic around. They believe the best way to work on ‚Äúus‚Äù is to start with ‚Äúme.‚Äù\n  - Respect is like air. As long as it‚Äôs present, nobody thinks about it. But if you take it away, it‚Äôs all that people can think about.\n  - ‚ÄúOne dull pencil is worth six sharp minds.‚Äù Don‚Äôt leave your hard work to memory. If you‚Äôve gone to the effort to complete a crucial conversation, don‚Äôt fritter away all the meaning you created by trusting your memories.

A solution-oriented book.\n  - Train your interview team to apply a limited-consensus approach to hiring. When groups use limited consensus, not everyone may agree with the decision, but each person should be satisfied enough with a particular candidate‚Äôs suitability not to block the decision to hire him or her.\n  - What if the vetoer is someone I don‚Äôt want to keep in the organization?‚Äù The answer to this is simple: In the interview process, only involve employees whose work you respect and value. If an employee isn‚Äôt successful in his or her technical position, don‚Äôt make that employee part of the interview team.\n  - Make sure members of your team interview an internal candidate the same way they would interview an external candidate.\n  - Know why you‚Äôre hiring more people. Define your problems to define your hiring strategy.\n  - Sometimes, the main reason a hiring manager doesn‚Äôt hire a candidate is that he or she has a gut feeling that the person just won‚Äôt fit well with the culture. But a ‚Äúgut feeling‚Äù is not a good reason not to hire someone, so train yourself to articulate culture-fit differences.\n  - I personally do not consider certification to mean anything much when I am hiring someone for a technical position. Because the knowledge tested is functional-skills book knowledge, make sure you understand what the person must do to maintain his or her certification and the value of that certification to your environment.\n  - Too often, internal recruiters look for tool and technology expertise or for advanced academic degrees, rather than for functional skill or for product-domain experience.\n  - If you feel the need to take notes, take them on paper, never on a computer. My reason for this is that when you use a computer, you have to sit behind a screen, which creates a barrier between you and the candidate.\n  - Promising an unconditional promotion is not just risky; it is stupid. Circumstances within the company can change; the employee may not perform up to expectations; the economy may tank.\n- A good example of [offer letter](https://medium.com/@henrysward/a-better-offer-letter-4e9bf61a7365#.md4rm1zlp) from eShares.\n- [We Hire the Best, Just Like Everyone Else](http://blog.codinghorror.com/we-hire-the-best-just-like-everyone-else/), Jeff Atwood.\n- ‚≠êÔ∏è [How to Hire](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-hire-34f4ded5f176#.jxkz3wrs3): one of the best articles about hiring.\n  - Hire for Strength vs Lack of Weakness\n  - Hire for Trajectory vs Experience\n  - Hire Doers vs Tellers\n  - Hire Learners vs Experts\n  - Hire Different vs Similar\n  - Always pass on ego\n- ‚≠êÔ∏è [The hiring post](http://sockpuppet.org/blog/2015/03/06/the-hiring-post/): another truly awesome post about hiring by Thomas Ptacek.\n- [This is why you never end up hiring good developers](http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/)\n  - Many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life;\n  - You want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now;\n  - Or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly;\n  - You want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do;\n  - Your interview should be a collaborative conversations, not a combative interrogation;\n  - You also want somebody who you will enjoy working with;\n  - It‚Äôs important to separate ‚Äúenjoy working with‚Äù from ‚Äúenjoy hanging out with;‚Äù\n  - Don‚Äôt hire assholes, no matter how good they are;\n  - If your team isn‚Äôt diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be;\n  - Accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard.\n- [Engineering Management - Hiring](http://algeri-wong.com/yishan/engineering-management-hiring.html) explains why hiring should be your top priority.\n- [When we only hire the best means we only hire the trendiest](http://danluu.com/programmer-moneyball/)\n- [How to Hire](https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-to-hire), Patty McCord (built HR function at Netflix).\n- [Trouble hiring senior engineers?
