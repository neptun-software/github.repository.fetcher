For example, when the user is presented with '2) phone' he can remove the client by typing either '2' or 'phone'.\n- Added ability to remove a client non-interactively with 'pivpn -r phone -y'.\n- When choosing to use Pi-hole, do not whitelist the specific VPN interface. Instead, use Pi-hole's built-in command 'pihole -a -i local' to allow listening from on the VPN interface. DNS resolution on the LAN shouldn't break anymore in some circumstances if the user changes Pi-hole's listening behavior after installing PiVPN.\n\n## Jun 9th 2020\n\n- Dual VPN mode, use both WireGuard and OpenVPN by running the installer script over an existing installation.\n- Generate a unique pre-shared key for each client as per the WireGuard protocol to improve post-quantum resistance.\n- Added the ability to regenerate the .ovpn config when the client template changes (issue #281). Use 'pivpn -a -o'.\n- Added the '--show-unsupported-nics' argument to the install script for those who need PiVPN on virtual servers where the available network interfaces may not be detected reliably (issue #994).\n- Clone the git repo to '/usr/local/src/pivpn' and replace all other locations with symlinks (issue #695).\n- Simplified the OpenVPN installation flow by moving some settings behind a \"customize\" dialog.\n-  Temporarily disable 'pivpn -up' until a proper update strategy is defined. See [this commit](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/commit/f06f6d79203c29ebd785f860a81a15e9caac4fc9) for more information.\n\n## Mar 17th 2020\n\n- Switch to Bullseye repository on Debian/Raspbian. The bullseye repository is less likely to offer broken packages and it's also supported by Raspbian, meaning there is no need to manually compile WireGuard on older Raspberry Pis.\n- Adding a PPA on Ubuntu requires 'software-properties-common' with may not be installed on servers.\n- Avoid IPv6 leak by routing IPv6 through WireGuard.\n- Download OpenVPN key via HTTPS if retrieving via keyserver fails.\n- Show connected clients data rates with dotted decimal notation using 'pivpn -c -b'. It's useful because the human readable format does not offer enough precision to tell if a client is sending very little data.\n- Use 'apt-cache policy' to decide whether we need a repository or not.\n- Use lowest APT pin priority that allows package upgrades (more information on pull request [#963](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/pull/963) and [#983](https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn/pull/983)).\n\n## Feb 17th 2020\n\n- When offering to use Pi-hole, identify VPN clients via clientname.pivpn using a dedicated hosts file. Clients can now be resolved by their names and also show up in the Pi-hole dashboard.\n- Decide whether to tell dnsmasq to listen on the VPN interface depending on the user settings. The default Pi-hole listening behavior is **Listen only on interface whatever**, which means dnsmasq needs to know the additional VPN interface. However, if the user has **Listen on all interfaces** or **Listen on all interfaces, permit all origins**, then, there is no need to add the interface (self-explanatory).\n- Set static IPs by default when using OpenVPN.\n- Restrict access to automatic backups (.tar.gz) of **/etc/wireguard** and **/etc/openvpn** to root.\n- Drop libmnl-dev requirement on armv6l as it's not required anymore to build wireguard-tools.\n- Require apt-transport-https on Ubuntu < Bionic and Debian < Buster as those older version have APT without HTTPS repositories support and the script uses them.\n- Import OpenVPN PGP key from keyserver as it should be more secure than downloading from the website since we specifically tell the keyserver which key we want, referring to its fingerprint.\n\n## Jan 31th 2020\n\n- More validation of user input\n- Check if package installation is successful\n- Detect netmask when setting a static IP\n- Avoid adding repositories if they already exist\n- Switch DH params from 2ton.com.au to RFC 7919\n- Using 'install' to copy files into place\n- Move the self check to a different script and use it for both OpenVPN and WireGuard\n- Add 'pivpn -wg' to update WireGuard on older Raspberry Pis\n\n## Jan 20th 2020\n\n- Allow setting DHCP reservation preference with --unattended\n- Flip condition check on $dhcpReserv: first check if empty, and if not, check if it's not 1.\n  Doing it the other way (first check if not 1) would give a shell error if $dhcpReserv was empty.\n- Prepend 'pivpn-' to unstable repo files to limit naming conflicts\n- Update variables inside unattended examples\n- Remove openvpn logging setting when uninstalling the package\n- Run 'apt-get update' after removing the WireGuard PPA\n\n## Jan 18th 2020\n\nDistro Support, Bug Fixes, Unattended install\n\nTested and added Support on Debian 9\ntested and added support on Ubuntu 16.04 & 18.08\n  * Fixed wireguard not installing, added pkg cache update after adding ppa\n  * added kernel headers to dependencies as its requred for wireguard-dkms\nunattended install\n  * When user is provided and doest exist, it will create one without password set\n  * Use metapackage to install kernel headers on Ubuntu\n\n\n## Jan 8th 2020\n\nUpdates and improvements\nIssue #871: fix backup script\n\ninstall.sh\n  installScripts function:\n    update script not being copied over to /opt therefore update funcion was probably broken.\n    changed script to copy all .sh scripts from .pivpn/scripts directory.\n\nIssue #871: fix backup script\n  I was probably very drunk when i first wrote this backup script.\n  fixed it, now works with new code refactoring,\n  loads vars from setupVars\n  Added backup for wireguard\n  Moved script to global pivpnscripts.\n  Added backup script to bash-completion\n  Added backup script to pivpn script\n\nupdate.sh\n  Commented the update from master branch to avoid users trying to update test from master.\n\n\nUpdated LatestChages.md\n\n## Jan 7th 2020\n\nChanges for FR #897\nSupport For DHCP IP Reservation\n\nMain:\n  - added If statement to skipp SetStaticIPv4 if dhcpRserv=1\n\ngetStaticIPv4Settings:\n  - Added Whiptail asking if user wants to use DHCP reservation Settings, this will add dhcpReserv and\n    skip setStaticIPv4 while still logging everything.\nConfigExample files:\n  - Added staticReserv=0 to config examples. so it can be used with Unattended install\n    * 0 means static ip will be setup.\n    * 1 means DHCP Reservation will be used and no chage will be made to the interfaces\n\n\nUpdated LatestChanges\n\n## Jan 6th 2020\n\n* Removed Unecessary pipe on availableInterfaces\n* Changed OS Support messages accross the script\n  - Removed OS Version names from the script, this avoids having to change the code everytime a new OS Version is Released, instead we update the wiki with propper information.\n* Changed MaybeOSSupport whiptail tiltes and messages to make it more clear.\n  - Messages and titles could cause confusion to users and specially developers\n* Moved Funcions Comment to correct place.\n* DistroCheck Function:\n  - Moved up before other functions so it better refflects the order they are called.\n  - changed Case identation to make it easier to read.\n  - Added info to # compatibility Comment, Removed unecessary comments\n  - added break to exit out of case, easier to understand that the script should move on.\n* Added Shellcheck ignores,\n* chooseinterface Function:\n  - Changed function Logic and cleaned it up\n  - Fixed Issue #906\n  - Added exit code if no interfaces are found\n* Updated LatestUpdate.md\n* Use radiolist to select a VPN\n\n## Jan 3rd 2020\n\n- Revise route query for IP & GW selection from Quad9 to TEST-NET-1\n- Replace mention of 'Google' with 'Quad9'\n\n## Jan 2nd 2020\n\n- Fix mv command when copying the DH parameters to final destination\n\n## Dec 30th 2019\n\n- Fix paths inside the update script\n- Use the wireguard script for WireGuard as well\n- Updated the README in accordance to changes in the test branch\n\n## Dec 29th 2019\n\n* Handle running the install script over an existing installation (as the script already did before branching to test-wireguard), providing:\n    - Update, downloads latest scripts from git repo\n    - Repair, reinstall PiVPN while keeping existing settings\n    - Reconfigure, start over overwriting the existing settings\n* Tag iptables rules as an attempt to make sure that the uninstall script only removes PiVPN rules\n* Change the armv6l installation to reflect the split of WireGuard snapshots into wireguard-linux-compat and wireguard-tools\n\n## Dec 27th 2019\n\n - When suggesting to use Pi-hole, use the VPN server IP instead of the LAN IP to allow DNS resolution even if the user does not route the local network through the tunnel.\n- Format listCONF in a similar way as listOVPN\n- Specifically look for a free octet in the last word of clients.txt and not just any word.\n  Necessary otherwhise public keys starting with a number will match against an octet.\n  Example: if line is 'name 5abcdefgh 4', then looking for ' 5' will match but '5$' will\n  not (correctly).\n- 'pivpn -c' will show the Connected Clients List for WireGuard too\n\n## Dec 10th 2019\n\n- Use dedicated openvpn user and group for increased security\n- Added basic safeguards to avoid wrecking /etc/ufw/before.rules\n- Applied some Shellcheck suggested changes.\n- Added safeguards to rm -rf when downloading the git repo.\n- Use more variables instead of hardcoding data\n- Add local resolver as DNS option\n\n## Dec 3rd 2019\n\n- Better client stats formatting\n\n## Dec 2nd 2019\n\n* Properly avoid pulling unwanted packages from unstable repo:\n  - Currently apt pulls all packages from the unstable repo because the script intendation created the file 'limit-unstable' with tabs in it. Fixed using printf to create a multiline file.\n- Accept debug fixes using just the enter key\n\n## Nov 25th 2019 - On Master\n\n* Changed pivpn command exit codes from 1 to 0\n  - exit code 1 means general error hence should not be used for exiting successfully\n* added backup script to backup openvpn and pivpn generated certificates\n* added update script to update /opt/pivpn scripts, -t | --test | test update from test branch\n* Fixed hostname length issue #831\n    - the script now checks for hostname length right at the beginning and prompts for a new one.\n    - HOST_NAME to host_name, as best practice variables with capitals, should be used by system variables only.\n* fixed ubuntu 18.04 being detected as not supported OS, now fully supported and tested.\n* changed how scripts are copied to /opt/pivpn, it hat a lot of long repetitive lines, now it copies all `*.sh` files making it easier to manage when adding new scripts/features\n* Changed how supported OS are presented when maybeOS_Support() is called.\n\n## Nov 19th 2019\n\n- Added Ubuntu Bionic support\n\n## Nov 16th 2019\n\n- Added back unattended installation: as expected, the user can call the install script with --unattended followed by a config file and PiVPN will be installed non-interactively.\n- Removed persist-key and persist-tun from the client config.\n- Reverted keepalive setting on the server to smaller values.\n- See @TinCanTech's posts for the reasons of the above two: #864 (comment)\n- Copied validDomain() function from the test branch.\n- Removed 1024 bit certificate options, since on Buster OpenVPN does not start with such small certificates (It's related to OpenSSL 1.1.1).\n- Backup /etc/openvpn and /etc/wireguard before installing.\n- Always remove VPN configuration when uninstalling, but do not wipe the folder, just remove what PiVPN added.\n- Fetch latest WireGuard snapshot instead of hardcoding it into the script.\n\n## Nov 7th 2019\n\n- Add back the uninstall script\n- Only uninstall packages that were not already installed when running the PiVPN install script.\n- Detect and offer to use Pi-hole\n- Use checkinstall to install wireguard-tools for easy uninstallation\n- Added missing dkms dependency\n\n## Oct 19th 2019\n\n- MakeOVPN has been updated to include the -i iOS function to allow users to create an OVPN12 format file that can be used with the iOS keychain.\n- Check if -i iOS can be used (can't be used with ECDSA certificates).\n- Fixed the issues with special characters in OVPN12 files.\n\n## Oct 17th 2019\n\n- Allow subdomain in custom DNS search list.\n- Unified PiVPN configuration into the single /etc/pivpn/setupVars.conf file.\n- Functions that ask the user for the port, protocol, dns, domain don't apply the setting anymore, they only save the variable on disk. Settings are applied in confOpenVPN, confOVPN, confWireGuard.\n- Support and use WireGuard by default with an initial set of scripts matching current PiVPN scripts (list, create, remove clients).\n- Removed OpenVPN ECDSA option.\n- Renamed some variables (see pull request 849).\n- Refactored several functions.\n\n## Oct 12th 2019 - On test\n\n* Changed pivpn command exit codes from 1 to 0\n  - exit code 1 means general error hence should not be used for exiting successfully\n* added backup script to backup openvpn and pivpn generated certificates\n* added update script to update /opt/pivpn scripts, -t | --test | test update from test branch\n* Fixed hostname length issue #831\n    - the script now checks for hostname length right at the beginning and prompts for a new one.\n    - HOST_NAME to host_name, as best practice variables with capitals, should be used by system variables only.\n* fixed ubuntu 18.04 being detected as not supported OS, now fully supported and tested.\n* changed how scripts are copied to /opt/pivpn, it hat a lot of long repetitive lines, now it copies all `*.sh` files making it easier to manage when adding new scripts/features\n* Changed how supported OS are presented when maybeOS_Support() is called.\n\n### Merge Patch, Sept 2nd 2019\n\n* Bitwarden integration:\n    - Bitwarden Installation removed from script, users that whish to use it should install it manually.\n    - bugfixes with pivpn add\n    - pivpn add -b will fail if bitwarden is not found\n\n* File and dirs permissions:\n    - fixed bug where ovpns being owned by root\n\n* IOS integration\n    - fixed bug where ovpn12 files not being properly generated\n\n* General improvments:\n    - when runing updates, sudo password prompt now shows up in a new line\n\n## Sept 1st 2019\n\n* Added support for Buster\n* .ovpn12 files making use of iOS keychain\n* Leverage the Hostname of the Server to generate server uuid\n* integrated support to bitwarden password manager into pivpn\n* Recreate ovpn folder if deleted\n* Handle older UFW version from Jessie\n* Only use iptables-legacy if platform is Buster\n* improved Buester and Jessie IPtables / ufw handling\n* bugfixes and typos\n* permissions hardening and writing uniformization\n* improved pivpn user and ovpns dirs handling\n* Changes variable and file naming in `install.sh`\n    -  $pivPNUser renamed to $INSTALL_USER\n    -  /tmp/pivpnUSR renamed to INSTALL_USER\n"

You won't need a guide or tutorial as PiVPN will do it all for you in a fraction of the time with hardened security settings in place by default.  \n\nWe recommend running PiVPN on the latest RaspberryPi OS Lite image in a Raspberry Pi at your home so you can VPN into your network from not secure remote locations and safely use the internet. However, you can also use PiVPN in any Cloud Provider VPS running Ubuntu or Debian to assist those with untrustworthy ISPs. Running a VPN on a server elsewhere means you can connect to the VPN from home, and because your traffic will be getting out from the cloud/VPS provider, your ISP will only see encrypted traffic. \n\nPiVPN should also work with most Ubuntu and Debian based distributions, including those using UFW by default instead of raw iptables.\t\n\n----\n## Installation\n\n### Method 1 (standard)\n\n```Shell\ncurl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash\n```\n\n### Method 2 (direct link)\n\n```Shell\ncurl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivpn/pivpn/master/auto_install/install.sh | bash\n```\n\n### Method 3 (clone repo)\n\n```Shell\ngit clone https://github.com/pivpn/pivpn.git\nbash pivpn/auto_install/install.sh\n```\n\n### To install from Test/Development branch\n\n```shell\ncurl -L https://test.pivpn.io | TESTING= bash\n```\n\n### To install from custom git url and branch (for DEV)\n\nThis is inteded to be used when testing changes during\ndevelopment and **not** for standard installations.\nWithout this the script will always checkout the master branch.\n\n- Git repo can be pivpn or any other git repo (e.g. a fork).\n- Git branch can be specified as required\n\n```shell\n# Syntax\ngit clone < customgitrepourl >\nbash pivpn/auto_install/install.sh --giturl < customgitrepourl > --gitbranch < customgitbranch >\n\n# Example\ngit clone https://github.com/userthatforked/pivpn.git\nbash pivpn/auto_install/install.sh --giturl https://github.com/userthatforked/pivpn.git --gitbranch myfeaturebranch\n```\n\nThe unattended setup config also supports a custom giturl and branch.\n\n```shell\npivpnGitUrl=\"https://github.com/userthatforked/pivpn.git\"\npivpnGitBranch=\"myfeaturebranch\"\n```\n----\n## Feedback & Support\n\nPiVPN is purely community-driven and its our objective for PiVPN to work for as many people as possible.
