This means you can safely\nbreak the test installation without risking breaking your main rvm\ninstallation.\n\nIf you want to do manual testing on the CLI against this test installation,\nyou also need to do:\n\n    $ rvm reload\n\nTo get back to using original rvm installation run:\n\n    $ rvm switch ~/.rvm\n\n## Hacking RVM via TDD (Test-Driven Development)\n\nFirst write a test for the behaviour you expect.  For details on how\nto write new tests, see [README](https://github.com/rvm/rvm/blob/master/tests/README.md).\n\nThen run the test:\n\n    $ NOEXEC_DISABLE=1 tf --text tests/fast/foo_comment_test.sh\n\nIt should fail.  Now repeat the following steps until the test passes:\n\n    1. hack the changes in your rvm src tree\n    2. run `./install`\n    3. re-run the test (you can also manually test via rvm commands on the CLI)\n\nNow `git commit`, `git push` to your GitHub fork, then issue a pull\nrequest, and if it is accepted then your place in hacker heaven is\nsecured.\n"

It manages Ruby application environments and enables switching between them.\n\nHomepage and more info at [https://rvm.io](https://rvm.io)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n- [Installing RVM](#installing-rvm)\n  - [Ubuntu](#ubuntu)\n  - [Any other operating system](#any-other-operating-system)\n  - [Additional installation options](#additional-installation-options)\n- [Upgrading RVM](#upgrading-rvm)\n- [Basic RVM usage](#basic-rvm-usage)\n  - [Installing ruby](#installing-ruby)\n  - [Switching between ruby versions](#switching-between-ruby-versions)\n  - [Other RVM commands](#other-rvm-commands)\n- [Reporting issues](#reporting-issues)\n  - [Check documentation](#check-documentation)\n  - [Try again with latest RVM](#try-again-with-latest-rvm)\n  - [File an issue](#file-an-issue)\n- [Contributing](#contributing)\n- [License](#license)\n\n## Installing RVM\n\n### Ubuntu\n\nRVM have dedicated Ubuntu package, so please follow instructions posted here: https://github.com/rvm/ubuntu_rvm\n\nIf you need a different (newer) version of RVM, after installing base version of RVM check the [Upgrading](#upgrading) section below.\n\n### Any other operating system\n\nMake sure you have following required packages installed:\n\n* `curl`\n* `gpg2`\n\nAnd then run:\n\n```\ncurl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable\n```\n\n### Additional installation options\n\nAdditional installation options and details about the installation process are described here: https://rvm.io/rvm/install\n\n## Upgrading RVM\n\nYou can upgrade RVM any time by running:\n\n`rvm get VERSION`\n\nWhere `VERSION` should be replaced by one of the following values:\n\n* `stable`              - latest stable RVM (good for servers)\n* `master`              - latest RVM (might not be stable)\n* `branch /path/branch` - branched version of RVM (for testing new features or bug fixes)\n\nAdditional upgrading options are described here: https://rvm.io/rvm/upgrading\n\n## Basic RVM usage\n\nBasic RVM usage scenarios include installing and switching between different ruby versions.\n\n### Installing ruby\n\nTo install ruby you have to call `rvm install INTERPRETER[-VERSION] OPTIONS`\n\nWhen no version specified, RVM will install latest stable version or selected interpreter. If you omit to specify interpreter, RVM will assume\nthat you wanted to install MRI ruby. Following examples would have exactly the same effect:\n\n```\nrvm install ruby-2.3.1\nrvm install ruby-2.3\nrvm install 2.3.1\nrvm install 2.3\n```\n\nPassing additional `--default` option makes selected ruby your default.\n\nWe currently supported following ruby interpreters:\n\n* `ruby`       - MRI ruby (The Gold Standard)\n* `ironruby`   - a .NET ruby\n* `jruby`      - Java implementation of the ruby\n* `macruby`    - implementation of ruby 1.9 directly on top of macOS core technologies\n* `maglev`     - 64-bit implementation on top of VMware's GemStone\n* `mruby`      - lightweight ruby\n* `opal`       - ruby to JavaScript compiler\n* `rbx`        - Rubinius - a next generation virtual machine VM for ruby\n* `topaz`      - high performance ruby, written in RPython\n* `truffleruby` - high performance ruby using GraalVM\n\nHistorical interpreters which you can still install with RVM, but are not anymore developed and supported by their authors:\n\n* `ree`        - Ruby Enterprise Edition - MRI Ruby with several custom patches for performance, stability, and memory\n\n### Switching between ruby versions\n\nTo switch between ruby versions you should call\n\n`rvm use INTERPRETER[-VERSION]`\n\nSame rules and options apply as for `install` command with two special _interpreters_.\n\n* `default`    - [default](https://rvm.io/rubies/default/) ruby (or the system ruby if a default hasn't been set)\n* `system`     - system ruby (state before RVM was installed)\n\nAdditionally you might want to list your preferred ruby version in a `.ruby-version` file stored in your project folder. This would cause automatic switch to selected ruby whenever you enter the folder.\n\n### Other RVM commands\n\nRVM comes bundled with many different tools for managing your ruby environment. More detailed information about every command listed below can be read after executing `rvm help COMMAND` or browsing documentation on RVM homepage [https://rvm.io](https://rvm.io).\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nHere at RVM we get a high amount of bug reports, and often they are connected\nwith specific environment settings which might be hard for us to replicate.\nThat's why we would kindly ask you to follow the steps below so we can maximize\nour time helping you and minimize the time requesting more information.\n\n### Check documentation\n\nWe know, you hear this over and over and be rest assured we are working hard to improve the\nusability of https://rvm.io but we must always ask that you first please check the documentation\nif you are requesting a feature or if you are not sure if you did it right.\n\n### Try again with latest RVM\n\nWe try to release a new RVM as soon as we feel that we achieved certain stability. This might take\na while and it could be the case that your issue has been already resolved in our development branch.\nPlease get the latest RVM and try again:\n\n`rvm get master`\n\n### File an issue\n\nIf the documentation is not clear, an error message is not clear or you are stuck with the problem,\nplease do file a bug.\n\nWhen in doubt as to whether your issue might relate to another, simply file a new bug, and\nwe will mark it as duplicate if it needs to be.  It's always better to file a new ticket and\nlet us sort it out than to accidentally add noise to another ticket.\n\nFor filing issues, we have prepared a template for you to use. Please try to fill all sections as best as you can.\nAlways make sure to split up each command and its output into its own fenced code block.\nIf the output is long, please put it in a separate [gist](https://gist.github.com).\nOtherwise it's hard for us to process all the information and respond quickly.\n\nNote that if there is a lot of `debug` or `trace` output you can redirect it to a file with the `>`\ncharacter like `rvm [command] > output.txt`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nYou are very warmly welcome to help.
