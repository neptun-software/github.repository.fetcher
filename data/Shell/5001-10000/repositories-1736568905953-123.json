You have been warned.\n* If you want to use hibernate instead of suspend, you need to create a swap partition or file, please follow your distribution's instructions (or [here][hibernate-setup]).\n\n### Support\n\nIf you have questions or need support, please join our [Matrix Space][matrix-space]!\nThis space contains\n- a [support channel][matrix-support] for general support and\n- a [development channel][matrix-development] for all development related questions and discussions.\n\n## License\nThis repository contains patches, which are either derivative work targeting a specific already licensed source, i.e. parts of the Linux kernel, or introduce new parts to the Linux kernel.\nThese patches fall thus, if not explicitly stated otherwise, under the license of the source they are targeting, or if they introduce new code, the license they explicitly specify inside of the patch.\nPlease refer to the specific patch and source in question for further information.\nLicense texts can be obtained at https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/LICENSES.\n\n[wiki]: https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki\n[wiki-setup]: https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Installation-and-Setup\n[wiki-compiling]: https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Compiling-the-Kernel-from-Source\n[wiki-encryption]: https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Disk-Encryption\n\n[matrix-space]: https://matrix.to/#/#linux-surface:matrix.org\n[matrix-support]: https://matrix.to/#/#linux-surface-support:matrix.org\n[matrix-development]: https://matrix.to/#/#linux-surface-development:matrix.org\n\n[hibernate-setup]: https://fitzcarraldoblog.wordpress.com/2018/07/14/configuring-lubuntu-18-04-to-enable-hibernation-using-a-swap-file\n[releases]: https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/releases\n\n[linux-surface-kernel]: https://github.com/linux-surface/kernel/\n"
