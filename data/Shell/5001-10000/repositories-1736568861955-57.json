          "content": "# holman does dotfiles\n\nYour dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.\n\nI was a little tired of having long alias files and everything strewn about\n(which is extremely common on other dotfiles projects, too). That led to this\nproject being much more topic-centric. I realized I could split a lot of things\nup into the main areas I used (Ruby, git, system libraries, and so on), so I\nstructured the project accordingly.\n\nIf you're interested in the philosophy behind why projects like these are\nawesome, you might want to [read my post on the\nsubject](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/).\n\n## topical\n\nEverything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your\nforked dotfiles — say, \"Java\" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put\nfiles in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically\nincluded into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get\nsymlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `script/bootstrap`.\n\n## what's inside\n\nA lot of stuff. Seriously, a lot of stuff. Check them out in the file browser\nabove and see what components may mesh up with you.\n[Fork it](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/fork), remove what you don't\nuse, and build on what you do use.\n\n## components\n\nThere's a few special files in the hierarchy.\n\n- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made\n  available everywhere.\n- **topic/\\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your\n  environment.\n- **topic/path.zsh**: Any file named `path.zsh` is loaded first and is\n  expected to setup `$PATH` or similar.\n- **topic/completion.zsh**: Any file named `completion.zsh` is loaded\n  last and is expected to setup autocomplete.\n- **topic/install.sh**: Any file named `install.sh` is executed when you run `script/install`. To avoid being loaded automatically, its extension is `.sh`, not `.zsh`.\n- **topic/\\*.symlink**: Any file ending in `*.symlink` gets symlinked into\n  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles\n  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get\n  symlinked in when you run `script/bootstrap`.\n\n## install\n\nRun this:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles\ncd ~/.dotfiles\nscript/bootstrap\n```\n\nThis will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory.\nEverything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`.\n\nThe main file you'll want to change right off the bat is `zsh/zshrc.symlink`,\nwhich sets up a few paths that'll be different on your particular machine.\n\n`dot` is a simple script that installs some dependencies, sets sane macOS\ndefaults, and so on. Tweak this script, and occasionally run `dot` from\ntime to time to keep your environment fresh and up-to-date. You can find\nthis script in `bin/`.\n\n## bugs\n\nI want this to work for everyone; that means when you clone it down it should\nwork for you even though you may not have `rbenv` installed, for example. That\nsaid, I do use this as _my_ dotfiles, so there's a good chance I may break\nsomething if I forget to make a check for a dependency.\n\nIf you're brand-new to the project and run into any blockers, please\n[open an issue](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles/issues) on this repository\nand I'd love to get it fixed for you!\n\n## thanks\n\nI forked [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb)' excellent\n[dotfiles](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles) for a couple years before the\nweight of my changes and tweaks inspired me to finally roll my own. But Ryan's\ndotfiles were an easy way to get into bash customization, and then to jump ship\nto zsh a bit later. A decent amount of the code in these dotfiles stem or are\ninspired from Ryan's original project.\n"
