Spinnaker provides a single platform that allows you to safely deploy and manage your application in multiple cloud environments (AWS, GCP, Kubernetes and more!).  With automated canary analysis and multiple ways to initiate deployments, you can safely promote your code from a git commit into a dev environment all the way through multiple production environments with confidence in the results.  Spinnaker is the most mature and widely productionalized continuous delivery platform built upon the work of Netflix, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and numerous other companies to allow fast, safe deploys. Used by numerous organizations including Target, Salesforce, Airbnb, Cerner, Adobe, JPMorgan Chase and more!  \n\n= Project status and updates\n\nNote that this repo is only used for issue tracking across the various services at this time.  Releases are not managed here nor are updates regularly made to this repository.  Please see the following for more information about spinnaker and it's state:\n\n- https://spinnaker.io/docs/releases/versions/[Current available versions]\n- https://join.slack.com/t/spinnakerteam/shared_invite/zt-7juwxmx0-nQ4Ud4pJcbuPykX3SXwQrg[The spinnaker slack for help and discussions around spinnaker]\n- https://github.com/spinnaker/spinnaker/issues[Issues page for bug reports, enhancements and similar]\n- https://github.com/spinnaker/governance/[Governance for the project as a whole]\nThere is a lot of activity and we'd welcome participation! \n\n= More about spinnaker\n\n\nManage your SDLC in Spinnaker using the GUI (graphical user interface), or config-as-code. View, manage, and construct https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#application[application] workflows involving one or all of these resources:\n\n- https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/pipeline/stages/#bake[Virtual machine (VM) deployments to a public cloud provider], \"baked\" as immutable infrastructure\n- https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/providers/[Container deployments to a cloud]\n- https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/deploy-manifest/[Container deployments to Kubernetes]\n- https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#load-balancer[Load balancers]\n- Security groups\n- https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#server-group[Server groups]\n- https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#cluster[Clusters]\n- https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#firewall[Firewalls]\n- Functions\n\nFacilitate GitOps, and grant developers control of provisioning infrastructure for apps. Use Spinnaker’s Clouddriver to deploy to all of the major public cloud providers and Kubernetes. You may even orchestrate configuration and firmware changes as part of Spinnaker delivery https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/#pipeline[pipelines].\n\n= Why Do I Need Spinnaker?\n\nUse Spinnaker to create a “paved road” for application delivery, with guardrails that ensure only valid infrastructure and configuration reach production.\n\nFree development teams from burdensome ops provisioning while automating reinforcement of business and regulatory requirements. Delivery automation strategies such as canary deployments provide the safety necessary to capture value from quick innovation, while protecting against business and end-user impact.\n \n= Tech Specs\n\nSpinnaker consists of a number of https://www.spinnaker.io/reference/architecture/[independent microservices], with the https://github.com/spinnaker/halyard[Halyard CLI tool] or the https://www.armory.io/spinnaker-community/spinnaker-operator/[Kubernetes Operator] (Beta)\nmanaging the lifecycle of the other services. A https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/setup/other_config/[variety of SDLC tools] integrate with Spinnaker, and its plugin framework makes Spinnaker more easily customizable to your needs. Plugins allow us to add system integrations without updating Spinnaker, broadening its potential\nto easily leverage the entire software delivery toolchain. With this in place, Spinnaker is evolving towards a smaller threat surface,\nenabling performance and operational advantages. Meanwhile, managed delivery, a newer Spinnaker featureset, provides declarative definitions of common\ninfrastructure and other requirements; users can declare requirements using those\nprebuilt definitions and move changes through environments via a visual interface.\n\n'''\n\nThis repository centralizes issue tracking across Spinnaker for each microservice. \nThe core code making up Spinnaker’s microservices is found in the other https://github.com/spinnaker[Spinnaker repositories].\n\n= Using Spinnaker\n\nSpinnaker users should refer to the main\nhttps://www.spinnaker.io/[Spinnaker site] and https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/setup/[Installation] guide.\n\nFor more information on how Spinnaker is designed, see the https://www.spinnaker.io/docs/concepts/[Concepts] topic in the documentation Overview.\n\nIf you're interested in a detailed walkthrough of the Spinnaker systems, check the https://spinnaker.io/guides/[Spinnaker How-to guides, videos, and codelabs].\n\n= Setting Up Spinnaker For Development\n\nTo pull Spinnaker from source and set it up to run locally against any of the https://www.spinnaker.io/setup/install/providers/#supported-providers[Cloud Providers], follow the https://spinnaker.io/docs/community/contributing/code/developer-guides/dev-env/getting-set-up/[Developer Setup Guide]\n"
