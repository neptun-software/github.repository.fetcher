The\nfollowing considerations are for informational purposes only, are not\nexhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.\n\n     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are\n     intended for use by those authorized to give the public\n     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any\n     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-\n     licensed material, or material used under an exception or\n     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:\n\twiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors\n\n     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable.

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a\ncontract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your\nacceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You\nsuch rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from\nmaking the Licensed Material available under these terms and\nconditions.\n\n\nSection 1 -- Definitions.\n\n  a.

For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed\n     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,\n     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is\n     synched in timed relation with a moving image.\n\n  b.

For purposes of this Public License, the rights\n     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar\n     Rights.\n\n  e. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the\n     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws\n     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright\n     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international\n     agreements.\n\n  f. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or\n     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights\n     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.\n\n  g.

Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,\n     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public\n     License.\n\n  i. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the\n     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to\n     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the\n     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.\n\n  j. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights\n     under this Public License.\n\n  k.

You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5. Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.\n               Every recipient of Adapted Material from You\n               automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to\n               exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material\n               under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n            c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b. Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii. a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n  b. ShareAlike.\n\n     In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share\n     Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.\n\n       1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons\n          license with the same License Elements, this version or\n          later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.\n\n       2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the\n          Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition\n          in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and\n          context in which You Share Adapted Material.\n\n       3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms\n          or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological\n          Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the\n          rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n     portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,\n\n     including for purposes of Section 3(b); and\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n     terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\nlicenses.

加速功能，并实现每日自动更新，支持添加多个规则。（可选）\n* **增加更多的节点区域分组。**  增加包括英国、加拿大等国家的节点分组，参考本项目推荐机场的节点地区设定。\n* **增加若干冷门域名规则。**  增加了一些小众网站的直连规则，可以自己 PR 提交域名参与完善规则。  \n\n# 使用方法  \n准备好你的订阅链接，然后按照本项目 Wiki 中的对应部分对 OpenClash 进行设置：[OpenClash-设置方案](https://github.com/Aethersailor/Custom_OpenClash_Rules/wiki/OpenClash-设置方案)  \n方案中已包括了本项目订阅转换模板的使用方法。  \n以上方案非常详尽，只需按部就班设置即可。全部设置内容均基于 OpenClash 的 luci 设置页面，有手就行！  \n设置方案文字较多，务必逐字逐句认真阅读，不要忽略以防漏掉关键部分导致故障。且方案内含多处设置的讲解便于理解相关设置原理，有助于小白学习。  \n\n# 一些说明  \n## 关于个性化需求  \n由于本项目为自用目的，且个人时间有限，只能随缘更新，因此不提供个性化修改服务。  \n具体个性化实现方式，请参考 Wiki 中的对应章节：[个性化需求](https://github.com/Aethersailor/Custom_OpenClash_Rules/wiki/%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E#%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E4%B8%AA%E6%80%A7%E5%8C%96%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82)\n\n## 关于冷门国内域名收录问题  \n若需要添加少量需要直连的国内冷门域名，建议使用 OpenClash 的自定义规则功能，插入相关的规则条目。  \n如果希望本项目收录你认为需要直连的国内冷门域名，请参考 Wiki 对应章节：[关于国内冷门域名的收录](https://github.com/Aethersailor/Custom_OpenClash_Rules/wiki/%E5%85%B6%E4%BB%96%E8%AF%B4%E6%98%8E#%E5%85%B3%E4%BA%8E%E5%86%B7%E9%97%A8%E5%9B%BD%E5%86%85%E5%9F%9F%E5%90%8D%E7%9A%84%E6%94%B6%E5%BD%95)\n\n## 关于广告过滤  \n本项目借助 OpenClash 的“开发者选项”功能，实现不依赖第三方插件的广告过滤功能。  \n具体设置见 Wiki 中的方案：[广告拦截设置方案](https://github.com/Aethersailor/Custom_OpenClash_Rules/wiki/%E6%97%A0%E6%8F%92%E4%BB%B6%E5%B9%BF%E5%91%8A%E6%8B%A6%E6%88%AA%E5%8A%9F%E8%83%BD%E8%AE%BE%E7%BD%AE%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88)  \n其中提供了 Dnsmasq 格式和 hosts 格式的两种设置方法的示例，可以照抄，亦可自由设置其他任何符合格式要求的广告规则。\n\n## 关于 IPv6  \n谁说 OpenClash 不能和 IPv6 同时工作？  \n通过正确设置 OpenWrt 的 IPv6 功能以及 OpenClash，即可实现 IPv6 和 OpenClash 的完美兼容。在实现 IPv6 国内外分流代理的同时，还能完美通过 IPv6-Test 的国内和国外镜像站点测试。  \n\nOpenWrt 的 IPv6 设置方案见本项目的 Wiki：[OpenWrt-IPv6-设置方案](https://github.com/Aethersailor/Custom_OpenClash_Rules/wiki/OpenWrt-IPv6-设置方案)  \n\n## 订阅转换服务  \n本项目提供订阅转换后端服务，便于网络环境奇葩的用户使用。  \n如果 OpenClash 自带的订阅转换服务全部不可用，你可以使用本项目提供的订阅转换服务地址：  \n```\nhttps://api.asailor.org/sub\n```\n填写进“订阅转换服务地址”中即可生效。 \n\n## 不能上网？分流不正常？某些网站打不开？OpenClash 不能启动？\n出现故障请参考 [Wiki 中的故障排除部分](https://github.com/Aethersailor/Custom_OpenClash_Rules/wiki/%E6%95%85%E9%9A%9C%E6%8E%92%E9%99%A4)，内含常见问题的解决方法。  \n项目维护者可以确定，本项目的设置方案完美无瑕，建议不要从本项目的内容上找原因，以免浪费时间。某些特殊问题如 Google Play 更新问题涉及诸多原因，和模板本身并无关系。  \n\n## 在 OpenClash 之外的其他软件中是否可用？  \n理论上本项目的订阅转换模板是通用的，可以在任何 Clash 客户端下使用（例如 Stash）。  \n但是不建议在移动端设备上使用。由于规则过于复杂会导致移动设备耗电急剧增加，甚至影响上网体验。  \n\n适用于 iOS 下 Shadowrocket 的规则：https://github.com/Aethersailor/Custom_Shadowrocket_Rules  \n测试状态，尚不完善  \n\n\n# 机场推荐 \n## SSRDOG  \n`\n“SSRDOG（SG）是一個追求可靠、安全、高效、且高性價比的互聯網接入方案國際研發團隊，為您提供最安全的網絡加速服務！”\n`  \n\n本人长期使用的一家机场，价格和流量都比较适中，搭配本项目的设置方案以及订阅模板使用，体验保证拉满。\n\n### 机场特性：  \n- 全 IEPL 线路不过墙，特殊时期服务稳定\n- 低延迟大带宽，高峰时期油管 8K 视频秒开无压力\n- 节点覆盖地区全面，包含港台美日新欧等主流地区\n- 全部节点解锁 Netflix、Disney+、YouTube、TikTok、Spotify 等主流流媒体服务\n- 全部节点解锁 ChatGPT \n- 部分节点支持 IPv6 出站\n- 支持 UDP 转发和游戏加速，部分节点支持 FullCone 全锥形 NAT\n- 支持试用\n- 工单支持简体中文沟通且客服反应迅速\n\n注册链接：[SSRDOG 注册](https://dog1.ssrdog10.com/#/register?code=FnSb4oWM)  (链接包含 aff 信息，感谢支持！)\n\n本项目订阅模板的节点地区分类即参考了该机场的节点地区进行分类。  \n\nPS：该机场 Hong Kong 11-15 节点以及其他部分节点暂不支持 IPv6 出站，如果需要使用 IPv6 出站功能，建议在 订阅设置 > 排除节点中设置排除如下关键词，以避免使用非 IPv6 出站节点：  \nTraffic、GB、Expire、11、12、13、14、15  \n\n若不使用 IPv6 功能，建议只需屏蔽如下节点关键词：  \nTraffic、GB、Expire  \n不屏蔽不影响使用，只是会让节点列表看着更整洁一些  \n\n# 控制面板效果截图  \n历史截图，可能和当前版本不一致，仅供示意
