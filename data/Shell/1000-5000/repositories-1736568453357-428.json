The typeface is designed with more geometric accents to lend a technical and idiosyncratic feel—perfect for headers and pull-quotes. Made together with [Degarism](https://degarism.com/).\n\nHubot Sans is a [variable font](https://web.dev/variable-fonts/). Variable fonts enable different variations of a typeface to be incorporated into one single file, and are [supported by all major browsers](https://caniuse.com/?search=variable%20fonts).\n\n![hubot-sans](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99746865/200649171-0eb80908-df45-4fd5-9fc7-53403f5709da.png)\n\n## Usage\n\n For web, we recommend using `Hubot-Sans.woff2`. Define the font with a `@font-face` rule, set its **weight** and **stretch** ranges, and use it:\n\n ```css\n @font-face {\n   font-family: 'Hubot Sans';\n   src:\n     url('Hubot-Sans.woff2') format('woff2 supports variations'),\n     url('Hubot-Sans.woff2') format('woff2-variations');\n   font-weight: 200 900;\n   font-stretch: 75% 125%;\n }\n html {\n   font-family: 'Hubot Sans';\n }\n ```\n\n To reduce [CLS](https://web.dev/cls/), you can preload the font in the `head` of your document:\n\n ```html\n <link rel=\"preload\" href=\"Hubot-Sans.woff2\" as=\"font\" type=\"font/woff2\" crossorigin>\n ```\n\n## Styles\n| Style Name | Italic Name | Weight | Width |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ExtraLight Narrow | ExtraLight Narrow Italic | 200 | 75 |\n| Light Narrow | Light Narrow Italic | 300 | 75 |\n| Regular Narrow | Regular Narrow Italic | 400 | 75 |\n| Medium Narrow | Medium Narrow Italic | 500 | 75 |\n| SemiBold Narrow | SemiBold Narrow Italic | 600 | 75 |\n| Bold Narrow | Bold Narrow Italic | 700 | 75 |\n| ExtraBold Narrow | ExtraBold Narrow Italic | 800 | 75 |\n| Black Narrow | Black Narrow Italic | 900 | 75 |\n| ExtraLight | ExtraLight Italic | 200 | 100 |\n| Light | Light Italic | 300 | 100 |\n| Regular | Regular Italic | 400 | 100 |\n| Medium | Medium Italic | 500 | 100 |\n| SemiBold | SemiBold Italic | 600 | 100 |\n| Bold | Bold Italic | 700 | 100 |\n| ExtraBold | ExtraBold Italic | 800 | 100 |\n| Black | Black Italic | 900 | 100 |\n| ExtraLight Wide | ExtraLight Wide Italic | 200 | 125 |\n| Light Wide | Light Wide Italic | 300 | 125 |\n| Regular Wide | Regular Wide Italic | 400 | 125 |\n| Medium Wide | Medium Wide Italic | 500 | 125 |\n| SemiBold Wide | SemiBold Wide Italic | 600 | 125 |\n| Bold Wide | Bold Wide Italic | 700 | 125 |\n| ExtraBold Wide | ExtraBold Wide Italic | 800 | 125 |\n| Black Wide | Black Wide Italic | 900 | 125 |\n\n\n## License\nHubot Sans is licensed under the [SIL Open Font License v1.1](http://scripts.sil.org/OFL).\n"
