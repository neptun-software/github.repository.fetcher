          "content": "# nvm.fish\n\n> The Node.js version manager you'll adore, crafted just for [Fish](https://fishshell.com).\n\nNope, not [_that_](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) POSIX-compatible script. Built from scratch for [Fish](https://fishshell.com), this handy tool lets you juggle multiple active Node versions in a single local environment. Install and switch between runtimes like a boss, without messing up your home directory or breaking system-wide scripts.\n\n- 100% pure Fish—so simple to contribute to or tweak\n- <kbd>Tab</kbd>-completable for seamless shell integration\n- `.node-version` and `.nvmrc` support\n- [XDG Base Directory](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) compliant\n- No setup needed—it just works!\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):\n\n```console\nfisher install jorgebucaran/nvm.fish\n```\n\n## Quickstart\n\nInstall the latest Node release and activate it.\n\n```console\nnvm install latest\n```\n\nInstall the latest [LTS](https://github.com/nodejs/Release) (long-term support) Node release.\n\n```console\nnvm install lts\n```\n\nInstall an older LTS release by codename.\n\n> Installs `8.16.2`, the latest release of the Carbon LTS line.\n\n```console\nnvm install carbon\n```\n\nOr install a specific version of Node.\n\n> Supports full or partial version numbers, starting with an optional \"v\".\n\n```console\nnvm install v15.3.0\n```\n\nActivate a version you've already installed.\n\n```console\nnvm use v14\n```\n\nCheck out which versions you have installed (includes your system-installed Node if there is one).\n\n```console\n$ nvm list\n     system\n    v8.17.0 lts/carbon\n    v15.3.0\n ▶ v14.15.1 lts/fermium\n    v18.4.0 latest\n```\n\nOr list all the Node versions up for grabs.\n\n```console\nnvm list-remote\n```\n\nNeed to uninstall a version?\n\n```console\nnvm uninstall v15.3.0\n```\n\n## `.nvmrc`\n\nAn `.nvmrc` file is perfect for locking a specific version of Node for different projects. Just create an `.nvmrc` (or `.node-version`) file with a version number or alias, e.g., `latest`, `lts`, `carbon`, in your project's root.\n\n```console\nnode --version >.nvmrc\n```\n\nThen run `nvm install` to install or `nvm use` to activate that version. Works like a charm from anywhere in your project by traversing the directory hierarchy until an `.nvmrc` is found.\n\n```console\nnvm install\n```\n\n## `$nvm_mirror`\n\nChoose a mirror of the Node binaries. Default: https://nodejs.org/dist.\n\n## `$nvm_default_version`\n\nThe `nvm install` command activates the specified Node version only in the current environment. If you want to set the default version for new shells:\n\n```fish\nset --universal nvm_default_version v18.4.0\n```\n\n## `$nvm_default_packages`\n\nGot a list of default packages you want installed every time you install a new Node version?\n\n```fish\nset --universal nvm_default_packages yarn np\n```\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\n`nvm.fish` was established in 2016 by [**@jorgebucaran**](https://github.com/jorgebucaran) as the go-to Node.js version manager for Fish. It was inspired by the original [**nvm.sh**](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) created by [**@creationix**](https://github.com/creationix) and [**@ljharb**](https://github.com/ljharb). To use the original nvm in Fish, consider [**@FabioAntunes/fish-nvm**](https://github.com/FabioAntunes/fish-nvm) or [**@derekstavis/plugin-nvm**](https://github.com/derekstavis/plugin-nvm). We appreciate all of our contributors! ❤️\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE.md)\n"
