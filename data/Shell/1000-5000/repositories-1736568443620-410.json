We're currently working to bring it up to date and make it much better! As we're making some major changes, the content might be a bit mixed up, parts may be duplicated or missing, etc. Bear with us, it'll get better soon :-) To see what we're planning and to let us know what you think, see [issue 224](https://github.com/rust-lang/async-book/issues/224).\n\n## Requirements\n\nThe async book is built with [`mdbook`] ([docs](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html)), you can install it using cargo.\n\n```\ncargo install mdbook\ncargo install mdbook-linkcheck\n```\n\n[`mdbook`]: https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook\n\n## Building\n\nTo create a finished book, run `mdbook build` to generate it under the `book/` directory.\n\n```\nmdbook build\n```\n\n## Development\n\nWhile writing it can be handy to see your changes, `mdbook serve` will launch a local web\nserver to serve the book.\n\n```\nmdbook serve\n```\n"
