It's simply a very effective way of navigating, creating and editing text. Thus, it's natural that one would like to get Vim-like keybindings in as many programs we use as possible.\n\nThe intention of this collaborative list is to:\n* learn which programs/apps that you already use which you can enhance with Vim keybindings. Search in your browser with `ctrl/cmd + f`.\n* discover new programs that support Vim keybindings. In the need for a new file manager? Why not get one that has Vim keybindings?\n* be up-to-date and alive -- add new programs and extensions as they evolve!\n\nThere are of course already lists like this one floating around on the internet (see [Acknowledgments](#Acknowledgments)). While they are great, the issue is that they are not up-to-date with the latest developments. There are Vim-emulator add-ons being developed all the time! This is why this collaborative list was created.\n\n(yes, technically it is **vi**-like keybindings we talk about here, but most people know and Google for vim, thus vim is used here instead of vi).\n\n## Legend\nThe following symbols are used with each list item to make it clearer what kind of Vim keybindings support exist\n* :white_check_mark: - built-in support (possibly via a setting)\n* :heavy_plus_sign: - via addon/extension\n\nTerminology:\n* [TUI](https://itlaw.fandom.com/wiki/Text_user_interface) - Text User Interface\n\n**Tip**: navigate this file easily by using GitHub's built-in Markdown Table of Contents in the top left corner:\n<a href=\"#\" title=\"GitHub built-in Table of Contents for markdown files.\"><img src=\"img/github_md_toc.png\" width=\"256\" alt=\"ToC\"></a>\n\n\n\n\n# The Ultimate Vim Keybinding List\n\n## Debuggers\n* :white_check_mark: [cgdb](http://cgdb.github.io/) - a curses interface on top of the GDB debuger with keybindings modeled after vim.\n* :white_check_mark: [vimpdb](https://github.com/gotcha/vimpdb) - An integration of the python debugger `pdb` and vim.\n\n\n## Development\n* :white_check_mark: [ipython](https://ipython.org/) - Interactive Python shell. It no longer uses readline for input, so it must be configured in the ipython profile `~/.ipython/profile_default/ipython_config.py` itself ([reference](https://gist.github.com/sstirlin/c3c207b1052b613ab9554b4ebdfc3f35)):\n  * ```ini\n    c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode = \"vi\"\n    ```\n* :white_check_mark: [GHCi](https://wiki.haskell.org/GHC/GHCi) - Interactive Haskell environment. It uses [haskeline](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskeline) instead of readline.

You will likely see message: \"Unable to install extension 'vscodevim.vim' as it is not compatible with the current VS Code engine version\". If you see that message you should try earlier release.\n* :white_check_mark: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) - Data analysis and machine learning tool that allows you to combine executable Python code and rich text along with charts, images, HTML, LaTeX and more into a single document stored in Google Drive.

Tell git to use vim/nvim when editing commit messages, interactive rebase etc. by putting in your `~/.config/git/config`:\n  * ```ini\n    [user]\n        editor = vim\n    ```\n* :white_check_mark: [tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) - Text interface for git.

By configuring readline to use vi key bindings, you automatically get it for programs like `bash`, `irb`, `octave` etc. By default, readline has Emacs-like keybindings, but you can change that by putting this in your `~/.inputrc`:\n  * ```\n    set editing-mode vi\n    set keymap vi-insert\n    ```\n* :white_check_mark: [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) - The preferred method is to set Vi mode in `~/.inputrc` via readline, as you will get Vi mode automatically in all programs using the library. However, if you just want this for bash, put this in your bash startup file e.g. `~/.bashrc`:\n  * ```bash\n    set -o vi\n    ```\n* :white_check_mark: [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) - just put this in your ZSH startup file, most likely `~/.zshrc`:\n  * ```bash\n    bindkey -v\n    ```\n  * <details>\n      <summary>Extra text object keybindings</summary>\n\n    ```bash\n    # Add text object extension -- eg ci\" da(:\n    autoload -U select-quoted\n    zle -N select-quoted\n    for m in visual viopp; do\n        for c in {a,i}{\\',\\\",\\`}; do\n            bindkey -M $m $c select-quoted\n        done\n    done\n    ```\n    </details>\n  * :heavy_plus_sign: [zsh-vi-mode](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode) - A better and friendly Vim-mode plugin for zsh.\n* :white_check_mark: [fish](https://fishshell.com/) - Just add to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish` ([reference](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28445450/265508)):\n  * ```bash\n    fish_vi_key_bindings\n    ```\n* :white_check_mark: [tcsh](https://www.tcsh.org/) - Put this in your tcsh startup file e.g. `~/.tcshrc` ([reference](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mac-os-x/0596004583/ch04s02.html)):\n  * ```bash\n    bindkey -v\n    ```\n* :white_check_mark: [ksh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KornShell) - Put this in your ksh startup file e.g. `~/.kshrc`:\n  * ```bash\n    set -o vi\n    ```\n* :white_check_mark: [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh) - Put this in your config file e.g. `$nu.config-path`:\n  * ```nu\n    let-env config = {\n      # ...\n      edit_mode: vi,\n      # ...\n    }\n    ```\n\n * ✅ [pwsh](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/) - The Readline module offers support for convenient vim support. Add this to your `$Profile`:\n   *\n    ```\n     Import-Module PSReadLine\n     # enable Vim on the shell and as editor\n     $OnViModeChange = [scriptblock]{\n        if ($args[0] -eq 'Command') {\n            # Set the cursor to a blinking block.\n            Write-Host -NoNewLine \"`e[2 q\"\n        }\n        else {\n            # Set the cursor to a blinking line.\n            Write-Host -NoNewLine \"`e[5 q\"\n        }\n     }\n\n     Set-PsReadLineOption -EditMode Vi\n     Set-PSReadLineOption -ViModeIndicator Script -ViModeChangeHandler $OnViModeChange\n    ```\n   * This was collected from many github issues and posts. Powershell 5.1 for one reason or another refuses to change the cursor so the script to give\n    feedback does not work. Just remove it and it will still work, just no feedback of the mode you're in.\n * :white_check_mark: [xsh](https://xon.sh/) - Put this in your run control file `~/.xonshrc`:\n   * ```\n     $VI_MODE = True\n     ```\n\n## System-wide\n* :white_check_mark: [vim-anywhere](https://github.com/cknadler/vim-anywhere) - Spawn a vim buffer from any text input in the operating system.\n* :white_check_mark: [Homerow](https://www.homerow.app/) - Add vim-like navigation to any macOS app.\n* :white_check_mark: [kindaVim](https://kindavim.app/) - Get Vim motions all over macOS, in text fields, text areas, and other UI elements. \n* :white_check_mark: [Scrolla](https://scrolla.app/) - Scroll in macOS using Vim motions.\n* :white_check_mark: [sketchyvim](https://github.com/FelixKratz/SketchyVim) - Get vim-like navigation in any macOS text field.\n* :white_check_mark: [athame](https://github.com/ardagnir/athame) - Patches your shell to add full Vim support by routing your keystrokes through an actual Vim process.\n* :white_check_mark: ~[kommand](https://www.autohotkey.com/board/topic/42706-kommand-a-cross-application-vim-like-hot-key-solution/)~ - A cross-application Vim-like hot key solution.\n* :white_check_mark: [win-vind](https://github.com/pit-ray/win-vind) - Control the Windows GUI in the same way as Vim.\n\n## System Tools\n* :white_check_mark: [htop-vim](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/htop-vim/) - A patched version the [htop](https://htop.dev/) interactive process viewer that has vim keybindings for navigation.\n* :white_check_mark: [btop++](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop) - A resource monitor.
