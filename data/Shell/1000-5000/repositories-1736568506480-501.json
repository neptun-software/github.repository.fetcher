Specifically:\n\n- Thanks to the Icepick developers for making the Icepick, I initially forked it for earlier versions of Northstar and it was a great base to experiment with stuff on before moving to the custom launcher.\n- Thanks to everyone on R5R team for giving me advice on some later parts of development.\n- Thanks to everyone in the testing server for putting up with me and helping find bugs.\n- Thanks to everyone else that's helped, gave advice, all that.\n"
