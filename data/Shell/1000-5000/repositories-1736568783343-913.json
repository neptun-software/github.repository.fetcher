How do I reset the 2FA?](#q-ive-lost-my-second-factor-device-how-do-i-reset-the-2fa)\n\n### Q: I can connect to the VPN, but can't access the Internet\n\nUnfortunately, most Wireguard clients are a bit misleading in that regard. If you can connect to the VPN, but see very little data in the 'Received' column and can't access the Internet, this most likely means that **you actually can't connect to the VPN server**.\n\nThe most common reason for that is a firewall blocking the Wireguard port – either on the VPS side, or on the client side. Your VPS provider may apply some default firewall rules to your server, which you can edit in the web control panel of your VPS provider.\n\nAlternatively, your ISP may be blocking the default Wireguard port (51820/udp). This can be fixed by changing the port to something else (for examlpe, 12345), and re-running the playbook:\n\n```\ncd $HOME/ansible-easy-vpn\necho 'wireguard_port: \"12345\"` >> custom.yml\nbash bootstrap.sh\n```\n\n\n### Q: I've run the playbook succesfully, but now I want to change the domain name/username/password. How can I do that?\n\nA: Edit the variable files, and then re-run the script\n\n```\ncd $HOME/ansible-easy-vpn\nnano custom.yml \nansible-vault edit secret.yml\nbash bootstrap.sh\n```\n\n### Q: I get a \"Secure connection failed\" error when trying to access the Wireguard WebUI in the browser\n\nA: This usually means that Let's Encrypt has failed to generate the certificates for your domain name.\n\nThere are a few reasons why that might happen:\n\n1. Firewall misconfiguration (are the ports 80 and 443 open?)\n2. The server is behind NAT (make sure that the ports 80 and 443 are port-forwarded to the server's internal IP on the router)\n3. Let's Encrypt has time-limited your domain name (try a different domain name)\n\nCheck the Bunkerweb logs for more details:\n```\ndocker logs bunkerweb\n```\n\nYou can use the commands from the previous answer to change your domain name.\n\n### Q: I get \"500 Internal Server Error\" when trying to access the Wireguard WebUI in the browser\n\nA: Most likely, you chose to configure the e-mail functionality, but entered wrong SMTP credentials. Check out Authelia logs for details:\n```\ndocker logs authelia\n```\nYou can either disable e-mail functionality entirely, by removing the `email_password` variable from `secret.yml`, or enter the correct SMTP credentials. In both cases, you'll need to re-run the playbook after the changes have been made:\n```\ncd $HOME/ansible-easy-vpn\nansible-vault edit secret.yml\nbash bootstrap.sh\n```\n\n### Q: My SMTP credentials are correct, but I still get the HTTP 500 error, and the Authelia logs show an \"i/o timeout\" error\n\nA: This error message indicates that your VPS provider is blocking the SMTP ports (465/25).\n\n```\nerror dialing the SMTP server: dial tcp: lookup smtp.example.com: i/o timeout\"\n```\n\nAsk the provider to unblock the ports or disable the e-mail functionality by removing the `email_password` line from secret.yml and re-run the playbook:\n```\ncd $HOME/ansible-easy-vpn\nansible-vault edit secret.yml\nbash bootstrap.sh\n```\n\n### Q: I'd like to completely automate the process of setting up the VPN on my machines. How can I do that?\n\n1. Fork this repository\n2. Fill out the `custom.yml` and `secret.yml` files, either by running the `bootstrap.sh` script, or editing the files manually\n3. Remove `secret.yml` from .gitignore\n4. Commit and push the changes\n\nConsider making your repository private. Even though the Vault file is encrypted, it might be unsafe to make it publicly accessible.\n\n### Q: When I try to copy the SSH key to my Windows machine, I get an error\n\nA: On Windows, you might need to omit the `~/` before `.ssh`:\n```\ncd ~\nscp -P 22 root@65.109.141.154:/tmp/id_ssh_ed25519 .ssh/id_vpn_username\nssh -p 22 username@65.109.141.154 -i .ssh/id_vpn_username\n```\n\n\n### Q: I've lost my second factor device. How do I reset the 2FA?\n\nA: Log in to the server via SSH and execute the following commands:\n```\ndocker stop authelia && docker rm authelia\nsudo rm -rf /opt/docker/authelia\ncd $HOME/ansible-easy-vpn\nbash bootstrap.sh\n```\n"

          "content": "# Why is this project archived?\nTL;DR: It wasn't as \"easy\" as the name suggested, and took too much time to develop, test and debug.\n\n**Long version**\n\nWhen developing ansible-easy-vpn, I tried to come up with an easy turn-key solution that would work for everyone, no matter their knowledge of Docker, Ansible, Linux, etc.\n\nUnfortunately, due to just how different OS configurations and environments are across different VPS/cloud providers, this playbook does not work everywhere.\n\nMoreover, by presenting it as an \"easy\" solution that doesn't require a deep knowledge of Linux shell, Ansible or Docker, I obfuscated a lot of complexities in the setup, making it difficult for the end user to fix any potential errors. \n\nAt the same time, the errors in question were tricky to debug for me, since I'm not [eating my own dogfood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) and do not have time to test this playbook on every popular VPS/cloud server there is.\n\nFinally, this playbook was way too intrusive – it was made for setting up a single-purpose VPN server from scratch, taking care of automatic updates, SSH hardening and SSL certificates.\n\nHowever, most people would want to use their VPS for things other than just a VPN server, and due to the aforementioned reasons, modifying and extending this playbook is difficult unless you know Ansible and Docker well enough.\n\n# So what do I do now?\n\nIf you want to get rid of the services managed by this playbook, you will need to stop and remove the Docker containers, and delete their persistent storage:\n```bash\ndocker stop authelia wg-easy adguard-unbound-doh watchtower bunkerweb\ndocker rm authelia wg-easy adguard-unbound-doh watchtower bunkerweb\nsudo rm -rf /opt/docker\ndocker system prune -a\n```\nThe configuration for unattended upgrades, SSH and the non-root user created by the playbook will remain in place.\n\nIf you're interested in a similar setup, I recommend using this project as a starting point: https://github.com/notthebee/cloud-homeserver\n\nThis Compose project sets up other services and uses Traefik instead of Bunkerweb, but follows the same purpose – running Dockerized web applications on a cloud server, protected by Authelia.\n\nSo long, and thanks for all the fish!\n"
