For alternative getting started\nexperiences, you may want to try one of these options:\n\n- Start a\n  [free trial on Elastic Cloud](https://www.elastic.co/cloud/elasticsearch-service/signup),\n  our hosted service.\n- Read our\n  [Running the Elastic Stack on Docker](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-docker.html)\n  guide.\n- Take a look at [our Helm charts](https://github.com/elastic/helm-charts) for\n  launching the stack via Kubernetes.\n\n# stack-docker\nThis example Docker Compose configuration demonstrates many components of the\nElastic Stack, all running on a single machine under Docker.\n\n## Prerequisites\n- Docker and Docker Compose.\n  * Windows and Mac users get Compose installed automatically\nwith Docker for Windows/Mac.\n\n  * Linux users can read the [install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) or can install via pip:\n```\npip install docker-compose\n```\n\n* Windows Users must set the following 2 ENV vars:\n  * `COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1`\n  * `PWD=/path/to/checkout/for/stack-docker`\n    * for example I use the path: `/c/Users/nick/elastic/stack-docker`\n    * Note: you're paths must be in the form of `/c/path/to/place` using `C:\\path\\to\\place` will not work\n  * You can set these two ways:\n    1. Temporarily add an env var in powershell use: `$Env:COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1`\n    2. Permanently add an env var in powershell use: `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(\"COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS\", \"1\", \"Machine\")`\n      > Note: you will need to refresh or create a new powershell for this env var to take effect\n    3. in System Properties add the environment variables.\n\n\n* At least 4GiB of RAM for the containers. Windows and Mac users _must_\nconfigure their Docker virtual machine to have more than the default 2 GiB of\nRAM:\n\n![Docker VM memory settings](screenshots/docker-vm-memory-settings.png)\n\n* Linux Users must set the following configuration as `root`:\n\n```\nsysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144\n```\nBy default, the amount of Virtual Memory [is not enough](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html).\n\n\n## Starting the stack\n\nFirst we need to:\n\n1. set default password\n2. create keystores to store passwords\n3. install dashboards, index patterns, etc.. for beats and apm\n\nThis is accomplished using the setup.yml file:\n```\ndocker-compose -f setup.yml up\n```\n\nPlease take note after the setup completes it will output the password\nthat is used for the `elastic` login.\n\nNow we can launch the stack with `docker-compose up -d` to create a demonstration Elastic Stack with\nElasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Auditbeat, Metricbeat, Filebeat, Packetbeat,\nand Heartbeat.\n\nPoint a browser at [`http://localhost:5601`](http://localhost:5601) to see the results.\n> *NOTE*: Elasticsearch is now setup with self-signed certs.\n\nLog in with `elastic` and what ever your auto generated elastic password is from the\nsetup.\n"
