          "content": "Continuity Activation Tool\n==========================\n\nThis tool makes the necessary changes to enable OS X 10.10 and 10.11 Continuity features on compatible hardware. Continuity features activated by this tool include Handoff, Instant Hotspot, and New Airdrop.\nOS X 10.11 (El Capitan) dongle support is not stable yet!\n\nPlease check the [Wiki](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/wiki) before using this tool and opening any issues that are already referenced in the Wiki!\n\nUse the latest beta if you are on **macOS Sierra**. [Download latest beta](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/archive/beta.zip)\n\n## News\n2016-06-13: **macOS Sierra** ~~The work on the newest version of macOS will begin as soon a possible.~~ CAT mostly works fine with Sierra! (New Features like auto-unlock still need to be tested). New updates will be released on the beta branch while macOS Sierra is in beta!\n\n2016-06-13: **wiki page** A wiki page has been erstablished and will be used to suggest fixes for the most common issues. A issue template was added to help the users provide more details.\n\n2015-10-09 : **Version 2.1.3** Merged with the beta version. Should now work on 10.10 - 10.11\n\n2015-08-13 : **New active lead** : I (sysfloat) will now be the main contributer and manager of the project, since dokterdok is not able to support this project anymore. He supported me with a lot of stuff and his research into enabling Continuity with dongles. I will contact some old beta testers and will do my best to get the dongles working on El Capitan and merge my fork with the beta branch.\n\nDec. 14 2014 : **Continuity Activation Tool 2.0 released** : Adds compatibility with Bluetooth 4.0 USB dongles, allowing many Macs from 2008 and later to easily upgrade to Continuity. See the chart below to verify available upgrade options.\n\n**[Download link](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/archive/master.zip)**\n=======\n\n## Features\n* Activate Continuity: Does a Continuity compatibility check, makes a backup of the Systems kexts before and after patching, applies patches relevant to the current configuration.\n* System Diagnostic: Produces a report of the current system parameters influencing Continuity.\n* Uninstall: Rolls back any changes applied by the tool. It firsts looks for previous backups made with the tool, and if it can't find any, kexts from the OS X Recovery Disk are reinstalled. It will only reactivate OS kext signature protection if it is sure that all system kexts installed are signed and valid, to prevent potential boot time issues with 3rd party tools or hardware.\n\n## Issues\n\nBefore submitting a new issue please check the Wiki for common issues! When submitting a new issue please check if there's already an issue open.\n\nPlease fill out the template as detailed as possible.\n\nIssues that do not follow the rules and are unclear on the issue might get deleted without help!\n\n## Warning\n* You should exercise caution when using the Continuity Activation Tool, as it moves around low level files and there's a possibility it could cause problems. Using this tool is at your own risk. Always use the latest version of the tool to avoid issues.\n* The tool disables the verification of original Apple drivers in order to work, which lowers the overall system security.\n\n## How to use it\n\n**From Finder**\n\n1. Download the zip (link on the right) and extract it.\n2. Double-click on the app.\n3. Follow instructions on the screen. Ignore or deny any \"Access to accessibility features\" prompt.\n\n**From the command line**\n\nScript location: ```Continuity Activation Tool.app/Contents/Resources/contitool.sh```\n\nUsage: ```sudo contitool.sh -a | -d | -f | -h | -r | -z```\n\nOptions:\n```\n-a               run the compatibility checks and activation procedure\n-d               run the system diagnostic procedure and quit\n-f               force the activation procedure without compatibility checks\n-h               display a help message and quit\n-r               uninstall Continuity mods by directly using OS X recovery disk files\n-z               uninstall Continuity mods\n```\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf you run into issues:\n\n1. Make sure you understand the known limitations by reading the sections above carefully\n2. Go through the official Continuity [troubleshooting steps](http://support.apple.com/kb/TS5458)\n3. Search for similar issues in the [issues section](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues?q=is%3Aissue) or on [forums](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=20124161), a solution to your problem might exist already\n4. Create a [new issue](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/new) and include a description of the problem, the steps to reproduce it, and a System Diagnostic copy/paste from the latest version of the tool.\n\nDevelopers are more than welcome to contribute with bug fixes or improvements. In that case please upload changes to the [beta branch](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/tree/beta).\n=======\n4.

It fixes a bug where the uninstaller could in some cases re-activate OS kext signature protection even if unsigned kexts are installed. Trim Enabler users should not use the uninstallation feature from prior versions to avoid risks of issues at boot-time.\n\n**v.1.1.1 - 2014.11.12**\n* Further improved reliability with systems that can't find utilities due to an irregular PATH ([#9](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/9))\n\n**v.1.1.0 - 2014.11.11**\n\n* **New uninstallation feature**: new option to rollback all system changes applied by the tool. It firsts looks for previous backups made with the tool, and if it can't find any, kexts from the OS X Recovery Disk are used. It will only reactivate OS kext signature protection if it is sure that all system kexts installed are signed. The uninstallation can be also be called from the command line.

Previous behavior was to silently overwrite.\n* Removed the 13\" MacBook Pro 2010 from the compatibility list ([#28](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/28), pull [#29](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/pull/29))\n* Minor optimisations\n\n\n**v.1.0.1 -  2014.10.24**\n\n* Fixed a boot arguments overwriting bug, that could lead to a system failure in specific cases ([#1](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/1), [#15](https://github.com/dokterdok/Continuity-Activation-Tool/issues/15))\n* Fixed a kext-dev-mode bug that prevented the OS to disable its drivers protection\n* Fixed the strings utility presence check when the script is run from the command line\n* Added a disk reparation step at the start of the patching procedure, lowering failure risks on disks with permissions issues\n* Added a verification that sudo is still active before patching\n\n**v.1.0.0 - 2014.10.23**\n\n* Initial release\n\n### Thanks\n* To the >150 CAT 2.0 beta testers\n* Skvo\n* toleda\n* Lem3ssie (LAUTRU Mehdi)\n* UncleSchnitty\n* TealShark\n* Manic Harmonic\n* rob3r7o\n\n\nDavid Dudok de Wit (dokterdok)\n"
