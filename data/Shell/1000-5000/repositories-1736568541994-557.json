If you are using helm-secrets in your company or organization, we would like to invite you to create a PR to add your\ninformation to this [file](./USERS.md).\n\n## Installation\n\nSee [Installation](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/Installation) for more information.\n\n## Usage\n\nFor full documentation, read [GitHub wiki](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/Usage).\n\n### Decrypt secrets via protocol handler\n\nRun decrypted command on specific value files. \nThis method is preferred over the plugin command below. \nThis mode is used in [ArgoCD](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/ArgoCD-Integration) environments.\n\n```bash\nhelm upgrade name . -f secrets://secrets.yaml\n```\n\nSee [Usage](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/Usage) for more information\n\n### Decrypt secrets via plugin command\n\nWraps the whole `helm` command. Slow on multiple value files.\n\n```bash\nhelm secrets upgrade name . -f secrets.yaml\n```\n\n\n### Evaluate secret reference inside helm template\n\n*requires helm 3.9+; vals 0.20+*\n\nhelm-secrets supports evaluating [vals](https://github.com/variantdev/vals) expressions inside Helm templates with the flag `--evaluate-templates`.\n\n**secrets.yaml**\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: secret\ntype: Opaque\nstringData:\n  password: \"ref+awsssm://foo/bar?mode=singleparam#/BAR\"\n```\n\n**Run**\n```bash\nhelm secrets --evaluate-templates upgrade name .\n```\n\n## Cloud support\n\nUse AWS Secrets Manager or Azure KeyVault for storing secrets securely and reference them inside values.yaml\n\n```bash\nhelm secrets --backend vals template bitnami/mysql --name-template mysql \\\n  --set auth.rootPassword=ref+awsssm://foo/bar?mode=singleparam#/BAR\n```\n\nSee [Cloud Integration](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/Cloud-Integration) for more information.\n\n\n## ArgoCD support\n\nFor running helm-secrets with ArgoCD, see [ArgoCD Integration](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/ArgoCD-Integration) for more information.\n\n### Example\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\nkind: Application\nmetadata:\n  name: app\nspec:\n  source:\n    helm:\n      valueFiles:\n        - secrets+gpg-import:///helm-secrets-private-keys/key.asc?secrets.yaml\n        - secrets+gpg-import-kubernetes://argocd/helm-secrets-private-keys#key.asc?secrets.yaml\n        - secrets://secrets.yaml\n      # fileParameters (--set-file) are supported, too. \n      fileParameters:\n        - name: config\n          path: secrets://secrets.yaml\n        # directly reference values from Cloud Providers\n        - name: mysql.rootPassword\n          path: secrets+literal://ref+azurekeyvault://my-vault/secret-a\n```\n\n## Terraform support\n\nThe Terraform Helm provider does not [support downloader plugins](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-helm).\n\nhelm-secrets can be used together with the [Terraform external data source provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/external/latest/docs/data-sources/data_source).\n\n### Example\n\n```hcl\ndata \"external\" \"helm-secrets\" {\n  program = [\"helm\", \"secrets\", \"decrypt\", \"--terraform\", \"../../examples/sops/secrets.yaml\"]\n}\n\nresource \"helm_release\" \"example\" {\n  \n\n  values = [\n    file(\"../../examples/sops/values.yaml\"),\n    base64decode(data.external.helm-secrets.result.content_base64),\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nAn example of how to use helm-secrets with Terraform can be found in [examples/terraform](examples/terraform/helm.tf).\n\n## Secret backends\n\nhelm-secrets support multiple secret backends.\nCurrently, [sops](https://github.com/getsops/sops) and [vals](https://github.com/variantdev/vals/) are supported.\n\nSee [Secret-Backends](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/Secret-Backends) how to use them.\n\n## Documentation\n\nAdditional documentation, resources and examples can be found [here](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets/wiki/Usage).\n\n## Moving parts of project\n\n- [`scripts/run.sh`](scripts/run.sh) - Main helm-secrets plugin code for all helm-secrets plugin actions available in `helm secrets help` after plugin install\n- [`scripts/backends`](scripts/lib/backends) - Location of the in-tree secrets backends\n- [`scripts/commands`](scripts/commands) - Sub Commands of `helm secrets` are defined here.\n- [`scripts/lib`](scripts/lib) - Common functions used by `helm secrets`.\n- [`scripts/wrapper`](scripts/wrapper) - Wrapper scripts for Windows systems.\n- [`tests`](tests) - Test scripts to check if all parts of the plugin work. Using test assets with PGP keys to make real tests on real data with real encryption/decryption. See [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md) for more information.\n- [`examples`](examples) - Some example secrets.yaml\n\n## Open Source Sponsors\n\nThanks to all sponsors!\n\n* [@hegawa](https://github.com/hegawa) (25$) onetime\n\n## Copyright and license\n\n© 2020-2022 [Jan-Otto Kröpke (jkroepke)](https://github.com/jkroepke/helm-secrets)\n\n© 2017-2020 [Zendesk](https://github.com/zendesk/helm-secrets)\n\nLicensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](LICENSE)\n\n## Thanks\n\n- [JetBrains IDEs](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=jkroepke)\n\n[![JetBrains-Logo (Haupt) logo](https://resources.jetbrains.com/storage/products/company/brand/logos/jb_beam.svg)](https://www.jetbrains.com/?from=jkroepke)\n"
