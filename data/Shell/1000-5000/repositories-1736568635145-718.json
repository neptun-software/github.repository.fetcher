Add back `\"image\": \"zigbee2mqtt/zigbee2mqtt-edge-{arch}\"` to `zigbee2mqtt-edge/config.json` after you're done.\n\n# Upgrading the Zigbee2MQTT version\n1. Change the version number in `zigbee2mqtt/config.json`: `\"version\": \"$NEW_VERSION\"`\n2. Update `zigbee2mqtt/CHANGELOG.md`\n3. Commit the changes to `master` branch\n4. Wait till ci finishes\n5. Publish a new \"Release\". Very important you specify Target: master. Example\n```\nTag version: v1.25.2-1  @ Target: master\nRelease title: v1.25.2-1\n```\n\n# Developing against the Home Assistant container\n\nWhen you want to check the impact of developing work, e.g. adjusting devices in [zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters), you need access to the add-on container in Home Assistant. Here's how:\n\nüö® Following these directions will make your Home Assistant system more prone to misconfiguration (by yourself) to the extent of rendering it completely useless, so only touch what you're confident to and \"know what you do\". \n\n1. install the [Portainer add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-portainer) from the Add-on store\n2. Make sure to disable its `Protection mode`:\n  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1125168/118788032-aa316800-b893-11eb-8567-f2122159f64c.png)\n3. Start Portainer and `Open Web UI`\n4. in the left menu,\n    1. head to `Settings` > section *Hidden Containers* and remove `io.hass.type`: `addon`\n    2. go to `Containers`, `addon_[‚Ä¶]_zigbee2mqtt`, `Console`, `Connect`\n5. ‚ÑπÔ∏è the location of zigbee-herdsman-converters for example is `/app/node_modules/zigbee-herdsman-converters`\n6. make your adjustments by copying or `vi`'ing\n7. Still in portainer, go back to the add-on's container and `Restart`\n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Note that restarting the add-on via Supervisor or further down the stack will revert the file changes.\n\nAfter work is done, don't forget to clean up and reintroduce the safety measures:\n1. re-add the filter `io.hass.type`: `addon` for *Hidden Containers*\n2. re-activate the \"Protection mode\" of the Portainer\n"

If you don't have an MQTT broker yet; in Home Assistant go to **[Settings ‚Üí Add-ons ‚Üí Add-on store](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_store/)** and install the **[Mosquitto broker](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=core_mosquitto)** add-on, then start it.\n1. Go back to the **Add-on store**, click **‚ãÆ ‚Üí Repositories**, fill in</br> `https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt` and click **Add ‚Üí Close** or click the **Add repository** button below, click **Add ‚Üí Close** (You might need to enter the **internal IP address** of your Home Assistant instance first).  \n   [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fzigbee2mqtt%2Fhassio-zigbee2mqtt)\n1. The repository includes two add-ons:\n   - **Zigbee2MQTT** is the stable release that tracks the released versions of Zigbee2MQTT. (**recommended for most users**)\n   - **Zigbee2MQTT Edge** tracks the `dev` branch of Zigbee2MQTT such that you can install the edge version if there are features or fixes in the Zigbee2MQTT dev branch that are not yet released.\n1. Click on the add-on and press **Install** and wait till the add-on is installed.\n1. Click on **Configuration**\n   - If you are **not** using the Mosquitto broker add-on fill in your MQTT details (leave empty when using the Mosquitto broker add-on) under the `mqtt` section. Format can be found [here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/configuration/mqtt.html#server-connection), but skip the initial `mqtt:` indent. e.g.: <br>\n     ```yaml\n     server: mqtt://localhost:1883\n     user: my_user\n     password: \"my_password\"\n     ```\n     Note: If the `password` includes certain special characters (reserved by yaml specification), the enclosing quotes are required. So it is recommended to always quote it when in doubt.\n   - Since Zigbee2MQTT automatically attempts to detect the adapter, you can leave the `serial` section empty for now; we may need it later in step 7.\n   - Click **Save**\n   - **Tip:** it is possible to refer to variables in the Home Assistant `secrets.yaml` file (not the Zigbee2MQTT one!) by using e.g. `password: '!secret mqtt_pass'`\n   - **CAUTION:** settings configured through the add-on configuration page will take precedence over settings in the `configuration.yaml` page (e.g. you set `rtscts: false` in add-on configuration page and `rtscts: true` in `configuration.yaml`, `rtscts: false` will be used).\n1. Start the add-on by going to **Info** and click **Start**\n1. Wait till Zigbee2MQTT starts and press **OPEN WEB UI** to verify Zigbee2MQTT started correctly.\n   - If it shows `502: Bad Gateway` wait a bit more and refresh the page.\n   - If this takes too long (e.g. 2 minutes +) check the **Log** tab to see what went wrong.\n   - In case the add-on fails to start with the following error: `USB adapter discovery error (No valid USB adapter found). Specify valid 'adapter' and 'port' in your configuration.`, we need to fill in the `serial` section (which we skipped in step 5). Format can be found [here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/configuration/adapter-settings.html#adapter-settings), but skip the initial `serial:` indent. e.g.: <br>\n     ```yaml\n     adapter: zstack\n     port: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Texas_Instruments_TI_CC2531_USB_CDC___0X00124B0018ED3DDF-if00\n     ```\n     If you don't know the port and you have just one USB device connected to your machine try `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyAMA0`. Else use the [Home Assistant CLI](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/os#home-assistant-via-the-command-line) and execute `ha hardware info` to find out.\n\nFor more information see [the documentation](https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt/blob/master/zigbee2mqtt/DOCS.md).\n\n## Restoring data from a standalone installation\n\n1. Ensure that both environments are running the same version\n1. Ensure you can [SSH to your Home Assistant OS](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/howto-how-to-access-the-home-assistant-os-host-itself-over-ssh/263352) (NOT to the SSH Add-on)\n1. Backup your standalone environment `data` folder (possibly leaving out the `logs/` folder)\n1. Start the Zigbee2MQTT HA add-on with a non-existing `tty` device, to create the `data` folder\n1. Restore your `data` folder contents into `/mnt/data/supervisor/homeassistant/zigbee2mqtt`, e.g. via `scp -O -P 22222 -i  PATHTOUSEDSSHKEY ./data/* root@hass:/mnt/data/supervisor/homeassistant/zigbee2mqtt/`\n1. Configure your serial port and MQTT settings using the HA add-on configuration UI\n1. Edit the `/usr/share/hassio/homeassistant/zigbee2mqtt/configuration.yaml` file:\n   - Ensure that the serial port section matches the one configured with the UI\n   - Remove any irrelevant sections from the config (e.g. `mqtt` (if not needed), `advanced/log_syslog`, `frontend`)\n1. Start the add-on\n\n## Changelog\n\nThe format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).\n\nAll notable changes to this project will be documented in the [CHANGELOG.md](zigbee2mqtt/CHANGELOG.md) file.\n\nVersion for releases is based on [Zigbee2MQTT](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt) format: `X.Y.Z`.\n\nAny changes on the add-on that do not require a new version of Zigbee2MQTT will use the format: `X.Y.Z-A` where `X.Y.Z` is fixed on the Zigbee2MQTT release version and `A` is related to the add-on.\n\nEdge version will not maintain a CHANGELOG and doesn't have a version.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you find any issues with the add-on, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/zigbee2mqtt/hassio-zigbee2mqtt/issues) for similar issues before creating one. If your issue is regarding specific devices or, more generally, an issue that arises after Zigbee2MQTT has successfully started, it should likely be reported in the [Zigbee2MQTT issue tracker](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/issues).\n\nFeel free to create a PR for fixes and enhancements.\n\n### Testing changes locally\n\nIf you're submitting a PR and wish to test it locally:\n\n- Gain root access to your Home Assistant installation\n- In the Add-on Settings, Ensure \"Watchdog\" is turned off so the container isn't automatically restarted when it's stopped via the CLI\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1923186/198087147-7ab2ba1e-1a68-41b8-9a84-76b25b329786.png)\n\n- Enter the `zigbee2mqtt` container interactively.\n\n```\ndocker exec -it $(docker ps | grep zigbee2mqtt | cut -d\" \" -f 1) /bin/sh\n```\n\n- Edit the file you'd like to test & save.\n\n```\nvi node_modules/zigbee-herdsman-converters/converters/toZigbee.js\n```\n\n- Back on the Home Assistant installation, restart the `zigbee2mqtt` container\n\n```\ndocker restart $(docker ps | grep zigbee2mqtt | cut -d\" \" -f 1)\n```\n\n- Refresh the web UI and perform your testing.\n\n## Credits\n\n- [danielwelch](https://github.com/danielwelch)\n- [ciotlosm](https://github.com/ciotlosm)\n- [Koenkk](https://github.com/Koenkk)\n"
