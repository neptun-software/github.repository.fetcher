This is an example of how each script is organized to create a common file structure.\n* Use `#` or `#1`, `#2` .. as icon replacement in your scripts. Everyone use another icon font. So let the user decide which icon he wants to use.\n* Use `#!/bin/sh` as shebang. We don't know which shell is installed and we don't want to add a specific shell as a dependency.\n* Remove your colors unless they have a special function. This way scripts remain customizable.\n\n\n## Check your code\n\nUse `shellcheck` to check your shell scripts for possible errors. Otherwise, GitHub CI will do it for you. A good start to try [ShellCheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/) is their website.\n"

We write and collect scripts for Polybar!\n\nTo find out how to write and use your own scripts, read [Polybars wiki](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar/wiki).\n\nThis repository is not an exact blueprint. I guess every script has to be customized to make your Polybar unique. We cannot guarantee that all scripts will work because many scripts are written for very specific purposes. But we're trying.\n\nYour script isn't here yet? You have ideas to extend the scripts or descriptions? Send us your pull request or join us on freenode's `#polybar`.\n\n\n## Hall of Fame\n\nIs this your first time here? You should definitely take a look at these scripts:\n\n* [openweathermap-fullfeatured](polybar-scripts/openweathermap-fullfeatured)\n* [player-mpris-tail](polybar-scripts/player-mpris-tail)\n* [battery-combined-udev](polybar-scripts/battery-combined-udev)\n* [system-bluetooth-bluetoothctl](polybar-scripts/system-bluetooth-bluetoothctl)\n*

[system-usb-udev](polybar-scripts/system-usb-udev)\n* [updates-pacman-aurhelper](polybar-scripts/updates-pacman-aurhelper)\n* [info-hackspeed](polybar-scripts/info-hackspeed)\n\n\n##  Setup\n\n* Save the script of your choice somewhere at `~/.config/polybar/`.\n* Don't forget to make the script executable: `chmod +x ~/.config/polybar/script.sh`.\n* Copy the module settings into your configuration file.\n* Replace the appropriate icon strings in the script (e.g. replace `#1` with `ðŸŽ‰`).\n\n\n## all colors are beautiful\n\n[![updates-pacman-aurhelper](polybar-scripts/updates-pacman-aurhelper/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/updates-pacman-aurhelper/)\n[![system-cpu-temppercore](polybar-scripts/system-cpu-temppercore/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/system-cpu-temppercore/)\n[![notification-chess](polybar-scripts/notification-chess/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/notification-chess/)\n[![notification-reddit](polybar-scripts/notification-reddit/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/notification-reddit/)\n[![vpn-openvpn-isrunning](polybar-scripts/vpn-openvpn-isrunning/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/vpn-openvpn-isrunning/)\n[![inbox-imap-pythongpg](polybar-scripts/inbox-imap-pythongpg/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/inbox-imap-pythongpg/)\n[![openweathermap-fullfeatured](polybar-scripts/openweathermap-fullfeatured/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/openweathermap-fullfeatured/)\n[![ticker-crypto](polybar-scripts/ticker-crypto/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/ticker-crypto/)\n[![info-docker](polybar-scripts/info-docker/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-docker/)\n[![easteregg-pornhub](polybar-scripts/easteregg-pornhub/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/easteregg-pornhub/)\n[![info-airqualityindex](polybar-scripts/info-airqualityindex/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-airqualityindex/)\n[![player-mpris-simple](polybar-scripts/player-mpris-simple/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/player-mpris-simple/)\n[![battery-combined-tlp](polybar-scripts/battery-combined-tlp/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/battery-combined-tlp/)\n[![info-projecthamster](polybar-scripts/info-projecthamster/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-projecthamster/)\n[![system-usb-udev](polybar-scripts/system-usb-udev/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/system-usb-udev/)\n[![system-usb-udev](polybar-scripts/system-usb-udev/screenshots/2.png)](polybar-scripts/system-usb-udev/)\n[![openweathermap-simple](polybar-scripts/openweathermap-simple/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/openweathermap-simple/)\n[![info-pingrtt](polybar-scripts/info-pingrtt/screenshots/3.png)](polybar-scripts/info-pingrtt/)\n[![info-ssh-sessions](polybar-scripts/info-ssh-sessions/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-ssh-sessions/)\n[![openweathermap-detailed](polybar-scripts/openweathermap-detailed/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/openweathermap-detailed/)\n[![info-hackspeed](polybar-scripts/info-hackspeed/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-hackspeed/)\n[![info-xampp](polybar-scripts/info-xampp/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-xampp/)\n[![info-taskspooler](polybar-scripts/info-taskspooler/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-taskspooler/)\n[![network-publicip](polybar-scripts/network-publicip/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/network-publicip/)\n[![system-thinklight](polybar-scripts/system-thinklight/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/system-thinklight/)\n[![player-mpris-tail](polybar-scripts/player-mpris-tail/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/player-mpris-tail/)\n[![info-redshift-temp](polybar-scripts/info-redshift-temp/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-redshift-temp/)\n[![info-trash](polybar-scripts/info-trash/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-trash/)\n[![vpn-wireguard-wg](polybar-scripts/vpn-wireguard-wg/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/vpn-wireguard-wg/)\n[![vpn-wireguard-wg](polybar-scripts/vpn-wireguard-wg/screenshots/2.png)](polybar-scripts/vpn-wireguard-wg/)\n[![info-softwarecounter](polybar-scripts/info-softwarecounter/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-softwarecounter/)\n[![vpn-anyconnect-status](polybar-scripts/vpn-anyconnect-status/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/vpn-anyconnect-status/)\n[![dunst-snooze](polybar-scripts/dunst-snooze/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/dunst-snooze/)\n[![dunst-snooze](polybar-scripts/dunst-snooze/screenshots/2.png)](polybar-scripts/dunst-snooze/)\n[![player-cmus](polybar-scripts/player-cmus/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/player-cmus/)\n[![info-todotxt](polybar-scripts/info-todotxt/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-todotxt/)\n[![vpn-networkmanager-status](polybar-scripts/vpn-networkmanager-status/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/vpn-networkmanager-status/)\n[![info-wifinomadkronoplus](polybar-scripts/info-wifinomadkronoplus/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-wifinomadkronoplus/)\n[![info-wifionice](polybar-scripts/info-wifionice/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/info-wifionice/)\n[![network-localip](polybar-scripts/network-localip/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/network-localip/)\n[![updates-dnf](polybar-scripts/updates-dnf/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/updates-dnf/)\n[![system-eprivacy](polybar-scripts/system-eprivacy/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/system-eprivacy/)\n[![network-ipinfo.io](polybar-scripts/network-ipinfo.io/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/network-ipinfo.io/)\n[![system-gpu-optimus](polybar-scripts/system-gpu-optimus/screenshots/1.png)](polybar-scripts/system-gpu-optimus/)\n[![info-cava
