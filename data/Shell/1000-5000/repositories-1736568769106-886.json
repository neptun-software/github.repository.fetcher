[Wayland Development](https://github.com/mikeroyal/PipeWire-Guide#wayland-development)\n\n# Getting Started with PipeWire\n\n[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)\n\n[PipeWire](https://pipewire.org) is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia pipelines.It provides a low-latency, graph based processing engine on top of audio and video devices that can be used to support the use cases currently handled by both pulseaudio and JACK. PipeWire was designed with a powerful security model that makes interacting with audio and video devices from containerized applications easy. Nodes in the graph can be implemented as separate processes, communicating with sockets and exchanging multimedia content using fd passing. PipeWire was created by [Wim Taymans](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wtaymans), Principal Engineer at Red Hat and co-creator of the GStreamer multimedia framework.\n \n **Key features of PipeWire include:**\n \n   - Capture and playback of audio and video with minimal latency.\n   - Real-time Multimedia processing on audio and video.\n   - Multiprocess architecture to let applications share multimedia content.\n   - Seamless support for PulseAudio, JACK, ALSA and GStreamer applications.\n\n### YouTube Tutorials\n\n[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)\n\n[![You should use PipeWire...

The compositor can be a standalone display server running on Linux kernel modesetting and evdev input devices, an [X application](https://www.x.org/wiki/XServer/), or a wayland client itself.\n\n * [Wayland Architecture](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/architecture.html)\n\n * [Wayland Documentation](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/docs/html/)\n\n * [Sotfware Toolkits that have Wayland support right now](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/toolkits.html)\n\n * [Contribution instructions for Wayland](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n * [Contribution instructions for Weston](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n * [Reporting Wayland bugs](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/wayland/issues)\n\n * [Reporting Weston bugs](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston/issues)\n\n * [WSLG: X11 and Wayland Applications in Windows Subsystem for Linux(WSL2)](https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/9/contributions/611/attachments/702/1298/XDC2020_-_X11_and_Wayland_applications_in_WSL.pdf)\n\n * [Qt Wayland Compositor](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwaylandcompositor-index.html)\n\n * [Qt Wayland Compositor Examples](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwaylandcompositor-examples.html)\n\n * [Wayland on ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Wayland)\n\n * [Sway on ArchWiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Sway)\n\n * [Wayland on Ubuntu Wiki](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Wayland)\n\n * [Wayland on Debian Wiki](https://wiki.debian.org/Wayland)\n\n * [The Wayland Display Server on Fedora Docs](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/rawhide/system-administrators-guide/Wayland/)\n\n * [Wayland features on Fedora Project Wiki](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Wayland_features)\n\n * [Wayland on GNOME Wiki](https://wiki.gnome.org/Initiatives/Wayland)\n\n * [KWin/Wayland on KDE Community Wiki](https://community.kde.org/index.php?title=KWin/Wayland)\n\n * [Wayland Desktop Landscape on Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Wayland_Desktop_Landscape)\n\n * [Wayland in Void Linux Handbook](https://docs.voidlinux.org/config/graphical-session/wayland.html)\n\n * [Wayland on Enlightenment DE](https://www.enlightenment.org/about-wayland)\n\n## Wayland Tools\n\n[Back to the Top](#table-of-contents)\n\n[Weston](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston) is a lightweight and functional Wayland compositor.\n\n[XWayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/xserver.html) is an X Server running as a Wayland client(for backwards compatibility), allowing the [Xorg server](https://www.x.org/wiki/XServer/) can be modified to use wayland input devices for input and forward either the root window or individual top-level windows as wayland surfaces.\n\n[KWin](https://community.kde.org/KWin/Wayland) is the window manager for the KDE Plasma Desktop. It gives you complete control over your windows, making sure they're not in the way but aid you in your task. It paints the window decoration, the bar on top of every window with (configurable) buttons like close, maximize and minimize.\n\n[Qt](https://www.qt.io/) is the faster, smarter way to create innovative devices, modern UIs & applications for multiple screens. It is one of the most popular toolkits for the Wayland and X11 windowing.\n\n[GTK](https://www.gtk.org/) is a free and open source cross-platform widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces developed by [GNOME Project](https://www.gnome.org/). It is one of the most popular toolkits for the Wayland and X11 windowing.\n\n[NVIDIA Wayland EGL External Platform library](https://github.com/NVIDIA/egl-wayland) is a work-in-progress implementation of a EGL External Platform library to add client-side Wayland support to EGL on top of EGLDevice and EGLStream families of extensions.\n\n[NVIDIA EGL External Platform Interface](https://github.com/NVIDIA/eglexternalplatform) is a work-in-progress specification of the EGL External Platform interface for writing EGL platforms and their interactions with modern window systems on top of existing low-level EGL platform implementations. This keeps window system implementation specifics out of EGL drivers by using application-facing EGL functions.\n\n[Sway](https://swaywm.org/) is an [i3](https://i3wm.org/)-compatible Wayland compositor.\n\n[wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots) is a modular Wayland compositor library.\n\n[WayfireWM](https://github.com/WayfireWM/wayfire) is a 3D Wayland compositor, inspired by [Compiz](https://launchpad.net/compiz) and based on [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots).\n\n[SDDM](https://github.com/sddm/sddm) is a modern display manager for X11 and Wayland aiming to be fast, simple and beautiful. It uses modern technologies like QtQuick, which in turn gives the designer the ability to create smooth, animated user interfaces.\n\n[x11docker](https://github.com/mviereck/x11docker) is an application that you allows to run graphical desktop applications (and entire desktops) in Docker Linux containers.\n\n[Mako](https://github.com/emersion/mako) is alightweight notification daemon for Wayland. It also works on [Sway](https://swaywm.org/).\n\n[Wayland-rs](https://github.com/Smithay/wayland-rs) is a Rust implementation of the wayland protocol (client and server).\n\n[Wine-wayland](https://github.com/varmd/wine-wayland) is an application that allows you to running DX9/DX11 and Vulkan games using pure Wayland and Wine/DXVK.\n\n## Contribute\n\n- [x] If would you like to contribute to this guide simply make a [Pull Request](https://github.com/mikeroyal/PipeWire-Guide/pulls).\n\n## License\n[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/PipeWire-Guide#table-of-contents)\n\nDistributed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) Public License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).\n"
