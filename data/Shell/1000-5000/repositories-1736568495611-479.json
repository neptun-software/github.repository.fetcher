By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\f\n\t\t    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\f\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\f\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\f\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n\t\t\t    NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n\t\t     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\f\n\t    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software\n    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA\n\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n"

These are the most important things, even 200ms latency is\nsluggish to work over.\n\n\t* Allow 'surfing' at reasonable speeds while up or downloading\n\nEven though http is 'bulk' traffic, other traffic should not drown it out\ntoo much.\n\n\t* Make sure uploads don't harm downloads, and the other way around\n\nThis is a much observed phenomenon where upstream traffic simply destroys\ndownload speed. It turns out that all this is possible, at the cost of a\ntiny bit of bandwidth. The reason that uploads, downloads and ssh hurt\neachother is the presence of large queues in many domestic access devices\nlike cable or DSL modems.\n\n\t* Have the ability to mark certain hosts/ports as 'low priority'\n\nIf you *know* which hosts or ports are hogging your outgoing link, be able\nto deprioritize it.\n\nThe next section explains in depth what causes delays, and how we can fix\nthem. You can safely skip it and head straight for the script if you don't\ncare how the magic is performed.\n\nBefore emailing me or the mailinglist PLEASE read the 'known problems'\nsection.\n\nWhy it doesn't work well by default\n-----------------------------------\n\nISPs know that they are benchmarked solely on how fast people can download.\nBesides available bandwidth, download speed is influenced heavily by packet\nloss, which seriously hampers TCP/IP performance. Large queues can help\nprevent packetloss, and speed up downloads. So ISPs configure large queues.\n\nThese large queues however damage interactivity. A keystroke must first\ntravel the upstream queue, which may be seconds (!) long and go to your\nremote host. It is then displayed, which leads to a packet coming back,\nwhich must then traverse the downstream queue, located at your ISP, before\nit appears on your screen.\n\nThis HOWTO teaches you how to mangle and process the queue in many ways, but\nsadly, not all queues are accessible to us. The queue over at the ISP is\ncompletely off-limits, whereas the upstream queue probably lives inside your\ncable modem or DSL device. You may or may not be able to configure it. Most\nprobably not.\n\nSo, what next? As we can't control either of those queues, they must be\neliminated, and moved to your Linux router. Luckily this is possible.\n\nLimit upload speed somewhat\n---------------------------\n\nBy limiting our upload speed to slightly less than the truly available rate,\nno queues are built up in our modem. The queue is now moved to Linux. \n\nLimit download speed\n--------------------\n\nThis is slightly trickier as we can't really influence how fast the internet\nships us data. We can however drop packets that are coming in too fast,\nwhich causes TCP/IP to slow down to just the rate we want. Because we don't\nwant to drop traffic unnecessarily, we configure a 'burst' size we allow at\nhigher speed.\n\nNow, once we have done this, we have eliminated the downstream queue totally\n(except for short bursts), and gain the ability to manage the upstream queue\nwith all the power Linux offers.\n\nLet interactive traffic skip the queue\n--------------------------------------\n\nWhat remains to be done is to make sure interactive traffic jumps to the\nfront of the upstream queue. To make sure that uploads don't hurt downloads,\nwe also move ACK packets to the front of the queue. This is what normally\ncauses the huge slowdown observed when generating bulk traffic both ways.\nThe ACKnowledgements for downstream traffic must compete with upstream\ntraffic, and get delayed in the process.\n\nWe also move other small packets to the front of the queue - this helps\noperating systems which do not set TOS bits, like everything from Microsoft.\n\nAllow the user to specify low priority traffic (new in 1.1!)\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSometimes you may notice low priority OUTGOING traffic slowing down\nimportant traffic. In that case, the following options may help you:\n\nNOPRIOHOSTSRC\n\tSet this to hosts or netmasks in your network that should have low\n\tpriority\n\nNOPRIOHOSTDST\n\tSet this to hosts or netmasks on the internet that should have low\n\tpriority\n\nNOPRIOPORTSRC\n\tSet this to source ports that should have low priority. If you have\n\tan unimportant webserver on your traffic, set this to 80\n\nNOPRIOPORTDST\n\tSet this to destination ports that should have low priority. \n\nSee the start of wshaper and wshaper.htb\n\nResults\n-------\n\nIf we do all this we get the following measurements using an excellent ADSL\nconnection from xs4all in the Netherlands:\n\nBaseline latency:\nround-trip min/avg/max = 14.4/17.1/21.7 ms\n\nWithout traffic conditioner, while downloading:\nround-trip min/avg/max = 560.9/573.6/586.4 ms\n\nWithout traffic conditioner, while uploading:\nround-trip min/avg/max = 2041.4/2332.1/2427.6 ms\n\nWith conditioner, during 220kbit/s upload:\nround-trip min/avg/max = 15.7/51.8/79.9 ms\n\nWith conditioner, during 850kbit/s download:\nround-trip min/avg/max = 20.4/46.9/74.0 ms\n\nWhen uploading, downloads proceed at ~80% of the available speed. Uploads\nat around 90%. Latency then jumps to 850 ms, still figuring out why.\n\nWhat you can expect from this script depends a lot on your actual uplink\nspeed. When uploading at full speed, there will always be a single packet\nahead of your keystroke. That is the lower limit to the latency you can\nachieve - divide your MTU by your upstream speed to calculate. Typical\nvalues will be somewhat higher than that. Lower your MTU for better effects!\n\nA small table:\n\nUplink speed   |  Expected latency due to upload\n--------------------------------------------------\n32             |  234ms\n64             |  117ms\n128            |  58ms\n256            |  29ms\n\nSo to calculate your effective latency, take a baseline measurement (ping on\nan unloaded link), and look up the number in the table, and add it. That is\nabout the best you can expect. This number comes from a calculation that\nassumes that your upstream keystroke will have at most half a full sized\npacket ahead of it.\n\nThis boils down to:\n\n   mtu * 0.5 * 10\n   --------------  + baseline_latency\n       kbit\n\nThe factor 10 is not quite correct but works well in practice.\n\nYour kernel\n-----------\n\nIf you run a recent distribution, everything should be ok. You need 2.4 with\nQoS options turned on. \n\nIf you compile your own kernel, it must have some options enabled. Most\nnotably, in the Networking Options menu, QoS and/or Fair Queueing, turn at\nleast CBQ, PRIO, SFQ, Ingress, Traffic Policing, QoS support, Rate\nEstimator, QoS classifier, U32 classifier, fwmark classifier.\n\nIn practice, I (and most distributions) just turn on everything.\n\nThe scripts\n-----------\n\nThe script comes in two versions, one which works on standard kernels and is\nimplemented using CBQ. The other one uses the excellent HTB qdisc which is\nnot in the default kernel. The CBQ version is more tested than the HTB one!\n\nSee 'wshaper' and 'wshaper.htb'. \n\nTuning\n------\n\nThese scripts need to know the 'real' rate of your ISP connection. This is\nhard to determine upfront as different ISPs use different kinds of bits it\nappears. People report success using the following technique:\n\nEstimate both your upstream and downstream at half the rate your ISP\nspecifies. Now verify if the script is functioning - check interactivity\nwhile uploading and while downloading. This should deliver the latency as\ncalculated above. If not, check if the script executed without errors.\n\nNow slowly increase the upstream & downstream numbers in the script until\nthe latency comes back. This way you can find optimum values for your\nconnection. If you are happy, please report to me so I can make a list of\nnumbers that work well. Please let me know which ISP you use and the name of\nyour subscription, and its reputed specifications, so I can list you here\nand save others the trouble.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf you dial in, you can copy the script to /etc/ppp/ip-up.d and it will be\nrun at each connect.\n\nIf you want to remove the shaper from an interface, run 'wshaper stop'. To\nsee status information, run 'wshaper status'.\n\nKNOWN PROBLEMS\n--------------\n\nIf you get errors, add an -x to the first line, as follows:\n\n#!/bin/bash -x\n\nAnd retry.

          "content": "The Wonder Shaper 1.4.1\n==============\n\nCopyright\n-------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2002-2020 Bert Hubert <ahu@ds9a.nl>, Jacco Geul <jacco@geul.net>, Simon Séhier <simon@sehier.fr>, <corbolais@gmail.com>\n\nSee the ChangeLog for information on the individual contributions of the authors.\n\nAbout\n--------------\n\nWonder Shaper is a script that allows the user to limit the bandwidth of one or more network adapters. It does so by using iproute's tc command, but greatly simplifies its operation. Wonder Shaper was first released by Bert Hubert in 2002, but the original version lacked a command-line interface, from on version 1.2 this feature was added. From version 1.3, the HTB queuing is used instead of CBQ, allowing better bandwidth management on high speed (above ten megabits) links. In version 1.4 an improved ingress shaping method was implemented and the ability to limit either down or up (both is still possible too). The original README is a rather lengthy document and is saved under README.bhubert, for those who'd like some more background information. Except any notes on operation this document is considered up-to-date.\n\nInstallation\n--------------\n\n### Obtaining wondershaper\n\nIt is recommended to clone the GitHub repository of wondershaper such that you can pull in new updates at any time (if available). Open a new terminal and clone the repository using\n\n    git clone https://github.com/magnific0/wondershaper.git\n\nThis will clone wondershaper in your current folder in a new folder named wondershaper. Now enter the folder using\n\n    cd wondershaper\n\n### Using wondershaper\n\nYou can run wondershaper (as any user with sufficient permissions) without installation and stop following the instructions at this point. Show the wondershaper usage instructions by typing\n\n    ./wondershaper -h\n\nThe program details all available options on how to use wondershaper. Next is to pick an interface that you want to shape. You can see all available interfaces by typing\n\n    ip addr show\n\nNote that on older systems this command might not be available. In this case you should run ```ifconfig``` instead.\n\nIdentify the network interface that you want to shape. The names [differ per system](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/PredictableNetworkInterfaceNames/).\n\nIn the following example a wireless interface is limited to an [upload of 4Mbps and download of 8Mbps](http://whatsabyte.com/).\n\n    ./wondershaper -a wlp4s0 -u 4096 -d 8192\n\nIf you get messages telling you that ```RTNETLINK answers: Operation not permitted``` your user account does not have sufficient privileges. In that case try:\n\n    sudo ./wondershaper -a wlp4s0 -u 4096 -d 8192\n\n### System installation (optional)\n\nA makefile file provided for easy installation. The default location for wondershaper is in ```/usr/bin```. If you want to install to your system you can run:\n\n    sudo make install\n\nYou can verify that wondershaper was installed correctly by entering:\n\n    which wondershaper\n\nThis should return ```/usr/bin/wondershaper```. You can follow the same instructions as explained in the \"Using wondershaper\" section, but instead of running the local version of the program you now run the system version by removing the ```./``` from the beginning of each command. For example to show the help instructions again run:\n\n    wondershaper -h\n\n### Persistent usage of wondershaper (optional)\n\n\nInstead of using the commandline options to set the rates and interface as previously shown, it is necessary to set these parameters in the ```wondershaper.conf``` configuration file. You can edit this file using your favourite text editor (vim in the example below) as such:\n\n    sudo vim /etc/systemd/wondershaper.conf\n\nTo make sure wondershaper is reactivated on reboot a systemd service file is provided. First enable wondershaper as a systemd service using:\n\n    sudo systemctl enable --now wondershaper.service\n\nThis way wondershaper is activated with your setting upon reboot.\n\nUsage\n--------------\n\n        wondershaper [-hcs] [-a <adapter>] [-d <rate>] [-u <rate>]\n\nThe following command line options are allowed:\n\n- `-h` Display help\n\n- `-a <adapter>` Set the adapter\n\n- `-d <rate>` Set maximum download rate (in Kbps) and/or\n\n- `-u <rate>` Set maximum upload rate (in Kbps)\n\n- `-p` Use the presets in /etc/systemd/wondershaper.conf\n\n- `-f <file>` Use alternative preset file\n\n- `-c` Clear the limits from adapter\n\n- `-s` Show the current status of adapter\n\nThe different modes are:\n\n        wondershaper -a <adapter> -d <rate> -u <rate>\n\n        wondershaper -c -a <adapter>\n\n        wondershaper -s -a <adapter>\n\nSome examples:\n\n        wondershaper -a eth0 -d 1024 -u 512\n\n        wondershaper -a eth1 -d 94000 -u 94000  # could be used on a 100Mbps link\n\n        wondershaper -a eth1 -u 94000  # only limit upload\n\n        wondershaper -c -a eth0\n\n        wondershaper -p -f foo.conf\n"
