          "content": "# Dotfiles\n\nMy OSX / Ubuntu dotfiles.\n\n## About this project\n\nI've been using bash on-and-off for a long time (since Slackware Linux was distributed on 1.44MB floppy disks). In all that time, every time I've set up a new Linux or OS X machine, I've copied over my `.bashrc` file and my `~/bin` folder to each machine manually. And I've never done a very good job of actually maintaining these files. It's been a total mess.\n\nI finally decided that I wanted to be able to execute a single command to \"bootstrap\" a new system to pull down all of my dotfiles and configs, as well as install all the tools I commonly use. In addition, I wanted to be able to re-execute that command at any time to synchronize anything that might have changed. Finally, I wanted to make it easy to re-integrate changes back in, so that other machines could be updated.\n\nThat command is [dotfiles][dotfiles], and this is my \"dotfiles\" Git repo.\n\n[dotfiles]: bin/dotfiles\n\n## How the \"dotfiles\" command works\n\nWhen [dotfiles][dotfiles] is run for the first time, it does a few things:\n\n1. In Ubuntu, Git is installed if necessary via APT (it's already there in OSX).\n1. This repo is cloned into your user directory, under `~/.dotfiles`.\n1. Files in `/copy` are copied into `~/`. ([read more](#the-copy-step))\n1. Files in `/link` are symlinked into `~/`. ([read more](#the-link-step))\n1. You are prompted to choose scripts in `/init` to be executed. The installer attempts to only select relevant scripts, based on the detected OS and the script filename.\n1. Your chosen init scripts are executed (in alphanumeric order, hence the funky names). ([read more](#the-init-step))\n\nOn subsequent runs, step 1 is skipped, step 2 just updates the already-existing repo, and step 5 remembers what you selected the last time. The other steps are the same.\n\n### Other subdirectories\n\n* The `/backups` directory gets created when necessary. Any files in `~/` that would have been overwritten by files in `/copy` or `/link` get backed up there.\n* The `/bin` directory contains executable shell scripts (including the [dotfiles][dotfiles] script) and symlinks to executable shell scripts. This directory is added to the path.\n* The `/caches` directory contains cached files, used by some scripts or functions.\n* The `/conf` directory just exists. If a config file doesn't **need** to go in `~/`, reference it from the `/conf` directory.\n* The `/source` directory contains files that are sourced whenever a new shell is opened (in alphanumeric order, hence the funky names).\n* The `/test` directory contains unit tests for especially complicated bash functions.\n* The `/vendor` directory contains third-party libraries.\n\n### The \"copy\" step\nAny file in the `/copy` subdirectory will be copied into `~/`. Any file that _needs_ to be modified with personal information (like [copy/.gitconfig](copy/.gitconfig) which contains an email address and private key) should be _copied_ into `~/`. Because the file you'll be editing is no longer in `~/.dotfiles`, it's less likely to be accidentally committed into your public dotfiles repo.\n\n### The \"link\" step\nAny file in the `/link` subdirectory gets symlinked into `~/` with `ln -s`. Edit one or the other, and you change the file in both places. Don't link files containing sensitive data, or you might accidentally commit that data! If you're linking a directory that might contain sensitive data (like `~/.ssh`) add the sensitive files to your [.gitignore](.gitignore) file!\n\n### The \"init\" step\nScripts in the `/init` subdirectory will be executed. A whole bunch of things will be installed, but _only_ if they aren't already.\n\n#### OS X\n\n* Minor XCode init via the [init/10_osx_xcode.sh](init/10_osx_xcode.sh) script\n* Homebrew via the [init/20_osx_homebrew.sh](init/20_osx_homebrew.sh) script\n* Homebrew recipes via the [init/30_osx_homebrew_recipes.sh](init/30_osx_homebrew_recipes.sh) script\n* Homebrew casks via the [init/30_osx_homebrew_casks.sh](init/30_osx_homebrew_casks.sh) script\n* [Fonts](/cowboy/dotfiles/tree/master/conf/osx/fonts) via the [init/50_osx_fonts.sh](init/50_osx_fonts.sh) script\n\n#### Ubuntu\n* APT packages and git-extras via the [init/20_ubuntu_apt.sh](init/20_ubuntu_apt.sh) script\n\n#### Both\n* Node.js, npm and nave via the [init/50_node.sh](init/50_node.sh) script\n* Ruby, gems and rbenv via the [init/50_ruby.sh](init/50_ruby.sh) script\n* Vim plugins via the [init/50_vim.sh](init/50_vim.sh) script\n\n## Hacking my dotfiles\n\nBecause the [dotfiles][dotfiles] script is completely self-contained, you should be able to delete everything else from your dotfiles repo fork, and it will still work. The only thing it really cares about are the `/copy`, `/link` and `/init` subdirectories, which will be ignored if they are empty or don't exist.\n\nIf you modify things and notice a bug or an improvement, [file an issue](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles/issues) or [a pull request](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles/pulls) and let me know.\n\nAlso, before installing, be sure to [read my gently-worded note](#heed-this-critically-important-warning-before-you-install).\n\n## Installation\n\n### OS X Notes\n\nYou need to have [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=xcode) or, at the very minimum, the [XCode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?=command%20line%20tools), which are available as a much smaller download.\n\nThe easiest way to install the XCode Command Line Tools in OSX 10.9+ is to open up a terminal, type `xcode-select --install` and [follow the prompts](http://osxdaily.com/2014/02/12/install-command-line-tools-mac-os-x/).\n\n_Tested in OSX 10.15_\n\n### Ubuntu Notes\n\nYou might want to set up your ubuntu server [like I do it](https://github.com/cowboy/dotfiles/wiki/ubuntu-setup), but then again, you might not.\n\nEither way, you should at least update/upgrade APT with `sudo apt-get -qq update && sudo apt-get -qq dist-upgrade` first.\n\n_Tested in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS_\n\n### Heed this critically important warning before you install\n\n**If you're not me, please _do not_ install dotfiles directly from this repo!**\n\nWhy? Because I often completely break this repo while updating. Which means that if I do that and you run the `dotfiles` command, your home directory will burst into flames, and you'll have to go buy a new computer. No, not really, but it will be very messy.\n\n### Actual installation (for you)\n\n1. [Read my gently-worded note](#heed-this-critically-important-warning-before-you-install)\n1. Fork this repo\n1. Open a terminal/shell and do this (change `cowboy` and `master` as appropriate):\n\n#### Ubuntu\n\n```sh\nexport DOTFILES_GH_USER=cowboy\nexport DOTFILES_GH_BRANCH=master\nbash -c \"$(wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/$DOTFILES_GH_USER/dotfiles/$DOTFILES_GH_BRANCH/bin/dotfiles)\" && source ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n#### macOS\n\n```sh\nexport DOTFILES_GH_USER=cowboy\nexport DOTFILES_GH_BRANCH=master\nbash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/$DOTFILES_GH_USER/dotfiles/$DOTFILES_GH_BRANCH/bin/dotfiles)\" && source ~/.bashrc\n```\n\nSince you'll be using the [dotfiles][dotfiles] command on subsequent runs, you'll only have to set the `DOTFILES_GH_USER` variable for the initial install, but if you have a custom branch, you _will_ need to export `DOTFILES_GH_BRANCH` for subsequent runs.\n\nThere's a lot of stuff that requires admin access via `sudo`, so be warned that you might need to enter your password here or there.\n\n### Actual installation (for me)\n\n#### Ubuntu\n\n```sh\nbash -c \"$(wget -qO- https://bit.ly/cowboy-dotfiles)\" && source ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n#### macOS\n\n```sh\nbash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://bit.ly/cowboy-dotfiles)\" && source ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n## Aliases and Functions\nTo keep things easy, the `~/.bashrc` and `~/.bash_profile` files are extremely simple, and should never need to be modified. Instead, add your aliases, functions, settings, etc into one of the files in the `source` subdirectory, or add a new file. They're all automatically sourced when a new shell is opened. Take a look, I have [a lot of aliases and functions](source). I even have a [fancy prompt](source/50_prompt.sh) that shows the current directory, time and current git/svn repo status.\n\n## Scripts\nIn addition to the aforementioned [dotfiles][dotfiles] script, there are a few other [bin scripts](bin). This includes [nave](https://github.com/isaacs/nave), which is a [git submodule](vendor).\n\n* [dotfiles][dotfiles] - (re)initialize dotfiles. It might ask for your password (for `sudo`).\n* [src](link/.bashrc#L8-18) - (re)source all files in `/source` directory\n* Look through the [bin](bin) subdirectory for a few more.\n\n## Prompt\nI think [my bash prompt](source/50_prompt.sh) is awesome. It shows git and svn repo status, a timestamp, error exit codes, and even changes color depending on how you've logged in.\n\nGit repos display as **[branch:flags]** where flags are:\n\n**?** untracked files  \n**!** changed (but unstaged) files  \n**+** staged files\n\nSVN repos display as **[rev1:rev2]** where rev1 and rev2 are:\n\n**rev1** last changed revision  \n**rev2** revision\n\nCheck it out:\n\n![My awesome bash prompt](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7142/6754488927_563dd73553_b.jpg)\n\n## Inspiration\n<https://github.com/gf3/dotfiles>  \n<https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles>  \n(and 15+ years of accumulated crap)\n\n## License\nCopyright (c) 2014 \"Cowboy\" Ben Alman  \nLicensed under the MIT license.  \n<http://benalman.com/about/license/>\n"
