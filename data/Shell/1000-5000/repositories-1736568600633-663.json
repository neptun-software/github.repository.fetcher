When data is sent into the channel, the sender blocks until a receiver is ready. Likewise, a receiver will block until a sender is ready.\n\n```c\n#include <pthread.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"chan.h\"\n\nchan_t* chan;\n\nvoid* ping()\n{\n    // Send blocks until receiver is ready.\n    chan_send(chan, \"ping\");\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Initialize unbuffered channel.\n    chan = chan_init(0);\n\n    pthread_t th;\n    pthread_create(&th, NULL, ping, NULL);\n\n    // Receive blocks until sender is ready.\n    void* msg;\n    chan_recv(chan, &msg);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", msg);\n\n    // Clean up channel.\n    chan_dispose(chan);\n}\n```\n\nWith an unbuffered channel, the sender and receiver are synchronized, so the above program will print `ping`.\n\n## Buffered Channels\n\nBuffered channels accept a limited number of values without a corresponding receiver for those values. Sending data will not block unless the channel is full. Receiving data will block only if the channel is empty.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"chan.h\"\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Initialize buffered channel with a capacity of 2.\n    chan_t* chan = chan_init(2);\n\n    // Send up to 2 values without receiver.\n    chan_send(chan, \"buffered\");\n    chan_send(chan, \"channel\");\n\n    // Later receive the values.\n    void* msg;\n    chan_recv(chan, &msg);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", msg);\n\n    chan_recv(chan, &msg);\n    printf(\"%s\\n\", msg);\n\n    // Clean up channel.\n    chan_dispose(chan);\n}\n```\n\nThe above program will print `buffered` and then `channel`. The sends do not block because the channel has a capacity of 2. Sending more after that would block until values were received.\n\n## Closing Channels\n\nWhen a channel is closed, no more values can be sent on it. Receiving on a closed channel will return an indication code that the channel has been closed. This can be useful to communicate completion to the channel’s receivers. If the closed channel is buffered, values will be received on it until empty.\n\n```c\n#include <pthread.h>\n#include <stdint.h>\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"chan.h\"\n\nchan_t* jobs;\nchan_t* done;\n\nvoid* worker()\n{\n    // Process jobs until channel is closed.\n    void* job;\n    while (chan_recv(jobs, &job) == 0)\n    {\n        printf(\"received job %d\\n\", (int) job);\n    }\n\n    // Notify that all jobs were received.\n    printf(\"received all jobs\\n\");\n    chan_send(done, \"1\");\n    return NULL;\n}\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Initialize channels.\n    jobs = chan_init(5);\n    done = chan_init(0);\n\n    pthread_t th;\n    pthread_create(&th, NULL, worker, NULL);\n\n    // Send 3 jobs over the jobs channel then close it.\n    int i;\n    for (i = 1; i <= 3; i++)\n    {\n        chan_send(jobs, (void*) (uintptr_t) i);\n        printf(\"sent job %d\\n\", i);\n    }\n    chan_close(jobs);\n    printf(\"sent all jobs\\n\");\n\n    // Wait for all jobs to be received.\n    chan_recv(done, NULL);\n\n    // Clean up channels.\n    chan_dispose(jobs);\n    chan_dispose(done);\n}\n```\n\nThis program will print:\n\n```\nsent job 1\nreceived job 1\nsent job 2\nreceived job 2\nsent job 3\nreceived job 3\nsent all jobs\nreceived all jobs\n```\n\n## Select Statements\n\nSelect statements choose which of a set of possible send or receive operations will proceed. They also provide a way to perform non-blocking sends and receives. Selects are particularly useful for multiplexing communication over several channels.\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n#include \"chan.h\"\n\nchan_t* messages;\nchan_t* signals;\n\nint main()\n{\n    // Initialize channels.\n    messages = chan_init(0);\n    signals = chan_init(0);\n    void *msg;\n\n    // This is a non-blocking receive. If a value is available on messages,\n    // select will take the messages (0) case with that value. If not, it will\n    // immediately take the default case.\n    switch(chan_select(&messages, 1, &msg, NULL, 0, NULL))\n    {\n        case 0:\n            printf(\"received message %s\\n\", msg);\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf(\"no message received\\n\");\n    }\n\n    // A non-blocking send works similarly.\n    msg = \"foo\";\n    switch(chan_select(NULL, 0, NULL, &messages, 1, &msg))\n    {\n        case 0:\n            printf(\"sent message %s\\n\", msg);\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf(\"no message sent\\n\");\n    }\n\n    // We can use multiple cases above the default clause to implement a\n    // multi-way non-blocking select. Here we attempt non-blocking receives on\n    // both messages and signals.\n    chan_t* chans[2] = {messages, signals};\n    switch(chan_select(chans, 2, &msg, NULL, 0, NULL))\n    {\n        case 0:\n            printf(\"received message %s\\n\", msg);\n            break;\n        case 1:\n            printf(\"received signal %s\\n\", msg);\n            break;\n        default:\n            printf(\"no activity\\n\");\n    }\n\n    // Clean up channels.\n    chan_dispose(messages);\n    chan_dispose(signals);\n}\n```\n\nThis program will print:\n\n```\nno message received\nno message sent\nno activity\n```\n"

The script attempts to\n# detect proper version support, and outputs warnings about particular\n# systems that have autotool peculiarities.\n#\n# Basically, if everything is set up and installed correctly, the\n# script will validate that minimum versions of the GNU Build System\n# tools are installed, account for several common configuration\n# issues, and then simply run autoreconf for you.\n#\n# If autoreconf fails, which can happen for many valid configurations,\n# this script proceeds to run manual preparation steps effectively\n# providing a POSIX shell script (mostly complete) reimplementation of\n# autoreconf.\n#\n# The AUTORECONF, AUTOCONF, AUTOMAKE, LIBTOOLIZE, ACLOCAL, AUTOHEADER\n# environment variables and corresponding _OPTIONS variables (e.g.\n# AUTORECONF_OPTIONS) may be used to override the default automatic\n# detection behaviors.  Similarly the _VERSION variables will override\n# the minimum required version numbers.\n#\n# Examples:\n#\n#   To obtain help on usage:\n#     ./autogen.sh --help\n#\n#   To obtain verbose output:\n#     ./autogen.sh --verbose\n#\n#   To skip autoreconf and prepare manually:\n#     AUTORECONF=false ./autogen.sh\n#\n#   To verbosely try running with an older (unsupported) autoconf:\n#     AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.50 ./autogen.sh --verbose\n#\n# Author:\n#   Christopher Sean Morrison <morrison@brlcad.org>\n#\n# Patches:\n#   Sebastian Pipping <sebastian@pipping.org>\n#\n######################################################################\n\n# set to minimum acceptable version of autoconf\nif [ \"x$AUTOCONF_VERSION\" = \"x\" ] ; then\n    AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.52\nfi\n# set to minimum acceptable version of automake\nif [ \"x$AUTOMAKE_VERSION\" = \"x\" ] ; then\n    AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.11\nfi\n# set to minimum acceptable version of libtool\nif [ \"x$LIBTOOL_VERSION\" = \"x\" ] ; then\n    LIBTOOL_VERSION=1.4.2\nfi\n\n##################\n# ident function #\n##################\nident ( ) {\n    # extract copyright from header\n    __copyright=\"`grep Copyright $AUTOGEN_SH | head -${HEAD_N}1 | awk '{print $4}'`\"\n    if [ \"x$__copyright\" = \"x\" ] ; then\n\t__copyright=\"`date +%Y`\"\n    fi\n\n    # extract version from CVS Id string\n    __id=\"$Id: autogen.sh 33925 2009-03-01 23:27:06Z brlcad $\"\n    __version=\"`echo $__id | sed 's/.*\\([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]\\)[-\\/]\\([0-9][0-9]\\)[-\\/]\\([0-9][0-9]\\).*/\\1\\2\\3/'`\"\n    if [ \"x$__version\" = \"x\" ] ; then\n\t__version=\"\"\n    fi\n\n    echo \"autogen.sh build preparation script by Christopher Sean Morrison\"\n    echo \"  + config.guess download patch by Sebastian Pipping (2008-12-03)\"\n    echo \"revised 3-clause BSD-style license, copyright (c) $__copyright\"\n    echo \"script version $__version, ISO/IEC 9945 POSIX shell script\"\n}\n\n\n##################\n# USAGE FUNCTION #\n##################\nusage ( ) {\n    echo \"Usage: $AUTOGEN_SH [-h|--help] [-v|--verbose] [-q|--quiet] [-d|--download] [--version]\"\n    echo \"    --help      Help on $NAME_OF_AUTOGEN usage\"\n    echo \"    --verbose   Verbose progress output\"\n    echo \"    --quiet     Quiet suppressed progress output\"\n    echo \"    --download  Download the latest config.guess from gnulib\"\n    echo \"    --version   Only perform GNU Build System version checks\"\n    echo\n    echo \"Description: This script will validate that minimum versions of the\"\n    echo \"GNU Build System tools are installed and then run autoreconf for you.\"\n    echo \"Should autoreconf fail, manual preparation steps will be run\"\n    echo \"potentially accounting for several common preparation issues.
