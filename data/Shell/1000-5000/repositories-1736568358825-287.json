[昨天用了一下最新版的docker镜像立马微信就被封了 #55](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/55)\n\n## Usage ![Powered Linux](https://img.shields.io/badge/WeChat-Linux-brightgreen)\n\nWeChat PC will be started on your Linux desktop by running the following one-line command:\n\n```sh\ncurl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huan/docker-wechat/master/dochat.sh | bash\n```\n\nIf you’re in China, try the following one-line command if the above one-line command does not work well:\n```sh\ncurl -sL https://gitee.com/mirrors/dochat/raw/main/dochat.sh | bash\n```\n\nJust copy/paste the above one-line command to your terminal and press Enter. Then the WeChat PC should appear in your XWindows desktop shortly.\n\n![DoChat Term Command](https://huan.github.io/docker-wechat/images/term-dochat.png)\n\n### Attention\n\nThe [dochat.sh](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/blob/master/dochat.sh) script must not be with uid 0 (root user). Running it with uid 0 will lead to an infinite loop\nthat is hard to kill from the terminal. If your user doesn't have the right to run docker please add the user to the docker group `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`.\n A reboot might be neccessary for the changes to take place.\n\nThe issue is described in [#60](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/60).\n\n## Features\n\nIt just works out-of-the-box with one-line of shell command!\n\n1. Input/Display Chinese characters perfectly.\n1. Paste copied images to WeChat with `Ctrl+V`\n\n![DoChat Screenshot](https://huan.github.io/docker-wechat/images/screenshot-dochat.png)\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Linux Ubuntu distribution will be recommended (DoChat was developed with the Ubuntu Desktop 19.10)\n    1. Debian support confirmed ([#9](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/9))\n    1. OpenSUSE Leap 15.1 support confirmed ([#16](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/16))\n    1. OpenSUSE Tumbleweed support confirmed ([#150](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/150))\n    1. Arch support confirmed ([#26](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/26))\n    1. Ubuntu(19.04/18.10/18.04) should be able to support\n    1. Linux Mint 21.2 Cinnamon support confirmed ([#215](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/215))\n    1. Other Linux distributions: might be able to support\n1. Docker (run `sudo apt update && apt install docker.io` to install Docker for Ubuntu users)\n1. [`nvidia-container-toolkit`](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) may be installed ([#173](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/173))\n\n## Environment Variables\n\n### `DOCHAT_DPI`\n\nDPI Scale Factors for graphic screen resolution.\n\n| DPI  | Scale factor |\n| ---: | :---: |\n|  96 | 100% |\n| 120 | 125% |\n| 144 | 150% |\n| 192 | 200% |\n\nDefault: `120`\n\nTo enlarge the window & fonts size:\n\n```sh\ncurl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huan/docker-wechat/master/dochat.sh \\\n  | DOCHAT_DPI=192 bash\n```\n\n### `DOCHAT_SKIP_PULL`\n\nIf you do not want to pull docker image for the latest version at startup everytime, you can set `DOCHAT_SKIP_PULL` environment variable.\n\n```sh\ncurl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huan/docker-wechat/master/dochat.sh \\\n  | DOCHAT_SKIP_PULL=true bash\n```\n\nIn case you have downloaded `dochat.sh`:\n\n```sh\nDOCHAT_SKIP_PULL=true ./dochat.sh\n```\n\n### `DOCHAT_DEBUG`\n\nShow more debug log messages.\n\n```sh\ncurl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huan/docker-wechat/master/dochat.sh \\\n  | DOCHAT_DEBUG=true bash\n```\n\n### `DOCHAT_WECHAT_VERSION`\n\nUse a specific version for WeChat.\n\nYou can get a full list of the supported versions from Docker Hub Image Tags at <https://hub.docker.com/r/zixia/wechat/tags>\n\nFor example:\n\n```sh\ncurl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huan/docker-wechat/master/dochat.sh \\\n  | DOCHAT_WECHAT_VERSION=3.3.0.115 bash\n```\n\n## For Hackers\n\nIf you want to control everything by yourself, for example, open multiple WeChat PC client on your desktop; then, you might want to inspect the [dochat.sh](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/blob/master/dochat.sh) in our repository and try the following docker command:\n\n```sh\ndocker run \\\n  --name DoChat \\\n  --rm \\\n  -i \\\n  \\\n  -v \"$HOME/DoChat/WeChat Files/\":'/home/user/WeChat Files/' \\\n  -v \"$HOME/DoChat/Applcation Data\":'/home/user/.wine/drive_c/users/user/Application Data/' \\\n  -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \\\n  -v \"/run/user/$(id -u)/pulse\":\"/run/pulse\" \\\n  \\\n  -e DISPLAY \\\n  \\\n  -e XMODIFIERS=@im=fcitx \\\n  -e GTK_IM_MODULE=fcitx \\\n  -e QT_IM_MODULE=fcitx \\\n  -e GID=\"$(id -g)\" \\\n  -e UID=\"$(id -u)\" \\\n  \\\n  --ipc=host \\\n  --privileged \\\n  \\\n  zixia/wechat\n```\n\nModify it whatever you want to fulfill your needs.\n\n## Versioning\n\nThe docker image has two schema of the versioning:\n\n1. `X.Y.Z.a`: This is for the WeChat PC Windows Client version\n    1. `zixia/wechat:2.7.1.85`: WeChat 2.7.1.85\n    1. `zixia/wechat:2.8.0.112`: WeChat 2.8.0.112\n1. `x.y`: This is for the docker image version.\n    1. `zixia/wechat:0.2`: docker-wechat version 0.2\n\nThe two version schema may overlap with each other.\n\nFor example: the `zixia/wechat:0.2` may be the same image as the `zixia/wechat:2.8.0.112`.\n\n## Known Issues\n\n- [ ] WeChat 2.8.0.x can not send big images/files ([#341](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/31))\n  - Work around: use [2.7.1.85](https://hub.docker.com/layers/zixia/wechat/2.7.1.85/images/sha256-e6e9d21c7cd1dfae0484e697f12f5f3c401de2f02e771d061868740e0d26549d) instead. (`DOCHAT_WECHAT_VERSION=2.7.1.85`)\n- [ ] In-WeChat Browser does not work ([#2](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/2))\n\n## To-do List\n\n- [x] Permanent Storage for WeChat PC Login Data Information ([#3](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/3))\n- [ ] Automatically install WeChat PC from .EXE installer when building the Dockerfile. (Test Automation tools might be needed)\n- [ ] Monitor WeChat PC version publications so that we can publish the same version number of the docker image with it.\n- [ ] Resolve the infinite loop situation when running with uid 0 ([#60](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/60))\n- [ ] New feature: wechat_pc_api， <https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/125>\n\n## FAQ\n\n### System Tray Icon with Gnome Desktop\n\nInstall Gnome Extension: [Top Icons Plus Git](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2311/topicons-plus/) by bijignome\n\n> Note 1: there's almost half dozen of the `TopIcons` extensions with very similar name: TopIcons, TopIcons Redux, TopIcons Plus, **TopIcons Plus Git**, TopIconsFix. Use **TopIcons Plus Git**, it's the right one.  \n>\n> Note 2: The `TopIcons Plus` has the bug that cause the `wine` itself shows a window on your desktop. ([#19](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/19))\n\n### Exit with code 5 on openSUSE Leap\n\nWhen you encounter problem that the app exit with code 5  on openSUSE Leap, you need to disable X server access control to allow any user to connect to the X server before you start the app. Use below command to disable it:  \n\n`$ xhost +`\n\n### OpenSUSE Tumbleweed Configurations\n\nTo address the issue ([#150](https://github.com/huan/docker-wechat/issues/150)) do the following: (Thanks [Wu Bo](https://github.com/bo-wu))\n\n`$ xhost +; sudo chown -R $USER $HOME/DoChat/`\n\n### No main window after start up with 2 or more monitor setup\n\nThis could be caused by an old bug in wine with multiple monitor setup. Workaround is to start it up with single monitor and then switch to multiple monitors\n\nThis behavior may cause the view disappear when you use the Join Displays mode, so you need change the mode to mirrors when the app start, this script may help:\n\n```Bash\n#bin/bash\nxrandr --output HDMI-1-2 --same-as eDP-1-1\n\ncurl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huan/docker-wechat/master/dochat.sh \\\n  | DOCHAT_SKIP_PULL=true bash &\n\nsleep 5\nxrandr --output HDMI-1-2 --right-of eDP-1-1\n```\n\nChange the HDMI-1-2 to your external display name and eDP-1-1 to your built in display name. Display more than two, link to [this](http://www.mikewootc.com/wiki/linux/usage/set_x_reso.html).\n\n***Notice***: you must drag the login dialog to built in display side when the process sleep 5, otherwise the view may stuck in the external display.\n\n## Links\n\n- [Input Method don't work when using X11Forward](https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=913752)\n- [Input method related environment variables](https://fcitx-im.org/wiki/Input_method_related_environment_variables)\n- [Docker GUI最佳实践](https://github.com/zjZSTU/Containerization-Automation/blob/982d54458b05ef75fe6436f4ea72bbb66c4cb931/docs/docker/gui/%5BDocker%5DGUI最佳实践.md)\n- [Linux 下 完美运行 wechat 微信](https://www.kpromise.top/run-wechat-in-linux/)\n- [WeChat Desktop on Linux](https://ferrolho.github.io/blog/2018-12-22/wechat-desktop-on-linux)\n\n## History\n\n### master v0.14\n\n1.
