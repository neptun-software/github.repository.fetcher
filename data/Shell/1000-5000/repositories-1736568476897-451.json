Bash script compatible with **MacOS**, **Linux**, **BSD** and **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**.\n\n- Just **bash** 🤖.\n- It affects **any browser** or software installed 😱.\n- You **don't have to install any browser extensions or applications** 🚫, you just use the tools of your operating system.\n- You update the list of DNS to be blocked with a **single command** 😎.\n- Pure **Opensource** ❤️.\n\n<img alt=\"demo\" src=\"media/demov2.jpg\">\n\n## Index\n\n- [Commands](#-commands)\n- [Install or update](#%EF%B8%8F-install-or-update)\n- [Check if you block ads](#-check-if-you-block-ads)\n- [Auto update of domains to be blocked](#-auto-update-of-domains-to-be-blocked)\n- [Uninstall](#-uninstall)\n- [Not blocking certain domains](#-not-blocking-certain-domains)\n- [Add custom domains to block](#-add-custom-domains-to-block)\n- [Alternative DNS list](#-alternative-dns-list)\n- [DNSMASQ (or support sub-domains: wildcards)](#dnsmasq)\n  - [Create your own Pi-Hole](#-create-your-own-pi-hole-server-with-maza)\n- [Projects inspired by Maza](#user-content-️-projects-inspired-by-maza)\n- [Donations](#-buy-me-a-coffee)\n- [Community or questions](#-get-help-or-talk-with-the-community)\n\n## 📟 Commands\n\n### 📡 Update database\n\n``` bash\nsudo maza update\n```\n\n### 🔨 Start\n\n``` bash\nsudo maza start\n```\n\n### 🛠 Stop\n\n``` bash\nsudo maza stop\n```\n\n### ⚖️ Status\n\n``` bash\nsudo maza status\n```\n\n## ⚙️ Install or Update\n\n### 😥 Requirements\n\n- **bash** 4.0 or higher\n- **curl**\n- Only macOS users, **gsed**: `brew install gnu-sed`\n\nThen you do this.\n\n``` bash\ncurl -o maza https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tanrax/maza-ad-blocking/master/maza && sudo rm -rf /usr/local/bin/maza && chmod +x maza && sudo mv maza /usr/local/bin\n```\n\nOptional but recommended, make a backup of your hosts file.\n\n``` bash\nsudo cp /etc/hosts /etc/hosts.backup\n```\n\n## 🧪 Check if you block ads\n\nYou can run a test to see if the domains are blocked.\n\nFor example, you can run the following command.\n\n``` bash\ncurl googleadservices.com\n```\n\nIf you get an error like this, it means that the domain is blocked.\n\n``` shell\ncurl: (7) Failed to connect to googleadservices.com port 80 after 2 ms: Could not connect to server\n```\n\nBut if you get a response with HTML, it means that the domain is not blocked (maybe a 404 error).\n\n\n## 🤖 Auto update of domains to be blocked\n\nOpen your `cron`.\n\n``` bash\ncrontab -e\n```\n\nAdd the following line at the end.\n\n```\n@daily maza update\n```\n\nSome users have reported problems creating daemons on MacOS. Fixed with `TERM=dumb`.\n\n```\nTERM=dumb\n@daily maza update\n```\n\n## 🔪 Uninstall\n\n``` bash\nsudo rm /usr/local/bin/maza && sudo rm -r /root/.config/maza\n```\n\n## 🚫 Not blocking certain domains\n\nEdit `/root/.config/maza/ignore` and add the domains you want to ignore.\n\nExample:\n\n``` txt\nads-twitter.com\nads.twitter.com\n```\n\nBy default, the following domains are ignored to avoid problems with the operating system.\n\n``` txt\nlocalhost\nlocalhost.localdomain\nlocal\nbroadcasthost\nip6-localhost\nip6-loopback\nip6-localnet\nip6-mcastprefix\nip6-allnodes\nip6-allrouters\nip6-allhosts\n0.0.0.0\n```\n\nFinally update Maza to apply the changes.\n\n``` bash\nsudo maza update\n```\n\n## 🎯 Add custom domains to block\n\nIf you want to include your own domains to be blocked, you can add them to `/root/.config/maza/custom-domains`. They must each be on one line, ignoring end slash or protocol (`http` or `https`).\n\nFor example:\n\n``` txt\nbeauty-tea.com\nwww.expaqua.cloud\nad.about.com\n```\n\nThen update the database to regenerate the list to include your domains.\n\n```\nsudo maza update\n```\n\n## 🔒 Alternative DNS list\n\nBy default the Yoyo (Peter Lowe) DNS list is used (3.7k blocked domains). If you want to use another list, such as Steven Black's for example (with 135k blocked domains), you must add the URL of your list on line 8.\n\n```\nURL_DNS_LIST_CUSTOM=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StevenBlack/hosts/master/hosts\"\n```\n\n## DNSMASQ\n\nUnfortunately the hosts file does **not support sub-domains (wildcards)**, which is necessary to correctly filter all DNS. You will **need to install locally a server** for that purpose, Maza supports the **Dnsmasq** format.\n\n[MacOS](#MacOS)\n\n[Linux](#user-content-linux-debianubuntu)\n\n### MacOS\n\n#### 0 Update Maza\n\n```bash\nsudo maza update\n```\n\n#### 1 Install\n\n```bash\nbrew install dnsmasq\n```\n\n#### 2 Configure\n\nEdit the file.\n\n```\n/usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf\n```\n\nAdd the following line at the end.\n\n```\nconf-file=(your user path)/.config/maza/dnsmasq.conf\n```\n\nExample\n\n```\nconf-file=/Users/myuser/.config/maza/dnsmasq.conf\n```\n\nStart DNSMASQ.\n\n```bash\nsudo brew services stop dnsmasq\nsudo brew services start dnsmasq\n```\n\n#### 3 Tell your OS to use your DNS server\n\nDelete the list of macOS DNS servers and add the 3 addresses. The first one will be your local server, and the other 2 belong to OpenDNS, which you can use any other.\n\n```bash\n127.0.0.1\n208.67.222.222\n208.67.220.220\n```\n\n<img alt=\"network macos\" src=\"media/network-osx.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n\nRefresh your DNS cache\n\n```bash\nsudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder\n```\n\n#### 4 Restart/Start Maza\n\n```bash\nsudo maza stop\nsudo maza start\n```\n\n### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)\n\n#### 0 Update Maza\n\n```bash\nsudo maza update\n```\n\n#### 1 Install\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install dnsmasq\n```\n\n#### 2 Configure\n\nEdit file in path.\n\n```\n/etc/dnsmasq.conf\n```\n\nAdd the following line at the end.\n\n```\nconf-file=(your user path)/.config/maza/dnsmasq.conf\n```\n\nExample\n\n```\nconf-file=/home/myuser/.config/maza/dnsmasq.conf\n```\n\nStart DNSMASQ.\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl stop dnsmasq\nsudo systemctl start dnsmasq\nsudo systemctl enable dnsmasq\n```\n\n#### 3 Tell your OS to use your DNS server\n\n##### 3.1 Gnome Shell\n\nIn Gnome Shell, open `Settings->Network`.
