This repository is deprecated and continues to exist solely for historical purposes and so people know where to look to update their bookmarks, watches, forks, stars, and other records.\n\nMy Workflows are published to the [Alfred Gallery](https://alfred.app/). As a [member of the Alfred team](https://www.alfredapp.com/blog/announcements/alfred-team-is-growing/) I release new Workflows either to the [official Alfred Team page](https://alfred.app/workflows/alfredapp/) or a [personal creator page](https://alfred.app/workflows/vitor/) depending on the Workflow. You can find the individual repositories for each Workflow from the links on the top right of their Gallery pages.\n\n## Historical Workflows and Tools\n\nThe following are helpers and Workflows which have been deprecated and are not kept anywhere else. Some were proofs of concept, a few used APIs or services which no longer exist, but most were made obsolete by Alfred features such as [Automation Tasks](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/automations/automation-task/) which provide convenient ways to replicate the same functionality to your liking with no coding required.\n\nAs they were not transferred to new repositories, the following tables points to commits were their latest versions were available.\n\n| Helper | Source Code |\n| ------ | :---------: |\n| _sharedresources | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/b8df6b60ad49f2f35695a5c0c96807ebc5166102/_helpers#_sharedresources) |\n| downmedia-download | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/b8df6b60ad49f2f35695a5c0c96807ebc5166102/_helpers#downmedia-download) |\n\n| Workflow | Source Code |\n| --------- | :---------: |\n| AlfredBookmarklet | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/9ba7a27921acb67cc7b7022703c8202ecb67c003/AlfredBookmarklet) |\n| AppVersion | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/fefde12914ed35d1cc7e0e90c62a932cdec3b39a/AppVersion) |\n| BugNot | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/b8df6b60ad49f2f35695a5c0c96807ebc5166102/BugNot) |\n| CheckSpelling | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/c0d9c9313857676997e6e05d9dda65cfa5fcda6a/CheckSpelling) |\n| OpenActions | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/b8df6b60ad49f2f35695a5c0c96807ebc5166102/OpenActions) |\n| OneUpdater | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/a2a2984ec4c7b839b7bf45315491c6993ef13444/OneUpdater) |\n| QuitArena | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/c02a9c1c5526d64ae15972ab331802d01d887766/QuitArena)\n| RepeatRepeat | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/9a70302fa31d6fba2b532bc9dd7eac75d67f6964/RepeatRepeat) |\n| RespondQuickly | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/f174fde5da3238d57dc3415bb351759c02eb8dab/RespondQuickly) |\n| RottenMovies | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/2c0eca9f2336e3470b103586189ba7dd450f2b39/RottenMovies) |\n| VideoDuration | [View](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/b8df6b60ad49f2f35695a5c0c96807ebc5166102/VideoDuration) |\n"
