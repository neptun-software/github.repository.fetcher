And if you return to the previous terminal and open the scratchpad, the first session you had started will open.\n\nIt would be great if the session was maintained regardless of whether you change terminals or not, but I don't think it's possible, but if anyone knows how, a pull request is welcome.\n\n## Animated Wallpapers\n##### December 08 2024\n\nI have added the function of being able to set an animated wallpaper in the environment.\n\nSince a few commits ago, you can now configure BY THEME if you want a random wallpaper to be displayed depending on the theme you are on (Default). Or you can show a random wallpaper by choosing the folder where you want the random wallpaper to be taken (CustomDir). Or you can specify a specific image (CustomImage).\n\nYour changes are saved and that specific theme will display the wallpaper depending on the option you have chosen.\n\nI have now added the option to set an animated wallapper (AnimatedWall).\nValid files are **(mp4, mkv, gif)**\n\nI added 7 animated wallpapers to the dotfiles but if you don't like them, you can download any from the internet and configure it.\n\nOn less powerful computers, your CPU usage may increase A LOT, but hey, it's just one more feature you have at your disposal.\n\nYou need to have my dotfiles updated.\n\nIf you already have my dots, and you already updated the dots, you need to install mpv and xwinwrap.\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S mpv\nparu -S xwinwrap-0.9-bin\n```\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08ae55d3-a6cc-4944-b1dd-5df1ff9b1c4d\n\n---\n\n## Shortcuts and other changes\n##### December 01 2024\n\nI have modified the keyboard shortcuts trying to improve the UX, making them more intuitive, simple, organized and ergonomic.\n\nI have divided the theme.sh within each theme, into 2 files, Now theme-config.bash contains the configuration.\nAll this to prepare the environment to use a single theme.sh in the future.\n\nFor the moment I eliminated RiceEditor, since with the new changes it does not work now, and I am going to update and improve it in the next few days.\nAT THE MOMENT IT DOES NOT WORK.\n\nAlso added a new way to set wallpapers, now you can decide the folder that contains your wallpapers or specify a specific wallpaper or continue with the default. And it can be configured by theme.\n\nFixed flickering when you had a terminal open and changed themes.\n\nAnd eliminate unnecessary sleeps. Sometimes when changing themes, quickly, the bars would get stuck, now the loading process does not continue until the processes finish correctly.\n\n---\n\n## Replaced Ranger with Yazi\n##### November 13 2024\n\nI replaced Ranger with Yazi, because it is faster, modern and looks spectacular.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e15cc1a-88b8-4a7e-a4de-e7da76021406\n\n---\n\n## Keyboard rofi applet\n##### Noviembre 04 2024\n\nSo i added an applet in rofi to change your current keyboard layout..  of course changes with the theme you are, as all the other things. And I have also added the polybar module that shows your current layout and **is clickable**, which will launch the new applet. Likewise, if you want to launch it *directly with the keyboard*, `super + alt + k` is the shortcut.\n\n![ezgif com-animated-gif-maker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1cce2194-ed52-4e32-8bf1-66a69f20dd9f)\n\nIf you already have my dotfiles, you need to clone my dots again somewhere you want, and move the 2 new files:\n\ndotfiles/config/bspwm/src/KeyBoardL --> ~/.config/bspwm/src/KeyBoardL\n\ndotfiles/config/bspwm/src/rofi-themes/Keyboard.rasi --> ~/.config/bspwm/src/rofi-themes/Keyboard.rasi\n\nAnd you will need to edit:\n\n*~/.config/bspwm/src/OpenApps* Add this:\n```bash\n--keyboard)\n\tKeyBoardL\n\t;;\n```\n\n*~/.config/bspwm/src/config/sxhkdrc* add this:\n```bash\n#Keyboard Layout Applet\nsuper + alt + k\n\tOpenApps --keyboard\n```\n\nAnd yes, in all rices, the modules.ini file, have at the bottom the new module you need to add it.\n\nOnly on 2 or 3 rices is active per default, in the others if you want to activate, just add it in config.ini\n\nah yes you need to edit too the cheatsheet, just check the commit, to know what to add.\n\n---\n\n## New animations for specific windows\n##### October 22 2024\n\n- I added some animations for specific windows/apps, like **rofi menus, dunst notifications, jgmenu, eww widgets**. Additionally, **polybar and eww bars** (Andrea, z0mbi3) i forgot to show in video but when you change from theme to theme or hide, show, the bars, now have a fade effect.\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de014275-57f1-45e9-b1f3-acb9939e5a76\n\n- Updated RiceInstaller. I will give some love to installer next days.\n\n---\n\n## LockScreen\n##### October 17 2024\n\nYes, I finally updated the lock screen, it was something I was putting off but it is now ready. Of course the color theme changes depending on the theme you are in.\n\nThere are 2 options:\n\n```\nScreenLocker\n\n# Take a screenshot and blur it.\n```\n\n```\nScreenLocker --rice\n# Lock the screen with a random wallpaper depending on the theme you are in\n```\n\nBy default I have left it in the first command that takes a screenshot of the moment and applies a blur effect.\n\nIf you want to switch to the other command, you need to edit the file **·/config/bspwm/src/PowerMenu** and the file **·/config/bspwm/src/config/sxhkdrc**\n\nrespectively adding the --rice after the ScreenLocker command\n\nEdit sxhkdrc for shortcuts `Super + ctrl + alt + l`\n\nAnd PowerMenu is edited for the rofi menu.\n\nFinally if you already have my dots, you need to install from AUR **i3lock-color** `paru -S i3lock-color`\n\nSome examples:\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1157392-af8c-421d-960c-95e2a52f0fd0\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                               z0mbi3 LockScreen                                                    |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f51c30eb-428a-4e40-8b1f-70b02be4f5ee\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Cynthia LockScreen                                                    |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cac9e074-0a75-4259-a7c7-ea166aa70d40\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Emilia LockScreen                                                     |\n\n---\n\n## Picom Animations!! And new app to control some aspects of the rices\n##### October 6 2024\n\nThe new version of picom has finally been released and brings stable animations.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa79c5d7-50ee-4378-b67a-12673a3bb341\n\nAnimations are enabled in almost all themes, and only windows/applications are animated. Tooltips, popups, dropdown menus are not animated because.. visual bloat!!. But you can always modify the behavior to your liking with picom's new rules system.\n\nAnd there is also a new application called **RiceEditor** to control some aspects of the themes. As are the animations, shadows, fading effect, border radius and border size. And in case you make a mess, it has an option to reset to the original values.\n\n*Note: If you open the application in a theme and change to another theme, you will need to close the application (RiceEditor) and reopen it so that RiceEditor can edit the theme you are currently in.\n\nYou can open RiceEditor either by opening a terminal and typing the command `RiceEditor`, from the rofi menu, there will be a new \"Rice Editor\" app listed or from jgmenu when you right click on the desktop.\n\nThe changes are permanent, you do not need to apply them again. In the future I will probably add more options to edit the theme you are in.\n\n![Shot-2024-10-06-094238](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72e62be2-e337-4b3a-835b-78e29911772e)\n\nFinally I made a change to the structure of the configuration files, and they were moved to src/config/ with all the changes that entails. Like the assets folder, it was moved to src/\n\n---\n\n## introducing the function to change gtk themes\n##### September 20 2024\n\nFinally add the function to switch gtk themes when you change rice.\n\nThe problem was creating 18 gtk themes for each rice, which is a monumental job and certainly difficult to maintain. In addition to the problem of where to host them and not making the installation larger which could result in installation problems.\n\nFinally I created the themes with Themix and made a repository where I could host the themes and could be installed with a simple pacman -S\n\n**New:**\n\n- Gtk theme change on the fly, icons and cursors.\n- 18 new themes for geany editor\n- On your first run of my dotfiles, it will attempt to set the correct font size for your resolution, for the terminals, (alacritty and kitty).\n- Floating terminals such as <super + alt + enter> or the floating window that appears when you right click on available updates, ranger, ncmpcpp, and others now open with a size depending on the resolution of your screen. For those who use very large resolutions and the window was very small or, on the contrary, those who use resolutions smaller than 1600x900, they will open according to their resolution.\n\n**Changes**\n\n- Edited the .zshrc file, now \"bat\" shows the correct colors depending on the rice you are on in all use cases.\n- The sysinfo script was changed.\n- Edited bspwmrc for the new changes and functions added.\n- gtk2 and gtk3 configs added to my dots.\n- I give love to dunst config now the font and icons will change depending on the rice you are on.\n- Theme.sh in all themes edited for the new changes and functions added.\n- Tmux config updated.\n- Other minor fixes\n\n**How To update:**\n\nIf you don't use my dotfiles yet, you don't have to do anything, the installer will do everything for you.\n\nIf you already use my dotfiles there are several things to do:\n\n- install xsettingsd and ttf-ubuntu-mono-nerd.\n  `sudo pacman -S xsettingsd ttf-ubuntu-mono-nerd`\n\n- Add mi repo to your /etc/pacman.conf at the very end of file add:\n\n```\n[gh0stzk-dotfiles]\nSigLevel = Optional TrustAll\nServer = http://gh0stzk.github.io/pkgs/x86_64\n```\n- Now refresh your pacman `sudo pacman -Syy`\n- Now install the gtk themes, cursor and icons.\n\n`sudo pacman -S gh0stzk-gtk-themes gh0stzk-cursor-qogirr gh0stzk-icon-themes --noconfirm`\n\n- Clone the updated repo to another location from home or whatever you want and copy the new files, geany themes dir, xsettingsd, gtk2 and gtk3 config files.\n- Make the changes to bspwmrc, theme.sh, dunstrc, externarules, term files.\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fe02229-7590-4f41-8758-899e45083d2a\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                               Emilia gtk theme example                                                              |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a46783e6-04f4-4ec8-a87d-368d85ad881a\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Jan gtk theme example                                                               |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b18d068-7ffb-493d-984d-ce771199b824\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Brenda gtk theme example                                                                  |\n\n---\n\n## Faster and smoother\n##### July 28 2024\n\nThe most important change in this update is that now every time you change the theme, bspwm does not restart, the changes are reflected without restarting the Window Manager.\n\nLikewise with the change in structure, it is no longer necessary to kill and restart certain daemons such as sxhkd, it also prevents processes from being checked whether they are already started or not to launch them, they are only checked the first time you enter the environment and that's it, and some scripts such as RiceSelector and WallpaperSelect were modified to not depend on the main variable $RICETHEME. And this makes switching between themes feel faster and smoother.\n\nThe second important change is in the Theme.sh file within all themes, now we try to make it easier to edit the configurations, setting variables with default values, making their modification easier.\n\nI fixed many bugs in the eww widgets, as well as the Workspaces script for z0mbi3 and Andrea should now run smoother.\n\nThe logic in some scripts has been improved and everything should work fine.\n\nThe menu to select a terminal was improved and now looks better. And the logic of the code was improved.\n\nFinally, in the MediaControl script, the code to generate the song covers for the eww widgets no longer creates the cover every second, overloading performance, now it only generates it once and that's it.\n\n---\n\n## Android Mount applet\n##### July 10 2024\n\nNew applet to manage your android phones via USB. I already test it with 3 phones connected at same time, so if you find errors pls report.\nIt uses simple-mtpfs app, from AUR. If you already have my dots, just install it `paru -S simple-mtpfs` Additionally you may need gvfs-mtp from regular repos.\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/4c387426-17cb-4965-83f8-31a21f14bd47\" alt=\"Android Mount applet\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                               Android Mount applet                                                               |\n\n\n---\n\n\n## 3 New rices, rofi applets and fixes\n##### July 03 2024\n\n3 New themes (rices) added.\n\nFor those who **ALREADY** use my dotfiles, don't forget to install the bat and eza packages because I made changes to the .zshrc aliases and the Varinka theme uses a new ttf-maple font and the new clipboard manager uses the rofi-greenclip aur package.\n\n`paru -S bat eza ttf-maple rofi-greenclip`\n\n- **h4ck3r** - Hack the box colorschame.\n  - I'm not into hacking, but I saw a Spanish YouTuber who did a review of environments focused on hacking, including my dotfiles, and I thought, why not? so i made this.\n  - Special polybar modules **VPN** (if you have one configured) and **Target** (Open a terminal and writte `target {some ip}` to add it. To reset `target reset`\n  - ![Shot-2024-07-03-074759](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/21c49120-870f-4723-b88a-5312e0abcb4d)\n\n- **Varinka** - Monochrome blue-gray colorscheme.\n- **Yael** - OxoCarbon colorscheme.\n  -  The name of this theme is after the Israeli model Yael Cohen Aris. She is a system engineer and a former military officer. She is beautiful, and yes, I am in love. https://www.instagram.com/yaelaris/\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/44ff8b57-5fad-4d10-8e0a-b04563302ab3\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                               Hacker                                                               |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/e75ff30a-2ea9-48cb-b919-fa7254ae970c\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Varinka                                                               |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/53ac83a5-68df-4956-9956-2741f60bb650\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Yael                                                                  |\n\n##### Rofi Applets\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/7df07d69-614e-4c1d-822c-213982347c97\" alt=\"Clipboard manager\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Clipboard                                                             |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/d0ccde5e-6e49-4edd-8344-06f60a9013cd\" alt=\"Screenshoter\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Screenshoter                                                            |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/a09cd42e-440a-4fd7-9f78-72de85336336\" alt=\"Power menu\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Power Menu                                                            |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/13e7fe5b-8df1-4d26-afd8-75e2632e1959\" alt=\"Power menu\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Bluetooth Manager                                                            |\n\n##### Other changes:\n\n- Change the directory structure now instead of being ~/.config/bspwm/scripts/ it is ~/.config/bspwm/src/ and inside this there are 2 new directories \"jgmenu\" and \"rofi-themes\" and src is still PATH for binaries.

Change the alias for ls, now uses eza.\n- Optimized Theme.sh in all rices, Try to reduce the \"sed\" processes for the rofi menus, now the application launcher, the wallpaper selector, the terminal selector, and all the new applets, use a single file called \"shared.rasi\" that you find inside the rofi-themes folder.\n- Fixed Calendar widget.\n- Updated Cheatsheet with all new keybinds.\n- Imagemagick changed the convert command to magick so i already change it in WallSelect script to avoid warnings.\n- Updated jgmenu options (added the new rices)\n- And well another minor stuff like fixes, style fixes etc.. and the necessary scripts are updated.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## May 07 2024\n##### Added Tmux config.\n\nI wanted to upload my tmux configuration but not until I had a theme that would change the color scheme when changing rice and here it is.\n\n![ezgif com-animated-gif-maker](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/dd5f7261-0631-4a91-b584-51ca8859c197)\n\n---\n\n## May 03 2024\n##### Add finally systemtray to eww in z0mbi3 rice.\n\nWell, there is finally a system tray system to host the icons in eww.

You can access it by pressing **F1**. They include the new changes.\n\n![Shot-2024-04-16-093950](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/48cc2146-b4d1-4c91-a54c-2cf6d4c1056e)\n\n**I updated the eww widgets**, added a close button, someone ask for it in the issues and redesign and new functions to dashboard widget, calendar widget changes too.\n\n![Shot-2024-04-16-094459](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/24794b67-5f0b-42f3-9d30-24a98f4a66ee)\n![Shot-2024-04-16-094508](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/b6686ced-e8b9-4afb-96fd-26d7a53ab226)\n![Shot-2024-04-16-094512](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/844dcb4d-4631-45a4-beb2-252c3e97acc5)\n\nAbout the gamemode in the new dashboard.\nActivate it, kill the picom composer process, disable notifications and change the cpu governor to performance mode.\n\nDisabling it restarts the composer and notifications and switches the cpu governor to **ondemand** mode.\n\nWhen you activate game mode, a window will appear and ask you for your super user password, this is because changing the cpu governor obviously requires elevated permissions.\n\n![Shot-2024-04-16-095447](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/0495e8a9-4bb2-4236-b35c-88eb4b812e6f)\n\nNew rofi menu to change default terminal. Add a terminal selection menu, now the 2 that my dotfiles use are alacritty and kitty. Alacritty is the one that will be by default, and alternatively you can change to kitty.\n\nJust select one from the menu which you can launch with `Super + alt + t` immediately after selecting one, each action of opening a terminal will open the selected one. You can change terminal too from new dashboard.\n\n![Shot-2024-04-16-101731](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/66c79f96-4010-4388-add7-5284ef4bb1ff)\n\nAnd about the kitty terminal, of course it changes its color scheme when changing rice, the splits, tabs and everything else changes accordingly.\n\nKitty's keyboard shortcuts are the ones that come by default.\n\n![Shot-2024-04-16-102402](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/3947a128-ccab-4bfa-bec9-59bbf7efb0cd)\n\nAnd general fixes, edited some texts in Spanish, changed to English, thanks @AzhamProdLive\n\nAdded/changed some nvim keymaps\n\n---\n\n## Add rofi launcher to manage connections.\n\n##### March 24 2024\n\nFinally add a rofi menu to manage your connections, wired and wireless.

Corrected many visual defects, positions and etc...\n- The Aline theme has a new colors scheme (Rose Pine Dawn)\n\n---\n\n## 3 New rices\n\n##### March 12 2024\n\n3 New themes (rices) added.\n\n- **Brenda** - Everforest colorschame.\n- **Daniela** - Catppuccin Mocha colorscheme.\n- **Marisol** - Dracula colorscheme.\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/b5beaaf8-e76c-48c4-932b-f7a73e939bea\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                               Brenda                                                               |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/b606fa88-738b-4084-8ead-761dde7097b9\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Daniela                                                               |\n\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/3b6c8f05-9152-4fed-8fed-56775a4b7f6e\" alt=\"Bspwm theme\" width=\"700\"> |\n| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                              Marisol                                                               |\n\n- **HideBar** script updated. Now it is automatic, it is no longer necessary to add each rice manually. Except for the ones with a bar made with eww, like z0mbi3 or andrea.\n- **RiceInstaller** script updated. Added missing dependencies and optimized \"if is installed\" function.\n- Some fixes to nvim config.\n\n### How to update\n\nClone my repository again to any directory.\n\nCopy the \"brenda\" \"daniela\" \"marisol\" folders located in **../dotfiles/config/bspwm/rices/**\n\nAnd paste them in **~/.config/bspwm/rices/**\n\nThere is a new font called **BebasNeue.ttf** in the directory **../dotfiles/misc/fonts/**\nCopy and paste it into your font directory **~/.local/share/fonts/**\n\nFinally in **../dotfiles/config/bspwm/assets/** there are **3** new images that correspond to the rofi menu of the new themes, copy them and paste them in **~/.config/bspwm/assets/**\nThe images are br-rofi.webp, da-rofi.webp and ma-rofi.webp\n\nIn the future I will change this, to make the image of the rofi launcher is in the theme folder and there is no need to modify or add anything.\n\n---\n\n## Changed Cynthia's general color scheme to Kanagawa Dragon\n\n##### February 27 2024\n\n- I change the general color scheme to Kanagawa Dragon in Cynthia. (See gif)\n- Deleted colors.ini in ../bspwm/scripts/ I considered that having that file was unnecessary, and that made it difficult for people who were just starting out and wanted to modify the polybar colors to understand it. Now, as it should be, the colors are defined in config.ini\n- Minor color fixes to almost all rices. \"Cristina is beautiful.\" (Rose Pine Moon)\n\n---\n\n## Returns to polybar's default systemtray.\n\n##### February 21 2024\n\n- Due to the ease in configuring the systemtray that comes with polybar, the stalonetray is droped from the dotfiles.\n- Fixed minor visual bugs in some themes\n- The installer now has more descriptive colors and error handling in RiceError.log, to make it easier to track if you had any errors.\n- The neovim configuration is returned to the dotfiles\n  - I try to make a simple but powerful neovim configuration, of course if you are a pro with neovim and have your own super pro configuration, you will not be interested, remember that your neovim folder was moved to the backup folder, so you can return to it without problems. But if you start with neovim, you will surely be able to get a lot of juice out of it.\n\n##### Plugins included:\n\n- Alpha\n- Autopairs\n- Bufferline\n- Comments\n- LSP stuff (completions, snippets, code actions, definitions, etc)\n- Highlight-colors\n- Indent-blankline\n- Lualine\n- Neotree\n- None-ls (null-ls)\n- OneDark Pro colorscheme (The colors adapt to different rices.)\n- Rainbow delimiters\n- Ranger\n- Telescope\n- Treesitter\n\nLazy is used to manage plugins and of course the configuration is in lua. Loading time is **Startuptime: 44.1ms**.\n\nIt is not my intention to add many languages to the LSP, by default those used in dotfiles, bash, lua, css, python are configured.\n\nBut of course you can add more and in case you don't know how, here is the YouTube link where I took the configuration from, the guy is a machine its name is \"Typecraft\" and you will surely learn something new.

(Each theme has its own wallpapers) and it also looks beautiful too.\n\nThe color theme in the Wall Selector menu changes depending on the theme you are in.\nNot the Rice Selector menu, the color is unique for all themes.\n\n| ![Screenshot-08_12_2023-09-25-54](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/764b6ad3-f1dd-4abb-a127-b5b9ffa01b4a) |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                        Rice Selector                                                        |\n\n| ![Screenshot-08_12_2023-09-26-35](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/5f21121d-5b6c-4bfe-82c1-09aa129ed183) |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n|                                                     Wallpaper Selector                                                      |\n\nIf you already have my dotfiles installed, you need to install the xorg-xdpyinfo and imagemagick packages.\n\n```bash\nsudo pacman -S xorg-xdpyinfo imagemagick\n```\n\nClone my dotfiles again (or do a pull) and copy these 4 files located in **~/dotfiles/config/bspwm/scripts/**\n\n- RiceSelector\n- RiceSelector.rasi\n- WallSelect\n- WallSelect.rasi\n\nThen copy/overwrite them to **~/.config/bspwm/scripts/**\n\nThe **Theme.sh** files inside each rice were also modified, you need to copy and overwrite them as well.\n\nFinally you need to edit the **sxhkdrc** file, from lines 65 to 67 you will find this:\n\n```bash\n# Random wallpaper\nsuper + alt + w\n  feh -z --no-fehbg --bg-fill ~/.config/bspwm/rices/$RICETHEME/walls/\n```\n\nReplace it with this:\n\n```bash\n# Random wallpaper\nsuper + alt + w\n  WallSelect\n```\n\nNow just reload the sxhkd daemon with **Super + Esc** and you're all set.\n\nIf this is the first time you are installing my dotfiles, you don't need to do anything, the installation script will do everything for you.\n\nIt is important that you know that the first time you run the Wallpaper Selector in each theme, it will take 3 to 5 seconds to open, it is because it is converting the images and saving them in the cache directory. This does not happen with RiceSelector, because it does not need to convert any images.\n\nAnd thats all, possibly i forgot something, make an issue :P\n\n---\n\n## Massive update\n\n##### October 11 2023:\n\nFirst of all, this will be the last update that adds new features.\n\nIt is very **important** that if you already have my dotfiles installed, you use the installer again because dependencies, fonts, etc were added.\n\nEww widgets now use their internal variable **EWW_TIME** so if you already have eww installed/compiled before June 9 2023, **you will have to recompile eww**.\n\n### New stuff:\n\n- **Jgmenu** added to the environment, now if you right click anywhere on the desktop a menu will be displayed from where you can perform some actions or launch some apps.\n  Of course, the menu changes color instantly depending on the theme you are in or the theme you switch to.\n\n| ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-02-57-04](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/13ce3d41-b7fd-4329-ac75-217ac78e8fc5) | ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-02-58-13](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/ca2e0438-c1cd-4f8e-8d4d-8c2ad80db7e8) | ![Jgmenu Jan rice](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/61790ca9-b7ee-4be8-a654-17a8705481e3) |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n- **Stalonetray** was added to the environment, and the use of the systray that uses polybar by default was _discarded_.\n\nBut take note... unfortunately stalonetray does not allow in its configuration to place the systray in percentage, only in pixels. If your resolution is not 1600x900, surely the systray dock will be moved to another location than what you can see in these images. You will need to edit within each theme, the Theme.sh file, the function \"set_stalonetray_config\" The geometry part.\n\n| ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-03-45-08](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/ae73f813-20bd-4dad-8bbd-89a21258f04e) | ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-03-47-28](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/743d209e-1c68-4c7e-b858-f5fa925c8acc) | ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-03-58-27](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/74aeeb55-c6a4-4926-a1fa-ce8032fa8ed9) |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-03-45-22](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/a98081bb-6690-4bc7-950e-8cf2f1939d3a) | ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-03-47-41](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/f9a9e6c8-e95c-443f-85a5-5bad681e3056) | ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-03-58-47](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/379b6006-8c28-4ed6-afe4-5ee1873124ce) |\n\n(In Andrea and z0mbi3 stalonetray is not used)\n\n- **Four new eww widgets** [usercard, powermenu, music player, calendar] that work in the 12 themes and of course change color depending on the theme you are in.\n  The music player works for Spotify, browsers, and all players that use playerctl and also works for your local music using MPD.\n\n| ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-04-14-06](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/1ebd76f6-aa26-481d-a707-4e4f557ddf36) | ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-04-14-28](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/c2e25801-fb4c-4fe6-b178-7a531b0a326c) |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-04-15-03](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/a6a01d84-e3aa-49d1-9d10-3c99313bb4b7) | ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-04-15-37](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/66729112-1616-4e7f-8ab4-80ff91ff8a82) |\n\n- The **Andrea** theme was the only one that is not my own, now I improved it and rewrote all the code, before it used more than 5 windows and the widgets, now it only uses one and it loads faster and more fluid, and the design is now more functional.\n\n| ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-04-43-15](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/3b78d587-4155-4582-86c1-95dc901a625e) |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n- Redesigned the bar in the **Jan** theme, it suck-less now.\n\n| ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-04-47-26](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/513a58ab-c945-4e02-b2b5-131c44a235bd) |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n- I redesigned the bar a little in the **z0mbi3** theme, now it has more icons and some have changed.\n\n| ![Screenshot-11_10_2023-04-51-35](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/assets/67278339/c0f45e3c-b351-4daa-bbf5-709428705a37) |\n| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n### Modified/Optimized:\n\n- Alacritty's color scheme in Andrea's theme was modified, now it looks and feels much better without killing your eyes.\n- The code was modified to add workspaces in the bspwmrc file. If you want to add more than one monitor to your setup please read the wiki. https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/wiki/Two-or-more-monitors-setup\n- The way picom starts has been changed and no longer interrupts the process every time you change the theme, making it feel **faster and smoother**.\n- Improved fading effects when opening or closing windows.\n- Launchers were added to the polybar in almost all themes to have access to the new widgets. If the theme does not have them, with the new jgmenu there is a way to launch them, in the widgets submenu.\n- The MediaControl script was modified, optimized and improved to make it work with playerctl and mpd correctly.\n- The Volume script was improved\n\n### The Installer\n\n- Now before downloading the repository, checks if the \"dotfiles\" folder located in your HOME exists and if it exists, delete it.\n- The way EWW is installed now is directly from the EWW repository. The AUR package has many problems and continually crashes making it unable to be compiled and installed. The binary is installed in /usr/bin/\n\nAnd some more things under the hood. For z0mbi3 and Andrea's themes that use eww as their main bar, it remains to be added stalonetray and adapt it to eww, but I will go on vacation in a few days and at some point in life I will do so. Feel free to open an issue if something goes wrong, I'll try to fix any possible errors. And if anyone wants to collaborate by adapting atalonetray to eww, I would be happy to look at your commits.\n\nAnd yes, I said that I was not going to add a more visual way to restart, shutdown or lock the screen other than with the shortcuts, but well, many people asked for it. You have 3 ways to do it now, with the usual shortcuts, with the icon in the polybar, and with the new jgmenu right click on the desktop in the \"exit\" submenu.\n\nI may be forgetting things but in general terms, this is all that is important.\n"

By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

I’m gh0stzk from Mexico.\n\nThese dotfiles are designed with the goal of providing a bspwm environment that is lightweight, efficient, and functional, tailored for any use—whether it’s gaming, web browsing, or a productive work setting.\n\nYou’ll have 18 unique themes to choose from, each with its own style, colors, and navigation bar options. With this variety, you’re sure to find one that suits your preferences and needs.\n\n## :book: Wiki\nI already started writing the [**Wiki**](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/wiki), you should give it a read. If it is your first time with a WM, you may be interested in reading [First steps after installing the dotfiles](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/wiki/Firsts-steps-after-installing) or maybe read [frequently asked questions and answers](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/wiki/Questions---Answers) [Keybinds](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/wiki/Keyboard-Shortcuts) [Firefox Theme](https://github.com/gh0stzk/dotfiles/wiki/Firefox-Theme).\n\n## 🚀 Features\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67278339/221605474-21d65156-0cf7-485c-bd1a-40792c37817e.png\" alt=\"Linux Fetch\" align=\"right\" width=\"450\">\n\n**Change themes on the fly**\n\n<sup>You can switch themes instantly, with no need to restart your session or environment. With just one click, the change is applied immediately.</sup>\n\n**Consistency Across the Environment**\n\n<sup>Each theme not only changes the appearance of bspwm but also instantly transforms the color scheme in terminals (Alacritty & Kitty), eww widgets, polybar bars, notifications, gtk theme, launchers and more. Visual harmony is guaranteed in every corner of your system.</sup>\n\n**RiceEditor**\n\n<sup>Is an application designed to simplify the customization of your current theme. It allows you to easily adjust various visual and configuration aspects, tailoring your environment to your preferences without the need to manually edit configuration files.</sup>\n\n**Eww Widgets**\n\n<sup>4 different widgets, including a calendar, music player, profile card and a cheatsheet. These widgets are not only functional but also instantly adapt to the color scheme of the selected theme.</sup>\n\n**Jgmenu**\n\n<sup>Explore an elegant right-click menu (Desktop) made with Jgmenu, which also syncs with themes for flawless visual consistency. </sup>\n\n**LockScreen**\n\n<sup>The lockscreen automatically adapts to the active theme and offers two locking options: it can capture the current screen with a blur effect, or use a specific wallpaper depending on the selected theme.</sup>\n\n**Variety of Wallpapers**\n\n<sup>Each login surprises you with a randomly selected wallpaper specifically tailored to the theme in use. But if surprises aren't your thing, our wallpaper menu lets you choose from over 5 exclusive wallpapers for each theme.</sup>\n\n**Scratchpad**\n\n<sup>A _scratchpad_ is a tool designed to provide quick, temporary access to applications or notes without disrupting the desktop workflow. When activated, the scratchpad appears over the current workspace, allowing the user to access applications like a terminal, text editor, or any configured tool. Minimizing it hides the scratchpad from view but keeps it running in the background, ready to be reopened with a simple keyboard shortcut.</sup>\n\n<sup>It's ideal for quick note-taking, running commands, or accessing auxiliary tools without losing focus on the current task.</sup>\n\n**Visual Composition and Animations**\n\n<sup>Each theme features a unique color palette, along with transparencies, shadows, and animations—all designed to maintain visual balance without impacting performance or overwhelming the environment.</sup>\n\n**Rofi Applets**\n\n<sup>7 Rofi applets to simplify your workflow:</sup>\n\n- Network Manager\n- Bluetooth Controller\n- Clipboard Manager\n- Screenshot Tool\n- Android MTP Manager\n- Power Menu\n- Keyboard Layout\n\n**Terminal Selection Menu**\n\n<sup>Choose your preferred terminal emulator between alacritty and kitty through a simple menu. The selected terminal will be the default for your environment, with alacritty set as the default.</sup>\n\n**Tmux Configuration**\n\n<sup>Benefit from a newly added tmux configuration and design, enhancing your terminal multiplexing experience.</sup>\n\n**Complete Neovim Setup**\n\n<sup>Immerse yourself in a fully configured Neovim setup with plugins, written in Lua, providing a simple but powerful and efficient code editing environment.</sup>\n\n**Optimized ZSH Configuration**\n\n<sup>Enjoy a complete and optimized configuration of ZSH with features such as autocompletion, syntax highlighting, history substring search, and a simple yet powerful and beautiful prompt. Elevate your command line experience to a new level of efficiency and aesthetics.</sup>\n\n---\n\n### 🎨 Launchers\n\n| :tshirt: Theme Selector
