Verify it or export it.\n      SC2154: var is referenced but not assigned.\n      ```\n\n- If you use vim, [vim-essentials](https://webinstall.dev/vim-essentials)\n  includes everything you need to automatically format and lint on save.\n- If you use VS Code, the same plugins are also available in the VS Code store.\n\n**Not strictly mandatory, but we appreciate**:\n\n- [x] [Signed Commits](/git-config-gpg)\n- [x] Semantic Commit Messages\n- [x] Update `test` psuedo-package\n\n## Signed Commits\n\nPlease **enable gpg-signing**.\n\nYou can do this **in about 30 seconds**:\n\n1. Run [`git-config-gpg`](https://webinstall.dev/git-config-gpg) from Webi:\n   ```sh\n   # On Mac & Linux\n   curl https://webi.sh/git-config-gpg | sh\n   ```\n2. Copy the GPG public key (it will be printed to your screen)\n3. Add it to your GitHub profile: <https://github.com/settings/gpg/new>\n\n## Semantic Commit Messages\n\nWe try to follow \"semantic commits\" to some degree. Especially since this is a\nproject with many sub-projects.\n\nThe general format is `<type>(<package>): <description>`, using these _types_:\n\n| _type_   | _usage_                                                            |\n| :------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| feat     | new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script       |\n| fix      | bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script                  |\n| docs     | changes to the documentation                                       |\n| style    | formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change    |\n| refactor | refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable               |\n| test     | adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change |\n| chore    | updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change                |\n\nTry to write your commit messages (in the present tense) like this:\n\n```text\nfix(node): update install.sh (fix #200)\n```\n\n```text\nfeat(delta): add cheat sheet and install.sh\n```\n\n```text\ndocs(ssh-adduser): document that foo does bar\n```\n\nSee <https://gist.github.com/joshbuchea/6f47e86d2510bce28f8e7f42ae84c716> for\nsome more examples.\n\n## Also update the `test` installer (a 3-line change)\n\nWhenever adding a new installer, please also update `test/install.sh`\n\n- `rm -rf ~/.local/opt/YOUR_PACKAGE`\n- `rm -f ~/.local/bin/YOUR_PACKAGE`\n- `webi YOUR_PACKAGE`\n- (and please keep it in alphabetical order)\n\nSee\n<https://github.com/webinstall/webi-installers/pull/346/files#diff-db3af85ef45ed7ac0d1d9c473cf4d858657c127dc24d931fe18a9961f17e05b1>\nfor an example.\n"

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2.

Litigation\n-------------\n\nAny litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the\ncourts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal\nplace of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that\njurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.\nNothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring\ncross-claims or counter-claims.\n\n9. Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10. Versions of the License\n---------------------------\n\n10.1. New Versions\n\nMozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section\n10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or\npublish new versions of this License.

Effect of New Versions\n\nYou may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version\nof the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,\nor under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license\nsteward.\n\n10.3. Modified Versions\n\nIf you create software not governed by this License, and you want to\ncreate a new license for such software, you may create and use a\nmodified version of this License if you rename the license and remove\nany references to the name of the license steward (except to note that\nsuch modified license differs from this License).\n\n10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary\nLicenses\n\nIf You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With\nSecondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the\nnotice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.\n\nExhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice\n-------------------------------------------\n\n  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public\n  License, v. 2.0.

          "content": "# [webi-installers](https://github.com/webinstall/webi-installers)\n\n> [webi](https://webinstall.dev) is how developers install their tools\n\n[![webinstall-dev-ogimage-github](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/122831/129465590-136b5a8a-f8f5-4e8d-a010-784eaa9f21bb.png)](https://webinstall.dev)\n\n- no `sudo`\n- no package manager\n- no messing with system permissions\n- in short: no nonsense\n\n```sh\ncurl https://webi.sh/webi | sh\n```\n\nThis repository contains the primary and community-submitted packages for\n[webinstall.dev](https://webinstall.dev).\n\n# How webi works\n\n- Contacts official release APIs for download URLs\n- Selects the appropriate package version and archive format\n- Installs to `$HOME/.local/opt` or `$HOME/.local/bin`, as appropriate.\n- Updates `PATH` via `$HOME/.config/envman/PATH.env`\n- Symlinks or copies current selected version\n\nMore technically:\n\n1. `<package>/releases.js` transforms the package's release API into a common\n   format\n   - (i.e. HTML, CSV, TAB, or JSON into a specific JSON format)\n   - common release APIs are in `_common/` (i.e. `_common/github.js`)\n2. `_webi/bootstrap.sh` is a template that exchanges system information for a\n   correct installer\n   - constructs a user agent with os, cpu, and utility info (i.e. `macos`,\n     `amd64`, can unpack `tar,zip,xz`)\n3. `_webi/template.sh` is the base installer template with common functions for\n   - checking versions\n   - downloading & unpacking\n   - updating PATH\n   - (re-)linking directories\n4. `<package>/install.sh` may provide functions to override `_webi/template.sh`\n5. Recap:\n   - `curl https://webi.sh/<pkg>` => `bootstrap-<pkg>.sh`\n   - `sh bootstrap-<pkg>.sh` =>\n     `https://webinstall.dev/api/installers/<pkg>@<ver>.sh?formats=zip,tar`\n   - `sh install-<pkg>.sh` => download, unpack, move, link, update PATH\n\n# Philosophy (for package authors / maintainers publishing with webi)\n\n- Should install to `$HOME/.local/opt/<package>-<version>` or `$HOME/.local/bin`\n- Should not need `sudo` (except perhaps for a one-time `setcap`, etc)\n- Examples:\n  - Full Packages:\n    - Node.js: <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/node>\n    - Golang: <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/golang>\n    - PostgreSQL: <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/postgres>\n  - Single-Binary Installers:\n    - Caddy: <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/caddy>\n    - Ripgrep: <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/ripgrep>\n    - Gitea: <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/gitea>\n  - Convenience Scripts:\n    - Prettier: <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/prettier>\n    - Rust-lang: <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/rustlang>\n    - vim-sensible:\n      <https://github.com/webinstall/packages/tree/master/vim-sensible>\n\n## Creating an Installer\n\nAn install consists of 5 parts in 4 files:\n\n```\nmy-new-package/\n  - README.md (package info in frontmatter)\n  - releases.js\n  - install.sh (POSIX Shell)\n  - install.ps1 (PowerShell)\n```\n\n1. Create Description\n2. Fetch Releases\n3. Version Check (semi-optional)\n4. Update PATH\n\nSee these **examples**:\n\n- https://github.com/webinstall/packages/blob/master/rg/\n- https://github.com/webinstall/packages/blob/master/golang/\n\nThe `webinstall.dev` server uses the list of releases returned by\n`<your-package>/releases.js` to generate a shell script with most necessary\nvariables and functions pre-defined.\n\nYou just fill in the blanks.\n\n### TL;DR\n\nJust create an empty directory and run the tests until you get a good result.\n\n```sh\ngit clone git@github.com:webinstall/webi-installers.git\npushd ./webi-installers/\ngit submodule update --init\nnpm clean-install\n```\n\n```sh\nmkdir -p ./new-package/\nnode _webi/test.js ./new-package/\n```\n\n### 1. Create Description\n\nJust copy the format from any of the existing packages. It's like this:\n\n`README.md`:\n\n````md\n---\ntitle: Node.js\nhomepage: https://nodejs.org\ntagline: |\n  JavaScript V8 runtime\ndescription: |\n  Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine\n---\n\n```sh\nnode -e 'console.log(\"Hello, World!\")'\n> Hello, World!\n```\n````\n\n### 1. Fetch Releases\n\nAll you're doing in this step is just translating from one form of JSON or CSV\nor TAB or whatever, to a format understood by `webi`.\n\n- Using Github releases? See `ripgrep/releases.js` (which uses\n  `_common/github.js`)\n- Have a special format? See `golang/releases.js` or `node/releases.js`.\n\nIt looks like this:\n\n`releases.js`:\n\n```js\nmodule.exports = function () {\n  return github(null, owner, repo).then(function (all) {\n    // if you need to do something special, you can do it here\n    // ...\n    return all;\n  });\n};\n```\n\n### 2. Bash Installer\n\n1. Variables _you_ can set\n2. Functions _you_ must define\n3. Convenience / Helper Functions\n\n(optional, if needed) Bash variables that you _may_ define:\n\n```sh\n# Define this if the package name is different from the command name (i.e. golang => go)\npkg_cmd_name=\"foobar\"\n\n# These are used for symlinks, PATH, and test commands\npkg_dst=\"$HOME/.local/opt/foobar\"\npkg_dst_cmd=\"$HOME/.local/opt/foobar/bin/foobar\"\n#pkg_dst_bin=\"$(dirname \"$pkg_dst_cmd\")\"\n\n# These are the _real_ locations for the above\npkg_src=\"$HOME/.local/opt/foobar-v$WEBI_VERSION\"\npkg_src_cmd=\"$HOME/.local/opt/foobar-v$WEBI_VERSION/bin/foobar\"\n#pkg_src_bin=\"$(dirname \"$pkg_src_cmd\")\"\n```\n\n(required) A version check function that strips all non-version junk\n\n```sh\npkg_get_current_version() {\n    # foobar-v1.1.7 => 1.1.7\n    echo \"$(foobar --version | head -n 1 | sed 's:foobar-v::')\"\n}\n```\n\nFor the rest of the functions you can copy/paste from the examples:\n\n```sh\npkg_format_cmd_version() {}         # Override, pretty prints version\n\npkg_link                            # Override, replaces webi_link()\n\npkg_pre_install() {                 # Override, runs any webi_* commands\n    webi_check                          # for $HOME/.local/opt tools\n    webi_download                       # for things that have a releases.js\n    webi_extract                        # for .xz, .tar.*, and .zip files\n}\n\npkg_install() {}                    # Override, usually just needs to rename extracted folder to\n                                    # \"$HOME/.local/opt/$pkg_cmd_name-v$WEBI_VERSION\"\n\npkg_post_install() {                # Override\n    webi_path_add \"$pkg_dst_bin\"        # should probably update PATH\n}\n\npkg_done_message() {}               # Override, pretty print a success message\n```\n\n## Script API\n\nSee `webi/template.sh`\n\nThese variables will be set by the server:\n\n```sh\nWEBI_PKG=example@v1\nWEBI_TAG=v1\nWEBI_HOST=https://webinstall.dev\nWEBI_RELEASES=https://webinstall.dev/api/releases/example@v1?os=macos&arch=amd64&pretty=true\nWEBI_CSV=v1.0.2,\nWEBI_VERSION=1.0.2\nWEBI_MAJOR=1\nWEBI_MINOR=0\nWEBI_PATCH=2\nWEBI_LTS=\nWEBI_CHANNEL=stable\nWEBI_EXT=tar\nWEBI_PKG_URL=https://cdn.example.com/example-macos-amd64.tar.gz\nWEBI_PKG_FILE=example-macos-amd64.tar.gz\n```\n\n```sh\nPKG_NAME=example\nPKG_OSES=macos,linux,windows\nPKG_ARCHES=amd64,arm64,x86\nPKG_FORMATS=zip,xz\n```\n\n```sh\nWEBI_TMP=${WEBI_TMP:-\"$(mktemp -d -t webinstall-foobar.XXXXXXXX)\"}\nWEBI_SINGLE=\"\"\n```\n\n```sh\nwebi_check              # Checks to see if the selected version is already installed (and re-links if so)\nwebi_download           # Downloads the selected release to $HOME/Downloads/webi/<package-name>.tar.gz\nwebi_extract            # Extracts the download to /tmp/<package-name>-<random>/\nwebi_path_add /new/path # Adds /new/path to PATH for bash, zsh, and fish\nwebi_pre_install        # Runs webi_check, webi_download, and webi_extract\nwebi_install            # Moves extracted files from $WEBI_TMP to $pkg_src\nwebi_link               # replaces any existing symlink with the currently selected version\nwebi_post_install       # Runs `webi_path_add $pkg_dst_bin`\n```\n\n# Roadmap\n\n- Wrap release APIs to unify and expose\n- [ ] Support more Windows packages\n- [ ] Support arbitrary git urls (i.e. `@github.com/node/node`)\n  - (maybe `ghi node/node` for github specifically)\n- [ ] Support git as an archive format\n\n<!--\n\n# Windows Notes\n\n```bat\nset WEBI_HOST=https://webinstall.dev\n```\n\nWindows has curl too!?\n\n```bat\ncurl.exe -sL https://webi.ms/node | powershell\n```\n\nAnd it's easy enough to ignore the execution policy\n\n```bat\npowershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass install.ps1\n```\n\nAnd if we want something that looks as complicated as we expect Windows to be,\nhistorically, we have options:\n\n```bat\npowershell \"Invoke-Expression ( Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing https://webi.ms/node ).Contents\"\n```\n\n```bat\npowershell ( Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing https://webi.ms/node ).Contents | powershell\n```\n\n-->\n"
