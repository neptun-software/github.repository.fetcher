Andronix uses **PRoot** to run your favourite Linux distribution on your Android devices.\n\n\n### What exactly is PRoot?\n\nAs stated in the official website of PRoot\n\n> PRoot is a user-space implementation of **chroot, mount --bind, and binfmt_misc**. This means that users don't need any privileges or setup to do things like using an arbitrary directory as the new root file system, making files accessible somewhere else in the file system hierarchy, or executing programs built for another CPU architecture transparently through QEMU user-mode.\n\n\nor in easier words, the benefits of enabling PRoot include running Linux operating systems in a Termux [chroot](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) on an Android smartphone, tablet and Chromebook.\n\nWe use **Termux** to provide the command line and the packages that are especially compiled for Termux implemented inside Andronix.\n\n# Get started now üöÄ\nHey! üòä, let's introduce to the basics of the documentations around here. This is the doc-hub for Andronix, from development to installations, you can find almost everything here. [Read the documentation here](https://docs.andronix.app)\n\n### Introduction Docs üìí\n\nHere you can find all the information necessary to understand Andronix better. Diving deep in **PRoot**, **app structure** and **Shell scripts** that actually make you understand about what's actually happening.\n\n### Installation Docs üì±\nAll and everything for you to get up and running with your favourite Linux Distribution. If you're seeking for help installing a distribution, this is place you need to be. [Read the installation docs](https://docs.andronix.app/installations/non-modded-os)\n\n### Apps Installation üíª\nHere are the installation procedures of few most popular apps like **VS Code, IntelliJ Idea, GIMP, Blender** etc. Easy to follow and quick! [Read the app installation docs](https://docs.andronix.app/software/browsers)\n\n### Development Docs üë®‚Äçüíª\nLooking into contributing and developing things around or for Andronix? Here you can find all the required documentation regarding **termux-packages, app, scripts** or anything to development. *We are working on it üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è*\n\n# What can you do with Andronix?\nPretty much anything you like to do. You're just limited by the lack of the full Linux kernel, the SELinux policies of your Android versions, your CPU architecture and your device's hardware. We have users replacing their entire laptops and computer with Andronix. We are looking for something that can support web-browsing, coding or anything else that is not really taxing on your phone's hardware then you can use Andronix without any issues.\n\nYou don't have to worry about multi-booting your system which means you can have all the Un-Modded and Modded OS installed at once. **12 OS at once given that you have the storage for it.** Install as many as you like, uninstall them when you're done.\n\n[Here's what you can't do on Andronix systems](https://docs.andronix.app/)\n\n## Is it free?\n\nYes! ‚ö° Andronix is completely **Ad-free** and all the Un-modded distros and **free to use as much as you want**. \n\nOn the other hand [Modded OS](https://docs.andronix.app/installations/modded-os) are paid but they are very economical considering it is a **lifetime purchase with unlimited installs on unlimited devices.**  (We spend hours optimizing and packing it, and these are very large files which we need to serve requiring a massive amount of bandwidth, which costs money).\n\nYou can also get **Andronix Premium** which is another way to support the developers. You also get a few perks including online sync with Andronix Commands and a web-app to access it from any device you want.\n\n\n# What OS are supported?\nAndronix currently supports 8 Un-Modded OS and 4 Modded OS at the moment.\n### Un-Modded OS\n1. Ubuntu\n2. Debian\n3. Manjaro\n4. Fedora\n5. Kali\n6. Void\n7. Alpine\n8. Arch\n\n### Desktop Environment\n1. LXDE\n2. LXQT\n3. XFCE\n\n### Windows Managers\n1. Awesome\n2. Openbox\n3. i3\n\n### Modded OS\n1. Ubuntu XFCE\n2. Debian XFCE\n3. Ubuntu KDE\n4. Manjaro XFCE\n\n\n\n# Are we open-source? üìñüîì\n\n\nYes but no. Andronix is partially open-source. All the free distro tar files and the shell scripts are available on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andronixapp). While all the paid things, like the actual Android app and all the files concerning Andronix Modded OS are close-source for obvious reasons.\n\nThat doesn't mean that we don't love open-source, **we** üíò **open-source**. In fact if you're a developer or a maintainer of an open-source project, **we will be more than happy to provide you everything for free** for life. Just get-in touch with us and complete the process of verificationüòä.\n\n<br>\n\n# Here are a few screenshots ü§ò\n\n<br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imprakharshukla/Readme-Resources/master/example/example1.png\" width=\"400\" >\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imprakharshukla/Readme-Resources/master/example/example2.png\" width=\"400\" >\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imprakharshukla/Readme-Resources/master/example/example3.png\" width=\"400\" >\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imprakharshukla/Readme-Resources/master/example/example4.png\" width=\"400\" >\n</p>\n"
