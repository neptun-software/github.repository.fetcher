          "content": "Preface\n=======\n\nProgrammers shape ideas into text.\n\nThat text gets turned into numbers and those numbers bump into other numbers\nand *make things happen*.\n\nAs programmers, we use text editors to get our ideas out of our heads and create\nthe chunks of text we call \"programs\".  Full-time programmers will spend tens of\nthousands of hours of their lives interacting with their text editor, during\nwhich they'll be doing many things:\n\n* Getting raw text from their brains into their computers.\n* Correcting mistakes in that text.\n* Restructuring the text to formulate a problem in a different way.\n* Documenting how and why something was done a particular way.\n* Communicating with other programmers about all of these things.\n\nVim is incredibly powerful out of the box, but it doesn't truly shine until you\ntake some time to customize it for your particular work, habits, and fingers.\nThis book will introduce you to Vimscript, the main programming language used to\ncustomize Vim.  You'll be able to mold Vim into an editor suited to your own\npersonal text editing needs and make the rest of your time in Vim more\nefficient.\n\nAlong the way I'll also mention things that aren't strictly about Vimscript, but\nare more about learning and being more efficient in general.  Vimscript isn't\ngoing to help you much if you wind up fiddling with your editor all day instead\nof working, so it's important to strike a balance.\n\nThe style of this book is a bit different from most other books about\nprogramming languages.  Instead of simply presenting you with facts about how\nVimscript works, it guides you through typing in commands to see what they do.\n\nSometimes the book will lead you into dead ends before explaining the \"right\nway\" to solve a problem.  Most other books don't do this, or only mention the\nsticky issues *after* showing you the solution.  This isn't how things typically\nhappen in the real world, though.  Often you'll be writing a quick piece of\nVimscript and run into a quirk of the language that you'll need to figure out.\nBy stepping through this process in the book instead of glossing over it I hope\nto get you used to dealing with Vimscript's peculiarities so you're ready when\nyou find edge cases of your own.  Practice makes perfect.\n\nEach chapter of the book focuses on a single topic.  They're short but packed\nwith information, so don't just skim them.  If you really want to get the most\nout of this book you need to actually type in all of the commands.  You may\nalready be an experienced programmer who's used to reading code and\nunderstanding it straight away.  If so: it doesn't matter.  Learning Vim and\nVimscript is a different experience from learning a normal programming language.\n\nYou need to **type in *all* the commands.**\n\nYou need to **do *all* the exercises.**\n\nThere are two reasons this is so important.  First, Vimscript is old and has\na lot of dusty corners and twisty hallways.  One configuration option can change\nhow the entire language works.  By typing *every* command in *every* lesson and\ndoing *every* exercise you'll discover problems with your Vim build or\nconfiguration on the simpler commands, where they'll be easier to diagnose and\nfix.\n\nSecond, Vimscript *is* Vim.  To save a file in Vim, you type `:write` (or `:w`\nfor short) and press return.  To save a file in a Vimscript, you use `write`.\nMany of the Vimscript commands you'll learn can be used in your day-to-day\nediting as well, but they're only helpful if they're in your muscle memory,\nwhich simply doesn't happen from just reading.\n\nI hope you'll find this book useful.  It's *not* meant to be a comprehensive\nguide to Vimscript.  It's meant to get you comfortable enough with the language\nto mold Vim to your taste, write some simple plugins for other users, read other\npeople's code (with regular side-trips to `:help`), and recognize some of the\ncommon pitfalls.\n\nGood luck!\n"
