          "content": "# Kafka for Kubernetes\n\nThis community seeks to provide:\n * Production-worthy Kafka setup for persistent (domain- and ops-) data at small scale.\n * Operational knowledge, biased towards resilience over throughput, as Kubernetes manifest.\n * A platform for event-driven (streaming!) microservices design using Kubernetes.\n\nTo quote [@arthurk](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/issues/82#issuecomment-337532548):\n\n> thanks for creating and maintaining this Kubernetes files, they're up-to-date (unlike the kubernetes contrib files, don't require helm and work great!\n\n## Getting started\n\nWe suggest you `apply -f` manifests in the following order:\n * [namespace](./00-namespace.yml)\n * [./rbac-namespace-default](./rbac-namespace-default/)\n * [./zookeeper](./zookeeper/)\n * [./kafka](./kafka/)\n\nThat'll give you client \"bootstrap\" `bootstrap.kafka.svc.cluster.local:9092`.\n\n## Fork\n\nOur only dependency is `kubectl`. Not because we dislike Helm or Operators, but because we think plain manifests make it easier to collaborate.\nIf you begin to rely on this kafka setup we recommend you fork, for example to edit [broker config](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/blob/master/kafka/10broker-config.yml#L47).\n\n## Kustomize\n\nWith the introduction of [app customization](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/pages/app_customization/introduction.html) in `kubectl` 1.14 there's an alternative to forks. We as a community can maintain a set of overlays.\n\nSee the [variants](./variants) folder for different overlays. For example to scale to 1 kafka broker try `kubectl apply -k variants/scale-1/`.\nVariants also include examples of how to configure volumes for GKE, AWS and AKS with different storage classes.\n\n### Quickstart\n\n```\nkubectl create namespace kafka && \\\nkubectl apply -k github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/variants/dev-small/?ref=v6.0.3\n```\n\nWhen all pods are Ready, test with for example `kafkacat -b localhost:9094 -L` over `kubectl -n kafka port-forward kafka-0 9094`.\n\n### Maintaining your own kustomization\n\nStart your variant as a new folder in your choice of version control, with a base `kustomization.yaml` pointing to a tag or revision in this repository:\n\n```\nbases:\n- github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/rbac-namespace-default/?ref=60d01b5\n- github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/kafka/?ref=60d01b5\n- github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/zookeeper/?ref=60d01b5\n```\n\nThen pick and chose from patches our [example variants](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/tree/master/variants) to tailor your Kafka setup.\n\n## Version history\n\n| tag    | k8s ≥ | highlights  |\n| ------ | ----- | ----------- |\n| v7.0.0 | 1.15+ | [Breaking](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/311#issuecomment-657181714) with [nonroot](./nonroot/) and [native](./native/) bases |\n| v6.0.x | 1.13+ | Kafka [2.4.0](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/297) + [standard storage class](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/294) |\n| v6.0.0 | 1.11+ | Kafka 2.2.0 + `apply -k` (kubectl 1.14+) + [#270](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/270) |\n| v5.1.0 | 1.11+ | Kafka 2.1.1 |\n| v5.0.3 | 1.11+ | Zookeeper fix [#227](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/227) + [maxClientCnxns=1](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/230#issuecomment-445953857) |\n| v5.0  | 1.11+  | Destabilize because in Docker we want Java 11 [#197](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/197) [#191](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/191) |\n| v4.3.1 | 1.9+  | Critical Zookeeper persistence fix [#228](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/228) |\n| v4.3  | 1.9+   | Adds a proper shutdown hook [#207](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/207) |\n| v4.2  | 1.9+   | Kafka 1.0.2 and tools upgrade |\n|       |        | ... see [releases](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/releases) for full history ... |\n| v1.0  | 1      | Stateful? In Kubernetes? In 2016? Yes. |\n\n## Monitoring\n\nHave a look at:\n * [./prometheus](./prometheus/)\n * [./linkedin-burrow](./linkedin-burrow/)\n * [./consumers-prometheus](./consumers-prometheus/)\n * [or plain JMX](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/96)\n * what's happening in the [monitoring](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/labels/monitoring) label.\n * Note that this repo is intentionally light on [automation](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/labels/automation). We think every SRE team must build the operational knowledge first. But there is an example of a [Cruise Control](./cruise-control/) setup.\n\n## Outside (out-of-cluster) access\n\nAvailable for:\n\n * [Brokers](./outside-services/)\n\n## Stream...\n\n * [Kubernetes events to Kafka](./events-kube/)\n * [Container logs to Kafka](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/131)\n * [Heapster metrics to Kafka](https://github.com/Yolean/kubernetes-kafka/pull/120)\n"
