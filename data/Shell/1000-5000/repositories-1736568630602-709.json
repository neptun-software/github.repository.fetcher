This document outlines some of the conventions on\ndevelopment workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other\nresources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.\n\n## Certificate of Origin\n\nBy contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of\nOrigin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a\nsimple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the\ncontribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.\n\n## Developer Guide\n\nWe have a [Developer Guide](/docs/setup/developer-guide/README.md) that outlines everything you need to know from setting up your\ndev environment to how to build and test Voyager. If you find something undocumented or incorrect along the way,\nplease feel free to send a Pull Request.\n\n## Getting Help\n\nIf you have a question about Voyager or having problem using it, you can contact us on our public Slack channel. Follow [this link](https://slack.appscode.com) to get invitation to our Slack channel.\n\n## Bugs/Feature request\n\nIf you have found a bug with Voyager or want to request for new features, please [file an issue](https://github.com/voyagermesh/voyager/issues/new).\n\n## Submit PR\n\nIf you fix a bug or developed a new feature, feel free to submit a PR. In either case, please file a [GitHub issue]((https://github.com/voyagermesh/voyager/issues/new)) first, so that we can have a discussion on it. This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\n\n- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).\n- Make commits of logical units.\n- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.\n- Submit a pull request to the original repository.\n\nThanks for your contributions!\n\n## Spread the word\n\nIf you have written blog post or tutorial on Voyager, please share it with us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AppsCodeHQ) or [Slack](https://slack.appscode.com).\n"

Please update to the latest v2022.01.10 release!\n\nVoyager is a [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) backed [secure](#certificate) L7 and L4 [ingress](#ingress) controller for Kubernetes developed by [AppsCode](https://appscode.com). This can be used with any Kubernetes cloud providers including aws, gce, gke, azure, acs. This can also be used with bare metal Kubernetes clusters.\n\n## Ingress\nVoyager provides L7 and L4 load balancing using a custom Kubernetes [Ingress](https://voyagermesh.com/docs/latest/guides/ingress/) resource. This is built on top of the [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) to support high availability, sticky sessions, name and path-based virtual hosting.\nThis also supports configurable application ports with all the options available in a standard Kubernetes [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).\n\n## Certificate\nVoyager can automatically provision and refresh SSL certificates (including wildcard certificates) issued from Let's Encrypt using [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/).\n\n## Installation\nTo install Voyager, please follow the guide [here](https://voyagermesh.com/docs/latest/setup/).\n\n## Using Voyager\nWant to learn how to use Voyager? Please start [here](https://voyagermesh.com/docs/latest/welcome/).\n\n## Contribution guidelines\nWant to help improve Voyager?
