With a combination of frequency and recency, it enables you to jump to the directory in mind.\n\nA _pure-fish_ port means **z** is _fast_ and _fish-friendly_, with tab-completions and lazy-loading. Top that off with great customizability and a small amount of added functionality.\n\nOriginally written by [@jethrokuan](https://github.com/jethrokuan/), co-maintained with [@krobelus](https://github.com/krobelus).\n\n## Installation\n\nInstall with [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):\n\n```console\nfisher install jethrokuan/z\n```\n\nFor fish <`2.7.0` users you can install from our legacy branch:\n\n```\nfisher install z@pre27\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSee [man/man1/z.md](https://github.com/jethrokuan/z/blob/master/man/man1/z.md) for details.\n\n## License\n\nZ is MIT licensed. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) for details.\n"
