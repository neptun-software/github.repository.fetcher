If you have any trouble\nwith the contribution process, please feel free to contact developers [on the\nmailing list or IRC](README.md#community). Note that larger Triton project\nchanges are typically designed and discussed via [\"Requests for Discussion\n(RFDs)\"](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/rfd).\n\nTriton repositories use the [Triton Engineering\nGuidelines](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/eng/blob/master/docs/index.md).\nNotably:\n\n* The #master branch should be first-customer-ship (FCS) quality at all times.\n  Don't push anything until it's tested.\n* All repositories should be \"make check\" clean at all times.\n* All repositories should have tests that run cleanly at all times.\n\n## Issues\n\nThere are two separate issue trackers that are relevant for Triton code:\n\n* An internal JIRA instance.\n\n  A JIRA ticket has an ID like `TRITON-206`, where \"TRITON-206\" is the JIRA project\n  name -- in this case used by the\n  [sdc-vmapi](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/sdc-vmapi) and related\n  repos. A read-only view of most JIRA tickets is made available at\n  <https://smartos.org/bugview/> (e.g.\n  <https://smartos.org/bugview/TRITON-206>).\n* GitHub issues for the relevant repo, e.g.\n  <https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton/issues>.\n\nBefore Triton was open sourced, Joyent engineering used a private JIRA instance.\nWhile we continue to use JIRA internally, we also use GitHub issues for\ntracking -- primarily to allow interaction with those without access to JIRA.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nAll persons and/or organizations contributing to, or intercting with our\nrepositories or communities are required to abide by the\n[illumos Code of Conduct][coc].\n\n[coc]: https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/illumos-joyent/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\n"

Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

With an emphasis on ease of installation and operation, Triton is\nproven at scale: Triton powers the [Triton\nCloud](https://www.tritondatacenter.com/triton/managed-hardware-cloud) and private data centers\n([Triton Enterprise](https://www.tritondatacenter.com/triton/on-premises))\nworldwide.\n\nThis repository provides documentation for the overall Triton project and\npointers to the other repositories that make up a complete Triton deployment.\nSee the [repository list](./docs/developer-guide/repos.md).\n\nReport bugs and request features using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton/issues).\nFor additional resources, you can visit the\n[Triton Developer Center](https://www.tritondatacenter.com/getting-started).\n\n## Overview\n\nA Triton DataCenter installation consists of two or more servers. All servers run\n[SmartOS](http://smartos.org). One server acts as the management server, the\nhead node, which houses the initial set of core services that drive Triton. The\nremainder are compute nodes (CNs) which run instances (containers and\nvirtual machines).\n\nTriton features:\n\n* SmartOS zones provides high performance container virtualization. KVM support\n  on top of zones means secure full Linux and Windows guest OS support.\n* RESTful API and CLI tooling for customer self-service\n* Complete operator portal (web app)\n* Robust and observable service oriented architecture (implemented primarily in\n  Node.js)\n* Automated USB key, ISO, or iPXE installation\n\nTriton consists of the following components:\n\n* A public API for provisioning and managing instances (virtual machines),\n  networks, users, images, etc.\n* An operator portal\n* A set of private APIs\n* Agents running in the global zone of CNs for management and monitoring\n\nFor more details, see:\n\n* The [Triton Enterprise](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/private-cloud) documentation.\n* [Triton DataCenter Architecture](./docs/developer-guide/architecture.md) for\n  overall architecture.\n* [Triton DataCenter Reference](./docs/reference.md) for an\n  overview of each component.\n\n## Community\n\nCommunity discussion about Triton DataCenter happens in two main places:\n\n* The *sdc-discuss*\n  [mailing list](https://smartdatacenter.topicbox.com/groups/sdc-discuss).\n  If you wish to send mail to the list you'll need to join, but you can view\n  and search the archives online without being a member.\n\n* In the *#smartos* IRC channel on the\n  [Libera Chat IRC network](https://libera.chat/).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Cloud on a Laptop (CoaL)\n\nAn easy way to try Triton DataCenter is by downloading and installing a Cloud\non a Laptop (CoaL) build. CoaL is a VMware virtual appliance that provides a\nfull Triton head node for development and testing.\n\nThe [CoaL Setup document](./docs/developer-guide/coal-setup.md) contains\ndetailed instructions for downloading and installing the virtual appliance.\nIf you use the ISO installer (see below) on a Virtual Machine, the CoaL setup\ninstructions post-booting should be followed as well.\n\nIf you already have a CoaL and would like to update the installation, follow\nthe instructions for [updating a Triton standup using\n[`sdcadm`](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/sdcadm/blob/master/docs/update.md).\n\n### ISO Installer\n\nThe [ISO installer page](./docs/developer-guide/iso-installer.md) contains\ninformation on the ISO installer. With SmartOS now able to boot off a ZFS\npool, the Triton Head Node can do the same.\n\n### iPXE installer\n\nSome deployment environments install new hardware using an iPXE boot. An\n[iPXE boot](./docs/developer-guide/ipxe-installer.md) directory for a Triton\nHead Node can install Triton using an iPXE installation.\n\n### Installing Triton on a Physical Server\n\nA Triton DataCenter server runs SmartOS which is a live image. That live\nimage, which generates a ramdisk root with many portions set to read-only,\ncan boot from a USB flash drive (a physical USB key), or a ZFS pool.  To\ninstall a USB-key Triton, first obtain the latest release USB build.\nOtherwise, given the cautions in the [ISO installer\npage](./docs/developer-guide/iso-installer.md), a physical server can boot\noff of its `zones` pool.\n\nBoth USB-key-boot and ZFS-pool-boot use the same interfaces within Triton,\nwith a ZFS bootable filesystem substituting for the USB-key.\n\n#### Hardware\n\nFor Triton development only, the minimum server hardware is:\n\n* 8 GB USB flash drive\n* Intel Processors with VT-x and EPT support (all Xeon since Nehalem), or AMD\n  Processors no earlier than EPYC or Zen.\n* 16 GB RAM\n* 20 GB available storage\n\nHardware RAID is not recommended. Triton will lay down a ZFS ZPOOL across all\navailable disks on install. You'll want much more storage if you're working\nwith images and instances.  If you are using an ISO or iPXE installation,\nconfigure a simple layout of disks (e.g. mirrored pair, or single raidz\ngroup).\n\nIf setting up a Triton DataCenter pilot then you'll want to review\nthe [Hardware Selection Requirements](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/private-cloud/install/hardware-selection),\n[Networking Layout Requirements](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/private-cloud/install/network-layout),\nand [Installation Prerequisites](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/private-cloud/install/deployment-planning)\nwhich include IPMI and at least 10 gigabit Ethernet. The supported hardware\ncomponents for SmartOS are described in the\n[SmartOS Hardware Requirements](http://wiki.smartos.org/display/DOC/Hardware+Requirements).\ncertified hardware for Triton DataCenter are all in\nthe [Triton Manufacturing Database](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/private-cloud/hardware).\n\n#### Install\n\nTo install a USB-key Triton, first download the latest release image:\n\n```bash\ncurl -C - -O https://us-central.manta.mnx.io/Joyent_Dev/public/SmartDataCenter/usb-latest.tgz\n```\n\nOnce you have downloaded the latest release image, you will need to\n[write it to a USB key](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/private-cloud/install/installation-media)\nboot the head node server using the USB key, and follow the install prompts. All steps necessary\nto plan, install, and configure Triton DataCenter (Triton) are available in the\ncustomer documentation [Installing Triton Data Center](https://docs.tritondatacenter.com/private-cloud/install).\n\nTo install using the [ISO\ninstaller](./docs/developer-guide/iso-installer.md), download the [ISO\nimage](https://us-central.manta.mnx.io/Joyent_Dev/public/SmartDataCenter/iso-latest.iso),\nmake sure you be aware of the available disks, and then follow the\ninstallation instructions above.\n\nTo install using the [iPXE\ninstaller](https://us-central.manta.mnx.io/Joyent_Dev/public/SmartDataCenter/ipxe-latest.tgz),\nfollow the advice on the [iPXE installer\ndocumentation](./docs/developer-guide/ipxe-installer.md).\n\n## Building\n\nTriton is composed of several pre-built components:\n\n* A [SmartOS *platform* image](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/smartos-live). This is\n  a slightly customized build of vanilla SmartOS for Triton.\n* *Virtual machine images* for Triton services (e.g. imgapi, vmapi, adminui), which\n  are provisioned as VMs at install time.\n* Agents bundled into a [single\n  package](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/sdc-agents-installer)\n  installed into the global zone of each compute node.\n\nEach component is built separately and then all are combined into\nCoaL, USB, ISO, and iPXE builds (see the preceding sections) via the\n[sdc-headnode repository](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/sdc-headnode). The\nbuilt components are typically stored in a [Manta object\nstore](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/manta), and pulled from\nthere. For example, Triton builds push to\n`/Joyent_Dev/public/builds` in our public Manta in us-central-1\n(<https://us-central.manta.mnx.io/>).\n\nYou can build your own CoaL and USB images on Mac or SmartOS (see the\n[sdc-headnode\nREADME](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/sdc-headnode#readme)). However, ISO\nand iPXE images, as well as all other Triton components must be built\nusing a running Triton or in a local CoaL). See\n[the building document](./docs/developer-guide/building.md) for details on\nbuilding each of the Triton components.\n\n## Contributing\n\nTo report bugs or request features, submit issues here on\nGitHub, [TritonDataCenter/triton/issues](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/triton/issues)\n(or on the GitHub issue tracker for the relevant project).\nFor support of Triton products and services, please contact [MNX Solutions customer\nsupport](https://www.tritondatacenter.com/contact) instead.\n\nSee the [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information about\ncontributing changes to the project.\n\n## Design Principles\n\nTriton DataCenter is very opinionated about how to architect a cloud. These\nopinions are the result of many years of deploying and debugging\n[Triton as a public cloud service](https://www.tritondatacenter.com/triton/compute)\nin production. Design principles include the following:\n\n* A VM's primary storage should be local disk, not over the network -- this\n  avoids difficult to debug performance pathologies.\n* Communication between internal APIs should occur in its own control plane\n  (network) that is separate from the customer networks. Avoid communicating\n  over the open Internet if possible.\n* A provisioned VM should rely as little as possible on Triton services outside of\n  the operating system for its normal operation.\n* Installation and operation should require as little human intervention as\n  possible.\n\nThe goals behind the design of Triton services include:\n\n* All parts of the stack should be observable.\n* The state of the running service should be simple to obtain.\n* The internals of the system should make it straightforward to debug from a\n  core file (from a crash or taken from a running process using\n  [gcore(1)](http://smartos.org/man/1/gcore)).\n* Services should be RESTful and accept JSON unless there is a compelling\n  reason otherwise.\n* Services should avoid keeping state and should not assume that there is\n  only one instance of that service running. This allows multiple instances\n  of a service to be provisioned for high availability.\n* Node.js and C should be used for new services.\n\n## Dependencies and Related Projects\n\nTriton DataCenter uses [SmartOS](http://smartos.org) as the host operating\nsystem. The SmartOS hypervisor provides both SmartOS zone (container) and\nKVM virtualization.\n\nTriton's open-source [Manta project](https://github.com/TritonDataCenter/manta)\nis an HTTP-based object store with built-in support to run arbitrary\nprograms on data at rest (i.e., without copying data out of the object store).\nManta runs on and integrates with Triton DataCenter.\n\n## License\n\nTriton DataCenter is licensed under the\n[Mozilla Public License version 2.0](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/).\nSee the file LICENSE.
