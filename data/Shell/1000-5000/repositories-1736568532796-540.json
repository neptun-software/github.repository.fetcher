This doesn't cover as many systems as the official releases\nfrom http://releases.llvm.org/, and distro packages etc. The main advantages\nis being able to cut releases easily whenever we want.\n\nThe releases are just a zip archive containing the `clangd` binary, and the\nclang builtin headers. They should be runnable immediately after extracting the\narchive. The linux binary has `libstdc++` and other dependencies statically\nlinked for maximum portability, and requires glibc 2.18 (the first version with\n`thread_local` support).\n\n## Creating a release manually\n\nIn GitHub, click the \"Releases\" tab and create a new release.\nThe tag name is significant, it's used in the directory name (`clangd_tagname`).\n\nBecause clangd sources don't live in this repository, the release description\nmust contain a magic string indicating the revision to build at, e.g.\n\n   Built at llvm/llvm-project@0399d5a9682b3cef71c653373e38890c63c4c365\n\nThis must be a full SHA, not a short-hash, a tag or branch name, etc.\nThe release must **not** be a draft release, as that won't trigger automation.\n\n## Building release binaries\n\nCreating the release will trigger the `autobuild` workflow, visible under the\n\"Actions\" tab. This runs a sequence of steps:\n\n- First, the release is marked as a draft, so it's invisible to non-owners.\n- Next, the sources are checked out and built on each of {mac, windows, linux}.\n  These run in parallel, and the results are zipped and added to the release.\n- If all builds succeeded, the release is published (marked as non-draft)\n\n## Automatic snapshot releases\n\nThe `periodic` workflow runs on a weekly schedule and creates a release based\non the last green revision at llvm/llvm-project.\nThis in turn triggers the `autobuild` workflow above to produce binaries.\n\nThese snapshot releases are marked as \"pre-release\" - they don't undergo any\nserious testing and so aren't particularly stable. However they're useful for\npeople to try the latest clangd.\n\n## Credentials\n\nRather than the default GitHub Actions access token, these actions use a\nPersonal Access Token added to the repository as a secret. This is because:\n\n- The default access token expires after an hour. Builds take longer than that.\n- Releases created using the default access token don't trigger workflows.\n\nIf you fork the repository, you must provide the `RELEASE_TOKEN` secret.\n"
