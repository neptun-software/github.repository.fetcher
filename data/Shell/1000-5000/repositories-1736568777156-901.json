This document outlines some of the conventions on\ndevelopment workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other\nresources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.\n\n# Certificate of Origin\n\nBy contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of\nOrigin (DCO). This document was created by the Linux Kernel community and is a\nsimple statement that you, as a contributor, have the legal right to make the\ncontribution. See the [DCO](DCO) file for details.\n\n# Email and Chat\n\nThe project currently uses the general CoreOS email list and IRC channel:\n- Email: [coreos-dev](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coreos-dev)\n- IRC: #[coreos](irc://irc.freenode.org:6667/#coreos) IRC channel on freenode.org\n\nPlease avoid emailing maintainers found in the MAINTAINERS file directly. They\nare very busy and read the mailing lists.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n- Fork the repository on GitHub\n- Read the [README](README.md) for build and test instructions\n- Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!\n\n## Contribution Flow\n\nThis is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:\n\n- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).\n- Make commits of logical units.\n- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).\n- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.\n- Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.\n- Submit a pull request to the original repository.\n\nThanks for your contributions!\n\n### Format of the Commit Message\n\nWe follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two\nquestions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and\nthe body of the commit should describe the why.\n\n```\nscripts: add the test-cluster command\n\nthis uses tmux to setup a test cluster that you can easily kill and\nstart for debugging.\n\nFixes #38\n```\n\nThe format can be described more formally as follows:\n\n```\n<subsystem>: <what changed>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<why this change was made>\n<BLANK LINE>\n<footer>\n```\n\nThe first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the\nsecond line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.\nThis allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various\ngit tools.\n"
