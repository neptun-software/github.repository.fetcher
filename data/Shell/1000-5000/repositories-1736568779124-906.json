The `two-container` config may work better on Synology due to usage of `macvlan` networking which helps prevent port conflicts with the host.\n\n- [`one-container`](one-container/) (new) - Install Unbound directly into the Pi-Hole container\n  - This configuration contacts the DNS root servers directly, please read the Pi-Hole docs on [Pi-hole as All-Around DNS Solution](https://docs.pi-hole.net/guides/unbound/) to understand what this means.\n  - With this approach, we can also simplify our Docker networking since `macvlan` is no longer necessary.\n- [`two-container`](two-container/) (legacy) - Use separate containers for Pi-Hole and Unbound\n  - This configuration uses MatthewVance's [unbound-docker](https://github.com/MatthewVance/unbound-docker) container to implement encrypted DNS to third party DNS resolvers (eg Cloudflare). This is arguably less privacy-friendly since you're handing your DNS queries to those 3rd party providers.\n\n"
