          "content": "# UBUNTU ON ANDROID CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES\n> you successfully reached here 🎉\n\nThe following is a set of guidelines for contributing to ubuntu-on-android and its sub-repos\n\n## CODE OF CONDUCT\nthis project and everyone's participation is governed by [code of conduct](https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android/blob/modified/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.\nPlease report unacceptable behavior to hello.1x1.sai@gmail.com\n\n### For Questions & general discussion\nwe have a official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/3ZTT83tH9Z) & [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android/discussions). reach us out there for any query regarding udroid\n> to have a chit-chat with us ( join Discord )\n\n## Getting started\n### ubuntu-on-android\nubuntu-on-android repository aimed to custom ubuntu tarballs with the pre-installed applications for general usage. The idea is to provide pc like experience by keeping in mind about drawbacks of proot ( which udroid works on ).\nFor starters, ubuntu-on-android doesn't hold the major code part of udroid. ubuntu-on-android has the installer, some beginner markdown guides, and preview images.\nhere is the list of all repos and their description that are part of udroid.\n> https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/ubuntu-on-android\n\n### fs-manager-udroid\nfs-manager-udroid holds scripts for managing udroid and some snippet codes for installing or setting up the common application.\n> https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/fs-manager-udroid\n\n### udroid-wiki\nthis repository contains all the documentation written by developers and contributors of udroid\n> https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/udroid-wiki\n\n### fs-cook\nfs-cook repository is the most active repo in udroid. It aims to make the Linux building process easier for shipping Linux tarballs to users\n> https://github.com/RandomCoderOrg/fs-cook\n\n## How can I contribute\nfor starters, you can follow the basic GitHub guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world).\n\nWhen submitting a pull request make sure to add a good title and description to it. using images is encouraged too\n\nAlways write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:\n```\n$ git commit -m \"A summary of the commit\n> \n> A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.\"\n```\n\n## Coding conventions\nStart reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:\n* use 4-6 spaces for intending to bash\n* follow directory rules in all cases ( images should go in directories named similar to `assets` or `img` )\n* use code beautification tools for better look and readability\n* This is open-source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers, the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.\n\n\n###### Thanks to all users & contributors ( udroid contribution guidlines v0.1) \n"
