For example:\n\n* https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/compare/rn-0.28.0...rn-0.29.0\n(Change in Android template)\n* https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/compare/rn-0.29.0...rn-0.29.2\n(no change)\n* https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/compare/rn-0.30.0...rn-0.31.0\n(minor change in `.flowconfig` )\n\nSee table below for the complete list.\n\nThis repository can also be used to upgrade React Native with a git-like interface which is\nfaster and easier than running the `react-native upgrade` command.\nSee [USAGE.md](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/blob/master/USAGE.md) for details.\n\nPlease :star: this repository if I helped you ;)\n\n## Version changes\n\nVersion|Compare

that the diff stat (last column) doesn't take the `package.json` into account (it\ndoesn't have to: the `package.json` must be updated by hand before upgrading React Native).\n\n## Why this repository ?\n\nAfter an upgrade of React Native on your project, according to the\n[documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading.html),\nyou have to run the CLI command `react-native upgrade` to upgrade the files in the\n`ios` and `android` directories with the new template.\n\nThis process can be painful if you had made some changes in these files, especially\nthose which are not meant to be read by human (the goddam `project.pbxproj` !).\nIt inevitably happens by using 3rd-party librairies or changing native\nstuff (device orientation, splash screen, etc.).\n\nThe CLI detects any file changed by user, shows the diff and asks user if it\nmust be override or keep untouched.\n\nBy knowing the real changes due to the React Native upgrade, you can easily\nknow which option is the best for you. For example, from\n[the 0.28.0 to the 0.29.0](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/compare/rn-0.28.0...rn-0.29.0)\nthe changes in the `android` files are huge so it may be easier for you to override\nand reapplied your changes (relinking your 3-rd parties, etc.) **BUT** if you\nlook at the `project.pbxproj`, there is only one flag added, so the best decision\nfor this file is to keep it untouched and report the flag yourself on the right\nposition.\n\n## Known issues\n\n### babel\n\nThe version 0.56.0 and 0.57.0 changed a lot about the packager and babel. Because the upgrade was not easy or successful, I created a new project over the existing, and got the diff that way.\n\nThe version jumps from 0.55.4 to 0.57.0.\n\n### index.js\n\nThe version 0.49.0 introduces a unified entry-point: `index.ios.js` and `index.android.js` were replaced by `index.js`.\n\nrn-diff doesn't show that change because the concerned files are [skipped during the upgrade process](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/0cd69e8a02d254577fac9ccd3ff8a1727a024cc8/local-cli/generator/copyProjectTemplateAndReplace.js#L45-L47).\n\nThat change is referenced in some native files though, so you have to follow the update guide in the [0.49.0 release notes](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/releases/tag/v0.49.0).\n\n\n### AndroidManifest.xml\n\nDue to an issue with the Yeoman generator used before 0.39.0 (the `AndroidManifest.xml`\nfile was never updated), the diff of this file\n[from 0.38.0 to 0.39.0](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/compare/rn-0.38.0...rn-0.39.0#diff-ce925d749acbf5fb99afc2d465a0f352)\nis irrelevant. It shows the diff from **0.23.0** to 0.39.0 because the RnDiffApp has been\ngenerated with 0.23.0. You'll probably have less changes on this file when upgrading from 0.38.0 to\n0.39.0 depending of the version your app has been generated with. See\n[#8](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/issues/8) for details.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Why starting from 0.23.0 ?\n\nThe starting point is the generation of an app with the CLI tool. I've started from the first\nversion of `react-native` since the release 0.2.0 the `react-native-cli` (March 2016), the first\nto seem mature and stable (3 months after the previous release).\n\n### How did you do this ?\n\nI initialized the 3 or 4 first commits manually to see where was it going. Then I automated\nthings with this [script](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/blob/master/new-version.sh).\n\n### How can I contribute ?\n\nUnfortunately you can't ;). Correct me if I'm wrong but due to the particular structure of the\nbranch tree, it's impossible to collaborate in the classic way (Pull Request on a non-existing\nbranch).\n\nNevertheless, when a new version of React Native is released, I'll have to be prompt to provide\nthe new diff. I guess having 3 or 4 collaborators on this project will help in the future.\nIf you're interested, please open an issue to discuss.\n\nOf course, the above doesn't concern suggesting changes on the `master` branch (script or\nREADME.md). Pull Requests are highly welcome !\n"

          "content": "# Using rn-diff patches\n\nThe git patches can be used as a replacement of `react-native upgrade`. The procedure isn't really\nstraightforward but it's still more efficient than using the upgrade command.\n\n## Procedure\n\n#### 1 Download the git patch\n\nDownload the patch for your version, for example:\n\n```shell\ncurl https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/compare/rn-0.29.0...rn-0.30.0.diff > upgrade-rn.patch\n```\n\n#### 2 Prepare the patch\n\nThe patch is made for the RnDiffApp located in the *RnDiffApp* folder of this repository.\nTo use it in your own repository, some changes are needed.\n\nDon't worry about the root folder *RnDiffApp*, it can be ignored with the option `-p 2`\n(see https://git-scm.com/docs/git-apply)\n\nThen, some files include the name of the app in their path:\n\n- All files in the `ios` directory (example: `ios/RnDiffApp/AppDelegate.m`)\n- Some files in the `android` directory (example:\n`android/app/src/main/java/com/rndiffapp/MainActivity.java`)\n\nYou have to edit the patch and replace all occurences of `ios/RnDiffApp` and `com/rndiffapp`\nby the name of your app.\n\n#### 3 Set up the 3-way merge\n\nBy default in case of conflicts, the `git apply` command will fail and leave the files untouched.\nIt could be interesting to fallback on a 3-way merge (option `--3way`) in order to resolve the\nconflicts with your favorite merge tool.\n\nTo do this, git needs to know the blob referenced in the patch\n(line `index 4c88077..e49e881 100644` for example). So you have to add rn-diff as a remote\nrepository and fetch it (see this [SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33577383/git-apply-3way-error-repository-lacks-the-necessary-blob-to-fall-back-on-3-way) \nfor details).\n\n```shell\ngit remote add rn-diff https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff.git\ngit fetch rn-diff\n```\n\n#### 4 Run the apply command\n```shell\ngit apply upgrade-rn.patch --exclude=package.json -p 2 --3way\n```\n\n\n## Wrap up\n\n```shell\n# Download the patch\ncurl https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/compare/rn-0.29.0...rn-0.30.0.diff > upgrade-rn.patch\n\n# Replace RnDiffApp occurences\nappNameCamelCase=MyApp\nappNameLowerCase=myapp\nsed -i \"\" \"s-ios/RnDiffApp-ios/${appNameCamelCase}-\" upgrade-rn.patch\nsed -i \"\" \"s-java/com/rndiffapp-java/com/${appNameLowerCase}-\" upgrade-rn.patch\n\n# Set up the 3-way merge\ngit remote add rn-diff https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff.git\ngit fetch rn-diff\n\n# Run the apply command\ngit apply upgrade-rn.patch --exclude=package.json -p 2 --3way\n```\n\n## :warning: Known issues\n\n- A new Java file has been added in [0.29.0](https://github.com/ncuillery/rn-diff/compare/rn-0.28.0...rn-0.29.0#diff-dc772a7e567909f837c8078e7db52a27R1).\nIt contains the name of the app (package declaration) at line 1.
