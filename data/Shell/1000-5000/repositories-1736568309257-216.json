Watching all the sessions is pretty time-consuming and help is highly appreciated.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nYou should have a look at the [open PR's](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/pulls) before you start watching a session. There is a chance that a session has already been processed so you can focus on another video.\n\nI watch sessions in 1.5 speed using the awesome player from wwdc.io. It is hard to follow at this speed but this is the only way for me to watch so many of them. You can try it and if it feels too fast, just reduce the speed to 1.25 which should be fine for most of the people.\n\nWrite in a text editor that offers spell check. You'll be surprised by the amount of typos and small mistakes we make by typing while paying attention to the session :)\n\n## Submitting Changes\n\nPlease respect the following rules to maintain a consistent look and feel across the session notes:\n\n- The main file README.md including table of contents is **auto-generated** when your PR is merged please don't edit it.\n- Search your session markdown file among `./summaries/2020/<session_number>.md` and put your session in there. Please make sure your file has no top/bottom blank lines when you're finished editing.\n- Don't forget to mention the authors below the session link in the format `_Author_1, Author_2_`. You'll find the authors at the beginning of each video.\n- The video duration is not needed here since you can see it when you click the link.\n- For the session please do not add **code samples** (except one-liners) and no **images**. I plan to have all session notes skimmable as easy as possible. But you can link to the relevant position in the video by using a short link like this one: [22:32](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/245/?time=1337). The time parameter is in seconds. Just put in the time where the interesting part starts in the video.\n- Writing while watching the session can be challenging and you'll often make typos or innocent grammar mistakes. Please review what you're submitting before opening a PR, as this will make your notes available to others faster, and with higher quality.\n- `objc` != `Obj-C` != `objective-C` != `Objective-C`. `IOS` is not an Apple operating system and neither `XCode` is an IDE (`iOS` and `Xcode` would be correct). Please double check your spelling and make sure it's consistent.\n\nWhen you are finished please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/compare) with some notes of what you have done (read more about [PRs](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).\n\n## Commit Messages\n\n### Submit a Session\n\nIt will be enough to have a one-line commit message that contains the title of the session, like:\n\n```\nAdd Session \\\"Platform State of the Union\\\"\n```\n\n### Submit a Fix\n\nHere it's enough to quickly mention what you did, like:\n\n```\nFixed typo\n```\n\n```\nAdded Description if Feature xyz\n```\n\nThanks so much for your contribution,\nStefan\n"

I would like to take the moment to thank all of you for contribution, feedback, support and reading my session notes 🙏\n\n## Intro\n\nUsually it is much faster to read through some bullet points instead of watching a 50 min session video. Then if you find something interesting you can still watch it.\n\nSessions that are exceptionally mentionable are highlighted using a ★.\n\n> This is work in progress since it is a lot of effort to watch all the videos by myself. So either please be patient or just [open up an issue](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/issues/new) to make a suggestion which session notes you like to see next :)\n\n## Contribution\n\nFeel free to submit a PR if I got something wrong or you have a suggestion for improvement. Please also have a look in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute.\n\nThanks so much to EVERYBODY who contributed and improved the overall quality of the notes and those who added complete notes to the list.\n\n## Mentions\n\nThis repo has already been mentioned many times on Twitter and apart from this also in the following places:\n\n- [iOS Dev Weekly Issue 409](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/409)\n- [iOS Goodies Issue 287](https://ios-goodies.com/post/185729205551/week-287)\n- [Swift Developments Issue 189](https://andybargh.com/swiftdevelopments-189/)\n- [WWDCNotes](https://www.wwdcnotes.com/)\n\n## Interesting WWDC-Related Links\n\n- [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation) by [@Apple](https://twitter.com/apple)\n- [Xcode Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/)\n- [iOS & iPadOS Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_ipados_release_notes)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n![Progress](https://progress-bar.dev/31/?scale=204&title=Progress&width=600&suffix=%20/%20204%20Sessions)\n\n1. **(TO-DO)** [Expanding automation with the App Store Connect API](#Expanding-automation-with-the-App-Store-Connect-API)\n1. **(TO-DO)** [What's new in assessment](#Whats-new-in-assessment)\n1.

Don't need to think about the old state at all.\n    - Set the image and text on the content configuration. \n    - `cell.contentConfiguration = content` As soon as we call this, the cell is updated to display the image and text that we specified.\n  - Same code to configure any cell and any view that supports content configurations.\n  - Composable, lightweight, very inexpensive to create and built for performance\n- **Configuration types**\n  - Background Configuration\n    - let you set things such as background color, visual effect, stroke, insets, corner radius and custom view\n  - List Content Configuration\n    - let you set things such as image, text, secondary text, layout metrics and behaviors\n- **Configuration state**\n  - Configuration state represents the various inputs that you use to configure your cells and views.\n  - Each cell, header and footer has its own configuration state.\n  - **Two Types**\n    - **View configuration state**\n      - Trait collection\n      - 4 states: highlighted, selected, disabled and focused\n      - Custom state: this is key-value storage to add any extra states or data that use to configuring your view.\n    - **Cell configuration state**\n      - Everything from the View configuration state\n      - Editing, swiped, expanded\n      - Drag and drop states\n  - When `automaticallyUpdatesContentConfiguration` is true, The cell automatically calls `updated(for:)` on its contentConfiguration when the cell’s configurationState changes, and applies the updated configuration back to the cell. The default value is true.\n  - When `automaticallyUpdatesBackgroundConfiguration` is true, the cell automatically calls `updated(for:)` on its backgroundConfiguration when the cell’s configurationState changes, and applies the updated configuration back to the cell. The default value is true.\n  - You can override `updateConfiguration(using:)` to manually update and customize the content configuration, disable automatic updates by setting this property to false. This method is called before your cell first displays and will be called anytime the configuration state have changed.\n\n\n## Meet WidgetKit\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10028\n\nPresenters: _Nahir Khan, Neil Desai_\n\n- Widgets are now used across all platforms\n- Great widgets are glancable, relevant and personalized\n- **Smart stacks** are collections of widgets and automatically show the right one on top using on-device intelligence\n- Widgets support **configuration** by tapping them - this is realized using **intents** similar to SiriKit\n- e.g. choosing the city in a Weather app\n- UI built entirely in SwiftUI\n- **How WidgetKit works**\n  - WidgetKit extensions are background extensions \n  - They return a series of view hierarchies in a time line\n  - Time line is sent to the home screen which presents the right view at the right time\n  - Since views are \"ready\" they can be re-used at different points in the system, e.g. the Widget Gallery\n  - Time line is refreshed from main app and updates are scheduled by extension\n    - Imagine the Calendar time line for the day. One event is updated from Calendar, which then wakes up the extension and provides the new time line.\n- **Building a Widget**\n  - Single Widget Extension supports multiple kinds of widgets on different platforms\n  - **Possible configurations:** `Static` (Workout widget) or `Intent-Based` (Reminder widget that can be personalized)\n  - **Supported Families:** A widget can enable one or many of the following families: `systemSmall`, `systemMedium`, `systemLarge`\n  - Widget struct must conform to `Widget` and its body to `WidgetConfiguration`\n  - **How to build a glancable experience**\n    - Widgets are **not** mini apps they rather project content on the home screen\n    - No scrolling\n    - No videos or animated images\n    - Tap interactions to deep link into main app. Widget associable with a URL link using the widgetURL API (use the new Link API of SwiftUI)\n    - Important new view types: \n      - `Placeholder`\n        - Should not contain user data\n        - Great placeholder UIs show a representation of what kind your data is\n      - `Snapshot` \n        - Represent a single entry in time\n        - Should return a view as quickly as possible\n        - Used to display your widget in the gallery\n        - Use it as the first entry in your time line so users get what they see in the gallery\n      - `Time line`\n        - Combination of views and dates\n        - Output if WidgetKit extension is serialized to disk which enabled rendering of individual entries just in time\n    - **Reloads** \n      - Wake up the extension and ask for a new time line\n      - Help to ensure that content is up to date\n  - Get a `TimelineProvider` by `struct Provider: TimelineProvider`\n    - Implement `func snapshot(...)` and `func timeline(...)` for returning the respective data\n    - Provide a reload policy at Time line cretion time  to tell when the time line should be reloaded: `atEnd`, `after(date: Date)`, `never`\n  - System determines the best time to reload the widget, e.g. based on:\n    - Background notification\n    - Significant time change\n    - Changes in the app made by the user, e.g. new Calendar entry\n  - Use `WidgetCenter.[reloadTimelines(ofKind:), reloadAllTimelined]` to programmatically reload time lines\n  - Get current configurations with `WidgetCenter.getCurrentConfigurations(completion:)`\n    - Use batch requests \n    - Do not overuse networking from a widget\n  - Use `onBackgroundURLSessionEvents` modifier to launch a network task which delivers the result to your extension\n    - Reloads are budgeted by the system, do not overuse them\n  - **Personalization**\n    - Use the `Intents` framework, known from Siri, to customize the widgets behavior\n    - Use the new **In-App Intent Handling** to answer requests from your widget\n    - `IntentConfiguration` is used to power intent-based widget configurations\n    - `IntentTimelineProvider` is used to generate specific time lines\n  - **Intelligence**\n    - Widgets are displayed on the home screen by on-device intelligence\n    - Your app can donate shortcuts\n    - Widget extension can annotate time line entries using `TimelineEntryRelevance` with its score and duration properties\n\n\n## Stacks, Grids, and Outlines in SwiftUI\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10031\n\nPresenters: _Example Guy, Another Person_\n\n##### TO-DO!

Changes to it will re-render **all** scenes (instances/windows) of your app\n  - New 2020: Property Wrappers that offer **data persistence across app restarts** and can be used as source of truth\n    - `@SceneStorage`\n      - Per-scene property wrapper for reading/writing data managed by SwiftUI\n      - Light-weight storage for your views data\n      - Use it to populate your collection views\n    - `@AppStorage`\n      - App-scoped global storage, persisted using `UserDefaults`, usable anywhere (app/view)\n      - Perfect for storing settings\n      - `@AppStorage(\"amountOfGold\") private var amountOfGold = 5000`\n      - Automatically reads/writes from/to UserDefaults whenever the property changes\n\n\n## What's new in SwiftUI\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10041\n\nPresenters: _Matt Ricketson, Taylor Kelly_\n\n- **Apps**\n  - Bild your whole app using SwiftUI: `struct BookClubApp: App`\n  - Apps can declare data dependencies\n  - Use `WindowGroup` to manage windows platform independent. Supports multiple windows on macOS and iPadOS out of the bos\n  - Use `Settings` to get a preference pane for free • available on macOS\n  - Use `DocumentGroup` scene type to automatically handle opening, saving and editing documents • macOS, iOS, iPadOS\n  - Use `CommandMenu` command to add additional menus to the menu bar including keyboard shortcuts\n  - New multi-platform templates specifically for SwiftUI apps\n  - `LaunchScreen` Info.plist key to configure your launch screen • simple alternative to the storyboard\n- **Widgets**\n  - iOS, iPadOS, macOS exclusively built using SwiftUI\n  - Declared by `struct YourWidget: Widget` and `var body: some WidgetConfiguration`\n  - Use SwiftUI to build custom complications for watchOS\n- **Lists and Collections**\n  - List now receive outlines to quickly access the lists content • reduces the need for push/pop navigation patterns\n  - Lazy loading grid layouts (`Lazy[V|H]Stack`) to reduce memory footprint and preserve smooth scrolling for large amounts of data\n  - View Builder for switch statements to show e.g. different image styles in a list of images\n- **Toolbars and Controls**\n  - `.toolbar` modifier for unified display of toolbars\n  - Use `ToolbarItem(placement: .principal)` to make an item prominent\n  - Use `ToolbarItem(placement: .bottomBar)` to place an item in the bottom bar\n  - When using `Label(\"Title\", systemImage: \"sf.symbol.name\")` SwiftUI automatically display icon and/or text depending on where the label is displayed: toolbar, list, ...\n  - `.keyboardShortcut` modifier can now be used for additional controls like `Button`\n  - New default focus support in tvOS\n  - New controls:\n    - `ProgressView(\"Downloading\", value: progress)` - horizontal bar\n    - `ProgressView(\"Downloading\", value: progress).progressViewStyle(CircularViewStyle())` - circular progress indicator\n    - `ProgressView()` - spinner\n    - `Gauge` to indicate the level of value • can contain value labels and min/max value labels\n- **New effects and styling**\n  - New control center UI with beautiful transitions\n  - `.matchedGeometryEffect` to provide smooth animations inside of a grid of UI elements\n  - `.clipShape(ContainerRelativeShape())` to automatically apply a super views shape to the subview\n  - custom fonts automatically scaled with dynamic type changes\n  - Custom accent color directly form the AssetCatalog on all platforms\n  - Many controls can now be tinted\n- **System integration**\n   - New `Link` control to display URLs in link style and open them with the default browser • also supports url schemes to open other apps\n   - `@Environment(\\.openURL) private var openURL` to programmatically open urls via `openURL(url)` in your views\n   - `onDrag {}` and `onDrop {}` to support drag & drop\n   - `UniformTypeIdentifers` framework for e.g. introspection of file types\n   - `Sign in with Apple` as first class component in SwiftUI • available on every platform\n   - Other Frameworks: **AuthenticationServices**, **AVKit**, **MapKit**, **SceneKit**, **SpriteKit**\n\n\n## Build SwiftUI apps for tvOS\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10042\n\nPresenters: _Example Guy, Another Person_\n\n##### TO-DO!

In Applications running in the background, this creates a risk of termination. Remember to call `endBackgroundTask` for your task in a timely manner to avoid this._)\n    - Expiration handler\n      - Implement an `expirationHandler`\n      - Call `endBackgroundTask(_:)` inside the handler\n      - Do not begin new work\n      - Do not rely on it exclusively\n      - Add telemetry at the start and end of each expiration handler\n      - Inspect [`MXMetricPayload`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxmetricpayload)\n    - Check [`backgroundTimeRemaining`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplication/1623029-backgroundtimeremaining)\n      - Only start work if plenty of time remains\n      - Unsafe to begin tasks with < 5 seconds remaining\n    - Avoid leaking [`UIBackgroundTaskIdentifier`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uibackgroundtaskidentifier)\n- **New MetricKit API (iOS 14)**\n  - [`MXBackgroundExitData`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxbackgroundexitdata)  shows how often these terminations happen providing counts of each termination type\n    - `cumulativeBadAccessExitCount`\n    - `cumulativeIllegalInstructionExitCount`\n    - `cumulativeAbnormalExitCount`\n    - `cumulativeMemoryResourceLimitExitCount`\n    - `cumulativeMemoryPressureExitCount`\n    - `cumulativeSuspendedWithLockedFileExitCount`\n    - `cumulativeAppWatchdogExitCount`\n    - `cumulativeBackgroundTaskAssertionTimeoutExitCount`\n    - `cumulativeNormalExitCount`\n  - Crash reporting via MetricKit\n    - Diagnostics on a per-device basis\n    - Ability to get crash info programmatically directly from the device\n    - [`MXCrashDiagnostic`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/metrickit/mxcrashdiagnostic)\n      - Stack trace\n      - Signal\n      - Exception code\n      - Termination reason\n    - Check out [What's New in MetricKit](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC#whats-new-in-metrickit) to get detailed information\n- **How to improve multi-tasking experience?**\n  - Identify and fix terminations\n  - Reduce memory usage\n  - Implement state restoration\n\n\n## What's new in MetricKit\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10081\n\nPresenters: _Example Guy, Another Person_\n\n##### TO-DO!

Why we should build something?\n- **Intelligent System Experience**\n  - The main idea is to be proactive\n  - Intelligence is how the OS works with the apps that people use every day to make the \"every day\" easier for people\n  - Intelligence is design (it should be viewed as a design practice)\n- **Living design**. What is that?\n  - The core job of the designer is to help people accomplish something\n  - One of the key ways a designer can leverage this is by using elements familiar to the user\n  - People use a signifier or a symbol\n  - For example, \"Share\" button. In the case of iOS, almost everyone can easily recognize the \"default\" share symbol because it consistently gets used across a lot of apps\n  - Intelligence is a platform convention, it's in a static glyph or icon, like the share button. It's live\n  - Intelligence manifests itself by adapting to how the system, the platform, conforms to how people use their devices\n  - Intelligence is expected (people expect their devices and apps to be smart)\n- **Extensibility**\n  - Intelligence is powered by an app through extensibility\n  - Apps have actually been evolving over time\n  - A lot of the technologies built by Apple that are foundational to the intelligence system (starting from App Extensions debuted at WWDC 2014 and ending with App Clips so far)\n  - It's built to help growing ecosystem of devices and apps\n  - Intelligence system is built from a foundation of respecting users privacy\n- In the next sessions about system intelligence, Apple's team will try to cover it from a few different angles\n\n\n## Design for intelligence: Make friends with \"The System\"\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10087\n\nPresenters: _Example Guy, Another Person_\n\n##### TO-DO!

from the layout, the \"where\" content is being rendered.\n    - For layout, an abstract class is `UICollectionViewLayout`, and a concrete subclass is `UICollectionViewFlowLayout`.\n    - For the presentation, there are `UICollectionViewCell` and `UICollectionReusableView`.\n    - In iOS 13, there are two new components for Data and Layout respectively with Diffable Data Source and Compositional Layout. \n  - Section snapshot [New in iOS 14]\n    - Allow data sources to be more composable into section-sized chunks of data.\n    - Allow modeling of hierarchical data, which is needed to support rendering outline-style UIs.\n- **Compositional Layout**\n  - Recap\n    - Compositional Layout was introduced in iOS 13\n    - Allows us to build rich, complex layouts by composing smaller, easy-to-reason bits of layout together.\n    - Describes what the layout to look like instead of how the layout ought to work.\n    - Section-specific layouts to help you build more sophisticated UIs\n    - Support for orthogonal scrolling sections.\n- **Lists [New in iOS 14]**\n    - `UITableView`-like sections right in to any `UICollectionView`.\n    - Rich with features you've come to expect from `UITableView`, like swipe actions and many common cell layouts. \n    - Easily mix and match Lists with other kinds of layout on a per-section basis.\n    - Concrete `UICollectionViewListCell`, header and footer support\n    - New Sidebar appearance we see in many iPadOS system apps.\n- **Modern Cells**\n  - Cell registrations\n    - Simple, reusable way to set up a cell from a view model.\n    - Eliminate the extra step of registering a cell class or nib to associate it with a reuse identifier.\n    - Use a generic registration type which incorporates a configuration closure for setting up a new cell from a view model.\n  - Cell content configurations. \n    - Standardized layouts for cells similar to what is seen in `UITableView` standard cell types.\n    - Can be used with any cell, or even a generic UIView. \n  - Background configurations. \n    - Similar to content configurations but apply to any cell's background with the ability to adjust properties such as color, border styles and more.\n\n\n## What's new in Universal Links\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10098\n\nPresenter: _Christopher Linn_\n\n- **Universal Links**\n  - HTTPS URLs that represent your content both on the web and in your app\n  - Allow to open your app instead of browser\n  - Enable by adding an entitlement to your app and a JSON file to your web server - creates secure association between both\n  - Custom URL schemes not recommended anymore - switch as soon as possible\n- **Support for watchOS**\n  - Same functionalities like on iOS, tvOS and macOS\n  - Apply entitlement to your WatchKit extension - not your WatchKit App\n  - Use `[WKExtensionDelegate.handle(_ userActivity: NSUserActivity) -> Void](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkextensiondelegate/2798966-handle)` to handle Universal Links\n  - Use `[WKExtension.shared().openSystemURL(url)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkextension/1628224-opensystemurl)` to open Universal Links in other apps\n  - Different API on iOS (UIKit) and macOS (AppKit)\n- **Universal Links in SwiftUI**\n  - Now it is possible to handle Universal Links equally on all platforms\n  - Handle Universal Links using `.onOpenURL { url in /* ... */ }`\n  - Open Universal Links in other apps using `@Environment (\\.openURL) var openURL; let url = /* ... */; openURL(url)`\n- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**\n  - `*` matches zero or more characters greedily\n  - `?` matches any one character\n  - `*?` matches at least one character\n  - `\"components\": [{ \"/\": \"/sourdough/?*\", \"caseSensitive\": false }]` for case-insensitive pattern matching (macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and iOS 13.5)\n  - `\"components\": [{ \"/\": \"/中國哲學書電子化計劃/?*\", \"percentEncoded\": false }]` for Unicode pattern matching (macOS Big Sur and iOS 14)\n  - `\"defaults\": { \"percentEncoded\": false, \"caseSensitive\": false }` to specify defaults for all components (macOS Big Sur and iOS 14)\n    - Apply `defaults` to \"details\" (includes app IDs and components) or only to \"components\" to match all elements of the respective arrays\n- **Substitution Variables**\n  - Named lists of substrings to match against\n  - Names can contain anything but `$`, `(`, `)`\n  - Names are always case sensitive in patterns\n  - Values can contain `?` and `*` but no other substitution variables\n  - Values are case-sensitive by default\n  - Available today in macOS Catalina 10.15.6 and iOS 13.5\n  - **Predefined Substitution Variables**\n    - `$(alpha)* - match upper and lower case letters`\n    - `$(upper),$(lower)* - match either upper or lower case letters`\n    - `$(alnum)* - match upper and lower case letters including digits`\n    - `$(digit),$(xdigit)* - match either digits or hexadecimal digits`\n    - `$(region)** - match every ISO region code defined by Foundation: Locale.isoRegionCodes`\n    - `$(lang)** - match every ISO language code defined by Foundation: Locale.isoLanguageCodes`\n    - Use `\"exclude\": true` to exclude specific patterns\n    - Substitution variables can be used to form different combinations of patterns, e.g. show different menus for different countries\n    - **Example**\n      ```json\n      {\n        \"appLinks\": {\n          \"substitutionVariables\": {\n            \"food\": [ \"burrito\", \"sushi\" ],\n            \"Canadian food\": [ \"burrito\", \"poutine\", \"tête-de-violon\" ]\n          },\n          \"details\": [{\n            \"appIDs\": [ \"ABCDEF.com..example.restaurant\" ],\n            \"components\": [\n              { \"/\": \"$(lang)_CA/$(Canadian food)/\", \"percentEncoded\": false }\n              { \"/\": \"$(lang)_CA/$(food)/\", \"exclude\": true }\n              { \"/\": \"$(lang)_$(region)/$(food)/\" }\n            ]\n          }]\n        }\n      }\n      ```\n- **Universal Links Workflow** \n  - After download of an app the system checks its entitlements to see if it needs any app-association files, and downloads them\n  - App association files can now be downloaded in parallel by connecting to an **Apple CDN** instead of opening one connection per downloaded app\n    - CDN is dedicated to associated domains\n    - CDN uses single HTTP/2 connection for all associated domains on a device\n    - CDN Reduces load on your server\n    - CDN routes devices to a known-good, known-fast connection\n  - **Alternate Modes** for internal domains not reachable from an Apple CDN\n    - **Managed Mode** when distributing within your organization (see [What's New in Managing Apple Devices (WWDC20)](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC#Whats-new-in-managing-Apple-devices))\n      - System trusted root certificate\n      - MDN admin must opt-in\n      - Works using any profile\n    - **Developer Mode** when building your app\n      - Use any SSL certificate\n      - User must opt-in from `iOS Settings > Developer > Associated Domains Development` or for macOS using the command `swcutil developer-mode -e true`\n      - Only works using a development profile\n    - Server path for all modes: `https://example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`\n    - Specify domains for different modes in the entitlements as `<string>applinks:testing.example.com?mode=developer</string>` (or `?mode=managed` or `?mode=developer+managed`) in an array under the key `com.apple.developer.associated-domains`\n\n\n## Explore the Action & Vision app\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10099\n\nPresenters: _Example Guy, Another Person_\n\n##### TO-DO!

Reserve complex features for your app\n  - Require all assets for initial experience\n  - Do not include splash screens\n  - Avoid requiring people to sign up _before_ finishing their task\n  - Only ask for location and notification permissions if needed (more on this below)\n  - Make sure your App Clip has the same name and icon as your app\n  - Put shared assets in a shared asset catalog\n  - Authentication\n    - Support Sign in with Apple\n    - Use `ASWebAuthenticationSession` for other federated login\n    - Offer username and password login for existing users\n    - Offer \"Sign In With Apple\" upgrade in the app\n  - For privacy reasons, and because App Clips are ephemeral, some contents are not available to App Clips, such as HealthKit info\n  - App Clips can request permission to use Bluetooth, the camera, and microphone\n- **Streamlining Transactions**\n  - 2 new types of ephemeral permissions: Location and Notification\n    - Allows App Clips to check if the user is within a region, **without prompting for location permission**\n      - Add `NSAppClipRequestLocationConfirmation` with value `true` in your `Info.plist` to enable this\n      - Supports checking a region with a radius of up to 500 meters\n    - Allows App Clips to send notifications for up to 8 hours after each launch, **without prompting for notification permission**.\n      - Add `NSAppClipRequestEphemeralUserNotification` with value `true` in your Info.plist to enable this\n      - Check the authorization status in the `NotificationSettings`, under the new `.ephemeral` status\n    - Users can explicitly disable these permissions via App Clip settings panel\n    - App Clips can prompt the user for full Location and Notifications access, although discouraged\n  - Strongly suggest using ApplePay\n  - Strongly suggest using \"Sign In With Apple\"\n  - Use `AuthenticationServices` API to sign your users in without showing a login screen (assuming they have already previously signed up in your website for instance)\n- **Transition users to your app**\n  - iOS suggests downloading your app from App Clip experiences, banners and App Clip settings\n  - You can embed `StoreKit` `SKOverlay` in a view\n    - Suggestion: display this overlay only after the user finishes their task, e.g. after payment\n  - **Transfer data on device with a secure App Group**\n    - Only accessible between your App Clip and your app\n    - Once user downloads the app, the App Group will be transferred to the app after the App Clip is deleted\n    - Migrate your \"Sign In With Apple\" session from your App Clip by persisting the user ID in the secure App Group. Use `ASAuthorizationAppleIDProvider` to verify the user's session without prompting UI\n\n\n## Discover AppleSeed for IT and Managed Software Updates\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10138\n\nPresenters: _Example Guy, Another Person_\n\n##### TO-DO!

You can contribute to this session, please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n## Configure and link your app clips\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10146/\n\nPresenters: _Ada Chan, Luming Yin_\n\n- **Intro**\n  - App Clips provide entry points to your users to experience your app with minimal friction.\n  - Use deep-linked navigation to present the App Clip\n- **User Quest**\n  - User is in a smoothie shop. They see an NFC tag and tap it using the phone.\n  - An app clip shows up on the phone's lockscreen with summarized detail about that smoothie.\n  - User taps \"open\" and a single screen of your app shows up.\n  - User can then proceed to the payment via Apple Pay.\n- **Activation**\n  - Tapping NFC tags or scanning QR codes - they're just deep links after all (a URL)\n  - Maps and Siri Nearby Suggestions (for registered businesses)\n  - Smart app banner in your website (shown in Safari and Messages)\n  - Apple App Clip codes will be introduced later this year (it's a prettified QR code)\n  - If the user already has the your app installed, following an App Clip link will open the full app instead.\n- **Setup**\n  - Configure web server and App Clip for link handling\n    - Web Server: Update the apple-app-site-association file\n    - App Clip: Add associated domains entitlement and handle NSUserActivity\n  - Configure App Clip default and advanced experiences on App Store Connect\n    - Layout requirements:\n      - Title: 18 chars limit\n      - Subtitle: 43 chars limit\n      - Image:\n        - Size: 3000 x 2000px\n        - Aspect Ratio: 3:2\n        - Format: png/jpg\n        - Transparency: No\n    - **Best Practices**\n      - URL mapping is based on **most specific** prefix match against registered App Clip experience URLs\n      - Your App Clip must be able to launch using an exact registered URL. For example:\n        - App registers https://bikesrental.com/rent instead of https://website.com/rent?bikeID=2\n        - When receiving https://website.com/rent?bikeID=2, it should be able to deliver the https://website.com/rent App Clip\n        - App is responsible for parsing the remaining arguments and presenting the specific bike with ID 2\n        - You can also register a more specific URL if you want to provide a different and more specific App Clip experience for it\n  - Configure the Smart App Banner to open App Clip (add this if the content of your web page can be delivered as a better and more streamlined app experience)\n    - Add/update your website's HTML to add the Smart App Banner meta tag\n- **Test**\n  - Specify an App Clip URL under the `_XCAppClipURL` environment variable to launch App Clip from Xcode\n  - TestFlight - new App Clips section in App Store Connect\n\n\n## Distribute binary frameworks as Swift packages\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10147\n\nPresenters: _Boris Buegling_\n\n- **Xcode 11**\n  - Introduction of Swift Packages to distribute libraries as source code\n  - Introduction of XCFrameworks to distribute closed-source binary frameworks and libraries\n- **Xcode 12** adds support for binary dependencies \n- **Binary Dependencies (XCFrameworks)**\n  - Used to distribute closed-source frameworks, static and dynamic libraries\n  - Contain a single module\n  - Easily addable via the `Xcode > File > Swift Packages > Add Package Dependency`\n  - Has sub directories corresponding to platform and target environment, each containing a framework\n  - Declare dependency in your Package.swift using `.package(url: \"https://github.com/owner/package\", from: \"1.0.0\")`\n- **Distribute Binary Frameworks as a Swift Package**\n  - New target type `.binaryTarget(name: \"Emoji\", url: https://example.com/Emoji/Emoji-1.0.0.xcframework.zip, checksum: \"6d98....\")`\n  - Binary targets can be offered to clients just like regular targets\n  - **Binary Targets** \n    - Use XCFrameworks\n    - Only supported on Apple platforms\n    - HTTPS or path based - paths can point to files inside your package\n    - Name corresponds to the module name\n    - Use semantic versioning\n- **Create your own Binary Dependency**\n  - Create `File > New Swift Package`\n  - Replace template-added targets and add a binary target\n  - Compute the checksum using `swift package compute-checksum Emoji-1.0.0.xcframework.zip`\n  - Set `Build Libraries for Distribution` build setting\n  - Archive each variant\n  - `xcodebuild -create-xcframework`\n  - See [2019 session \"Binary frameworks in Swift\"](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc19/416) or read the [session notes](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/tree/2019#binary-frameworks-in-swift) which is way quicker\n- Tradeoffs of Binary Dependencies\n  - Harder to debug since source code is missing\n  - You won't be able to compile for your specific platform if not included by the author\n\n\n## Inspect, modify, and construct PencilKit drawings\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10148\n\nPresenters: _Example Guy, Another Person_\n\n##### TO-DO!

Xcode 11.4 - Swift 5.2\n  - Xcode 12 (beta) - Swift 5.3\n- **Runtime Performance**\n  - Code Size\n    - Code size is the part of the app that represents the machine code representation of the app's logic\n    - Swift 5.3 is below 1.5 times the code size of Objective-C version (based on app that ships with iOS)\n    - Size difference is inevitable because of Swift safety features\n    - SwiftUI app binary code size can be reduced by 40% (based on MoviesSwiftUI app)\n  - Memory Layout\n    - Comparing models with three properties in Obj-C (`NSUUID`, `NSString` and `float`) and Swift (`UUID`, `String`, `Float`)\n    - In Obj-C, object variables are just pointers which then hold a pointer to their properties\n    - Swift's use of value types avoid the need to access values via pointers (UUID and Strings)\n    - Significant memory benefit because it is allocated directly within array storage (contiguous block of memory)\n    - Heap memory use comparison: 20kB in Swift 5.1 vs 35kB in Obj-C (400 models in array)\n    - Swift's Standard Library now is below Foundation in the stack which means it can be used to develop low-level frameworks for Objective-C frameworks where previously C has to be used!\n- **Diagnostics**\n  - New diagnostics in the Swift compiler result in more precise and actionable errors\n  - Additional notes in error messages (SwiftUI as an example)\n  - More info on [swift.org](https://swift.org/blog/new-diagnostic-arch-overview/)\n- **Code completion**\n  - Much better code completion thanks to improvements in SourceKit\n  - Code completion for dictionary literals, ternary expressions and more dynamic features like key paths\n  - Code completion in Xcode 12.0 is 15x faster compared to Xcode 11.5\n- **Code Indentation**\n  - Improved indentation formatting in chained methods calls, tuples, multiline `if` and `guards`\n  - Improved indentation in SwiftUI as well\n- **Debugging**\n  - Debugger now displays the reason for Swift runtime failure traps\n- **Cross-Platform Support**\n  - Multiple platform support\n    - Apple Platforms\n    - Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04\n    - CentOS 8\n    - Amazon Linux 2\n    - Windows (coming soon)\n  - Swift on AWS Lambda\n    - Runtime is open-source and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/)\n- **Language**\n  - [Swift Evolution website](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/)\n  - Multiple trailing closure syntax [SE-0279](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md)\n    - It's important to set the correct base name of the method that will indicate the first trailing closure that its label will be dropped\n  - Key Path Expressions as Functions [SE-0249](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0249-key-path-literal-function-expressions.md)\n  - `@main`: Type-Based Program Entry Points [SE-0281](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0281-main-attribute.md)\n    - The standardized way to delegate a program's entry point\n  - Increased availability of implicit self in @escaping closures when reference cycles are unlikely to occur [SE-0269](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0269-implicit-self-explicit-capture.md)\n    - Now it's possible to add `self` to the capture list\n    - In Swift 5.3, if self is a structure it can be omitted entirely from the closure\n  - Multi-Pattern Catch Clauses [SE-0276](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0276-multi-pattern-catch-clauses.md)\n  - Enum Enhancements\n    - `Comparable` conformance is now synthesized automatically [SE-0266](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0266-synthesized-comparable-for-enumerations.md)\n    - Enum cases as protocol witnesses [SE-0280](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses.md)\n  - Embedded DSL Enhancements\n    - Builder closures\n    - Swift 5.3 introduces pattern matching statements like `if let` and `switch`\n    - Builder inference (`@SceneBuilder` is not longer needed)\n- **Libraries**\n  - `Float16` [SE-0277](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0277-float16.md)\n    -

Due to dead lock, poorly chosen timeout.\n- **Execution Time Allowance [NEW in XCode 12]**\n  - When enabled, Xcode enforces a limit on the amount of time each individual test can take. When a test exceeds this limit, Xcode will first capture spin dump, then kill the test that hung, restart the test runner, so that the rest of the suite can execute.\n  - A spin dump shows you which functions each thread is spending the most time in. It's also possible to manually capture spin dump from Terminal using the spin dump command or from within Activity Monitor. \n  - By default, each test gets 10 minutes. If you need to a specific test or test class, you can use the `executionTimeAllowance` API to special case a particular test or subclass. For values under 60 seconds, they'll be rounded up to 60 seconds, the nearest whole minute.\n  - Prevent a test requests unlimited time by enforcing a maximum allowance.\n  - You can customize the default time allowance and a maximum allowance either via a setting in the Test Plan or through an Xcodebuild option.\n  - Use `XCTest`'s performance APIs to automate testing for regressions in the performance. Use Instruments to identify what parts of your code are slow,\n- **Parallel Distributed Testing**\n  - Xcode build will distribute tests to each run destination by class. Each device runs a single test class at a time.\n  - If you're testing logic that is device or OS specific, this can lead to unexpected failures or skipped tests.\n\n\n## Create custom apps for employees\n\nhttps://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10222\n\nPresenters: _Example Guy, Another Person_\n\n##### TO-DO!

I would like to take the moment to thank all of you for contribution, feedback, support and reading my session notes 🙏\n\n## Intro\n\nUsually it is much faster to read through some bullet points instead of watching a 50 min session video. Then if you find something interesting you can still watch it.\n\nSessions that are exceptionally mentionable are highlighted using a ★.\n\n> This is work in progress since it is a lot of effort to watch all the videos by myself. So either please be patient or just [open up an issue](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/issues/new) to make a suggestion which session notes you like to see next :)\n\n## Contribution\n\nFeel free to submit a PR if I got something wrong or you have a suggestion for improvement. Please also have a look in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute.\n\nThanks so much to EVERYBODY who contributed and improved the overall quality of the notes and those who added complete notes to the list.\n\n## Mentions\n\nThis repo has already been mentioned many times on Twitter and apart from this also in the following places:\n\n- [iOS Dev Weekly Issue 409](https://iosdevweekly.com/issues/409)\n- [iOS Goodies Issue 287](https://ios-goodies.com/post/185729205551/week-287)\n- [Swift Developments Issue 189](https://andybargh.com/swiftdevelopments-189/)\n- [WWDCNotes](https://www.wwdcnotes.com/)\n\n## Interesting WWDC-Related Links\n\n- [Apple Developer Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation) by [@Apple](https://twitter.com/apple)\n- [Xcode Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/)\n- [iOS & iPadOS Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios_ipados_release_notes)\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n![Progress]($progress_badge_url)\n\nEOT\n\nprintf '%s\\n' \"${toc[@]}\" >> $readme\nprintf '\\n\\n' >> $readme\nprintf '%s\\n\\n\\n' \"${content[@]}\" >> $readme"
