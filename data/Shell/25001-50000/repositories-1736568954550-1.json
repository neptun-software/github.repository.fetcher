Limitations on copyright\n\nNothing in this Licence is intended to deprive the Licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Work, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.\n\n5. Obligations of the Licensee\n\nThe grant of the rights mentioned above is subject to some restrictions and obligations imposed on the Licensee. Those obligations are the following:\n\nAttribution right: The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties.

The Licensee (becoming Licensor) cannot offer or impose any additional terms or conditions on the Work or Derivative Work that alter or restrict the terms of the Licence.\n\nCompatibility clause: If the Licensee Distributes or Communicates Derivative Works or copies thereof based upon both the Work and another work licensed under a Compatible Licence, this Distribution or Communication can be done under the terms of this Compatible Licence. For the sake of this clause, Compatible Licence refers to the licences listed in the appendix attached to this Licence. Should the Licensee's obligations under the Compatible Licence conflict with his/her obligations under this Licence, the obligations of the Compatible Licence shall prevail.\n\nProvision of Source Code: When distributing or communicating copies of the Work, the Licensee will provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source will be easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute or communicate the Work.\n\nLegal Protection: This Licence does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.\n\n6. Chain of Authorship\n\nThe original Licensor warrants that the copyright in the Original Work granted hereunder is owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\nEach Contributor warrants that the copyright in the modifications he/she brings to the Work are owned by him/her or licensed to him/her and that he/she has the power and authority to grant the Licence.\n\nEach time You accept the Licence, the original Licensor and subsequent Contributors grant You a licence to their contributions to the Work, under the terms of this Licence.\n\n7. Disclaimer of Warranty\n\nThe Work is a work in progress, which is continuously improved by numerous Contributors. It is not a finished work and may therefore contain defects or bugs inherent to this type of development.\nFor the above reason, the Work is provided under the Licence on an as is basis and without warranties of any kind concerning the Work, including without limitation merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, absence of defects or errors, accuracy, non-infringement of intellectual property rights other than copyright as stated in Article 6 of this Licence.\nThis disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of the Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights to the Work.\n\n8. Disclaimer of Liability\n\nExcept in the cases of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor will in no event be liable for any direct or indirect, material or moral, damages of any kind, arising out of the Licence or of the use of the Work, including without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, loss of data or any commercial damage, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damage. However, the Licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.\n\n9. Additional agreements\n\nWhile distributing the Work, You may choose to conclude an additional agreement, defining obligations or services consistent with this Licence. However, if accepting obligations, You may act only on your own behalf and on your sole responsibility, not on behalf of the original Licensor or any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against such Contributor by the fact You have accepted any warranty or additional liability.\n\n10. Acceptance of the Licence\n\nThe provisions of this Licence can be accepted by clicking on an icon I agree placed under the bottom of a window displaying the text of this Licence or by affirming consent in any other similar way, in accordance with the rules of applicable law. Clicking on that icon indicates your clear and irrevocable acceptance of this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.\nSimilarly, you irrevocably accept this Licence and all of its terms and conditions by exercising any rights granted to You by Article 2 of this Licence, such as the use of the Work, the creation by You of a Derivative Work or the Distribution or Communication by You of the Work or copies thereof.\n\n11.

Termination of the Licence\n\nThe Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the Licensee of the terms of the Licence.\nSuch a termination will not terminate the licences of any person who has received the Work from the Licensee under the Licence, provided such persons remain in full compliance with the Licence.\n\n13. Miscellaneous\n\nWithout prejudice of Article 9 above, the Licence represents the complete agreement between the Parties as to the Work.\nIf any provision of the Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the Licence as a whole. Such provision will be construed or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.\nThe European Commission may publish other linguistic versions or new versions of this Licence or updated versions of the Appendix, so far this is required and reasonable, without reducing the scope of the rights granted by the Licence. New versions of the Licence will be published with a unique version number.\nAll linguistic versions of this Licence, approved by the European Commission, have identical value. Parties can take advantage of the linguistic version of their choice.\n\n14.

Therefore, we provide these alternative installation methods which allow code review before installation:\n\n### Method 1: Clone our repository and run\n\n```bash\ngit clone --depth 1 https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole.git Pi-hole\ncd \"Pi-hole/automated install/\"\nsudo bash basic-install.sh\n```\n\n### Method 2: Manually download the installer and run\n\n```bash\nwget -O basic-install.sh https://install.pi-hole.net\nsudo bash basic-install.sh\n```\n\n### Method 3: Using Docker to deploy Pi-hole\n\nPlease refer to the [Pi-hole docker repo](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole) to use the Official Docker Images.\n\n## [Post-install: Make your network take advantage of Pi-hole](https://docs.pi-hole.net/main/post-install/)\n\nOnce the installer has been run, you will need to [configure your router to have **DHCP clients use Pi-hole as their DNS server**](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-configure-my-devices-to-use-pi-hole-as-their-dns-server/245). This router configuration will ensure that all devices connecting to your network will have content blocked without any further intervention.\n\nIf your router does not support setting the DNS server, you can [use Pi-hole's built-in DHCP server](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-use-pi-holes-built-in-dhcp-server-and-why-would-i-want-to/3026); be sure to disable DHCP on your router first (if it has that feature available).\n\nAs a last resort, you can manually set each device to use Pi-hole as their DNS server.\n\n-----\n\n## Pi-hole is free but powered by your support\n\nThere are many reoccurring costs involved with maintaining free, open-source, and privacy-respecting software; expenses which [our volunteer developers](https://github.com/orgs/pi-hole/people) pitch in to cover out-of-pocket. This is just one example of how strongly we feel about our software and the importance of keeping it maintained.\n\nMake no mistake: **your support is absolutely vital to help keep us innovating!**\n\n### [Donations](https://pi-hole.net/donate)\n\nDonating using our Sponsor Button is **extremely helpful** in offsetting a portion of our monthly expenses:\n\n### Alternative support\n\nIf you'd rather not donate (_which is okay!_), there are other ways you can help support us:\n\n- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/pi-hole/)\n- [Patreon](https://patreon.com/pihole)\n- [Hetzner Cloud](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=7aceisRX3AzA) _affiliate link_\n- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=344d234950e1) _affiliate link_\n- [Stickermule](https://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=9127301701&utm_medium=link&utm_source=invite) _earn a $10 credit after your first purchase_\n- [Amazon US](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect-home/pihole09-20) _affiliate link_\n- Spreading the word about our software and how you have benefited from it\n\n### Contributing via GitHub\n\nWe welcome _everyone_ to contribute to issue reports, suggest new features, and create pull requests.\n\nIf you have something to add - anything from a typo through to a whole new feature, we're happy to check it out! Just make sure to fill out our template when submitting your request; the questions it asks will help the volunteers quickly understand what you're aiming to achieve.\n\nYou'll find that the [install script](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/automated%20install/basic-install.sh) and the [debug script](https://github.com/pi-hole/pi-hole/blob/master/advanced/Scripts/piholeDebug.sh) have an abundance of comments, which will help you better understand how Pi-hole works. They're also a valuable resource to those who want to learn how to write scripts or code a program! We encourage anyone who likes to tinker to read through it and submit a pull request for us to review.\n\n-----\n\n## Getting in touch with us\n\nWhile we are primarily reachable on our [Discourse User Forum](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/), we can also be found on various social media outlets.\n\n**Please be sure to check the FAQs** before starting a new discussion, as we do not have the spare time to reply to every request for assistance.\n\n- [Frequently Asked Questions](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/c/faqs)\n- [Feature Requests](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/c/feature-requests?order=votes)\n- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/pihole/)\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/The_Pi_hole)\n\n-----\n\n## Breakdown of Features\n\n### [Faster-than-light Engine](https://github.com/pi-hole/ftl)\n\n[FTLDNS](https://github.com/pi-hole/ftl) is a lightweight, purpose-built daemon used to provide statistics needed for the Web Interface, and its API can be easily integrated into your own projects. As the name implies, FTLDNS does this all _very quickly_!\n\nSome of the statistics you can integrate include:\n\n- Total number of domains being blocked\n- Total number of DNS queries today\n- Total number of ads blocked today\n- Percentage of ads blocked\n- Unique domains\n- Queries forwarded (to your chosen upstream DNS server)\n- Queries cached\n- Unique clients\n\nAccess the API via [`telnet`](https://github.com/pi-hole/FTL), the Web (`admin/api.php`) and Command Line (`pihole -c -j`). You can find out [more details over here](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/pi-hole-api/1863).\n\n### The Command-Line Interface\n\nThe [pihole](https://docs.pi-hole.net/core/pihole-command/) command has all the functionality necessary to fully administer the Pi-hole, without the need for the Web Interface. It's fast, user-friendly, and auditable by anyone with an understanding of `bash`.\n\nSome notable features include:\n\n- [Whitelisting, Blacklisting, and Regex](https://docs.pi-hole.net/core/pihole-command/#whitelisting-blacklisting-and-regex)\n- [Debugging utility](https://docs.pi-hole.net/core/pihole-command/#debugger)\n- [Viewing the live log file](https://docs.pi-hole.net/core/pihole-command/#tail)\n- [Updating Ad Lists](https://docs.pi-hole.net/core/pihole-command/#gravity)\n- [Querying Ad Lists for blocked domains](https://docs.pi-hole.net/core/pihole-command/#query)\n- [Enabling and Disabling Pi-hole](https://docs.pi-hole.net/core/pihole-command/#enable-disable)\n- ... and _many_ more!\n\nYou can read our [Core Feature Breakdown](https://docs.pi-hole.net/core/pihole-command/#pi-hole-core) for more information.\n\n### The Web Interface Dashboard\n\nThis [optional dashboard](https://github.com/pi-hole/web) allows you to view stats, change settings, and configure your Pi-hole. It's the power of the Command Line Interface, with none of the learning curve!\n\nSome notable features include:\n\n- Mobile-friendly interface\n- Password protection\n- Detailed graphs and doughnut charts\n- Top lists of domains and clients\n- A filterable and sortable query log\n- Long Term Statistics to view data over user-defined time ranges\n- The ability to easily manage and configure Pi-hole features\n- ... and all the main features of the Command Line Interface!\n\nThere are several ways to [access the dashboard](https://discourse.pi-hole.net/t/how-do-i-access-pi-holes-dashboard-admin-interface/3168):\n\n1. `http://pi.hole/admin/` (when using Pi-hole as your DNS server)\n2. `http://<IP_ADDRESS_OF_YOUR_PI_HOLE>/admin/`\n"
