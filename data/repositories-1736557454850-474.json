          "content": "# Citizen Code of Conduct\n\n## 1. Purpose\n\nA primary goal of Coolify is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\n\nWe invite all those who participate in Coolify to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.\n\n## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship\n\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open [source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\n\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\n\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n\n## 3. Expected Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\n * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n * Attempt collaboration before conflict.\n * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n## 4. Unacceptable Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:\n\n * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.\n * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\n * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\n * Inappropriate photography or recording.\n * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.\n * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\n * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\n * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n## 5. Weapons Policy\n\nNo weapons will be allowed at Coolify events, community spaces, or in other spaces covered by the scope of this Code of Conduct. Weapons include but are not limited to guns, explosives (including fireworks), and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Community members are further expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.\n\n## 6. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n\n## 7. Reporting Guidelines\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. hi@coollabs.io.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n\n## 8. Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify coollabsio with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies. \n\n\n\n## 9. Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues--online and in-person--as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\n\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n\n## 10.

Install Spin:\n   - Follow the instructions to install Spin on Windows from the [Spin documentation](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs/installation/install-windows#download-and-install-spin-into-wsl2?ref=coolify)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>MacOS</strong></summary>\n\n1. Install Orbstack, Docker Desktop (or similar):\n   - Orbstack (recommended, as it is a faster and lighter alternative to Docker Desktop):\n     - Download and install [Orbstack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/quick-start#installation?ref=coolify)\n   - Docker Desktop:\n     - Download and install [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/?ref=coolify)\n\n2. Install Spin:\n   - Follow the instructions to install Spin on MacOS from the [Spin documentation](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs/installation/install-macos/#download-and-install-spin?ref=coolify)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><strong>Linux</strong></summary>\n\n1. Install Docker Engine, Docker Desktop (or similar):\n   - Docker Engine (recommended, as there is no VM overhead):\n     - Follow the official [Docker Engine installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/?ref=coolify) for your Linux distribution\n   - Docker Desktop:\n     - If you want a GUI, you can use [Docker Desktop for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/?ref=coolify)\n\n2. Install Spin:\n   - Follow the instructions to install Spin on Linux from the [Spin documentation](https://serversideup.net/open-source/spin/docs/installation/install-linux#configure-docker-permissions?ref=coolify)\n\n</details>\n\n## 2. Verify Installation (Optional)\n\nAfter installing Docker (or Orbstack) and Spin, verify the installation:\n\n1. Open a terminal or command prompt\n2. Run the following commands:\n   ```bash\n   docker --version\n   spin --version\n   ```\n   You should see version information for both Docker and Spin.\n\n## 3. Fork and Setup Local Repository\n\n1. Fork the [Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) repository to your GitHub account.\n\n2. Install a code editor on your machine (choose one):\n\n   | Editor | Platform | Download Link |\n   |--------|----------|---------------|\n   | Visual Studio Code (recommended free) | Windows/macOS/Linux | [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download?ref=coolify) |\n   | Cursor (recommended but paid) | Windows/macOS/Linux | [Download](https://www.cursor.com/?ref=coolify) |\n   | Zed (very fast) | macOS/Linux | [Download](https://zed.dev/download?ref=coolify) |\n\n3. Clone the Coolify Repository from your fork to your local machine\n   - Use `git clone` in the command line, or\n   - Use GitHub Desktop (recommended):\n     - Download and install from [https://desktop.github.com/](https://desktop.github.com/?ref=coolify)\n     - Open GitHub Desktop and login with your GitHub account\n     - Click on `File` -> `Clone Repository` select `github.com` as the repository location, then select your forked Coolify repository, choose the local path and then click `Clone`\n\n4. Open the cloned Coolify Repository in your chosen code editor.\n\n## 4. Set up Environment Variables\n\n1. In the Code Editor, locate the `.env.development.example` file in the root directory of your local Coolify repository.\n2. Duplicate the `.env.development.example` file and rename the copy to `.env`.\n3. Open the new `.env` file and review its contents. Adjust any environment variables as needed for your development setup.\n4. If you encounter errors during database migrations, update the database connection settings in your `.env` file. Use the IP address or hostname of your PostgreSQL database container. You can find this information by running `docker ps` after executing `spin up`.\n5. Save the changes to your `.env` file.\n\n## 5. Start Coolify\n\n1. Open a terminal in the local Coolify directory.\n2. Run the following command in the terminal (leave that terminal open):\n   ```bash\n   spin up\n   ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> You may see some errors, but don't worry; this is expected.\n\n3. If you encounter permission errors, especially on macOS, use:\n   ```bash\n   sudo spin up\n   ```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you change environment variables afterwards or anything seems broken, press Ctrl + C to stop the process and run `spin up` again.\n\n## 6. Start Development\n\n1. Access your Coolify instance:\n   - URL: `http://localhost:8000`\n   - Login: `test@example.com`\n   - Password: `password`\n\n2. Additional development tools:\n   | Tool | URL | Note |\n   |------|-----|------|\n   | Laravel Horizon (scheduler) | `http://localhost:8000/horizon` | Only accessible when logged in as root user |\n   | Mailpit (email catcher) | `http://localhost:8025` | |\n   | Telescope (debugging tool) | `http://localhost:8000/telescope` | Disabled by default |\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> To enable Telescope, add the following to your `.env` file:\n> ```env\n> TELESCOPE_ENABLED=true\n> ```\n\n## 7. Create a Pull Request\n\n1. After making changes or adding a new service:\n   - Commit your changes to your forked repository.\n   - Push the changes to your GitHub account.\n\n2. Creating the Pull Request (PR):\n   - Navigate to the main Coolify repository on GitHub.\n   - Click the \"Pull requests\" tab.\n   - Click the green \"New pull request\" button.\n   - Choose your fork and branch as the compare branch.\n   - Click \"Create pull request\".\n\n3. Filling out the PR details:\n   - Give your PR a descriptive title.\n   - Use the Pull Request Template provided and fill in the details.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Always set the base branch for your PR to the `next` branch of the Coolify repository, not the `main` branch.\n\n4. Submit your PR:\n   - Review your changes one last time.\n   - Click \"Create pull request\" to submit.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Make sure your PR is out of draft mode as soon as it's ready for review. PRs that are in draft mode for a long time may be closed by maintainers.\n\nAfter submission, maintainers will review your PR and may request changes or provide feedback.\n\n## Development Notes\n\nWhen working on Coolify, keep the following in mind:\n\n1. **Database Migrations**: After switching branches or making changes to the database structure, always run migrations:\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it coolify php artisan migrate\n   ```\n\n2. **Resetting Development Setup**: To reset your development setup to a clean database with default values:\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it coolify php artisan migrate:fresh --seed\n   ```\n\n3. **Troubleshooting**: If you encounter unexpected behavior, ensure your database is up-to-date with the latest migrations and if possible reset the development setup to eliminate any environment-specific issues.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Forgetting to migrate the database can cause problems, so make it a habit to run migrations after pulling changes or switching branches.\n\n## Resetting Development Environment\n\nIf you encounter issues or break your database or something else, follow these steps to start from a clean slate (works since `v4.0.0-beta.342`):\n\n1. Stop all running containers `ctrl + c`.\n\n2. Remove all Coolify containers:\n   ```bash\n   docker rm coolify coolify-db coolify-redis coolify-realtime coolify-testing-host coolify-minio coolify-vite-1 coolify-mail\n   ```\n\n3. Remove Coolify volumes (it is possible that the volumes have no `coolify` prefix on your machine, in that case remove the prefix from the command):\n   ```bash\n   docker volume rm coolify_dev_backups_data coolify_dev_postgres_data coolify_dev_redis_data coolify_dev_coolify_data coolify_dev_minio_data\n   ```\n\n4. Remove unused images:\n   ```bash\n   docker image prune -a\n   ```\n\n5. Start Coolify again:\n   ```bash\n   spin up\n   ```\n\n6. Run database migrations and seeders:\n   ```bash\n   docker exec -it coolify php artisan migrate:fresh --seed\n   ```\n\nAfter completing these steps, you'll have a fresh development setup.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Always run database migrations and seeders after switching branches or pulling updates to ensure your local database structure matches the current codebase and includes necessary seed data.\n\n## Additional Contribution Guidelines\n\n### Contributing a New Service\n\nTo add a new service to Coolify, please refer to our documentation:\n[Adding a New Service](https://coolify.io/docs/knowledge-base/contribute/service)\n\n### Contributing to Documentation\n\nTo contribute to the Coolify documentation, please refer to this guide:\n[Contributing to the Coolify Documentation](https://github.com/coollabsio/documentation-coolify/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n"

You can manage VPS, Bare Metal, Raspberry PIs, and anything else.\n\nImagine having the ease of a cloud but with your own servers. That is **Coolify**.\n\nNo vendor lock-in, which means that all the configurations for your applications/databases/etc are saved to your server. So, if you decide to stop using Coolify (oh nooo), you could still manage your running resources. You lose the automations and all the magic. 🪄️\n\nFor more information, take a look at our landing page at [coolify.io](https://coolify.io).\n\n# Installation\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash\n```\nYou can find the installation script source [here](./scripts/install.sh).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> Please refer to the [docs](https://coolify.io/docs/installation) for more information about the installation.\n\n# Support\n\nContact us at [coolify.io/docs/contact](https://coolify.io/docs/contact).\n\n# Donations\nTo stay completely free and open-source, with no feature behind the paywall and evolve the project, we need your help.

way to use Coolify is to have one server for Coolify and one (or more) for the resources you are deploying. A server is around 4-5$/month.\n\nBy subscribing to the cloud version, you get the Coolify server for the same price, but with:\n- High-availability\n- Free email notifications\n- Better support\n- Less maintenance for you\n\n# Recognitions\n\n<p>\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26624341\">\n  <img\n    style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\"\n    alt=\"Featured on Hacker News\"\n    src=\"https://hackernews-badge.vercel.app/api?id=26624341\"\n  />\n</a>\n</p>\n\n<a href=\"https://www.producthunt.com/posts/coolify?ref=badge-featured&utm_medium=badge&utm_souce=badge-coolify\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://api.producthunt.com/widgets/embed-image/v1/featured.svg?post_id=338273&theme=light\" alt=\"Coolify - An&#0032;open&#0045;source&#0032;&#0038;&#0032;self&#0045;hostable&#0032;Heroku&#0044;&#0032;Netlify&#0032;alternative | Product Hunt\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 54px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"54\" /></a>\n\n<a href=\"https://trendshift.io/repositories/634\" target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"https://trendshift.io/api/badge/repositories/634\" alt=\"coollabsio%2Fcoolify | Trendshift\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 55px;\" width=\"250\" height=\"55\"/></a>\n\n# Core Maintainers\n\n| Andras Bacsai | 🏔️ Peak |\n|------------|------------|\n| <img src=\"https://github.com/andrasbacsai.png\" width=\"200px\" alt=\"Andras Bacsai\" /> | <img src=\"https://github.com/peaklabs-dev.png\" width=\"200px\" alt=\"peaklabs-dev\" /> |\n| <a href=\"https://github.com/andrasbacsai\"><img src=\"https://api.iconify.design/devicon:github.svg\" width=\"25px\"></a> <a href=\"https://x.com/heyandras\"><img src=\"https://api.iconify.design/devicon:twitter.svg\" width=\"25px\"></a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/heyandras.dev\"><img src=\"https://api.iconify.design/simple-icons:bluesky.svg\" width=\"25px\"></a> | <a href=\"https://github.com/peaklabs-dev\"><img src=\"https://api.iconify.design/devicon:github.svg\" width=\"25px\"></a> <a href=\"https://x.com/peaklabs_dev\"><img src=\"https://api.iconify.design/devicon:twitter.svg\" width=\"25px\"></a> <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/peaklabs.dev\"><img src=\"https://api.iconify.design/simple-icons:bluesky.svg\" width=\"25px\"></a> |\n\n# Repo Activity\n\n![Alt](https://repobeats.axiom.co/api/embed/eab1c8066f9c59d0ad37b76c23ebb5ccac4278ae.svg \"Repobeats analytics image\")\n\n# Star History\n\n[![Star History Chart](https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=coollabsio/coolify&type=Date)](https://star-history.com/#coollabsio/coolify&Date)\n"

          "content": "# Coolify Release Guide\n\nThis guide outlines the release process for Coolify, intended for developers and those interested in understanding how Coolify releases are managed and deployed.\n\n## Table of Contents\n- [Release Process](#release-process)\n- [Version Types](#version-types)\n  - [Stable](#stable)\n  - [Nightly](#nightly)\n  - [Beta](#beta)\n- [Version Availability](#version-availability)\n  - [Self-Hosted](#self-hosted)\n  - [Cloud](#cloud)\n- [Manually Update to Specific Versions](#manually-update-to-specific-versions)\n\n## Release Process\n\n1. **Development on `next` or Feature Branches**\n   - Improvements, fixes, and new features are developed on the `next` branch or separate feature branches.\n\n2. **Merging to `main`**\n   - Once ready, changes are merged from the `next` branch into the `main` branch (via a pull request).\n\n3. **Building the Release**\n   - After merging to `main`, GitHub Actions automatically builds release images for all architectures and pushes them to the GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub with the specific version tag and the `latest` tag.\n\n4. **Creating a GitHub Release**\n   - A new GitHub release is manually created with details of the changes made in the version.\n\n5. **Updating the CDN**\n   - To make a new version publicly available, the version information on the CDN needs to be updated manually. After that the new version number will be available at [https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/versions.json](https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/versions.json).\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The CDN update may not occur immediately after the GitHub release. It can take hours or even days due to additional testing, stability checks, or potential hotfixes. **The update becomes available only after the CDN is updated. After the CDN is updated, a discord announcement will be made in the Production Release channel.**\n\n## Version Types\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Stable (coming soon)</strong></summary>\n\n- **Stable**\n  - The production version suitable for stable, production environments (recommended).\n  - **Update Frequency:** Every 2 to 4 weeks, with more frequent possible fixes.\n  - **Release Size:** Larger but less frequent releases. Multiple nightly versions are consolidated into a single stable release.\n  - **Versioning Scheme:** Follows semantic versioning (e.g., `v4.0.0`, `4.1.0`, etc.).\n  - **Installation Command:**\n    ```bash\n    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Nightly</strong></summary>\n\n- **Nightly**\n  - The latest development version, suitable for testing the latest changes and experimenting with new features.\n  - **Update Frequency:** Daily or bi-weekly updates.\n  - **Release Size:** Smaller, more frequent releases.\n  - **Versioning Scheme:** Follows semantic versioning (e.g., `4.1.0-nightly.1`, `4.1.0-nightly.2`, etc.).\n  - **Installation Command:**\n    ```bash\n    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify-nightly/install.sh | bash -s next\n    ```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n  <summary><strong>Beta</strong></summary>\n\n- **Beta**\n  - Test releases for the upcoming stable version.\n  - **Purpose:** Allows users to test and provide feedback on new features and changes before they become stable.\n  - **Update Frequency:** Available if we think beta testing is necessary.\n  - **Release Size:** Same size as stable release as it will become the next stabe release after some time.\n  - **Versioning Scheme:** Follows semantic versioning (e.g., `4.1.0-beta.1`, `4.1.0-beta.2`, etc.).\n  - **Installation Command:**\n  ```bash\n    curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash\n  ```\n\n</details>\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Do not use nightly/beta builds in production as there is no guarantee of stability.\n\n## Version Availability\n\nWhen a new version is released and a new GitHub release is created, it doesn't immediately become available for your instance. Here's how version availability works for different instance types.\n\n### Self-Hosted\n\n- **Update Frequency:** More frequent updates, especially on the nightly release channel.\n- **Update Availability:** New versions are available once the CDN has been updated.\n- **Update Methods:**\n  1. **Manual Update in Instance Settings:**\n     - Go to `Settings > Update Check Frequency` and click the `Check Manually` button.\n     - If an update is available, an upgrade button will appear on the sidebar.\n  2. **Automatic Update:**\n     - If enabled, the instance will update automatically at the time set in the settings.\n  3. **Re-run Installation Script:**\n     - Run the installation script again to upgrade to the latest version available on the CDN:\n     ```bash\n     curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash\n     ```\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> If a new release is available on GitHub but your instance hasn't updated yet or no upgrade button is shown in the UI, the CDN might not have been updated yet. This intentional delay ensures stability and allows for hotfixes before official release.\n\n### Cloud\n\n- **Update Frequency:** Less frequent as it's a managed service.\n- **Update Availability:** New versions are available once Andras has updated the cloud version manually.\n- **Update Method:**\n  - Updates are managed by Andras, who ensures each cloud version is thoroughly tested and stable before releasing it.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> The cloud version of Coolify may be several versions behind the latest GitHub releases even if the CDN is updated. This is intentional to ensure stability and reliability for cloud users and Andras will manully update the cloud version when the update is ready.\n\n## Manually Update/ Downgrade to Specific Versions\n\n> [!CAUTION]  \n> Updating to unreleased versions is not recommended and can cause issues.\n\n> [!IMPORTANT]\n> Downgrading is supported but not recommended and can cause issues because of database migrations and other changes.\n\nTo update your Coolify instance to a specific version, use the following command:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash -s <version>\n```\nReplace `<version>` with the version you want to update to (for example `4.0.0-beta.332`).\n"
