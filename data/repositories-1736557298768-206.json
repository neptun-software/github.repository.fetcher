          "content": "# **Model Details**\n\nMeta developed and released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\n\n**Model Developers** Meta\n\n**Variations** Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\n\n**Input** Models input text only.\n\n**Output** Models generate text only.\n\n**Model Architecture** Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\n\n||Training Data|Params|Context Length|GQA|Tokens|LR|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\nLlama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|7B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>\nLlama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|13B|4k|&#10007;|2.0T|3.0 x 10<sup>-4</sup>\nLlama 2|*A new mix of publicly available online data*|70B|4k|&#10004;|2.0T|1.5 x 10<sup>-4</sup>\n\n**Llama 2 family of models.** Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. The 70B version uses Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\n\n**Model Dates** Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\n\n**Status** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\n\n**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)\n\n**Research Paper** More information can be found in the paper \"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\", available at https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/.\n\n**Where to send questions or comments about the model** Instructions on how to provide feedback or comments on the model can be found in the model [README](README.md).\n\n# **Intended Use**\n**Intended Use Cases** Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\n\n**Out-of-scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 2 Community License. Use in languages other than English**. \n\n**Note: Developers may fine-tune Llama 2 models for languages beyond English provided they comply with the Llama 2 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.\n\n# **Hardware and Software**\n**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\n\n**Carbon Footprint** Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\n\n||Time (GPU hours)|Power Consumption (W)|Carbon Emitted(tCO<sub>2</sub>eq)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 2 7B|184320|400|31.22|\n|Llama 2 13B|368640|400|62.44|\n|Llama 2 70B|1720320|400|291.42|\n|Total|3311616||539.00|\n\n**CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during pretraining.** Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\n\n# **Training Data**\n**Overview** Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\n\n**Data Freshness** The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\n\n# **Evaluation Results**\n\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.\nFor all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.\n\n|Model|Size|Code|Commonsense Reasoning|World Knowledge|Reading Comprehension|Math|MMLU|BBH|AGI Eval|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 1|7B|14.1|60.8|46.2|58.5|6.95|35.1|30.3|23.9|\n|Llama 1|13B|18.9|66.1|52.6|62.3|10.9|46.9|37.0|33.9|\n|Llama 1|33B|26.0|70.0|58.4|67.6|21.4|57.8|39.8|41.7|\n|Llama 1|65B|30.7|70.7|60.5|68.6|30.8|63.4|43.5|47.6|\n|Llama 2|7B|16.8|63.9|48.9|61.3|14.6|45.3|32.6|29.3|\n|Llama 2|13B|24.5|66.9|55.4|65.8|28.7|54.8|39.4|39.1|\n|Llama 2|70B|**37.5**|**71.9**|**63.6**|**69.4**|**35.2**|**68.9**|**51.2**|**54.2**|\n\n**Overall performance on grouped academic benchmarks.** *Code:* We report the average pass@1 scores of our models on HumanEval and MBPP. *Commonsense Reasoning:* We report the average of PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA, and CommonsenseQA.

Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\n\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at [https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/)\n"

After doing so, you should get access to all the Llama models of a version (Code Llama, Llama 2, or Llama Guard) within 1 hour.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nYou can follow the steps below to quickly get up and running with Llama 2 models. These steps will let you run quick inference locally. For more examples, see the [Llama 2 recipes repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes). \n\n1. In a conda env with PyTorch / CUDA available clone and download this repository.\n\n2. In the top-level directory run:\n    ```bash\n    pip install -e .\n    ```\n3. Visit the [Meta website](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) and register to download the model/s.\n\n4. Once registered, you will get an email with a URL to download the models. You will need this URL when you run the download.sh script.\n\n5. Once you get the email, navigate to your downloaded llama repository and run the download.sh script. \n    - Make sure to grant execution permissions to the download.sh script\n    - During this process, you will be prompted to enter the URL from the email. \n    - Do not use the “Copy Link” option but rather make sure to manually copy the link from the email.\n\n6. Once the model/s you want have been downloaded, you can run the model locally using the command below:\n```bash\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_chat_completion.py \\\n    --ckpt_dir llama-2-7b-chat/ \\\n    --tokenizer_path tokenizer.model \\\n    --max_seq_len 512 --max_batch_size 6\n```\n**Note**\n- Replace  `llama-2-7b-chat/` with the path to your checkpoint directory and `tokenizer.model` with the path to your tokenizer model.\n- The `–nproc_per_node` should be set to the [MP](#inference) value for the model you are using.\n- Adjust the `max_seq_len` and `max_batch_size` parameters as needed.\n- This example runs the [example_chat_completion.py](example_chat_completion.py) found in this repository but you can change that to a different .py file.\n\n## Inference\n\nDifferent models require different model-parallel (MP) values:\n\n|  Model | MP |\n|--------|----|\n| 7B     | 1  |\n| 13B    | 2  |\n| 70B    | 8  |\n\nAll models support sequence length up to 4096 tokens, but we pre-allocate the cache according to `max_seq_len` and `max_batch_size` values. So set those according to your hardware.\n\n### Pretrained Models\n\nThese models are not finetuned for chat or Q&A. They should be prompted so that the expected answer is the natural continuation of the prompt.\n\nSee `example_text_completion.py` for some examples. To illustrate, see the command below to run it with the llama-2-7b model (`nproc_per_node` needs to be set to the `MP` value):\n\n```\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_text_completion.py \\\n    --ckpt_dir llama-2-7b/ \\\n    --tokenizer_path tokenizer.model \\\n    --max_seq_len 128 --max_batch_size 4\n```\n\n### Fine-tuned Chat Models\n\nThe fine-tuned models were trained for dialogue applications. To get the expected features and performance for them, a specific formatting defined in [`chat_completion`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/generation.py#L212)\nneeds to be followed, including the `INST` and `<<SYS>>` tags, `BOS` and `EOS` tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling `strip()` on inputs to avoid double-spaces).\n\nYou can also deploy additional classifiers for filtering out inputs and outputs that are deemed unsafe. See the llama-recipes repo for [an example](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes/blob/main/examples/inference.py) of how to add a safety checker to the inputs and outputs of your inference code.\n\nExamples using llama-2-7b-chat:\n\n```\ntorchrun --nproc_per_node 1 example_chat_completion.py \\\n    --ckpt_dir llama-2-7b-chat/ \\\n    --tokenizer_path tokenizer.model \\\n    --max_seq_len 512 --max_batch_size 6\n```\n\nLlama 2 is a new technology that carries potential risks with use. Testing conducted to date has not — and could not — cover all scenarios.\nIn order to help developers address these risks, we have created the [Responsible Use Guide](Responsible-Use-Guide.pdf). More details can be found in our research paper as well.\n\n## Issues\n\nPlease report any software “bug”, or other problems with the models through one of the following means:\n- Reporting issues with the model: [github.com/facebookresearch/llama](http://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)\n- Reporting risky content generated by the model: [developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback](http://developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback)\n- Reporting bugs and security concerns: [facebook.com/whitehat/info](http://facebook.com/whitehat/info)\n\n## Model Card\nSee [MODEL_CARD.md](MODEL_CARD.md).\n\n## License\n\nOur model and weights are licensed for both researchers and commercial entities, upholding the principles of openness.

False refusals occur when the model incorrectly refuses to answer a question that it should, for example due to overly broad instructions to be cautious in how it provides responses. \n\n### Updated approach\nBased on evaluation and analysis, we recommend the removal of the system prompt as the default setting.  Pull request [#626](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/pull/626) removes the system prompt as the default option, but still provides an example to help enable experimentation for those using it. \n\n## Token Sanitization Update\n\n### Observed Issue\nThe PyTorch scripts currently provided for tokenization and model inference allow for direct prompt injection via string concatenation. Prompt injections allow for the addition of special system and instruction prompt strings from user-provided prompts. \n\nAs noted in the documentation, these strings are required to use the fine-tuned chat models. However, prompt injections have also been used for manipulating or abusing models by bypassing their safeguards, allowing for the creation of content or behaviors otherwise outside the bounds of acceptable use. \n\n### Updated approach\nWe recommend sanitizing [these strings](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama#fine-tuned-chat-models) from any user provided prompts. Sanitization of user prompts mitigates malicious or accidental abuse of these strings. The provided scripts have been updated to do this. \n\nNote: even with this update safety classifiers should still be applied to catch unsafe behaviors or content produced by the model. An [example](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama-recipes/blob/main/inference/inference.py) of how to deploy such a classifier can be found in the llama-recipes repository.\n"
