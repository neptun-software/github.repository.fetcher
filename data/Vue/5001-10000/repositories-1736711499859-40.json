          "content": "# Contributing Guide\n\nHi! We are excited that you are interested in contributing to Elk. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guide.\n\nRefer also to https://github.com/antfu/contribute.\n\nFor guidelines on contributing to the documentation, refer to the [docs README](./docs/README.md).\n\n### Online\n\nYou can use [StackBlitz Codeflow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow) to fix bugs or implement features. You'll also see a Codeflow button on PRs to review them without a local setup. Once the elk repo has been cloned in Codeflow, the dev server will start automatically and print the URL to open the App. You should receive a prompt in the bottom-right suggesting to open it in the Editor or in another Tab. To learn more, check out the [Codeflow docs](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/what-is-codeflow).\n\n[![Open in Codeflow](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_codeflow.svg)](https://pr.new/elk-zone/elk)\n\n### Local Setup\n\nTo develop and test the Elk package:\n\n1. Fork the Elk repository to your own GitHub account and then clone it to your local device.\n\n2. Ensure using the latest Node.js (20.x).\nIf you have [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), you can run `nvm i` to install the required version.\n\n3. The package manager used to install and link dependencies must be [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) v9. To use it you must first enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) by running `corepack enable`. (Note: on Linux in a standard Node 20+ environment, you should follow the instructions to install via Node's `corepack` rather than using the `curl` command)\n\n4. Check out a branch where you can work and commit your changes:\n```shell\ngit checkout -b my-new-branch\n```\n\n1. Run `pnpm i` in Elk's root folder\n\n2. Run `pnpm nuxi prepare` in Elk's root folder\n\n3. Run `pnpm dev` in Elk's root folder to start dev server or `pnpm dev:mocked` to start dev server with `@elkdev@universeodon.com` user.\n\nWe recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni#ni), that will use the right package manager in each of your projects. If `ni` is installed, you can instead run:\n\n```\nni\nnr dev\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nElk uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can run the test suite with:\n\n```\nnr test\n```\n\n### Running PWA on dev server\n\nIn order to run Elk with PWA enabled, run `pnpm dev:pwa` in Elk's root folder to start dev server or `pnpm dev:mocked:pwa` to start dev server with `@elkdev@universeodon.com` user.\n\nYou should test the Elk PWA application on private browsing mode on any Chromium-based browser: will not work on Firefox and Safari.\n\nIf not using private browsing mode, you will need to uninstall the PWA application from your browser once you finish testing:\n- Open `Dev Tools` (`Option + ⌘ + J` on macOS, `Shift + CTRL + J` on Windows/Linux)\n- Go to `Application > Storage`, you should check the following checkboxes:\n    - Application: [x] Unregister service worker\n    - Storage: [x] IndexedDB and [x] Local and session storage\n    - Cache: [x] Cache storage and [x] Application cache\n- Click on `Clear site data` button\n- Go to `Application > Service Workers` and check if the current `service worker` is missing or has the state `deleted` or `redundant`\n\n## CI errors\n\nSometimes when you push your changes to create a new pull request (PR), the CI can fail, but we cannot check the logs to see what went wrong.\n\nIf you are getting **Semantic Pull Request** error, please check the [Semantic Pull Request](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) documentation.\n\nYou can run the following commands on your local environment to fix CI errors:\n- `pnpm test:unit` to run unit tests, maybe you also need to update snapshots\n- `pnpm test:typecheck` to run TypeScript checks run on CI\n\n## RTL Support\n\nElk supports `right-to-left` languages, we need to make sure that the UI is working correctly in both directions.\n\nSimple approach used by most websites of relying on direction set in HTML element does not work because direction for various items, such as timeline, does not always match direction set in HTML.\n\nWe've added some `UnoCSS` utilities styles to help you with that:\n- Do not use `left/right` padding and margin: for example `pl-1`. Use `padding-inline-start/end` instead. So `pl-1` should be `ps-1`, `pr-1` should be `pe-1`. The same rules apply to margin.\n- Do not use `rtl-` classes, such as `rtl-left-0`.\n- For icons that should be rotated for RTL, add `class=\"rtl-flip\"`. This can only be used for icons outside of elements with `dir=\"auto\"`, such as timeline, and is the only exception to the rule above. For icons inside the timeline, it might not work as expected.\n- For absolute positioned elements, don't use `left/right`: for example `left-0`. Use `inset-inline-start/end` instead. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `inset-is` for `inset-inline-start` and `inset-ie` for `inset-inline-end`. Example: `left-0` should be replaced with `inset-is-0`.\n- If you need to change the border radius for an entire left or right side, use `border-inline-start/end`. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `rounded-is` for left side, `rounded-ie` for right side. Example: `rounded-l-5` should be replaced with `rounded-ie-5`.\n- If you need to change the border radius for one corner, use `border-start-end-radius` and similar rules. `UnoCSS` shortcuts are `rounded` + top/bottom as either `-bs` (top) or `-be` (bottom) + left/right as either `-is` (left) or `-ie` (right). Example: `rounded-tl-0` should be replaced with `rounded-bs-is-0`.\n\n## Internationalization\n\nWe are using [vue-i18n](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/) via [nuxt-i18n](https://i18n.nuxtjs.org/) to handle internationalization.\n\nYou can check the current [translation status](https://docs.elk.zone/docs/guide/contributing#translation-status): more instructions on the table caption.\n\nIf you are updating a translation in your local environment, you can run the following commands to check the status:\n- from root folder: `nr prepare-translation-status`\n- change to `docs` folder and run docs dev server `nr dev`\n- open `http://localhost:3000/guide/contributing#translation-status` in your browser\n\n### Adding a new language\n\n1. Add a new file in [locales](./locales) folder with the language code as the filename.\n2. Copy [en](./locales/en.json) and translate the strings.\n3. Add the language to the `locales` array in [config/i18n.ts](./config/i18n.ts#L61), below `en` and `ar`:\n   - If your language has multiple country variants, add the generic one for language only (only if there are a lot of common entries, you can always add it as a new one)\n      - Add all country variants in [country variants object](./config/i18n.ts#L12)\n      - Add all country variants files with empty `messages` object: `{}`\n      - Translate the strings in the generic language file\n      - Later, when anyone wants to add the corresponding translations for the country variant, just override any entry in the corresponding file: you can see an example with `en` variants.\n   - If the generic language already exists:\n      - If the translation doesn't differ from the generic language, then add the corresponding translations in the corresponding file\n      - If the translation differs from the generic language, then add the corresponding translations in the corresponding file and remove it from the country variants entry\n4. If the language is `right-to-left`, add `dir` option with `rtl` value, for example, for [ar](./config/i18n.ts#L71)\n5. If the language requires special pluralization rules, add `pluralRule` callback option, for example, for [ar](./config/i18n.ts#L72)\n\nCheck [Pluralization rule callback](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/pluralization.html#custom-pluralization) for more info.\n\n### Messages interpolation\n\nMost of the messages used in Elk do not require any interpolation, however, some messages require interpolation: check [Message Format Syntax](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html) for more info.\n\nWe're using these types of interpolation:\n- [List interpolation](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html#list-interpolation)\n- [Named interpolation](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html#interpolations)\n- [Linked messages](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html#linked-messages)\n- [Literal interpolation](https://vue-i18n.intlify.dev/guide/essentials/syntax.html#literal-interpolation)\n\n#### List interpolation\n\nYou can access the elements of the list using the object notation using the index: for example, `{0}` for the first element, `{1}` for the second, `{2}` for the third and so on.\n\n#### Named interpolation\n\nElk will use named interpolation only to handle plurals for number formatting. We have 2 scenarios for this:\n- using `plural` **with** `i18n-t` component\n- using `plural` **without** `i18n-t` component\n\nCheck [Custom Plural Number Formatting Entries](#custom-plural-number-formatting-entries) for custom plural entries in Elk with available values for interpolation.\n\nWhen using plural number formatting, we'll have always `{n}` available in the message, for example, `You have {n} new notifications|You have {n} new notification|You have {n} new notifications` or `You have no new notifications|You have 1 new notification|You have {n} new notifications`.\n\nWe've included `v` named parameter, it will be used to pass the formatted number using [Intl.NumberFormat::format](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/format): will be the number with separators symbols. The exception to the previous rule is when we're using `plural` **with** `i18n-t` component, in this case, we'll need to use `{0}` instead `{v}` to access the number.\n\nAdditionally, Elk will use [compact notation for numbers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat#parameters) for some entries, check `notation` and `compactDisplay` options: for example, `1K` for `1000`, `1M` for `1000000`, `1B` for `1000000000` and so on. That entry will be available in the message using `{v}` named parameter (or `{0}` if using the message **with** `i18n-t` component).\n\nYou can run this code in your browser console to see how it works:\n```ts\n[1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, 123456, 1234567].forEach((n) => {\n  const acc = {}\n\n  Array.from(['en-US', 'en-GB', 'de-DE', 'zh-CN', 'ja-JP', 'es-ES', 'fr-FR', 'cs-CZ', 'ar-EG']).forEach((l) => {\n    const nf = new Intl.NumberFormat(l, {\n      style: 'decimal',\n      maximumFractionDigits: 0,\n    })\n    const nf2 = new Intl.NumberFormat(l, {\n      notation: 'compact',\n      compactDisplay: 'short',\n      maximumFractionDigits: 1,\n    })\n    acc[l] = {\n      number: n,\n      format: nf.format(n),\n      compact: nf2.format(n),\n    }\n  })\n  console.table(acc)\n})\n```\n\n#### Custom Plural Number Formatting Entries\n\n**Warning**:\nEither **{0}** or **{v}** should be used with the exception being custom plurals entries using the `{n}` placeholder.\n\nThis is the full list of entries that will be available for number formatting in Elk:\n- `action.boost_count` (no need to be included, we should use always `en-US` entry): `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**\n- `action.favourite_count` (no need to be included, we should use always `en-US` entry): `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**\n- `action.reply_count` (no need to be included, we should use always `en-US` entry): `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**\n- `account.followers_count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**\n- `account.following_count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**\n- `account.posts_count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**\n- `compose.drafts`: `{v}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{v} should be used**\n- `notification.followed_you_count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**\n- `status.poll.count`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**\n- `time_ago_options.*`: `{0}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{0} should be used**: since numbers will be always small, we can also use `{n}`\n- `timeline.show_new_items`: `{v}` for formatted number and `{n}` for raw number - **{v} should be used**\n"

We recommend you use it if you would like to help us build it. We appreciate your feedback and contributions. Check out the [Open Issues](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk/issues) and jump in the action. Join the [Elk discord server](https://chat.elk.zone) to chat with us and learn more about the project.\n\n## Deployment\n\n### Official Deployment\n\nThe Elk team maintains a deployment at:\n\n- 🦌 Production: [elk.zone](https://elk.zone)\n- 🐙 Canary: [main.elk.zone](https://main.elk.zone) (deploys on every commit to `main` branch)\n\n### Self-Host Docker Deployment\n\nIn order to host Elk yourself you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a container with elk. Be aware, that Elk only loads properly if the connection is done via SSL/TLS. The Docker container itself does not provide any SSL/TLS handling. You'll have to add this bit yourself.\nOne could put Elk behind popular reverse proxies with SSL Handling like Traefik, NGINX etc.\n\n1. checkout source ```git clone https://github.com/elk-zone/elk.git```\n1. got into new source dir: ```cd elk```\n1. create local storage directory for settings: ```mkdir elk-storage```\n1. adjust permissions of storage dir: ```sudo chown 911:911 ./elk-storage```\n1. start container: ```docker-compose up --build -d```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> The provided Dockerfile creates a container which will eventually run Elk as non-root user and create a persistent named Docker volume upon first start (if that volume does not yet exist). This volume is always created with root permission. Failing to change the permissions of ```/elk/data``` inside this volume to UID:GID 911 (as specified for Elk in the Dockerfile) will prevent Elk from storing it's config for user accounts. You either have to fix the permission in the created named volume, or mount a directory with the correct permission to ```/elk/data``` into the container.\n\n### Ecosystem\n\nThese are known deployments using Elk as an alternative Web client for Mastodon servers or as a base for other projects in the fediverse:\n\n- [elk.fedified.com](https://elk.fedified.com) - Use Elk to log into any compatible instance\n- [elk.me.uk](https://elk.me.uk) - Use Elk to log into any compatible instance, hosted on Google Cloud Run with no Cloudflare proxy\n- [elk.h4.io](https://elk.h4.io) - Use Elk for the `h4.io` Server\n- [elk.universeodon.com](https://elk.universeodon.com) - Use Elk for the Universeodon Server\n- [elk.vmst.io](https://elk.vmst.io) - Use Elk for the `vmst.io` Server\n- [elk.hostux.social](https://elk.hostux.social) - Use Elk for the `hostux.social` Server\n- [elk.cupoftea.social](https://elk.cupoftea.social) - Use Elk for the `cupoftea.social` Server\n- [elk.aus.social](https://elk.aus.social) - Use Elk for the `aus.social` Server\n- [elk.mstdn.ca](https://elk.mstdn.ca) - Use Elk for the `mstdn.ca` Server\n- [elk.mastodonapp.uk](https://elk.mastodonapp.uk) - Use Elk for the `mastodonapp.uk` Server\n- [elk.bolha.us](https://elk.bolha.us) - Use Elk for the `bolha.us` Server\n- [crab.bumscode.com](https://crab.bumscode.com) - Use [crab](https://github.com/maybeanerd/crab) - a soft fork of Elk - for the `bumscode.com` Server\n\n> **Note**: Community deployments are **NOT** maintained by the Elk team.

Before submitting your contribution, please read through the following guide.\n\n### Online\n\nYou can use [StackBlitz Codeflow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow) to fix bugs or implement features. You'll also see a Codeflow button on PRs to review them without a local setup. Once the elk repo has been cloned in Codeflow, the dev server will start automatically and print the URL to open the App. You should receive a prompt in the bottom-right suggesting to open it in the Editor or in another Tab. To learn more, check out the [Codeflow docs](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/what-is-codeflow).\n\n[![Open in Codeflow](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_codeflow.svg)](https://pr.new/elk-zone/elk)\n\n### Local Setup\n\nClone the repository and run on the root folder:\n\n```\npnpm i\npnpm run dev\n```\n\n`Warning`: you will need `corepack` enabled, check out the [Elk Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed guide on how to set up the project locally.\n\nWe recommend installing [ni](https://github.com/antfu/ni#ni), that will use the right package manager in each of your projects. If `ni` is installed, you can instead run:\n\n```\nni\nnr dev\n```\n\n### Testing\n\nElk uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev). You can run the test suite with:\n\n```\nnr test\n```\n\n## 📲 PWA\n\nYou can consult the [PWA documentation](https://docs.elk.zone/pwa) to learn more about the PWA capabilities on Elk, how to install Elk PWA in your desktop or mobile device and some hints about PWA stuff on Elk.\n\n## 🦄 Stack\n\n- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling\n- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) - The Intuitive Web Framework\n- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - The Progressive JavaScript Framework\n- [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/) - Collection of Vue Composition Utilities\n- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - The Vue Store that you will enjoy using\n- [Vue Macros](https://vue-macros.sxzz.moe/) - More macros and syntax sugar for Vue\n- [UnoCSS](https://uno.antfu.me/) - The instant on-demand atomic CSS engine\n- [Iconify](https://github.com/iconify/icon-sets#iconify-icon-sets-in-json-format) - Iconify icon sets in JSON format\n- [Masto.js](https://neet.github.io/masto.js) - Mastodon API client in TypeScript\n- [shiki](https://shiki.style/) - A beautiful yet powerful syntax highlighter\n- [vite-plugin-pwa](https://github.com/vite-pwa/vite-plugin-pwa) - Prompt for update, Web Push Notifications and Web Share Target API\n\n## 👨‍💻 Contributors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/elk-zone/elk/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=elk-zone/elk\" />\n</a>\n\n## 📄 License\n\n[MIT](./LICENSE) &copy; 2022-PRESENT Elk contributors\n"
