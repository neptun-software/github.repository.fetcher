          "content": "# Introduction\n\n### Welcome!\n\nFirst off, thank you for considering contributing to Homer!\n\n### Project philosophy\n\nHomer is meant to be a light and very simple dashboard that keeps all your useful utilities at hands. The few features implemented in Homer focus on\nUX and usability. If you are looking for a full featured dashboard, there is tons of great stuff out there like https://heimdall.site/, https://github.com/rmountjoy92/DashMachine or https://organizr.app/.\n\n- Configuration is stored in a simple config file, avoiding the need for a backend/database while making possible to use versioning or [config template](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_templating.html).\n- Only modern browsers are supported, feel free to use any JS features without any polyfill as soon as the latest version of the major browsers supports them.\n\n\n# Ground Rules\n\n### Code of conduct and guidelines\n\nFirst of all, we expect everyone (contributors and maintainers alike) to respect the [Code of conduct](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). It is not a recommendation, it is mandatory.\n\nFor all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:\n\n* Each pull request should implement ONE feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.\n* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (e.g. `.gitignore`).\n* Do not add unnecessary dependencies.\n* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.\n\n# Getting started\n\n### Discuss about ideas\n\nIf you want to add a feature, it's often best to talk about it before starting to work on it and submitting a pull request. It's not mandatory at all, but\nfeel free to open an issue to present your idea.\n\n### How to submit a contribution\n\nThe general process to submit a contribution is as follow:\n1. Take a look to the [development guideline](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/blob/main/docs/development.md).\n2. Create your own fork of the code\n3. Do the changes in your fork\n4. Make sure to fill the [pull request description](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) properly.\n\n### Happy coding :metal:\n"

See [documentation](docs/configuration.md) for information about the configuration (`assets/config.yml`) options.\n\nIt's meant to be served by an HTTP server, **it will not work if you open the index.html directly over file:// protocol**.\n\n### Using docker\n\nThe configuration directory is bind mounted to make your dashboard easy to maintain.\n\n**Start the container with `docker run`**\n\n```sh\n# Make sure your local config directory exists\ndocker run -d \\\n  --name homer \\\n  -p 8080:8080 \\\n  --mount type=bind,source=\"/path/to/config/dir\",target=/www/assets \\\n  --restart=unless-stopped \\\n  b4bz/homer:latest\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]  \n> The container will run using a user uid and gid 1000 by default, add `--user <your-UID>:<your-GID>` to the docker command to adjust it if necessary. Make sure this match the permissions of your assets directory.\n\n**or `docker-compose`**\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  homer:\n    image: b4bz/homer\n    container_name: homer\n    volumes:\n      - /path/to/config/dir:/www/assets # Make sure your local config directory exists\n    ports:\n      - 8080:8080\n    user: 1000:1000 # default\n    environment:\n      - INIT_ASSETS=1 # default, requires the config directory to be writable for the container user (see user option)\n    restart: unless-stopped\n```\n\n**Environment variables:**\n\n- **`INIT_ASSETS`** (default: `1`)\nInstall example configuration file & assets (favicons, ...) to help you get started.\n\n- **`SUBFOLDER`** (default: `null`)\nIf you would like to host Homer in a subfolder, (ex: *<http://my-domain/homer>*), set this to the subfolder path (ex `/homer`).\n\n- **`PORT`** (default: `8080`)\nIf you would like to change internal port of Homer from default `8080` to your port choice.\n\n- **`IPV6_DISABLE`** (default: 0)\nSet to `1` to disable listening on IPv6.\n\n### Using the release tarball (prebuilt, ready to use)\n\nDownload and extract the latest release (`homer.zip`) from the [release page](https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/releases), rename the `assets/config.yml.dist` file to `assets/config.yml`, and put it behind a web server.\n\n```sh\nwget https://github.com/bastienwirtz/homer/releases/latest/download/homer.zip\nunzip homer.zip -d homer\ncd homer\ncp assets/config.yml.dist assets/config.yml\npnpx http-server # or python -m http.server 8010 or any web server.\n```\n\n### Build manually\n\n```sh\npnpm install\npnpm build\n```\n\nThen your dashboard is ready to use in the `/dist` directory.\n"
