This includes eliminating JSLint warnings.\n\nStyling preferences:\n  * Go code should use tabs for indentation\n  * Javascript (.vue) code should use 2 spaces for indentation\n  * JSLint warnings should not appear when running the frontend\n  * Lines should not have trailing white space\n  * No custom CSS. Rely on [Bulma CSS](https://bulma.io) for spacing, coloring, etc.\n\nGoldfish is becoming more and more stable, and therefore places higher priority on maintainability, expressiveness, and error handling. What this means is that features need a reason for existence beyond simply \"it's a feature\". Features need to be <b>needed</b>. \n\nIf you have any doubts on the necessity of a feature, please open a feature request issue first. Keep in mind many new feature requests are rejected because they fall out of scope or set a new precedent. Your feature could solve the halting problem, but still be rejected because it doesn't belong in the repository. Backend integration tests should be implemented as much as possible.\n"

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4.

Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6.

Conditions\n\nSections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted\nin Section 2.1.\n\n3. Responsibilities\n-------------------\n\n3.1. Distribution of Source Form\n\nAll distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any\nModifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under\nthe terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

On Windows, a restart after installation is needed.\n\n```bash\n# if you wish to launch goldfish in a VM:\ngit clone https://github.com/Caiyeon/goldfish.git\ncd goldfish/vagrant\n\n# this will take awhile\nvagrant up --provision\n\n# go to localhost:8080 on your local machine and login with token 'goldfish'\n\n# changes to frontend .vue files will be hot-reloaded\n# to force a full reload for the frontend, ssh into the machine and run\n#     `sudo systemctl restart goldfish_frontend.service`\n# to recompile and re-run the backend, ssh into the machine and run\n#     `sudo systemctl restart goldfish.service`\n```\n\n\n#### Compiling\nYou'll need Go(v1.9), Nodejs (v8.2.0), Npm (v5)\n\nNote that using different versions (of nodeJS, especially) will cause differences in the final binary.\n\n```bash\n# download the source code\ngo get -d github.com/caiyeon/goldfish\ncd $GOPATH/src/github.com/caiyeon/goldfish\n\n# resetting to a tagged version is recommended\n# no support will be given to arbitrary commits on the master branch\ngit fetch --all --tags --prune\ngit checkout tags/<version> # version could be, for example, v0.8.0\n\n# compile the binary\nsh build.sh\n```\n\n\n\n<!--\n-->\n## Development\nGoldfish is in very active development.\n\nPull requests and feature requests are welcome. Feel free to suggest new workflows by opening issues.\n\n\n<!--\n-->\n## Components\n\nFrontend:\n* VueJS\n* Bulma CSS\n* Vue Admin\n\nBackend:\n* [Vault API](https://godoc.org/github.com/hashicorp/vault/api) wrapper\n\n\n\n<!--\n-->\n## Design\n\nSee: [Architecture](https://github.com/Caiyeon/goldfish/wiki/Architecture)\n\n\n<!--\n-->\n## Sponsored by\n\n![](screenshots/DO_Logo_Horizontal_Blue.png)\n\n\n<!--\n-->\n## Why 'Goldfish'?\n\nThis server should behave as a goldfish, forgetting everything immediately after a request is completed. That, and other inside-joke reasons.\n\nCredits for the goldfish icon goes to [Laurel Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurel-chan-11baa286)\n"
