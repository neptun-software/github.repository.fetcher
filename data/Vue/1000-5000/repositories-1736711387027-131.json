By contrast,\nthe GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the\nGNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to\nany other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you\nthese rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have\ncertain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if\nyou modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same\nfreedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive\nor can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they\nknow their rights.\n\n  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:\n(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License\ngiving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.\n\n  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains\nthat there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and\nauthors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as\nchanged, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to\nauthors of previous versions.\n\n  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run\nmodified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer\ncan do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of\nprotecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic\npattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to\nuse, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we\nhave designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those\nproducts.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we\nstand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions\nof the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.\n\n  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.\nStates should not allow patents to restrict development and use of\nsoftware on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to\navoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could\nmake it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that\npatents cannot be used to render the program non-free.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,\nsection 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the\ncombination as such.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    {one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.}\n    Copyright (C) {year}  {name of author}\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short\nnotice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    {project}  Copyright (C) {year}  {fullname}\n    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands\nmight be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an \"about box\".\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\n  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program\ninto proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you\nmay consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with\nthe library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.  But first, please read\n<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.\n"

About me\n\nI'm a full-time iOS developer, not a front-end developer. Due to take part in Weex development, I get to know the `Vue.js`.\n\n### 2. Why write this project？\n\n1. The motivation to write this project is from an e-pal, he left a message on my blog - was there a better Weex demo?  I recommended [@EVAN YOU](http://evanyou.me/)’s Hacker News. Later he supposed me to make one. I refused but kept it in mind.\n\n2. On May 19 this year, GitHub used Electron rewrite the macOS and Windows client, coupled with the recent year development of cross-platform getting hotter, to some companies, Web and app are all needed, app also need support iOS and Android two platforms, and more they develop Weixin mini programs. Although desktop applications are a few, Electron can develop them all. I'm going to have a try.\n\n3. As a result of the contact to the Vue.js, of course, do not want to stay in the primary, would like to advanced, [@EVAN YOU](http://evanyou.me/) especially given the recommendations, is more practice, more practice. In order to speed up the pace of progress, I own private to find the project for practicing.\n\n4. Why choose Objc China, the reason is typically simple - I am an iOS developer. To iOS developers, Objc is basically well known, [喵神(@onevcat)](https://github.com/onevcat) as the same. I admire him very much [喵神(@onevcat)](https://github.com/onevcat) and decide to write Objc china without hesitation.\n\n5. Because of love ... ...\n\n### 3. Why not use Weex to build this cross-platform project？\n\nWhen I completed the project and tried to convert it directly into Weex, I got a lot of errors and most of them cannot be fixed immediately. I believe that I use the wrong way, not Weex's problem. By the way, Weex has released a new version, and then there is time to put Weex version of the open source again.\n\nWell, into the topic, Let's introduce this project:\n\n## Technology stack & main framework\n\n📦 All technology stack of Vue：vue2 + vuex + vue-router + webpack  \n📌 ES6     \n📡 Network request：axios  \n🎈 Response framework：bootstrap, element-ui  \n✏️ Backend：express  \n📝 Code highlighted：highlight.js  \n🗄 Database：lowdb  \n📖 Markdown Parser：vue-markdown  \n🔖 Form validation：vee-validate  \n🏆 Cross-platform framework：Electron  \n\n## 📱 Supported platforms\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Supported_Platforms_.png'>\n</p>\n\n## 🔨 How to build \n\nAs the Objc china website is directly response html data, to simulate the network request to return data, I build a backend and write API to return data.\n\nI use Express framework to build a server, set up in the `8081` port, and write routing, the request will go to `8080`, open the server will automatically open the background.\n\nMy current development environment is node v6.11.0, npm v3.10.10, Vue.js v2.8.2.\n\n``` bash\n\n# install dependencies \nnpm install\n\n# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080\nnpm run dev\n\n# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080\nnpm run start\n\n# build for production with minification\nnpm run build\n\n# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report\nnpm run build --report\n\n# run unit tests\nnpm run unit\n\n# run e2e tests\nnpm run e2e\n\n# run all tests\nnpm test\n\n# build Mac application\nnpm run build:mac\n\n# build Linxu application\nnpm run build:linux\n\n# build Win application\nnpm run build:win\n\n# build Cordova application\nnpm run build:app\n\n```\n\nHere to talk about Cordova's packaging alone, it is slightly more than the desktop side of the special point.\n\nFirst, make the `src/main.js` file on the three lines on the Cordova note open, Cordova library initialization needs to be included in the generation of Vue instance outside. After opening the comment, proceed to the next step.\n\nI put a `Makefile` in the project, you can do this according to this.\n\n1. First install the cordova command globally\n\n> npm install -g cordova \n\n2. And then enter the following command to generate the app project directory\n\n> cordova create app com.vueobjccn vueobjccn\n\n3. Into the app folder\n\n> cd app\n\n4. Add the corresponding platform\n\n> cordova platform add ios  \n> cordova platform add android\n\n5. Run the project\n\n> cordova run ios  \n> cordova run android\n\nCordova only generated a shell of the app, all the content are still read from the web page. There is a folder called `WWW` in the corresponding application and used to load the page. JavaScript package will generate the `www` folder, just replace the content under this folder.\n\nIn addition, if you develop a large app with Cordova framework and no any optimization, the user experience is really not as fast as the native. If you really want to use front-end technology to develop app, share you two recommendation: The one is trying to do optimization when use Cordova framework. The other is using React Native or Weex to get the experience close to native.\n\n## 🚀 Cross-platform development\n\nPackage this project into desktop application by JavaScript cross-platform development, mainly used the Electron framework. Here you need to install these three dependencies \"electron\", \"electron-builder\" and \"electron-packager\" in devDependencies. Configure other paths in the webpack.\n\nAbout Cordova installation, I make complaints a little network problems in China. If you are not over the wall in China, it is really painful. For example, not over the wall and in a very poor network environment, installation of Cordova globally, lots of error, even for the complete installation of `cnpm` after the addition of the iOS platform will later report a problem of 'co' file can not find, I suspect `cnpm` could not install the command complete. Later, I go back home, over the wall and network environment is very good, All of a sudden the `npm` installation is complete. But there is a small episode: If Cordova iOS 4.4.0 template throw a error, suggest installation of several times, the reason is still for the network over the wall in China, no catch to it.\n\nThere may be encountered the following error:\n\n> \"Error: Cannot find module 'config-chain'\" when running 'ionic start'\n\nThe solution of this error is trying again the original order with the `sudo` command. This error could be solved\n\nThe final package will be done in the dist folder.\n\nNext to show the performance of the cross-platform application on each platform:\n\nFirst show the Web side:\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web 1.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web 2.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web 3.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web 4.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web 5.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web 6.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web 7.png'>\n</p>\n\nAnd then show the effect in the mobile browser:\n\nAndroid platform\n\nNexus 5x Web\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Nexus 5x Web.png'>\n</p>\n\nNexus 6P Web\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Nexus 6P Web.png'>\n</p>\n\niOS platform\n\niPhone 5 Web\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/iPhone 5 Web.png'>\n</p>\n\niPhone 7 Web\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/iPhone 7 Web.png'>\n</p>\n\niPhone 7 Plus Web\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/iPhone 7 Plus Web.png'>\n</p>\n\niPad Web\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/iPad Web.png'>\n</p>\n\nThen look at the performance in Mac side:\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 1.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 2.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 3.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 4.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 5.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 6.png'>\n</p>\n\nFinally look at Cordova's effect:\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPhone/iPhone 1.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPhone/iPhone 2.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPhone/iPhone 3.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPad/iPad 1.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPad/iPad 2.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPad/iPad 3.png'>\n</p>\n\n## 🌈 Function display\n\nBuild a Web page with Vue.js quickly.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web.gif'>\n</p>\n\nVuex management status is very convenient. Login status saved in the state inside, the global object will be obtained it.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-login.gif'>\n</p>\n\nIf there is no login in information and user click the purchase button to buy an e-book, it will jump to the login page. \n\nAnother point is to say that because this is a SPA, so the routing inside are using Router-link to achieve, but did not use `<a>` tag jump, the effect is to jump and do not have to request data, jump quickly. This user experience is really cool.\n\n`<router-link>` is preferred over hard-coded `<a href=\"...\">` for the following reasons:\n\nIt works the same way in both HTML5 history mode and hash mode, so if you ever decide to switch mode, or when the router falls back to hash mode in IE9, nothing needs to be changed.\n\nIn HTML5 history mode, router-link will intercept the click event so that the browser doesn't try to reload the page.\n\nWhen you are using the base option in HTML5 history mode, you don't need to include it in to prop's URLs.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-logout.gif'>\n</p>\n\nSimilarly, once the user logs out, all places showing the user name will become a status to be logged in, the shopping cart on navigationBar also be disappeared. Manage status with Vuex, very exciting.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-email.gif'>\n</p>\n\nThis is the email form validation, not too much technical content.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-buy.gif'>\n</p>\n\nHere is the shopping cart page and use the MVVM page binding ideas. There are four buttons on the page, clicking any one will immediately change the related total price. To iOSer, it's worthy to learn the implemention on the MVVM.\n\nThen this is the iPhone's Safari performance, the speed is well.\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-iPhone.gif'>\n</p>\n\nIn the cross-platform of these applications, the best experience, I think, is the application of Mac. \n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-Mac.gif'>\n</p>\n\nFinally is the mobile phone app build by Cordova framework, I'm a little picky and not satificated with the unoptimized Cordova. See this showcase below:\n\niPhone application\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-iPone app.gif'>\n</p>\n\niPad application\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-iPad app.gif'>\n</p>\n\n## 🤔 Reflection\n\nI strongly recommand you the [element-ui](https://github.com/ElemeFE/element) (Vue.js developers must have heard of this library). It is a really fast way to build projects by using it, an app can be efficient developed. Save time and put more energy on business development.\n\nEveryone says \"Now is in the era of front-end, mobile development and front-end integration is inevitable\". But there are many different aspectes of the development between front-end and iOS, I experience them all and think a lot. Font-end and iOS, they have lots to learn from each other in their own advantages and disadvantages, I intend to write an article series on those aspects - engineering, component, routing, MVVM. (Dig a big hole to jump)\n\n## 📜 Feature\n\nIf I had more free time, I would like to support Weex. Taking Vue.js into a complete Weex application, to become a native app, the performance will not be bad. After then, it can cover the entire platform.\n\n## ❗️ Errata\n\nIf you find a bug, welcome to sumbit your PR.  \nIf you feel confused by something, welcome to submit your Issues.    \nI'm really appreciate it！🙏🙏🙏\n\n## ♥️ Thanks\n\nIf you like this project, welcome Star!\n\n\n[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/halfrost/vue-objccn.svg)](https://starchart.cc/halfrost/vue-objccn)\n\n\n\n## 🌏 LICENSE\n\n![](https://www.gnu.org/graphics/gplv3-127x51.png)\n\nVue-ObjcCN is available under the GPLv3 license.

桌面应用，支持 Mac、Linux、Windows 三个平台\n- [x] ✅ Web 应用，支持 桌面浏览器 和 手机浏览器\n- [x] ✅ 手机 App，目前只支持了 Cordova 框架，支持 iOS、Android、Windows Phone、BlackBerry 四个平台\n- [ ] ❌ 手机原生 App，打算用 Weex 框架，同样一起支持 iOS 和 Android 两个平台\n\n> 注：此项目纯属个人瞎搞，请大家支持 [喵神(@onevcat)](https://github.com/onevcat)，支持 [Objc中国](https://objccn.io/)。\n\n> [英文介绍 English Introduction](./README.md)\n\n可运行且已经完整打包好的软件下载链接在 [这里](https://github.com/halfrost/vue-objccn/releases).\n\n## 前言\n\n### 一. 关于我\n\n我是一名全职的 iOS 开发者，非前端开发者。由于接触了 Weex 开发，从而接触到了 Vue.js。\n\n### 二. 为什么会写这个项目？\n\n1. 最开始有这个想法的时候是来自一个网友，他在我的博客上问我，网上有没有写的比较好的 Weex demo ？我说尤大写的那个 Hacker News 是最好的。后来网友就说，楼主能写一个么？我当时回答暂时不行。其实这事我一直记在心里。\n\n2. 今年 5 月 19 号，GitHub 使用 Electron 重写了 macOS 和 Windows 的客户端，加上近些年跨端开发越来越火，对于一些公司来说，Web 和 app 应该都是需要的，app 还需要 iOS 和 Android 两个平台，再有甚者还要开发小程序，桌面级的应用虽然少，但是用 Electron 一样可以一起开发了。自己也萌生了想要跃跃欲试的念头。\n\n3. 由于接触到了 Vue.js，当然不想停留在初级，想进阶，尤大给出了建议，就是多实践，多练。为了加快进阶的步伐，自己私下就找项目练。\n\n4. 至于为何选择 Objc 中国，理由其实很简单，因为我是 iOS 开发者。在 iOS 开发者中，Objc 基本上人尽皆知（有不知道的？），喵神也基本上人尽皆知，我个人很崇拜喵神，所以就选了 Objc 中国来写。\n\n5. 因为爱 ... ...\n\n### 三. 这次为何跨端开发没有 Weex？\n\n这次在我写完项目以后，发现 Vue 的代码直接转换成 Weex 的项目，是无法实现的，好多报错。而且不是一下子能都修复好。我相信是我使用姿势的问题，不是 Weex 的问题。对了，Weex 又发布新版本了，接下来有时间的话就把 Weex 版的也做一遍开源。\n\n好了，进入正题，说项目：\n\n## 技术栈和主要框架\n\n📦 Vue 全家桶：vue2 + vuex + vue-router + webpack  \n📌 ES6     \n📡 网络请求：axios  \n🎈 页面相应式框架：bootstrap，element-ui  \n✏️ 后台：express  \n📝 代码高亮：highlight.js  \n🗄 数据库：lowdb  \n📖 Markdown解析器：vue-markdown  \n🔖 表单验证：vee-validate  \n🏆 跨平台框架：Electron  \n\n## 📱 支持的平台\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Supported_Platforms_CN_.png'>\n</p>\n\n## 🔨 项目构建\n\n由于喵神的 Objc 网站是直接返回 html，所以想进行模拟网络请求返回数据，就只能自己搭建一个后台，写 API 返回数据了。\n\n我利用 Express 把后台搭建在 8081 端口上，并写好路由，请求会转到 8080，开启服务器的时候也会自动开启后台。\n\n我当前的开发环境是 node v6.11.0 ，npm v3.10.10（npm v5.3.0 也可以，再高一点的版本没有测试过，应该也没多大问题），Vue.js v2.8.2 \n\n``` bash\n\n# install dependencies 安装依赖\nnpm install\n\n# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080\nnpm run dev\n\n# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080\nnpm run start\n\n# build for production with minification 打包\nnpm run build\n\n# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report\nnpm run build --report\n\n# run unit tests\nnpm run unit\n\n# run e2e tests\nnpm run e2e\n\n# run all tests\nnpm test\n\n# 打包 Mac 应用\nnpm run build:mac\n\n# 打包 Linux 应用\nnpm run build:linux\n\n# 打包 Win 应用\nnpm run build:win\n\n# 打包 Cordova 应用\nnpm run build:app\n\n```\n\n这里要单独说一下 Cordova 的打包方式，它比桌面端的稍微特殊一点。\n\n首先把 src/main.js 文件中关于 Coredova 的三行注释打开，Coredova 库的初始化需要包在生成 Vue 实例 的外面。打开注释以后，再执行接下来的步骤。\n\n我在项目中放了一个 Makefile，可以根据这个来做。\n\n1. 首先全局安装 cordova 命令\n> npm install -g cordova \n\n2. 再输入下面的命令，生成 app 项目目录\n> cordova create app com.vueobjccn vueobjccn\n\n3. 进入到 app 文件夹中\n> cd app\n\n4. 添加对应的平台\n> cordova platform add ios  \n> cordova platform add android\n\n5. 运行项目\n> cordova run ios  \n> cordova run android\n\nCordova 只生成了一个壳的 app，里面具体的内容还是读取的网页，在生成的对应的应用里面有一个 www 的文件夹，这个文件夹里面就是要加载页面。JavaScript 打包之后是会生成 www 的文件夹，只要去替换 Cordova 对应平台里面的 www 文件夹里面的内容即可。\n\n额外说几句，在 app 发展到现在这么成熟的时代，如果构建一个大的 app，用 Cordova 框架去做，不用原生，不做任何优化，用户体验确实不如原生的快。我这次就专门打包体验了 Cordova app，没有做任何优化，打包出来就用，如果是挑剔的用户，放在当今各大 app 接近完美的体验度相比来说，确实会感到满足感略低。如果真的要前端开发 app ，给2个建议，如果是用 Cordova 框架，一定要尽量优化优化，不然性能不如原生。如果想有接近原生的体验，那么可以考虑用 React Native 或者 Weex。\n\n## 🚀 跨平台开发\n\nJavaScript 跨平台开发打包成桌面级应用，主要用 Electron 框架。这里需要在 devDependencies 里面安装好 \"electron\"、\"electron-builder\"、\"electron-packager\" 这三个。其他的路径配置在 webpack 里面配置好即可。\n\n关于 Cordova 的安装，确实可以吐槽一点网络的问题。如果你在一个翻墙环境很差的地方，真的很痛苦。比如之前在一个翻墙环境很差的情况下全局安装 Cordova ，各种报错，就算是换了 cnpm 完全安装了以后，添加 iOS 平台以后以后会报一个 co 文件找不到的问题，感觉是 cnpm 没有把命令安装完整。后来我回到家里，翻墙网络很好，npm install 一下子就安装好了。不过有个小插曲：Cordova iOS 4.4.0 template 如果报错，就多安装几次，原因还是翻墙的原因，没有 catch 到。\n\n还有可能会遇到下面这个错误：\n\n> \"Error: Cannot find module 'config-chain'\" when running 'ionic start'\n\n这个错误就用 sudo 命令重新尝试一遍原命令就好了。\n\n最终打包完成会在 dist 的文件夹中。\n\n接下来展示一下这个跨三端的应用在各个平台下的表现：\n\n先展示一下 Web 端\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web 1.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Web

7.png'>\n</p>\n\n再展示一下在手机浏览器上的效果：\n\nAndroid 平台\n\nNexus 5x 的 Web\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Nexus 5x Web.png'>\n</p>\n\nNexus 6P 的 Web\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/Nexus 6P Web.png'>\n</p>\n\niOS 平台\n\niPhone 5 的 Web\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/iPhone 5 Web.png'>\n</p>\n\niPhone 7 的 Web\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/iPhone 7 Web.png'>\n</p>\n\niPhone 7 Plus 的 Web\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/iPhone 7 Plus Web.png'>\n</p>\n\niPad 的 Web\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Web/iPad Web.png'>\n</p>\n\n接着再看看 Mac 端上的表现：\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 1.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 2.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 3.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 4.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 5.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/Mac/Mac 6.png'>\n</p>\n\n最后看看 Cordova 的效果：\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPhone/iPhone 1.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPhone/iPhone 2.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPhone/iPhone 3.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPad/iPad 1.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPad/iPad 2.png'>\n</p>\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Screenshots/iPad/iPad 3.png'>\n</p>\n\n## 🌈 功能展示\n\n用 Vue.js 搭建一个 Web 页面很快。\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web.gif'>\n</p>\n\n看看 Vuex 管理状态的方便。登录状态保存在 state 里面，全局都会获取到。\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-login.gif'>\n</p>\n\n一旦用户没有登录，点击购买电子书的时候，判断没有用户登录都会跳转到登录页面。\n\n还有一点值得说的是，由于这是一个 SPA ，所以里面的路由都用 Router-link 实现的，而没有选用 `<a>` 标签的跳转，效果就是跳转并不用去请求数据，秒跳。这个用户体验真的很爽。\n\n`<router-link>` 比起写死的 `<a href=\"...\">` 会好一些，理由如下：\n\n无论是 HTML5 history 模式还是 hash 模式，它的表现行为一致，所以，当你要切换路由模式，或者在 IE9 降级使用 hash 模式，无须作任何变动。\n\n在 HTML5 history 模式下，router-link 会拦截点击事件，让浏览器不再重新加载页面。\n\n当你在 HTML5 history 模式下使用 base 选项之后，所有的 to 属性都不需要写（基路径）了。\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-logout.gif'>\n</p>\n\n登出页面同理，一旦用户登出，所有显示用户名的地方都会变成登录，navigationBar 上的购物车也一并消失。用 Vuex 管理状态，挺好的。\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-email.gif'>\n</p>\n\n这就是 email 的表单验证了，没有太多的技术含量。\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-buy.gif'>\n</p>\n\n这里是购物车页面，这里用到了 MVVM 页面的绑定的思想，页面上 4 个按钮，点任意一个按钮都会立即改变下面的总价。关于 Vue.js 的 MVVM 实现思想值得 iOSer 们学习。\n\n接下来这个是 iPhone 的 Safari 上的表现，速度还可以。\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-iPhone.gif'>\n</p>\n\n在跨平台的这几个应用中，体验最好的，我觉得还是 Mac 的应用。使用起来满意度非常高。\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-Mac.gif'>\n</p>\n\n最后就是 Cordova 框架搭建的 手机 app，体验度不高，具体如何，看图吧，总之不优化的 Cordova ，对于挑剔的我来说，我是不满意的。\n\niPhone 上的应用\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-iPone app.gif'>\n</p>\n\niPad 上的应用\n\n<p align='center'>\n<img src='./image/Gifs/Web-iPad app.gif'>\n</p>\n\n## 🤔 项目完成之后的感想\n\n先安利一下 element-ui 这个项目，用它来搭建项目，真的很快，页面很快就可以搭建完成，开发 Vue.js 的同学一定有听过这个库。节约出来的大把时间可以把更多的精力放在业务开发上面。\n\n大家都在说现在是大前端时代，移动开发和前端融合是必然。但是两个平台的开发其实还是有很多的不同，我在经历过前端的开发和 iOS 开发以后，感想还是很多的，前端和 iOS 是有很多可以相互学习的地方，两者也各有优缺点。接下来我打算写写这些方面的系列文章。前端的工程化，组件化，路由，MVVM，分别和 iOS 这边各有哪些优缺点，相互可以学习些什么。（感觉给自己挖了一个大坑）\n\n## 📜 Feature\n\n有时间就支持 Weex ，把这个 Vue.js 的改成一个完整的 Weex 的应用，变成原生以后，性能一定不会差。这样跨平台开发就应该全了。\n\n## ❗️
