          "content": "# Upcoming release\n\n## Features\n\n- Add a hidden `--mindepth` alias for `--min-depth`. (#1617)\n\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n\n## Changes\n\n\n## Other\n\n\n# 10.2.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Add --hyperlink option to add OSC 8 hyperlinks to output\n\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n\n## Changes\n\n- Build windows releases with rust 1.77 so windows 7 is still supported\n- Deb packages now include symlink for fdfind to be more consistent with official packages\n\n\n## Other\n\n# 10.1.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Allow passing an optional argument to `--strip-cwd-prefix` of \"always\", \"never\", or \"auto\". to force whether the cwd prefix is stripped or not.\n- Add a `--format` option which allows using a format template for direct ouput similar to the template used for `--exec`. (#1043)\n\n## Bugfixes\n- Fix aarch64 page size again. This time it should actually work. (#1085, #1549) (@tavianator)\n\n\n## Other\n\n- aarch64-apple-darwin target added to builds on the release page. Note that this is a tier 2 rust target.\n\n# v10.0.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Add `dir` as an alias to `directory` when using `-t` \\ `--type`, see #1460 and #1464 (@Ato2207).\n- Add support for @%s date format in time filters similar to GNU date (seconds since Unix epoch for --older/--newer), see #1493 (@nabellows)\n- Breaking: No longer automatically ignore `.git` when using `--hidden` with vcs ignore enabled. This reverts the change in v9.0.0. While this feature\n  was often useful, it also broke some existing workflows, and there wasn't a good way to opt out of it. And there isn't really a good way for us to add\n  a way to opt out of it. And you can easily get similar behavior by adding `.git/` to your global fdignore file.\n    See #1457.\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Respect NO_COLOR environment variable with `--list-details` option. (#1455)\n- Fix bug that would cause hidden files to be included despite gitignore rules\n  if search path is \".\" (#1461, BurntSushi/ripgrep#2711).\n- aarch64 builds now use 64k page sizes with jemalloc. This fixes issues on some systems, such as ARM Macs that\n  have a larger system page size than the system that the binary was built on. (#1547)\n- Address [CVE-2024-24576](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/04/09/cve-2024-24576.html), by increasing minimum rust version.\n\n\n## Changes\n- Minimum supported rust version is now 1.77.2\n\n\n# v9.0.0\n\n## Performance\n\n- Performance has been *significantly improved*, both due to optimizations in the underlying `ignore`\n  crate (#1429), and in `fd` itself (#1422, #1408, #1362) - @tavianator.\n  [Benchmarks results](https://gist.github.com/tavianator/32edbe052f33ef60570cf5456b59de81) show gains\n  of 6-8x for full traversals of smaller directories (100k files) and up to 13x for larger directories (1M files).\n\n- The default number of threads is now constrained to be at most 64. This should improve startup time on\n  systems with many CPU cores. (#1203, #1410, #1412, #1431) - @tmccombs and @tavianator\n\n- New flushing behavior when writing output to stdout, providing better performance for TTY and non-TTY\n  use cases, see #1452 and #1313 (@tavianator).\n\n## Features\n\n- Support character and block device file types, see #1213 and #1336 (@cgzones)\n- Breaking: `.git/` is now ignored by default when using `--hidden` / `-H`, use `--no-ignore` / `-I` or\n  `--no-ignore-vcs` to override, see #1387 and #1396 (@skoriop)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Fix `NO_COLOR` support, see #1421 (@acuteenvy)\n\n## Other\n\n- Fixed documentation typos, see #1409 (@marcospb19)\n\n## Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to @tavianator for his incredible work on performance in the `ignore` crate and `fd` itself.\n\n\n\n# v8.7.1\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- `-1` properly conflicts with the exec family of options.\n- `--max-results` overrides `-1`\n- `--quiet` properly conflicts with the exec family of options. This used to be the case, but broke during the switch to clap-derive\n- `--changed-within` now accepts a space as well as a \"T\" as the separator between date and time (due to update of chrono dependency)\n\n## Other\n- Many dependencies were updated\n- Some documentation was updated and fixed\n\n# v8.7.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Add flag --no-require-git to always respect gitignore files, see #1216 (@vegerot)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Fix logic for when to use global ignore file. There was a bug where the only case where the\n  global ignore file wasn't processed was if `--no-ignore` was passed, but neither `--unrestricted`\n  nor `--no-global-ignore-file` is passed. See #1209\n\n# v8.6.0\n\n## Features\n\n- New `--and <pattern>` option to add additional patterns that must also be matched. See #315\n  and #1139 (@Uthar)\n- Added `--changed-after` as alias for `--changed-within`, to have a name consistent with `--changed-before`.\n\n\n## Changes\n\n- Breaking: On Unix-like systems, `--type executable` now additionally checks if\n  the file is executable by the current user, see #1106 and #1169 (@ptipiak)\n\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Use fd instead of fd.exe for Powershell completions (when completions are generated on windows)\n\n\n## Other\n\n\n# v8.5.3\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Fix completion generation to not include full path of fd command\n- Fix build error if completions feature is disabled\n\n# v8.5.2\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Fix --owner option value parsing, see #1163 and #1164 (@tmccombs)\n\n\n# v8.5.1\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Fix --threads/-j option value parsing, see #1160 and #1162 (@sharkdp)\n\n\n# v8.5.0\n\n## Features\n\n- `--type executable`/`-t` now works on Windows, see #1051 and #1061 (@tavianator)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed differences between piped / non-piped output. This changes `fd`s behavior back to what we\n  had before 8.3.0, i.e. there will be no leading `./` prefixes, unless `--exec`/`-x`,\n  `--exec-batch`/`-X`, or `--print0`/`-0` are used. `--strip-cwd-prefix` can be used to strip that\n  prefix in those cases. See #1046, #1115, and #1121 (@tavianator)\n- `fd` could previously crash with a panic due to a race condition in Rusts standard library\n  (see https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/39364). This has been fixed by switching to a different\n  message passing implementation, see #1060 and #1146 (@tavianator)\n- `fd`s memory usage will not grow unboundedly on huge directory trees, see #1146 (@tavianator)\n- fd returns an error when current working directory does not exist while a search path is\n  specified, see #1072 (@vijfhoek)\n- Improved \"command not found\" error message, see #1083 and #1109 (@themkat)\n- Preserve command exit codes when using `--exec-batch`, see #1136 and #1137 (@amesgen)\n\n## Changes\n\n- No leading `./` prefix for non-interactive results, see above.\n- fd now colorizes paths in parallel, significantly improving performance, see #1148 (@tavianator)\n- fd can now avoid `stat` syscalls even when colorizing paths, as long as the color scheme doesn't\n  require metadata, see #1148 (@tavianator)\n- The statically linked `musl` versions of `fd` now use `jmalloc`, leading to a significant performance\n  improvement, see #1062 (@tavianator)\n\n## Other\n\n- Added link back to GitHub in man page and `--help` text, see #1086 (@scottchiefbaker)\n- Major update in how `fd` handles command line options internally, see #1067 (@tmccombs)\n\n# v8.4.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Support multiple `--exec <cmd>` instances, see #406 and #960 (@tmccombs)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- \"Argument list too long\" errors can not appear anymore when using `--exec-batch`/`-X`, as the command invocations are automatically batched at the maximum possible size, even if `--batch-size` is not given. See #410 and #1020 (@tavianator)\n\n## Changes\n\n- Directories are now printed with an additional path separator at the end: `foo/bar/`, see #436 and #812 (@yyogo)\n- The `-u` flag was changed to be equivalent to `-HI` (previously, a single `-u` was only equivalent to `-I`). Additional `-u` flags are still allowed, but ignored. See #840 and #986 (@jacksontheel)\n\n## Other\n\n- Added installation instructions for RHEL8, see #989 (@ethsol)\n\n\n# v8.3.2\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Invalid absolute path on windows when searching from the drive root, see #931 and #936 (@gbarta)\n\n\n# v8.3.1\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Stop implying `--no-ignore-parent` when `--no-vcs-ignore` is supplied, see #907, #901, #908 (@tmccombs)\n- fd no longer waits for the whole traversal if the only matches arrive within max_buffer_time, see #868 and #895 (@tavianator)\n- `--max-results=1` now immediately quits after the first result, see #867\n- `fd -h` does not panic anymore when stdout is closed, see #897\n\n## Changes\n\n- Disable jemalloc on FreeBSD, see #896 (@xanderio)\n- Updated man page, see #912 (@rlue)\n- Updated zsh completions, see #932 (@tmccombs)\n\n\n# v8.3.0\n\n## Performance improvements\n\n- Colorized output is now significantly faster, see #720 and #853 (@tavianator)\n- Writing to stdout is now buffered if the output does not go to a TTY. This increases performance\n  when the output of `fd` is piped to another program or to a file, see #885 (@tmccombs, original\n  implementation by @sourlemon207)\n- File metadata is now cached between the different filters that require it (e.g. `--owner`,\n  `--size`), reducing the number of `stat` syscalls when multiple filters are used; see #863\n  (@tavianator, original implementation by @alexmaco)\n\n## Features\n\n- Don't buffer command output from `--exec` when using a single thread. See #522\n- Add new `-q, --quiet` flag, see #303 (@Asha20)\n- Add new `--no-ignore-parent` flag, see #787 (@will459)\n- Add new `--batch-size` flag, see #410 (@devonhollowood)\n- Add opposing command-line options, see #595 (@Asha20)\n- Add support for more filesystem indicators in `LS_COLORS`, see\n  https://github.com/sharkdp/lscolors/pull/35 (@tavianator)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Always show the `./` prefix for search results unless the output is a TTY or `--strip-cwd-prefix` is set, see #760 and #861 (@jcaplan)\n- Set default path separator to `/` in MSYS, see #537 and #730 (@aswild)\n- fd cannot search files under a RAM disk, see #752\n- fd doesn't show substituted drive on Windows, see #365\n- Properly handle write errors to devices that are full, see #737\n- Use local time zone for time functions (`--change-newer-than`, `--change-older-than`), see #631 (@jacobmischka)\n- Support `--list-details` on more platforms (like BusyBox), see #783\n- The filters `--owner`, `--size`, and `--changed-{within,before}` now apply to symbolic links\n  themselves, rather than the link target, except when `--follow` is specified; see #863\n- Change time comparisons to be exclusive, see #794 (@jacobmischka)\n\n## Changes\n\n- Apply custom `--path-separator` to commands run with `--exec(-batch)` and `--list-details`, see #697 (@aswild)\n\n## Other\n\n- Many documentation updates\n\n\n# v8.2.1\n\nNo functional changes with respect to v8.2.0. Bugfix in the release process.\n\n# v8.2.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Add new `--prune` flag, see #535 (@reima)\n- Improved the usability of the time-based options, see #624 and #645 (@gorogoroumaru)\n- Add support for exact file sizes in the `--size` filter, see #669 and #696 (@Rogach)\n- `fd` now prints an error message if the search pattern requires a leading dot but\n  `--hidden` is not enabled (Unix only), see #615\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Avoid panic when performing limited searches in directories with restricted permissions, see #678\n- Invalid numeric command-line arguments are silently ignored, see #675\n- Disable jemalloc on Android, see #662\n- The `--help` text will be colorless if `NO_COLOR` has been set, see #600 (@xanonid)\n\n## Changes\n\n- If `LS_COLORS` is not set (e.g. on Windows), we now provide a more comprehensive default which\n  includes much more filetypes, see #604 and #682 (mjsir911).\n\n## Other\n\n- Added `zsh` completion files, see #654 and #189 (@smancill)\n\n# v8.1.1\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Support colored output on older Windows versions if either (1) `--color=always` is set or (2) the `TERM` environment variable is set. See #469\n\n# v8.1.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Add new `--owner [user][:group]` filter. See #307 (pull #581) (@alexmaco)\n- Add support for a global ignore file (`~/.config/fd/ignore` on Unix), see #575 (@soedirgo)\n- Do not exit immediately if one of the search paths is missing, see #587 (@DJRHails)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Reverted a change from fd 8.0 that enabled colors on all Windows terminals (see below) in order to support older Windows versions again, see #577. Unfortunately, this re-opens #469\n- Fix segfault caused by jemalloc on macOS Catalina, see #498\n- Fix `--glob` behavior with empty pattern, see #579 (@SeamusConnor)\n- Fix `--list-details` on FreeBSD, DragonFly BSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD. See #573 (@t6)\n\n## Changes\n\n- Updated documentation for `--size`, see #584\n\n# v8.0.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Add a new `-l`/`--list-details` option to show more details about the search results. This is\n  basically an alias for `--exec-batch ls -l` with some additional `ls` options.\n  This can be used in order to:\n    * see metadata like permissions, owner, file size, modification times (#491)\n    * see symlink targets (#482)\n    * achieve a deterministic output order (#324, #196, #159)\n- Add a new `--max-results=<count>` option to limit the number of search results, see #472, #476 and #555\n  This can be useful to speed up searches in cases where you know that there are only N results.\n  Using this option is also (slightly) faster than piping to `head -n <count>` where `fd` can only\n  exit when it finds the search results `<count> + 1`.\n- Add the alias `-1` for `--max-results=1`, see #561. (@SimplyDanny).\n- Add new `--type socket` and `--type pipe` filters, see #511.\n- Add new `--min-depth <depth>` and `--exact-depth <depth>` options in addition to the existing option\n  to limit the maximum depth. See #404.\n- Support additional ANSI font styles in `LS_COLORS`: faint, slow blink, rapid blink, dimmed, hidden and strikethrough.\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Preserve non-UTF8 filenames: invalid UTF-8 filenames are now properly passed to child-processes\n  when using `--exec`, `--exec-batch` or `--list-details`. In `fd`'s output, we replace non-UTF-8\n  sequences with the \"�\" character. However, if the output of `fd` goes to another process, we\n  print the actual bytes of the filename. For more details, see #558 and #295.\n- `LS_COLORS` entries with unsupported font styles are not completely ignored, see #552\n\n## Changes\n\n- Colored output will now be enabled by default on older Windows versions.\n  This allows the use of colored output if the terminal supports it (e.g.\n  MinTTY, Git Bash). On the other hand, this will be a regression for users\n  on older Windows versions with terminals that do not support ANSI escape\n  sequences. Affected users can use an alias `fd=\"fd --color=never\"` to\n  continue using `fd` without colors. There is no change of behavior for\n  Windows 10. See #469.\n- When using `--glob` in combination with `--full-path`, a `*` character does not match a path\n  separation character (`/` or `\\\\`) anymore. You can use `**` for that. This allows things like\n  `fd -p -g '/some/base/path/*/*/*.txt'` which would previously match to arbitrary depths (instead\n  of exactly two folders below `/some/base/path`. See #404.\n- \"Legacy\" support to use `fd -exec` (with a single dash) has been removed. Use `fd -x` or\n  `fd --exec` instead.\n- Overall improved error handling and error messages.\n\n\n## Other\n\n- Korean translation of the README, see: [한국어](https://github.com/spearkkk/fd-kor) (@spearkkk)\n\n\n# v7.5.0\n\n## Features\n\n- Added `--one-file-system` (aliases: `--mount`, `--xdev`) to not cross file system boundaries on Unix and Windows, see #507 (@FallenWarrior2k).\n- Added `--base-directory` to change the working directory in which `fd` is run, see #509 and #475 (@hajdamak).\n- `fd` will not use colored output if the `NO_COLOR` environment variable is set, see #550 and #551 (@metadave).\n- `fd --exec` will return exit code 1 if one of the executed commands fails, see #526 and #531 (@fusillicode and @Giuffre)\n\n## Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed 'command not found' error when using zsh completion, see #487 (@barskern).\n- `fd -L` should include broken symlinks, see #357 and #497 (@tommilligan, @neersighted and @sharkdp)\n- Display directories even if we don't have permission to enter, see #437 (@sharkdp)\n\n## Changes\n\n- A flag can now be passed multiple times without producing an error, see #488 and #496 (@rootbid).\n- Search results are sorted when using the `-X` option to match the behaviour of piping to `xargs`, see #441 and #524 (@Marcoleni @crash-g).\n\n\n# v7.4.0\n\n## Performance improvements\n\n- Reduce number of `stat` syscalls, improving the performance for searches where file metadata is\n  required (`--type`, `--size`, `--changed-within`, …), see #434 (@tavianator)\n- Use jemalloc by default, improving the performance for almost all searches, see #481. Note that\n  Windows and `*musl*` builds do not profit from this.\n\n## Features\n\n- Added a new `-g`/`--glob` option to switch to glob-based searches (instead of regular expression\n  based searches). This is accompanied by a new `--regex` option that can be used to switch back,\n  if users want to `alias fd=\"fd --glob\"`. See #284\n- Added a new `--path-separator <sep>` option which can be useful for Windows users who\n  want/need `fd` to use `/` instead of `\\`, see #428 and #153 (@mookid)\n- Added support for hidden files on Windows, see #379\n- When `fd` is run with the `--exec-batch`/`-X` option, it now exposes the exit status of the\n  command that was run, see #333.\n- Exit immediately when Ctrl-C has been pressed twice, see #423\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- Make `--changed-within`/`--changed-before` work for directories, see #470\n\n## Other\n\n- Pre-built `fd` binaries should now be available for `armhf` targets, see #457 (@detly)\n- `fd` is now available on Alpine Linux, see #451 (@5paceToast)\n- `fd` is now in the officla FreeBSD repositories, see #412 (@t6)\n- Added OpenBSD install instructions, see #421 (@evitalis)\n- Added metadata to the Debian package, see #416 (@cathalgarvey)\n- `fd` can be installed via npm, see #438 (@pablopunk)\n\n\n# v7.3.0\n\n## Features\n\n- New `--exec-batch <cmd>`/`-X <cmd>` option for batch execution of commands, see #360 (@kimsnj).\n  This allows you to do things like:\n  ``` bash\n  fd … -X vim  # open all search results in vim (or any other editor)\n  fd … -X ls -l  # view detailed stats about the search results with 'ls'\n  fd -e svg -X inkscape  # open all SVG files in Inkscape\n  ```\n- Support for 24-bit color codes (when specified via `LS_COLORS`) as well as\n  different font styles (bold, italic, underline).\n\n## Changes\n\n- A few performance improvements, in particular when printing lots of colorized\n  results to the console, see #370\n- The `LS_COLORS` handling has been \"outsourced\" to a separate crate (https://github.com/sharkdp/lscolors) that is now being used by other tools as well: [fselect](https://github.com/jhspetersson/fselect), [lsd](https://github.com/Peltoche/lsd/pull/84). For details, see #363.\n\n## Other\n\n- `fd` will be available in Ubuntu Disco DIngo (19.04), see #373 (@sylvestre)\n- This release should come with a static ARM binary (`arm-unknown-linux-musleabihf`), see #320 (@duncanfinney)\n- Various documentation improvements, see #389\n\n## Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to @alexmaco for his awesome work on refactoring and code improvements! (see #401, #398, and #383)\n\n# v7.2.0\n\n## Features\n\n* Added support for filtering by file modification time by adding two new options `--changed-before <date|duration>` and `--changed-within <..>`. For more details, see the `--help` text, the man page, the relevant issue #165 and the PR #339 (@kimsnj)\n* Added `--show-errors` option to enable the display of filesystem error messages such as \"permission denied\", see #311 (@psinghal20 and @majecty)\n* Added `--maxdepth` as a (hidden) alias for `--max-depth`, see #323 (@mqudsi)\n* Added `--search-path` option which can be supplied to replace the positional `path` argument at any position.\n\n## Changes\n\n* Loosen strict handling of missing `--ignore-file`, see #280 (@psinghal20)\n* Re-enabled `.ignore` files, see #156.\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n* `fd` could previously get stuck when run from the root directory in the\n  presence of zombie processes. This curious bug has been fixed in Rust 1.29 and higher. For more details, see #288, [rust-lang/rust#50619](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/50619) and [the fix](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/50630)\n\n## Other\n\n* `fd` has officially landed in Debian!

Thank you very much!\n\nThanks also go out to @tmccombs for the work on Debian packages and for reviewing a lot of pull requests!\n\n# v6.0.0\n\n## Changes\n\n- The `--exec`/`-x` option does not spawn an intermediate shell anymore. This improves the\n  performance of parallel command execution and fixes a whole class of (present and potentially\n  future) problems with shell escaping. The drawback is that shell commands cannot directly be\n  called with `--exec`. See #155 for the full discussion. These changes have been implemented by\n  @reima (Thanks!).\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n- `--exec` does not escape cmd.exe metacharacters on Windows (see #155, as above).\n\n## Other\n\n* *fd* is now available in the FreeBSD ports (@andoriyu)\n* The minimal `rustc` version is now checked when building with `cargo`, see #164 (@matematikaadit)\n* The output directory for the shell completion files is created if it does not exist (@andoriyu)\n\n\n# v5.0.0\n\n## Features\n\n* Added new `--exec`, `-x` option for parallel command execution (@mmstick, see #84 and #116). See the corresponding [README section](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#parallel-command-execution) for an introduction.\n* Auto-disable color output on unsupported Windows shells like `cmd.exe` (@iology, see #129)\n* Added the `--exclude`, `-X` option to suppress certain files/directories in the search results\n  (see #89).\n* Added ripgrep aliases `-u` and `-uu` for `--no-ignore` and `--no-ignore --hidden`, respectively\n  (@unsignedint, see #92)\n* Added `-i`, `--ignore-case` (@iology, see #95)\n* Made smart case really smart (@reima, see #103)\n* Added RedoxOS support (@goyox86, see #131)\n\n## Changes\n\n* The dot `.` can now match newlines in file names (@iology, see #111)\n* The short `--type` argument for symlinks has been changed from `s` to `l` (@jcpetkovich, see #83)\n\n## Bugfixes\n\n* Various improvements in root-path and symlink handling (@iology, see #82, #107, and #113)\n* Fixed absolute path handling on Windows (@reima, #93)\n* Fixed: current directory not included when using relative path (see #81)\n* Fixed `--type` behavior for unknown file types (@iology, see #150)\n* Some fixes around `--exec` (@iology, see #142)\n\n## Other\n\n* Major updates and bugfixes to our continuous integration and deployment tooling on Travis\n  (@matematikaadit, see #149, #145, #133)\n* Code style improvements & automatic style checking via `rustfmt` on Travis (@Detegr, see #99)\n* Added a man page (@pickfire, see #77)\n* *fd* has been relicensed under the dual license MIT/Apache-2.0 (@Detegr, see #105)\n* Major refactorings and code improvements (Big thanks to @gsquire, @reima, @iology)\n* First version of [`CONTRIBUTING`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines\n* There is now a Nix package (@mehandes)\n* *fd* is now in the official Arch Linux repos (@cassava)\n* Improved tooling around shell completion files (@ImbaKnugel, see #124)\n* Updated tutorial in the [`README`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/blob/master/README.md)\n* The minimum required version of Rust has been bumped to 1.19.\n\n## Thanks\n\nA *lot* of things have happened since the last release and I'd like to thank all contributors for their great support. I'd also like to thank those that have contributed by reporting bugs and by posting feature requests.\n\nI'd also like to take this chance to say a special Thank You to a few people that have stood out in one way or another: To @iology, for contributing a multitude of bugfixes, improvements and new features. To @reima and @Detegr for their continuing great support. To @mmstick, for implementing the most advanced new feature of *fd*.

It switches to\n  case-sensitive if the pattern contains an uppercase\n  character[\\*](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html#'smartcase').\n* Ignores hidden directories and files, by default.\n* Ignores patterns from your `.gitignore`, by default.\n* The command name is *50%* shorter[\\*](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) than\n  `find` :-).\n\n## Demo\n\n![Demo](doc/screencast.svg)\n\n## How to use\n\nFirst, to get an overview of all available command line options, you can either run\n[`fd -h`](#command-line-options) for a concise help message or `fd --help` for a more detailed\nversion.\n\n### Simple search\n\n*fd* is designed to find entries in your filesystem. The most basic search you can perform is to\nrun *fd* with a single argument: the search pattern. For example, assume that you want to find an\nold script of yours (the name included `netflix`):\n``` bash\n> fd netfl\nSoftware/python/imdb-ratings/netflix-details.py\n```\nIf called with just a single argument like this, *fd* searches the current directory recursively\nfor any entries that *contain* the pattern `netfl`.\n\n### Regular expression search\n\nThe search pattern is treated as a regular expression. Here, we search for entries that start\nwith `x` and end with `rc`:\n``` bash\n> cd /etc\n> fd '^x.*rc$'\nX11/xinit/xinitrc\nX11/xinit/xserverrc\n```\n\nThe regular expression syntax used by `fd` is [documented here](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax).\n\n### Specifying the root directory\n\nIf we want to search a specific directory, it can be given as a second argument to *fd*:\n``` bash\n> fd passwd /etc\n/etc/default/passwd\n/etc/pam.d/passwd\n/etc/passwd\n```\n\n### List all files, recursively\n\n*fd* can be called with no arguments. This is very useful to get a quick overview of all entries\nin the current directory, recursively (similar to `ls -R`):\n``` bash\n> cd fd/tests\n> fd\ntestenv\ntestenv/mod.rs\ntests.rs\n```\n\nIf you want to use this functionality to list all files in a given directory, you have to use\na catch-all pattern such as `.` or `^`:\n``` bash\n> fd . fd/tests/\ntestenv\ntestenv/mod.rs\ntests.rs\n```\n\n### Searching for a particular file extension\n\nOften, we are interested in all files of a particular type. This can be done with the `-e` (or\n`--extension`) option. Here, we search for all Markdown files in the fd repository:\n``` bash\n> cd fd\n> fd -e md\nCONTRIBUTING.md\nREADME.md\n```\n\nThe `-e` option can be used in combination with a search pattern:\n``` bash\n> fd -e rs mod\nsrc/fshelper/mod.rs\nsrc/lscolors/mod.rs\ntests/testenv/mod.rs\n```\n\n### Searching for a particular file name\n\n To find files with exactly the provided search pattern, use the `-g` (or `--glob`) option:\n``` bash\n> fd -g libc.so /usr\n/usr/lib32/libc.so\n/usr/lib/libc.so\n```\n\n### Hidden and ignored files\nBy default, *fd* does not search hidden directories and does not show hidden files in the\nsearch results. To disable this behavior, we can use the `-H` (or `--hidden`) option:\n``` bash\n> fd pre-commit\n> fd -H pre-commit\n.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample\n```\n\nIf we work in a directory that is a Git repository (or includes Git repositories), *fd* does not\nsearch folders (and does not show files) that match one of the `.gitignore` patterns. To disable\nthis behavior, we can use the `-I` (or `--no-ignore`) option:\n``` bash\n> fd num_cpu\n> fd -I num_cpu\ntarget/debug/deps/libnum_cpus-f5ce7ef99006aa05.rlib\n```\n\nTo really search *all* files and directories, simply combine the hidden and ignore features to show\neverything (`-HI`) or use `-u`/`--unrestricted`.\n\n### Matching the full path\nBy default, *fd* only matches the filename of each file. However, using the `--full-path` or `-p` option,\nyou can match against the full path.\n\n```bash\n> fd -p -g '**/.git/config'\n> fd -p '.*/lesson-\\d+/[a-z]+.(jpg|png)'\n```\n\n### Command execution\n\nInstead of just showing the search results, you often want to *do something* with them. `fd`\nprovides two ways to execute external commands for each of your search results:\n\n* The `-x`/`--exec` option runs an external command *for each of the search results* (in parallel).\n* The `-X`/`--exec-batch` option launches the external command once, with *all search results as arguments*.\n\n#### Examples\n\nRecursively find all zip archives and unpack them:\n``` bash\nfd -e zip -x unzip\n```\nIf there are two such files, `file1.zip` and `backup/file2.zip`, this would execute\n`unzip file1.zip` and `unzip backup/file2.zip`. The two `unzip` processes run in parallel\n(if the files are found fast enough).\n\nFind all `*.h` and `*.cpp` files and auto-format them inplace with `clang-format -i`:\n``` bash\nfd -e h -e cpp -x clang-format -i\n```\nNote how the `-i` option to `clang-format` can be passed as a separate argument. This is why\nwe put the `-x` option last.\n\nFind all `test_*.py` files and open them in your favorite editor:\n``` bash\nfd -g 'test_*.py' -X vim\n```\nNote that we use capital `-X` here to open a single `vim` instance. If there are two such files,\n`test_basic.py` and `lib/test_advanced.py`, this will run `vim test_basic.py lib/test_advanced.py`.\n\nTo see details like file permissions, owners, file sizes etc., you can tell `fd` to show them\nby running `ls` for each result:\n``` bash\nfd … -X ls -lhd --color=always\n```\nThis pattern is so useful that `fd` provides a shortcut. You can use the `-l`/`--list-details`\noption to execute `ls` in this way: `fd … -l`.\n\nThe `-X` option is also useful when combining `fd` with [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/) (`rg`) in order to search within a certain class of files, like all C++ source files:\n```bash\nfd -e cpp -e cxx -e h -e hpp -X rg 'std::cout'\n```\n\nConvert all `*.jpg` files to `*.png` files:\n``` bash\nfd -e jpg -x convert {} {.}.png\n```\nHere, `{}` is a placeholder for the search result. `{.}` is the same, without the file extension.\nSee below for more details on the placeholder syntax.\n\nThe terminal output of commands run from parallel threads using `-x` will not be interlaced or garbled,\nso `fd -x` can be used to rudimentarily parallelize a task run over many files.\nAn example of this is calculating the checksum of each individual file within a directory.\n```\nfd -tf -x md5sum > file_checksums.txt\n```\n\n#### Placeholder syntax\n\nThe `-x` and `-X` options take a *command template* as a series of arguments (instead of a single string).\nIf you want to add additional options to `fd` after the command template, you can terminate it with a `\\;`.\n\nThe syntax for generating commands is similar to that of [GNU Parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/):\n\n- `{}`: A placeholder token that will be replaced with the path of the search result\n  (`documents/images/party.jpg`).\n- `{.}`: Like `{}`, but without the file extension (`documents/images/party`).\n- `{/}`: A placeholder that will be replaced by the basename of the search result (`party.jpg`).\n- `{//}`: The parent of the discovered path (`documents/images`).\n- `{/.}`: The basename, with the extension removed (`party`).\n\nIf you do not include a placeholder, *fd* automatically adds a `{}` at the end.\n\n#### Parallel vs. serial execution\n\nFor `-x`/`--exec`, you can control the number of parallel jobs by using the `-j`/`--threads` option.\nUse `--threads=1` for serial execution.\n\n### Excluding specific files or directories\n\nSometimes we want to ignore search results from a specific subdirectory. For example, we might\nwant to search all hidden files and directories (`-H`) but exclude all matches from `.git`\ndirectories. We can use the `-E` (or `--exclude`) option for this. It takes an arbitrary glob\npattern as an argument:\n``` bash\n> fd -H -E .git …\n```\n\nWe can also use this to skip mounted directories:\n``` bash\n> fd -E /mnt/external-drive …\n```\n\n.. or to skip certain file types:\n``` bash\n> fd -E '*.bak' …\n```\n\nTo make exclude-patterns like these permanent, you can create a `.fdignore` file. They work like\n`.gitignore` files, but are specific to `fd`. For example:\n``` bash\n> cat ~/.fdignore\n/mnt/external-drive\n*.bak\n```\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> `fd` also supports `.ignore` files that are used by other programs such as `rg` or `ag`.\n\nIf you want `fd` to ignore these patterns globally, you can put them in `fd`'s global ignore file.\nThis is usually located in `~/.config/fd/ignore` in macOS or Linux, and `%APPDATA%\\fd\\ignore` in\nWindows.\n\nYou may wish to include `.git/` in your `fd/ignore` file so that `.git` directories, and their contents\nare not included in output if you use the `--hidden` option.\n\n### Deleting files\n\nYou can use `fd` to remove all files and directories that are matched by your search pattern.\nIf you only want to remove files, you can use the `--exec-batch`/`-X` option to call `rm`. For\nexample, to recursively remove all `.DS_Store` files, run:\n``` bash\n> fd -H '^\\.DS_Store$' -tf -X rm\n```\nIf you are unsure, always call `fd` without `-X rm` first. Alternatively, use `rm`s \"interactive\"\noption:\n``` bash\n> fd -H '^\\.DS_Store$' -tf -X rm -i\n```\n\nIf you also want to remove a certain class of directories, you can use the same technique. You will\nhave to use `rm`s `--recursive`/`-r` flag to remove directories.\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> There are scenarios where using `fd … -X rm -r` can cause race conditions: if you have a\npath like `…/foo/bar/foo/…` and want to remove all directories named `foo`, you can end up in a\nsituation where the outer `foo` directory is removed first, leading to (harmless) *\"'foo/bar/foo':\nNo such file or directory\"* errors in the `rm` call.\n\n### Command-line options\n\nThis is the output of `fd -h`. To see the full set of command-line options, use `fd --help` which\nalso includes a much more detailed help text.\n\n```\nUsage: fd [OPTIONS] [pattern] [path]...\n\nArguments:\n  [pattern]  the search pattern (a regular expression, unless '--glob' is used; optional)\n  [path]...  the root directories for the filesystem search (optional)\n\nOptions:\n  -H, --hidden                     Search hidden files and directories\n  -I, --no-ignore                  Do not respect .(git|fd)ignore files\n  -s, --case-sensitive             Case-sensitive search (default: smart case)\n  -i, --ignore-case                Case-insensitive search (default: smart case)\n  -g, --glob                       Glob-based search (default: regular expression)\n  -a, --absolute-path              Show absolute instead of relative paths\n  -l, --list-details               Use a long listing format with file metadata\n  -L, --follow                     Follow symbolic links\n  -p, --full-path                  Search full abs. path (default: filename only)\n  -d, --max-depth <depth>          Set maximum search depth (default: none)\n  -E, --exclude <pattern>          Exclude entries that match the given glob pattern\n  -t, --type <filetype>            Filter by type: file (f), directory (d/dir), symlink (l),\n                                   executable (x), empty (e), socket (s), pipe (p), char-device\n                                   (c), block-device (b)\n  -e, --extension <ext>            Filter by file extension\n  -S, --size <size>                Limit results based on the size of files\n      --changed-within <date|dur>  Filter by file modification time (newer than)\n      --changed-before <date|dur>  Filter by file modification time (older than)\n  -o, --owner <user:group>         Filter by owning user and/or group\n      --format <fmt>               Print results according to template\n  -x, --exec <cmd>...

It contains ~750.000\nsubdirectories and about a 4 million files. For averaging and statistical analysis, I'm using\n[hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine). The following benchmarks are performed\nwith a \"warm\"/pre-filled disk-cache (results for a \"cold\" disk-cache show the same trends).\n\nLet's start with `find`:\n```\nBenchmark 1: find ~ -iregex '.*[0-9]\\.jpg$'\n  Time (mean ± σ):     19.922 s ±  0.109 s\n  Range (min … max):   19.765 s … 20.065 s\n```\n\n`find` is much faster if it does not need to perform a regular-expression search:\n```\nBenchmark 2: find ~ -iname '*[0-9].jpg'\n  Time (mean ± σ):     11.226 s ±  0.104 s\n  Range (min … max):   11.119 s … 11.466 s\n```\n\nNow let's try the same for `fd`. Note that `fd` performs a regular expression\nsearch by default. The options `-u`/`--unrestricted` option is needed here for\na fair comparison. Otherwise `fd` does not have to traverse hidden folders and\nignored paths (see below):\n```\nBenchmark 3: fd -u '[0-9]\\.jpg$' ~\n  Time (mean ± σ):     854.8 ms ±  10.0 ms\n  Range (min … max):   839.2 ms … 868.9 ms\n```\nFor this particular example, `fd` is approximately **23 times faster** than `find -iregex`\nand about **13 times faster** than `find -iname`. By the way, both tools found the exact\nsame 546 files :smile:.\n\n**Note**: This is *one particular* benchmark on *one particular* machine. While we have\nperformed a lot of different tests (and found consistent results), things might\nbe different for you! We encourage everyone to try it out on their own. See\n[this repository](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd-benchmarks) for all necessary scripts.\n\nConcerning *fd*'s speed, a lot of credit goes to the `regex` and `ignore` crates that are\nalso used in [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) (check it out!).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### `fd` does not find my file!\n\nRemember that `fd` ignores hidden directories and files by default. It also ignores patterns\nfrom `.gitignore` files. If you want to make sure to find absolutely every possible file, always\nuse the options `-u`/`--unrestricted` option (or `-HI` to enable hidden and ignored files):\n``` bash\n> fd -u …\n```\n\n### Colorized output\n\n`fd` can colorize files by extension, just like `ls`. In order for this to work, the environment\nvariable [`LS_COLORS`](https://linux.die.net/man/5/dir_colors) has to be set. Typically, the value\nof this variable is set by the `dircolors` command which provides a convenient configuration format\nto define colors for different file formats.\nOn most distributions, `LS_COLORS` should be set already. If you are on Windows or if you are looking\nfor alternative, more complete (or more colorful) variants, see [here](https://github.com/sharkdp/vivid),\n[here](https://github.com/seebi/dircolors-solarized) or\n[here](https://github.com/trapd00r/LS_COLORS).\n\n`fd` also honors the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) environment variable.\n\n### `fd` doesn't seem to interpret my regex pattern correctly\n\nA lot of special regex characters (like `[]`, `^`, `$`, ..) are also special characters in your\nshell. If in doubt, always make sure to put single quotes around the regex pattern:\n\n``` bash\n> fd '^[A-Z][0-9]+$'\n```\n\nIf your pattern starts with a dash, you have to add `--` to signal the end of command line\noptions. Otherwise, the pattern will be interpreted as a command-line option. Alternatively,\nuse a character class with a single hyphen character:\n\n``` bash\n> fd -- '-pattern'\n> fd '[-]pattern'\n```\n\n### \"Command not found\" for `alias`es or shell functions\n\nShell `alias`es and shell functions can not be used for command execution via `fd -x` or\n`fd -X`. In `zsh`, you can make the alias global via `alias -g myalias=\"…\"`. In `bash`,\nyou can use `export -f my_function` to make available to child processes. You would still\nneed to call `fd -x bash -c 'my_function \"$1\"' bash`. For other use cases or shells, use\na (temporary) shell script.\n\n## Integration with other programs\n\n### Using fd with `fzf`\n\nYou can use *fd* to generate input for the command-line fuzzy finder [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf):\n``` bash\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type file'\nexport FZF_CTRL_T_COMMAND=\"$FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND\"\n```\n\nThen, you can type `vim <Ctrl-T>` on your terminal to open fzf and search through the fd-results.\n\nAlternatively, you might like to follow symbolic links and include hidden files (but exclude `.git` folders):\n``` bash\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND='fd --type file --follow --hidden --exclude .git'\n```\n\nYou can even use fd's colored output inside fzf by setting:\n``` bash\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_COMMAND=\"fd --type file --color=always\"\nexport FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS=\"--ansi\"\n```\n\nFor more details, see the [Tips section](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#tips) of the fzf README.\n\n### Using fd with `rofi`\n\n[*rofi*](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) is a graphical launch menu application that is able to create menus by reading from *stdin*. Piping `fd` output into `rofi`s `-dmenu` mode creates fuzzy-searchable lists of files and directories.\n\n#### Example\n\nCreate a case-insensitive searchable multi-select list of *PDF* files under your `$HOME` directory and open the selection with your configured PDF viewer. To list all file types, drop the `-e pdf` argument.\n\n``` bash\nfd --type f -e pdf . $HOME | rofi -keep-right -dmenu -i -p FILES -multi-select | xargs -I {} xdg-open {}\n```\n\nTo modify the list that is presented by rofi, add arguments to the `fd` command. To modify the search behaviour of rofi, add arguments to the `rofi` command.\n\n### Using fd with `emacs`\n\nThe emacs package [find-file-in-project](https://github.com/technomancy/find-file-in-project) can\nuse *fd* to find files.\n\nAfter installing `find-file-in-project`, add the line `(setq ffip-use-rust-fd t)` to your\n`~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d/init.el` file.\n\nIn emacs, run `M-x find-file-in-project-by-selected` to find matching files. Alternatively, run\n`M-x find-file-in-project` to list all available files in the project.\n\n### Printing the output as a tree\n\nTo format the output of `fd` as a file-tree you can use the `tree` command with\n`--fromfile`:\n```bash\n❯ fd | tree --fromfile\n```\n\nThis can be more useful than running `tree` by itself because `tree` does not\nignore any files by default, nor does it support as rich a set of options as\n`fd` does to control what to print:\n```bash\n❯ fd --extension rs | tree --fromfile\n.\n├── build.rs\n└── src\n    ├── app.rs\n    └── error.rs\n```\n\nOn bash and similar you can simply create an alias:\n```bash\n❯ alias as-tree='tree --fromfile'\n```\n\n### Using fd with `xargs` or `parallel`\n\nNote that `fd` has a builtin feature for [command execution](#command-execution) with\nits `-x`/`--exec` and `-X`/`--exec-batch` options. If you prefer, you can still use\nit in combination with `xargs`:\n``` bash\n> fd -0 -e rs | xargs -0 wc -l\n```\nHere, the `-0` option tells *fd* to separate search results by the NULL character (instead of\nnewlines). In the same way, the `-0` option of `xargs` tells it to read the input in this way.\n\n## Installation\n\n[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/fd-find.svg)](https://repology.org/project/fd-find/versions)\n\n### On Ubuntu\n*... and other Debian-based Linux distributions.*\n\nIf you run Ubuntu 19.04 (Disco Dingo) or newer, you can install the\n[officially maintained package](https://packages.ubuntu.com/fd-find):\n```\napt install fd-find\n```\nNote that the binary is called `fdfind` as the binary name `fd` is already used by another package.\nIt is recommended that after installation, you add a link to `fd` by executing command\n`ln -s $(which fdfind) ~/.local/bin/fd`, in order to use `fd` in the same way as in this documentation.\nMake sure that `$HOME/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`.\n\nIf you use an older version of Ubuntu, you can download the latest `.deb` package from the\n[release page](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/releases) and install it via:\n``` bash\ndpkg -i fd_9.0.0_amd64.deb #
