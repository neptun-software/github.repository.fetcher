If you use `PlatformText` on Android the default will now be camel case, which is the equavalent to just using `Text`. It is recommended to move away from `PlatformText` nad use flutter `Text` widget as this will become deprecated and then removed in future versions. If you need to keep existing ALL CAPS behaviour, set `matchMaterialCaseForPlatformText` to `false`. `PlatformProvider(settings: PlatformSettingsData(matchMaterialCaseForPlatformText: false))`.\n\n## [6.0.2]\n\n#### (Flutter version support: v3.16.0)\n\n- Adds all the flutter 3.16 additional properties for platform widgets\n\n## [6.0.1]\n\n#### (Flutter version support: v3.16.0)\n\n- Upgrade to flutter version 3.16.0 and sets the Dart min value to 3.2\n- Fixed `PlatformTextField` that had a breaking argument due to Flutter 3.16 (thanks kishormainali)\n\n## [5.0.0]\n\n#### (Flutter version support: v3.13.0 - 3.13.9)\n\n- Upgrade to flutter version 3.13.0 and sets the Dart min value to 3.1\n- Adds all the flutter 3.13 additional properties for platform widgets\n\n## [4.0.0-beta.2]\n\n#### (Flutter version support: v3.10.0)\n\n- Upgrade to flutter version 3.10.0 and sets the Dart min value to 3.0\n- Adds all the flutter 3.10 additional properties for platform widgets\n- Remove deprecated properties.\n- PlatformSearchBar added (thanks bookshiyi) !!

This may now render splash effect for Material widgets which would not occurred before. If this change is not needed then use `settings: PlatformSettingsData(legacyIosUsesMaterialWidgets: true)` \n- This setting can be disabled on a per PlatformScaffold basis for Cupertino. See noMaterialParent on `PlatformAppBar` cupertino data property\n- Added more PlatformIcons, dehaze, error, help and helpOutline (thanks mlava)\n  \n\n## [1.6.0] \n\n#### (Flutter version support: v2.0+)\n\n- Added `platformThemeData` to get access to the platform specific `ThemeData` more easily\n\n## [1.5.0] \n\n#### (Flutter version support: v2.0+)\n\n- Added context.platformIcon and additional remove platform icons (thanks vincevargadev)\n\n## [1.4.1] \n\n#### (Flutter version support: v2.0+)\n\n- Removed unmapped cupertino icons that show up as a 'question mark'\n  \n## [1.4.0] \n\n#### (Flutter version support: v2.0+)\n\n- Added `PlatformTextFormField`\n\n## [1.3.0] \n\n#### (Flutter version support: v2.0+)\n\n- Added PlatformElevatedButton and PlatformTextButton which change to Flutter 2.0 Material elevated and text buttons.

          "content": "The methid for creating the platform widgets is as follows\n\n1.  Generally each platform widget is a wrapper to the underlying Material or Cupertino widget.\n2.  Generally they do not include any specific styles or logic. Except Navbar and Appbar\n3.  Each platform widget should expose in the constructor as named arguments the same fields each Material and Cupertino underlying widgets share\n4.  All constructor arguments will take the same defaults from the underlying widgets and set on the platform widget being created\n5.  Only mark as @required if both underlying widgets also have them marked as @required\n6.  Each platform widget will provide a platform specifc builder to provide extra arguments targeting that platform. The name will match the platform control being created. i.e MaterialTextFieldData and CupertinoTextFieldData for PlatformTextField\n7.  Each data class will have all the constructor arguments of the underlying widget.\n    1. If the argunent already exists on the base platform widget then the default value for the arguemnt will be removed\n    2. If the argument does not exist on the base platform widget then the default value (if it has one) for the argument will be set\n8.  In constructing the underlying widget each argument will be of the following syntax:\n    1. `value = data?.value ?? value` for arguments shared between platforms\n    2. `value = data?.value` for arguments not shared between platforms and only exists on that one platform without a default argument\n    3. `value = data?.value ?? _kDefaultArg` for arguments not shared between platforms and only exists on that one platform with a default argument on the underlying widget\n9.  If underlying widgets share the same argument but the default values are differnet than that will need to be set as part of the platform constructor. See PlatformTextField fo example\n    1.  `style = style ?? (isMaterial ? null : _kDefaultTextStyle),`\n"

This typically starts with using the Material set of widgets which is the default look and feel for Android. However when designing screens for iOS and the Cupertino design language a double up of effort is required to cater for a new set of widgets.\n\nThis project was initially an experiment which grew into a fully fledged package to support the look using the Material and Cupertino designed widgets with a single platform widget.\n\nIf you want to build a Material and Cupertino looking app with very similar functionality then this package could save you time and effort.\n\n---\n\nThis package supports the **Stable** release as a full released version.\n\nBeta channels might be supported when there is a pre-release version. Please check the CHANGELOG for version compatibility.\n\nDue to Master being in rapid development this package is unable to support the Master channel. If this support is required then it is best to fork the repo and locally reference the forked version where you can make changes appropriately.\n\n---\n\n# Installation\n\n> pub.dev: https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_platform_widgets/install\n\n# How it works <a name=\"how-it-works\"></a>\n\nInstead of having to write conditional code like this...\n\n```dart\nif (Platform.isAndroid) {\n  return ElevatedButton(onPressed: onPressed, child: child);\n} else if (Platform.isIOS) {\n  return CupertinoButton.filled(onPressed: onPressed, child: child);\n}\n```\n\nyou can use a single `platform` widget which will render the correct underlying widget based on the `ThemeData.platform` property...\n\n```dart\nreturn PlatformElevatedButton(onPressed: onPressed, child: child);\n```\nThe heavy lifting of choosing the right widget is done for you.\n\nYou can also specify what design language you want for any supported platforms within flutter. These include:\n* Android\n* iOS\n* Web\n* Macos\n* Windows\n* Linux\n\n# Docs\n\nView the [package wiki](https://github.com/stryder-dev/flutter_platform_widgets/wiki) for details of how to use and the list of available widgets\n\n\n# Issues and Feedback\n\nPlease [create](https://github.com/stryder-dev/flutter_platform_widgets/issues/new) an issue to provide feedback or an issue.\n\n# License\n\nMIT\n\n# Contributors\n\nSpecial thanks for everyone that have contributed to this project over the last 5 years...\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/stryder-dev/flutter_platform_widgets/graphs/contributors\">\n  <img src=\"https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=stryder-dev/flutter_platform_widgets\" />\n</a>\n\nMade with [contrib.rocks](https://contrib.rocks).\n\nInspired by the example given by Swav Kulinski (https://github.com/swavkulinski/flutter-platform-specific-widgets)\n"
