          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThanks for using audioplayers and especially for your interest in contributing to the community!\n\nPlease read this document carefully before doing anything else!\n\n## Environment Setup\n\nAudioplayers is set up to run with the most recent `stable` version of Flutter, so make sure your version\nmatches that:\n\n```bash\nflutter channel stable\n```\n\nAlso, audioplayers uses [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos) to manage the project and dependencies.\n\nTo install Melos, run the following command from your terminal:\n\n```bash\nflutter pub global activate melos\n```\n\nNext, at the root of your locally cloned repository bootstrap the projects dependencies:\n\n```bash\nmelos bootstrap\n```\n\nThe bootstrap command locally links all dependencies within the project without having to\nprovide manual [`dependency_overrides`](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec). \nThis allows all plugins, examples and tests to build from the local clone project. \nYou should only need to run this command once.\n\n> You do not need to run `flutter pub get` once bootstrap has been completed.\n\n### Current Development\n\nIf you want to use the most recent changes in your own project add following dependencies to your `pubspec.yaml` or `pubspec_overrrides.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\ndependency_overrides:\n  audioplayers:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers.git\n      path: 'packages/audioplayers'\n  audioplayers_platform_interface:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers.git\n      path: 'packages/audioplayers_platform_interface'\n  audioplayers_web:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers.git\n      path: 'packages/audioplayers_web'\n  audioplayers_linux:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers.git\n      path: 'packages/audioplayers_linux'\n  audioplayers_android:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers.git\n      path: 'packages/audioplayers_android'\n  audioplayers_darwin:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers.git\n      path: 'packages/audioplayers_darwin'\n  audioplayers_windows:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers.git\n      path: 'packages/audioplayers_windows'\n```\n\n## Old Issues/PRs\n\nWe have many existing open issues and a few open PRs that were created before this doc was created. We will try to respect their ignorance of this file's existence by doing our best effort to answer/address/fix/merge them as we normally would up to this point (i.e. as time permits). \nHowever, if an existing issue or PR is too blatant of an outlier from these rules, we reserve the right of asking, in the issue/PR for the author (or someone) to fix it so that it falls under the new rules (i.e. apply the templates, etc). \nIf we need to do that, we will give two weeks for the issue/PR to be updated to follow the rules, otherwise it will be closed.\n\nOf course, anyone is free to open a similar followup at any time, as long as the new one follows the rules.\n\nWith that particular comment in mind, consider the following rules to apply to all new issues only.\n\n## General Rules\n\nThis document is divided in sections for each kind of contribution you have, but for any of them, basically for any form of communication between members of the community, you must follow these rules. \nI am adding them here at the top because they apply to all sections but also because they are the uttermost important thing for us.\n\n* Read this doc, the readme and everything else required carefully\n* Use clear, correct and acceptable English\n* Be polite, thoughtful and appreciate other people's time\n* Don't expect anyone to do anything for you, we are all helping each other to nourish a thriving community\n\nAny issues, PRs, or messages that do not follow can be deleted by our moderators and under persistent bad behavior we reserve the right to ban people.\n\n## Contribution Types\n\nAfter you read and accepted the rules above, you need to decide what kind of inquiry do you have. Choose the most appropriate of the sections below.\n\n### Questions\n\nQuestions are not bugs! Do not open issues for questions. Here are the channels to ask for help.\n\nFirst of all, make sure you read *at least* the [Readme Document](README.md) and the [Getting Started tutorial](getting_started.md) in full. That is the basis of how this library work and its very well written with care and love by us. If you haven't read even the basics, don't expect us to answer a question that is already solved there.\n\nSecond, make sure you went through our FAQ, [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md). There are many questions we get asked all the time that we have put the time and effort to answer on that doc. So make sure your question is not already there.\n\nThird, if your question is not there, try to searching for old issues. Even though we no longer use issues to track questions, we used to have A LOT of questions in the closed issues that are still there for documentation. Also maybe an old issue might give you context on how something works. In fact, if that doesn't work, try just searching google, stack overflow, discord logs. Maybe your question was already answered!\n\nLastly, try finding the answer in the source code. We try to keep our code clean and easy to understand, including docs explaining how things work. If our code/docs are not clear on something, this is a great opportunity to help with a PR (see feature requests below).\n\nIf you still have a question, then you might have a legit question! However issues are not the way to ask then. The ways in which we accept questions are:\n\n * [Our discord channel](https://discord.gg/ny7eThk): This is [Fire Slime Games](https://fireslime.xyz/) discord server, the people that are also behind Flame/audioplayers. We have a channel on the server dedicated for audioplayers questions. There you will be able to find many people, often knowing much more than we do, eager to help you out (as long as you followed all the steps). This is the quicker way to get help!\n\n * The `flutter-audioplayers` tag on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flutter-audioplayers): Feel free to use the [flutter-audioplayers] tag on Stack Overflow to get people from the community to help. This might be a bit more involved than discord but if you make a properly acceptable Stack Overflow question, people will be much more willing to help you with hard problems. Also, you are leaving some documentation for future generations!\n\n### Bugs / Issue Reports\n\nIf you found a bug or issue, please report it to us! If you are unsure if it's a bug or a question, feel free to ask on the discord channel first, or if you truly believe in good faith it's a bug, you can open an issue on GitHub.\n\nBut the first step is, again, to search for an existing issue. Maybe your issue was already reported, and we don't want duplicates. In fact, if it was already reported, the existing issues might have tips and tricks to circumvent the issue until we fix it.\n\nAlso, if it's about a specific feature not being implemented on a specific platform, we already track that on the [Feature Parity Table](feature_parity_table.md). PRs are welcome, but no need to report what we already know. We are progressing under our best effort to fulfill the most requested gaps.\n\nOnce you are certain your bug is legit and brand new, you can create an issue and select the `Bug Report` type. You **must** follow the template provided, read it carefully.\n\n**Note**: read the template and *replace* the sections with your content. Do not *keep* the instructions on the final text of your PR. PRs that contains copied excerpts from the template (other than the titles, etc), will be closed without notice.\n\n### Feature Requests / PRs\n\nUnless your PR is super simple (i.e. typo fixes, documentation improvements, etc), please open a Feature Request issue before opening a PR. You can make it clear in your feature request that you are willing to contribute with a PR, but it's important to have some discussion before starting anything more complicated; we might have better suggestions of how to do things.\n\nIn order to open a Feature Request issue, just select the correct template under issue creation. You **must** follow the guidelines in the template.\n\nOnce your feature got approved to start developing, feel free to send your PRs! However, we have a few important PR rules:\n\n * Start your PR title with a [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) type (feat:, fix: etc).\n * Your build must pass. Please make sure everything is green!\n * Follow guidelines.

[This article](https://denis-korovitskii.medium.com/flutter-demo-audioplayers-on-background-via-audio-service-c95d65c90ae1) showcases how to integrate audioplayers features with and audio_service.\n\nDo not send any PRs or additions regarding notifications/lock screen support, unless it is a generic change on our infrastructure/wiring to support better integrating with `audio_service`.\n\n## Other Out-of-Scope Features\n\nSome features are also out of scope for the `audioplayers` package. The goal  of this library is to provide a unified place to play audio media, be it songs, background musics, sound effects, etc, from different sources, and providing an array of advanced controls and listeners to control it via code.\n\nNon-goals: if the existing solutions proposed below are not good or do not work well with audioplayers, I am happy to collaborate to create an `audioplayers_x` separated package (eg `audioplayers_recorder`).\n\n * interfaces: nothing related to interface building concerns audioplayers; you can use Flutter to build your interfaces;\n * audio recording: recording audio from the microphone into audio files and streams; there is already a package for this called [audio_recorder](https://github.com/ZaraclaJ/audio_recorder).\n * playlist: you can implement playlists as you wish by playing multiple audios or songs in sequence. Doesn't make sense for this package to have any builtin playlist mechanism.\n * music metadata: some file formats include music metadata, like MP3 files that have author, track. This is a library dedicated for playing audio. It is a non-goal to provide this functionality.\n"

          "content": "# Getting Started\n\nThis tutorial should help you get started with the audioplayers library, covering the basics but guiding you all the way through advanced features.\nYou can also play around with our [official example app](https://bluefireteam.github.io/audioplayers/) and [explore the code](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/tree/main/packages/audioplayers/example), that showcases every feature the library has to offer.\n\nIn order to install this package, add the [latest version](pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) of `audioplayers` to your `pubspec.yaml` file.\nThis package uses [the Federated Plugin](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages) guidelines to support multiple platforms, so it should just work on all supported platforms your app is built for without any extra configuration.\nYou do not need to add the `audioplayers_*` packages directly.\n\n## Setup Platforms\n\nFor building and running for certain platforms you need pay attention to additional steps:\n\n* [Linux Setup](packages/audioplayers_linux/README.md#setup-for-linux) (`audioplayers_linux`).\n* [Windows Setup](packages/audioplayers_windows/README.md#setup-for-windows) (`audioplayers_windows`).\n\n## AudioPlayer\n\nAn `AudioPlayer` instance can play a single audio at a time (think of it as a single boombox). To create it, simply call the constructor:\n\n```dart\n  final player = AudioPlayer();\n```\n\nYou can create as many instances as you wish to play multiple audios simultaneously, or just to more easily control separate sources.\n\n## Sources\n\nEach AudioPlayer is created empty and has to be configured with an audio source (and it can only have one; changing it will replace the previous source).\n\nThe source (cf. packages/audioplayers/lib/src/source.dart) is basically what audio you are playing (a song, sound effect, radio stream, etc), and it can have one of 4 types:\n\n1. **UrlSource**: get the audio from a remote URL from the Internet. This can be a direct link to a supported file to be downloaded, or a radio stream.\n1. **DeviceFileSource**: access a file in the user's device, probably selected by a file picker.\n1. **AssetSource**: play an asset bundled with your app, by default within the `assets` directory.\n   To customize the prefix, see [AudioCache](#audiocache).\n1. **BytesSource** (only some platforms): pass in the bytes of your audio directly (read it from anywhere).\n\nIn order to set the source on your player instance, call `setSource` with the appropriate source object:\n\n```dart\n  await player.setSource(AssetSource('sounds/coin.wav'));\n```\n\nAlternatively, call the shortcut method:\n\n```dart\n  await player.setSourceUrl(url); // equivalent to setSource(UrlSource(url));\n```\n\nOr, if you want to set the url and start playing, using the `play` shortcut:\n\n```dart\n  await player.play(DeviceFileSource(localFile)); // will immediately start playing\n```\n\n## Controls\n\nAfter the URL is set, you can use the following methods to control the player:\n\n### resume\n\nStarts playback from current position (by default, from the start).\n\n```dart\n  await player.resume();\n```\n\n### seek\n\nChanges the current position (note: this does not affect the \"playing\" status).\n\n```dart\n  await player.seek(Duration(milliseconds: 1200));\n```\n\n### pause\n\nStops the playback but keeps the current position.\n\n```dart\n  await player.pause();\n```\n\n### stop\n\nStops the playback and also resets the current position.\n\n```dart\n  await player.stop();\n```\n\n### release\n\nEquivalent to calling `stop` and then releasing of any resources associated with this player.\n\nThis means that memory might be de-allocated, etc.\n\nNote that the player is also in a ready-to-use state; if you call `resume` again any necessary resources will be re-fetch.\n\nParticularly on Android, the media player is quite resource-intensive, and this will let it go. Data will be buffered again when needed (if it's a remote file, it will be downloaded again.\n\n### dispose\n\nDisposes the player. It is calling `release` and also closes all open streams. This player instance must not be used anymore!\n\n```dart\n  await player.dispose();\n```\n\n### play\n\nPlay is just a shortcut method that allows you to:\n\n  * set a source\n  * configure some player parameters (volume)\n  * configure audio attributes\n  * resume (start playing immediately)\n\nAll in a single function call. For most simple use cases, it might be the only method you need.\n\n## Player Parameters\n\nYou can also change the following parameters:\n\n### Volume\n\nChanges the audio volume. Defaults to `1.0`. It can go from `0.0` (mute) to `1.0` (max; some platforms allow bigger than 1), varying linearly.\n\n```dart\n  await player.setVolume(0.5);\n```\n\n### Balance\n\nChanges stereo balance. Defaults to `0.0` (both channels). `1.0` - right channel only, `-1.0` - left channel only.\n\n```dart\n  await player.setBalance(1.0); // right channel only\n```\n\n### Playback Rate\n\nChanges the playback rate (i.e. the \"speed\" of playback). Defaults to `1.0` (normal speed). `2.0` would be 2x speed, etc.\n\n```dart\n  await player.setPlaybackRate(0.5); // half speed\n```\n\n### Release Mode\n\nThe release mode is controlling what happens when the playback ends. There are 3 options:\n\n1. `.stop`: just stops the playback but keep all associated resources.\n1. `.release` (default): releases all resources associated with this player, equivalent to calling the `release` method.\n1. `.loop`: starts over after completion, looping over and over again.\n\n```dart\n  await player.setReleaseMode(ReleaseMode.loop);\n```\n\n**Note**: you can control exactly what happens when the playback ends using the `onPlayerComplete` stream (see Streams below).\n\n**Note**: there are caveats when looping audio without gaps. Depending on the file format and platform, when audioplayers uses the native implementation of the \"looping\" feature, there will be gaps between plays, which might not be noticeable for non-continuous SFX but will definitely be noticeable for looping songs. Please check out the Gapless Loop section on our [Troubleshooting Guide](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/blob/main/troubleshooting.md) for more details.\n\n\n### Player Mode\n\nThe Player Mode represents what kind of native SDK is used to playback audio, when multiple options are available (currently only relevant for Android). There are 2 options:\n\n1. `.mediaPlayer` (default): for long media files or streams.\n1. `.lowLatency`: for short audio files, since it reduces the impacts on visuals or UI performance.\n\n**Note**: on low latency mode, these features are NOT available:\n- get duration & duration event\n- get position & position event\n- playback completion event (this means you are responsible for stopping the player)\n- seeking & seek completion event\n\nNormally you want to use `.mediaPlayer` unless you care about performance and your audios are short (i.e. for sound effects in games).\n\n## Logs\n\nYou can globally control the amount of log messages that are emitted by this package:\n\n```dart\n  AudioLogger.logLevel = AudioLogLevel.info;\n```\n\nYou can pick one of 3 options:\n\n1. `.info`: show any log messages, include info/debug messages\n1. `.error` (default): show only error messages\n1. `.none`: show no messages at all (not recommended)\n\n**Note**: before opening any issue, always try changing the log level to `.info` to gather any information that might assist you with solving the problem.\n\n**Note**: despite our best efforts, some native SDK implementations that we use spam a lot of log messages that we currently haven't figured out how to conform to this configuration (specially noticeable on Android). If you would like to contribute with a PR, they are more than welcome!\n\nYou can also listen for [Log events](#Log event).\n\n## Audio Context\n\nAn Audio Context is a (mostly mobile-specific) set of secondary, platform-specific aspects of audio playback, typically related to how the act of playing audio interacts with other features of the device. In most cases, you do not need to change this.\n\nThe Audio Context configuration can be set globally for all players via:\n\n```dart\n  AudioPlayer.global.setAudioContext(AudioContextConfig(/*...*/).build());\n```\n\nTo configure a player specific Audio Context (if desired), use:\n\n```dart\n  player.setAudioContext(AudioContextConfig(/*...*/).build());\n```\n\n**Note:** As the iOS platform can not handle contexts for each player individually, for convenience this would also set the Audio Context globally.\n\nWhile each platform has its own set of configurations, they are somewhat related, and you can create them using a unified interface call [`AudioContextConfig`](https://pub.dev/documentation/audioplayers/latest/audioplayers/AudioContextConfig-class.html).\nIt provides generic abstractions that convey intent, that are then converted to platform specific configurations.\n\nNote that if this process is not perfect, you can create your configuration from scratch by providing exact details for each platform via\n[AudioContextAndroid](https://pub.dev/documentation/audioplayers_platform_interface/latest/audioplayers_platform_interface/AudioContextAndroid-class.html) and \n[AudioContextIOS](https://pub.dev/documentation/audioplayers_platform_interface/latest/audioplayers_platform_interface/AudioContextIOS-class.html).\n\n```dart\n  player.setAudioContext(AudioContext(\n    android: AudioContextAndroid(/*...*/),\n    iOS: AudioContextIOS(/*...*/),\n  ));\n```\n\n## Streams\n\nEach player has a variety of streams that can be used to listen to events, state changes, and other useful information coming from the player.\nAll streams also emit the same native platform errors via the `onError` callback.\n\n#### Duration Event\n\nThis event returns the duration of the file, when it's available (it might take a while because it's being downloaded or buffered).\n\n```dart\n  player.onDurationChanged.listen((Duration d) {\n    print('Max duration: $d');\n    setState(() => duration = d);\n  });\n```\n\n#### Position Event\n\nThis Event updates the current position of the audio. You can use it to make a progress bar, for instance.\n\n```dart\n  player.onPositionChanged.listen((Duration  p) => {\n    print('Current position: $p');\n    setState(() => position = p);\n  });\n```\n\n#### State Event\n\nThis Event returns the current player state. You can use it to show if player playing, or stopped, or paused.\n\n```dart\n  player.onPlayerStateChanged.listen((PlayerState s) => {\n    print('Current player state: $s');\n    setState(() => playerState = s);\n  });\n```\n\n#### Completion Event\n\nThis Event is called when the audio finishes playing; it's used in the loop method, for instance.\n\nIt does not fire when you interrupt the audio with pause or stop.\n\n```dart\n  player.onPlayerComplete.listen((_) {\n    onComplete();\n    setState(() {\n      position = duration;\n    });\n  });\n```\n\n### Log event\n\nThis event returns the log messages from the native platform. \nThe logs are handled by default via `Logger.log()`, and errors via `Logger.error()`, see [Logs](#Logs).\n\n```dart\n  player.onLog.listen(\n    (String message) => Logger.log(message),\n    onError: (Object e, [StackTrace? stackTrace]) => Logger.error(e, stackTrace),\n  );\n```\n\nOr to handle global logs:\n\n```dart\n  AudioPlayer.global.onLog.listen(\n    (String message) => Logger.log(message),\n    onError: (Object e, [StackTrace? stackTrace]) => Logger.error(e, stackTrace),\n  );\n```\n\n### Event Stream\n\nAll mentioned events can also be obtained by a combined event stream.\n\n```dart\n  player.eventStream.listen((AudioEvent event) {\n    print(event.eventType);\n  });\n```\n\nOr to handle global events:\n\n```dart\n  AudioPlayer.global.eventStream.listen((GlobalAudioEvent event) {\n    print(event.eventType);\n  });\n```\n\n## Advanced Concepts\n\n### AudioCache\n\nFlutter does not provide an easy way to play audio on your local assets, but that's where the `AudioCache` class comes into play. \nIt actually copies the asset to a temporary folder in the device, where it is then played as a Local File.\nIt works as a cache because it keeps track of the copied files so that you can replay them without delay.\n\nIf desired, you can change the `AudioCache` per player via the `AudioPlayer().audioCache` property or for all players via `AudioCache.instance`.\n\n#### Local Assets\n\nWhen playing local assets, by default every instance of AudioPlayers uses a [shared global instance of AudioCache](https://pub.dev/documentation/audioplayers/latest/audioplayers/AudioPlayer/audioCache.html), that will have a [default prefix \"/assets\"](https://pub.dev/documentation/audioplayers/latest/audioplayers/AudioCache/prefix.html) configured, as per Flutter conventions.\nHowever, you can easily change that by specifying your own instance of AudioCache with any other (or no) prefix.\n\nDefault behavior, presuming that your audio is stored in `/assets/audio/my-audio.wav`:\n```dart\nfinal player = AudioPlayer();\nawait player.play(AssetSource('audio/my-audio.wav'));\n```\n\nRemove the asset prefix for all players:\n```dart\nAudioCache.instance = AudioCache(prefix: '')\nfinal player = AudioPlayer();\nawait player.play(AssetSource('assets/audio/my-audio.wav'));\n```\n\nSet a different prefix for only one player (e.g. when using assets from another package):\n```dart\nfinal player = AudioPlayer();\nplayer.audioCache = AudioCache(prefix: 'packages/OTHER_PACKAGE/assets/')\nawait player.play(AssetSource('other-package-audio.wav'));\n```\n\n### playerId\n\nBy default, each time you initialize a new instance of AudioPlayer, a unique playerId is generated and assigned to it using the [uuid package](https://pub.dev/packages/uuid). \nThis is used internally to route messages between multiple players, and it allows you to control multiple audios at the same time. \nIf you want to specify the playerId, you can do so when creating the playing:\n\n```dart\n  final player = AudioPlayer(playerId: 'my_unique_playerId');\n```\n\nTwo players with the same id will point to the same media player on the native side.\n\n### PositionUpdater\n\nBy default, the position stream is updated on every new frame. You can change this behavior to e.g. update on a certain\ninterval with the `TimerPositionUpdater` or implement your own `PositionUpdater`:\n\n```dart\n  player.positionUpdater = TimerPositionUpdater(\n    interval: const Duration(milliseconds: 100),\n    getPosition: player.getCurrentPosition,\n  );\n```\n"

          "content": "# Migration Guide\n\n## Migrate from v1 to higher versions\n\nWe recommend following the migration instructions for the breaking changes in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## Migrate from v0 to v1\n\nDespite several major infrastructural changes in v1.0.0, it should be very easy to migrate for end users, as things overall just got simpler.\n\nThis document contains the list of major changes to be aware of.\n\nFirst step is to add the latest version (see [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) for the latest version) to your `pubspec.yaml`:\n\n```yaml\n  dependencies:\n    audioplayers: ^2.0.0\n```\n\n### Federation, simplified platform interface\n\nThis change is here as an introduction but should require no change whatsoever on users side. But we split the package using the official [Federation](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages) process from Flutter. You still only need to import the final package `audioplayers` into your project, but know that that will fetch the relevant implementations for each platform you support as `audioplayers_x` packages.\n\nIn order to support this, we also created a vastly simplified `audioplayers_platform_interface` that is allowing us to add support for other platforms (eg desktop) much easier but removing any shortcuts or duplicated methods and leaving everything that can, to be implemented on the Dart side. Platforms have to deal with only the most basic building blocks they have to implement, and nothing else.\n\n### AudioCache is dead, long live Sources\n\nOne of the main changes was my desire to \"kill\" the AudioCache API due to the vast confusion that it caused with users (despite our best efforts documenting everything).\n\nWe still have the AudioCache class but its APIs are _exclusively_ dedicated to transforming asset files into local files, cache them, and provide the path. It however doesn't normally need be used by end users because the AudioPlayer itself is now capable of playing audio from any Source.\n\nWhat is a Source? It's a sealed class that can be one of:\n\n1. **UrlSource**: get the audio from a remote URL from the Internet\n1. **DeviceFileSource**: access a file in the user's device, probably selected by a file picker\n1. **AssetSource**: play an asset bundled with your app, normally within the `assets` directory\n1. **BytesSource** (only some platforms): pass in the bytes of your audio directly (read it from anywhere).\n\nIf you use **AssetSource**, the AudioPlayer will use its instance of AudioCache (which defaults to the global cache if unchanged) automatically. This unifies all playing APIs under AudioPlayer and entirely removes the AudioCache detail for most users.\n\n### Simplified APIs, one method per task\n\nWe removed multiple overrides and used the concept of Sources to unify methods under AP. Now we have base, separated methods for:\n\n1. `setSource` (taking a Source object; we also provide `setSourceX` as shortcuts)\n1. `setVolume`\n1. `setAudioContext` (though consider using `AudioPlayer.global.setGlobalAudioContext` instead)\n1. `resume` (actually starts playing)\n\nWe still have (other than the handy `setSourceX` methods) one shortcut left: the `play` method. I think it's important to keep that as it might be easiest way for the most simple operation; it does:\n\n1. set the source via a Source object\n1. optionally sets the volume\n1. optionally sets the audio context\n1. optionally sets the position to seek\n1. optionally sets the player mode\n1. resumes (starts playing)\n\nAll in one go. We might decide whether to keep this shortcut or what parameters exactly to have on a next refactor. But for now we are very happy that we no longer have `play` and `playBytes` being essentially clones with different sources on `AudioPlayer` and then `AudioCache` having its own versions + looping versions (it was chaotic before).\n\n### Enum name consolidation, some files were shuffled around\n\nAs per Dart's new best practices, all enums on the Dart side now have lowercase constants.\n\nAlso, some files might have been shuffled around (even between packages), but nothing that your IDE won't be able to quickly sort out.\n\n### AudioContext\n\nFor some people, this will be irrelevant. For others, this might be the biggest change. Basically we collected all the random flags and parameters that were related to audio context/session configuration spread through the codebase on different methods, at different stages, into a single, unified configuration object called AudioContext, that can be set globally or per player (only for Android).\n\nFor more details, check the Audio Context section on the [Getting Started tutorial](getting_started.md), or the [class documentation itself](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/blob/main/packages/audioplayers_platform_interface/lib/api/audio_context_config.dart) (which is very comprehensive).\n"

Please always refer to this before opening an issue.\n\nAlso, you can compare your app with our [example code](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/tree/main/packages/audioplayers/example) or try to reproduce your issue there.\nFor that check out our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/blob/main/contributing.md), if you want to debug the app locally.\n\n## Runtime Issues\n\n### Supported Formats / Encodings\n\nNot all formats are supported by all platforms.\nEssentially `audioplayers` is just centralized interface that communicate with native audio players on each platform.\nWe are not parsing the bytes of your song. Each platform has its own native support.\n**Please do not open issues regarding encoding / audio format compatibility unless it is an AudioPlayers specific issue.**\n\nYou can check a list of supported formats below:\n\n- [Android](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/media-formats.html)\n- [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/MultimediaPG/UsingAudio/UsingAudio.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009767-CH2-SW33)\n- [macOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/SupportedAudioFormatsMacOSX/SupportedAudioFormatsMacOSX.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40003577-CH7-SW1)\n- Web: audio formats supported by the browser you are using ([more details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs))\n- [Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/medfound/supported-media-formats-in-media-foundation)\n- Linux: List of defined [audio types](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugin-development/advanced/media-types.html?gi-language=c#table-of-audio-types) and their according [Plugins](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/plugins_doc.html?gi-language=c)\n\nAlso, there is no guarantee that the file extension matches the audio format. \nA file encoded as Opus (`.ogg`) can easily be renamed to `.mp3`, but that doesn't mean it can be played by the platform's audio player.\nPlease verify that the real encoding / audio format is supported by analyzing the audio file (e.g. with [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/analyze.html)).\n\n### Issues with remote URLs\n\n#### Unsafe HTTP\n\nIt is very common for mobile platforms to forbid non-HTTPS traffic due to its lack of encryption and severe security deficiency. However, there are ways to bypass this protection.\n\nOn iOS and macOS, edit your `.plist` and add:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>\n<dict>\n    <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>\n    <true/>\n</dict>\n```\n\nOn Android, add `android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\"` to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file located in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n<manifest ...>\n    <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.INTERNET\" />\n    <application\n        ...\n        android:usesCleartextTraffic=\"true\"\n        ...\n    >\n        ...\n    </application>\n</manifest>\n```\n\n#### [Web] CORS Policy\n\nTo be able to play your own resources on Web you need to make sure your server has CORS support enabled or [temporarily disable](https://stackoverflow.com/a/74783428/5164462) the security feature in your browser.\n\n#### Audio Streams\n\nOne of the know reasons for streams not playing is that the stream is being gziped by the server, as described [here](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/issues/183).\n\n#### Redirections, Authentication & Local Confirmation\n\nThe remote URL must be accessible and not be a redirect. If it's not an audio file, it does a redirect, it requires some headers, cookies or authentication, it will not work.\nPlease bundle the file on the app or host it somewhere that properly provides the file.\nIf you are having issues with playing audio from an URL, please first download the file and try running it locally.\nIf the issue persists, then open the issue, including the file so we can test. Otherwise, it's an issue with your URL, not audioplayers.\n\n### Issues with local Assets and AudioCache\n\n[Flutter requires](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/assets/assets-and-images) that assets are specified on your `pubspec.yaml` file, under `flutter > assets`; check [this](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/blob/main/packages/audioplayers/example/pubspec.yaml#L29) for an example.\n\n**Note**: Make sure you have set the path to your asset correctly, see the [AudioCache](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/blob/main/getting_started.md#audiocache) concept.\n\n### [iOS] Background Audio\n\nThere is a required configuration to enable audio do be playing on the background; add the following lines to your `info.plist`:\n\n ```\n  <key>UIBackgroundModes</key>\n  <array>\n  \t<string>audio</string>\n  </array>\n```\n\nOr on XCode you can add it as a capability; more details [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_assets_playback_and_editing/creating_a_basic_video_player_ios_and_tvos/enabling_background_audio).\n\n### [iOS, macOS] Urls or Paths without a file extension\n\nAt the moment, the player of iOS and macOS (`AVPlayer` on Darwin) only accepts to play files with an extension (like `.mp3` or `.wav`). Make sure these are available or help us fix the issue #803.\n\n### Gapless Looping\n\nDepending on the file format and platform, when audioplayers uses the native implementation of the \"looping\" feature, there will be gaps between plays, which might not be noticeable for non-continuous SFX but will definitely be noticeable for looping songs.\n\nTODO(luan): break down alternatives here, low latency mode, audio pool, gapless_audioplayer, ocarina, etc.\n\n### [macOS] Outgoing Connections\n\nBy default, macOS apps don't allow outgoing connections; so playing audio files/streams from the internet won't work. To fix this, add the following to the `.entitlements` files for your app:\n\n```xml\n<key>com.apple.security.network.client</key>\n<true/>\n```\n\n## Build Issues\n\n**Warning**: If you are having any sort of build issues, you must read this first.\n\nOur [CI](https://github.com/bluefireteam/audioplayers/blob/master/.github/workflows/build.yml) builds our example app using audioplayers for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and web. So if the build is passing, any build errors (from android/ios sdk, gradle, java, kotlin, cocoa pods, swift, flutter, etc) is not a global issue and likely is something on your setup.\n\nBefore opening an issue, you **must** try these steps:\n\n1. Run this on your project and try again:\n```bash\nflutter clean\nrm -rf build\nrm -rf ~/.pub-cache\n\nflutter pub get\n```\n1. Update xcode, android studio, android sdks, to the latest versions.\n1. If the issue persists, clone the audioplayers repo and run the `example` app on the platform you are having issues. If it works, then there is something wrong with your project, and you can compare it to the `example` app to see what the problem is.\n1. If the problem still persists, and no existing (open or closed) issue on this repo, no stack overflow question or existing discord discussion solves you problem, then you can open an issue. But you must follow the issue template, and refer to the problem on the example app (or start with its code and make only the necessary modifications to trigger the issue), not on your own app that we don't have access (because since step 2 the error must be reproducible on the example app).\n1. Again, only open an issue if you reached step 3 and follow the issue template closely. Build issues that do not follow these steps will be closed without warning.\n\n### Build Requirements\n\nSome platforms need additional requirements to be fulfilled:\n\n* [Linux](packages/audioplayers_linux/README.md#setup-for-linux) (`audioplayers_linux`).\n* [Windows](packages/audioplayers_windows/README.md#setup-for-windows) (`audioplayers_windows`).\n"
