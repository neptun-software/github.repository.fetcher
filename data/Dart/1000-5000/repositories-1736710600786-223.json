Purpose\n\nA primary goal of Liquid Pull To Refresh is to be inclusive to the largest number of contributors, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).\n\nThis code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.\n\nWe invite all those who participate in Liquid Pull To Refresh to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.\n\n## 2. Open Source Citizenship\n\nA supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.\n\nCommunities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.\n\nIf you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.\n\n## 3. Expected Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:\n\n*   Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.\n*   Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.\n*   Attempt collaboration before conflict.\n*   Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.\n*   Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.\n*   Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.\n\n## 4. Unacceptable Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:\n\n*   Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.\n*   Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.\n*   Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.\n*   Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (\"doxing\").\n*   Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.\n*   Inappropriate photography or recording.\n*   Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.\n*   Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.\n*   Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).\n*   Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.\n*   Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.\n\n## 5. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nUnacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.\n\nAnyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.\n\nIf a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).\n\n## 6. Reporting Guidelines\n\nIf you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible. aagarwal9782@gmail.com.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.\n\n## 7. Addressing Grievances\n\nIf you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify Ayush Agarwal with a concise description of your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with our existing governing policies.\n\n\n\n## 8. Scope\n\nWe expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.\n\nThis code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.\n\n## 9.

Depend on it\r\nAdd this to your package's `pubspec.yaml` file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ndependencies:\r\n  liquid_pull_to_refresh: ^3.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 2. Install it\r\n\r\nYou can install packages from the command line:\r\n\r\nwith `pub`:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n$ pub get\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith `Flutter`:\r\n\r\n```css\r\n$ flutter packages get\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Import it\r\n\r\nNow in your `Dart` code, you can use: \r\n\r\n```dart\r\nimport 'package:liquid_pull_to_refresh/liquid_pull_to_refresh.dart';\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nFor adding this custom refresh indicator in your flutter app, you have to simply wrap *ListView*  or *GridView* inside `LiquidPullToRefresh`. Also you have provide the value of `onRefresh` parameter which is a refresh callback. \r\n\r\n**Note -** `LiquidPullToRefresh` can only be used with a vertical scroll view.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```dart\r\nLiquidPullToRefresh(\r\n        key: _refreshIndicatorKey,\t// key if you want to add\r\n        onRefresh: _handleRefresh,\t// refresh callback\r\n        child: ListView(),\t\t// scroll view\r\n      );\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do not want the opacity transition of child then set `showChildOpacityTransition: false`.  Preview regarding the both form of this widget is follows :-\r\n<div align=\"center\">\r\n<table>\r\n<thead>\r\n<tr>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"><code>showChildOpacityTransition: true</code></th>\r\n<th style=\"text-align:center\"><code>showChildOpacityTransition: false</code></th>\r\n</tr>\r\n</thead>\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/aagarwal1012/Liquid-Pull-To-Refresh/blob/master/display/liquid.gif?raw=true\" height = \"500px\"/></td>\r\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://github.com/aagarwal1012/Liquid-Pull-To-Refresh/blob/master/display/liquid_false.gif?raw=true\" height = \"500px\"/></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n### LiquidPullToRefresh Class\r\n\r\n| Dart attribute                        | Datatype        | Description                                                                                            |     Default Value     |\r\n| :------------------------------------ | :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------: |\r\n| child                                 | ScrollView      | The widget below this widget in the tree.                                                              |       @required       |\r\n| onRefresh                             | RefreshCallback | A function that's called when the refreshing of page takes place.                                      |       @required       |\r\n| height                                | double          | The distance from the child's top or bottom edge to where the box will settle after the spring effect. |         100.0         |\r\n| springAnimationDurationInMilliseconds | int             | Duration in milliseconds of springy effect that occurs when we leave dragging after full drag.         |         1000          |\r\n| borderWidth                           | double          | Border width of progressing circle in Progressing Indicator.                                           |          2.0          |\r\n| showChildOpacityTransition            | bool            | Whether to show child opacity transition or not.                                                       |         true          |\r\n| color                                 | Color           | The progress indicator's foreground color.                                                             | ColorScheme.secondary |\r\n| backgroundColor                       | Color           | The progress indicator's background color.                                                             | ThemeData.canvasColor |\r\n| animSpeedFactor                       | double          | Controls the speed of the animation after refresh.
