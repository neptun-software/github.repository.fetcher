          "content": "## Contribution Guidelines\n\nWe value your participation in this open source project. This page will give you a quick overview of how to get involved.\n\nYou can contribute to the project in any or all of the following ways: \n\n- [Ask a question](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/discussions)\n- [Submit a bug report](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues/new/choose)\n- [Request a new feature](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues/new/choose)\n- [Suggest ways to improve the developer experience of an existing feature](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues/new/choose)\n- Add documentation\n- Add a new feature, resolve an existing issue or add a new test to the project. (Goto [Code Contribution Guidelines](#code-contribution-guidelines)).\n\n### I have not contributed to any open source project before. Will I get any guidance?\n\nIn case you are new to the open source ecosystem, we would be more than happy to guide you through the entire process. Just join our [Discord server](https://bit.ly/heyfoss) and drop a message in the **#foss** channel.\n\n## Code Contribution Guidelines\n\n### Some things to keep in mind before opening a PR\n\n> PRs with precise changes (like adding a new test, resolving a bug/issue, adding a new feature) are always preferred over a single PR with a ton of file changes as they are easier to review and merge.\n\nWe currently do not accept PRs that involve:\n- Code refactoring without any new feature addition/existing issue resolution.\n- Bumping of dependency versions (SDKs, Packages).\n\n### Resolving an existing issue / Adding a requested feature\n\nYou can find all existing issues [here](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues). A good place to start is to take a look at [\"good first issues\"](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22). \n\n**Step 1** - Identify the issue you want to work on.  \n**Step 2** - Comment on the issue so that we can discuss how to approach and solve the problem.  \n**Step 3** - Fork the [`foss42/apidash`](https://github.com/foss42/apidash) repo to your account.  \n**Step 4** - Create a new branch in your fork and name it `add-feature-xyz` or `resolve-issue-xyz`.  \n**Step 5** - Run API Dash locally (More details [here](#how-to-run-api-dash-locally)).  \n**Step 6** - Make code changes in the branch.  \n**Step 7** - Once code changes have been made. Make sure you add the relevant tests in the `test` folder and run tests (More details [here](#how-to-run-tests)).  \n**Step 8** - [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description and add a reference to the issue (`#issue-number`).  \n**Step 9** - Wait for feedback and review. We will closely work with you on the Pull Request.\n\n### Adding a new feature\n\n**Step 1** - Open an [issue](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/issues/new/choose) so that we can discuss on the new feature.  \n**Step 2** - Fork the [`foss42/apidash`](https://github.com/foss42/apidash) repo to your account.  \n**Step 3** - Create a new branch in your fork and name it `add-feature-xyz`.   \n**Step 4** - Run API Dash locally (More details [here](#how-to-run-api-dash-locally)).  \n**Step 5** - Make the necessary code changes required to implement the feature in the branch.  \n**Step 6** - Once the feature is implemented. Make sure you add the relevant tests in the `test` folder and run tests (More details [here](#how-to-run-tests)).  \n**Step 7** - [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description and add a reference to the issue (`#issue-number`).  \n**Step 8** - Wait for feedback and review. We will closely work with you on the Pull Request.\n\n### Adding a new test\n\nYou can contribute by adding missing/new tests for:\n- Widgets (`lib/widgets/`)\n- Models (`lib/models/`)\n- Utilities (`lib/utils/`)\n- Riverpod providers (`lib/providers/`)\n- Code generation (`lib/codegen/`) \n- Services (`lib/services/`).\n\n**Step 1** - Identify the test you want to add or improve.  \n**Step 2** - Fork the [`foss42/apidash`](https://github.com/foss42/apidash) repo to your account.  \n**Step 3** - Create a new branch in your fork and name it `add-test-xyz`.  \n**Step 4** - Add the test to an existing test file or create a new test file in the `test` folder.  \n**Step 5** - Run the tests locally (More details [here](#how-to-run-tests)).  \n**Step 6** - [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with a clear title and description of the tests you are adding.  \n**Step 7** - Wait for feedback and review. We will closely work with you on the Pull Request.\n\n## General Instructions \n\n### What is the supported Flutter/Dart version?\n\nThis project supports the latest Dart 3 & Flutter version. If you are using older Flutter version that does not support Dart 3, you might get errors. \n\nIn case you are setting up Flutter for the first time, just go ahead and download the latest (Stable) SDK from the [Flutter SDK Archive](https://docs.flutter.dev/release/archive). Then proceed with the Flutter installation.\n\nIn case you have already setup Flutter, make sure to switch to `stable` branch and upgrade it.\n\n### How to run API Dash locally?\n\nCheck out [here](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/blob/main/doc/dev_guide/setup_run.md)\n\n### How to run tests?\n\nCheck out [here](https://github.com/foss42/apidash/blob/main/doc/dev_guide/testing.md)\n\n### How to add a new package to pubspec.yaml?\n\nInstead of copy pasting from pub.dev, it is recommended that you use `flutter pub add package_name` to add a new package to `pubspec.yaml`. You can read more [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/packages-and-plugins/using-packages#adding-a-package-dependency-to-an-app-using-flutter-pub-add).\n"
