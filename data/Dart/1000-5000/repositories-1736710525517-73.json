          "content": "# Code push Notes\n\nJust place to keep running notes about our development of code push for Flutter.\n\n## Server push vs. code push\n\nDynamically changing the application a user experiences (even just to show\ntheir login name or shopping cart balance, etc) is necessary in any modern\nserver-associated application.  This is trivial on the web (where users always\nfetch the latest version of your application from your servers), but not for\ninstalled applications, like we use on mobile phones.\n\nOne approach is sending new configuration data to clients.  This works for\nchanging layouts, showing profile information, etc.  However, it does not work\nfor changing the application logic (fixing bugs, etc).  For the purposes of this\ndoc I'm referring to data-only delivery as \"server push\" and code+data delivery\nas \"code push\".\n\nEvery single large application on mobile phones that I'm aware of uses code push\nin some form.  One reason for this is update frequency.  It is not uncommon for\na mobile application to have a new release every week or two, yet users\nsometimes lag months (or years) in their app updates.  This means that if an\napplication has a server component which might be tied to a specific version of\nan application, that server component must be able to handle multiple versions\nof the application going back years.  This is a huge burden for developers and\neventually results in a worse end user experience than if the an application\nrequired less developer effort to maintain.\n\n## Code push approaches\n\nMany approaches one could take:\n1. Compile Release Flutter with DartVM in JIT mode\\\n   Implementation Difficulty: Medium\\\n   Application Performance: Unreliable (due to JIT compiles), but good once warmed up.\\\n   Platform Restrictions: Some restrict executing dynamically compiled code (either technically or by store agreement)\n1. Replace libapp.so with new libapp.so\\\n   Implementation Difficulty: Simple\\\n   Application Performance: Great (AOT level performance)\\\n   Platform Restrictions: Some restrict loading dynamic libraries (either technically or by store agreement)\\\n   Developer Experience: OK (need to recompile for each platform)\\\n   Notes:\n    * A naive implementation has large update sizes (can be mitigated)\n1. Flutter Web (JS or WASM) + C++ Engine\\\n   Implementation Difficulty: Hard (no known implementations)\\\n   Application Performance: Unknown, likely good? (JS JIT level performance)\\\n   Platform Restrictions: None known.\\\n   Notes:\n    * No per-platform work for developers.\n    * Possible developer headaches due to Dart -> JS compilation quirks.\n1. Flutter Web (JS or WASM) in a WebView\\\n    Implementation Difficulty: Medium\\\n    Application Performance: Poor (untested)\\\n    Platform Restrictions: None known.\n1. (Custom) Dart Interpreter (for some or all application code)\\\n    Implementation Difficulty: Hard\\\n    Application Performance: Unknown\\\n    Developer Experience: Unknown\\\n    Platform Restrictions: None known.\\\n    Pros:\n     * There have been several implementations of this approach, I'm not aware\n       of any being publicly available/supported at this time.\n     * Defining a boundary between AOT and Interpreter code is very hard.\n\nShorebird takes the approach of building the correct developer experience and\nunderlying infrastructure first, with plans to (likely dynamically) provide\nmultiple code push implementations to customers, depending on their needs and\nthe needs/restrictions of their target platforms.  We will likely implement\nseveral of the above approaches for code push.\n\n## Other known over-the-air update implementations\n\n* https://github.com/microsoft/code-push\n* https://github.com/Tencent/tinker\n* https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/expo-updates\n* https://github.com/hydro-sdk/hydro-sdk\n* https://pub.dev/packages/rfw\n* https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_eval\n* https://github.com/google/omaha\n* http://code.google.com/p/update-engine/\n* https://sparkle-project.org/\n* https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/overview\n* https://hydraulic.software/\n\nDid we forget some?

For now, we recommend using\n`very_good test -r` in the packages directory to run all shorebird tests.\n\n(If you run it in the root, it will find packages in bin/cache/flutter and try\nto run tests there, some of which will fail.)\n\nTo generate a coverage report install `lcov`:\n\n```\nbrew install lcov\n```\n\nThen run tests with the `--coverage` flag:\n\n```\nvery_good test -r --coverage\ngenhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage\n```\n\nYou can view the generated coverage report via:\n\n```\nopen coverage/index.html\n```\n\n### Tracking coverage\n\nThe following command will generate a coverage report for the Dart packages:\n\n```bash\ndart test --coverage=coverage && dart pub global run coverage:format_coverage --lcov --in=coverage --out=coverage/lcov.info --packages=.dart_tool/package_config.json --check-ignore\n```\n\nCoverage reports are uploaded to [Codecov](https://app.codecov.io/gh/shorebirdtech/shorebird).\n\n## License\n\nShorebird projects are licensed for use under either Apache License, Version 2.0\n(LICENSE-APACHE or http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) MIT license\n(LICENSE-MIT or http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) at your option.\n\nSee our license philosophy for more information on why we license files this\nway:\nhttps://handbook.shorebird.dev/engineering/#licensing-philosophy\n"

If you see\n  a different version of your app in App Store Connect than in your Shorebird\n  release, this is likely caused by this change, and you should let us know.\n\n## 1.4.11 (November 14, 2024)\n\n- 🐦 Support for Flutter 3.24.5\n\n## 1.4.10 (November 8, 2024)\n\n- 🛠️ Fix Updater issuer where older patches would be used if state failed to deserialize (https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/2612)\n\n## 1.4.9 (November 4, 2024)\n\n- 📦 Release new Flutter 3.24.4 revision to support `package:shorebird_code_push` rewrite (v2.0.0-dev.1)\n- 🦀 Improved logs in the Shorebird Updater\n- 🧑‍🔧 Fix gradle version detection in `shorebird doctor`\n\n## 1.4.8 (October 29, 2024)\n\n- 📦 Add `shorebird releases get-apk` command\n- 🛠️ Fix error handling when building ipa fails using Xcode 16\n- 🐌 Add warning when windows artifact download is slower than expected\n\n## 1.4.7 (October 28, 2024)\n\n- 🐦 Support for Flutter 3.24.4\n- 🪵 Include gradle tasks when releasing android\n\n## 1.4.6 (October 24, 2024)\n\n- 🍧 Fix issue with `shorebird release ios` where flavored apps would sometimes\n  upload the incorrect binary.\n\n## 1.4.5 (October 23, 2024)\n\n- 🧑‍🔧 Fix bug when patching with `--split-debug-info` on iOS\n  - `shorebird release` and `shorebird patch` now have first party support for `--split-debug-info`\n- 🪵 Do not output error message when `-h` flag is passed\n\n## 1.4.4 (October 22, 2024)\n\n- 📈 Add download progress to patch commands\n\n## 1.4.3 (October 21, 2024)\n\n- 🧑‍⚕️ Fix `shorebird doctor -v` download speed test on Windows\n- 🍎 Enforce minimum Flutter version for `shorebird release ios-framework`\n\n## 1.4.2 (October 18, 2024)\n\n- 📦 Include artifact download speed test in `shorebird doctor -v`\n\n## 1.4.1 (October 15, 2024)\n\n- 🪵 Improve progress logs for artifact uploads\n- 🛜 Add various URL reachability checks to `shorebird doctor`\n- 👨‍🔧 Fix bug which caused unnecessary artifact downloads on windows\n\n## 1.4.0 (October 9, 2024)\n\n- 🏢 Support for organizations!

This bug has been present in\nall versions of Shorebird Flutter for iOS prior to 3.22.2. This bug did not\naffect Android.\n\nAfter careful evaluation we decided this try/catch issue was severe enough that\nwe would be remiss to allow continued use of older versions of Flutter for iOS\nreleases.

We\nbuilt a new mechanism to make patched code build much more similarly to\nunpatched code, thus allowing more code sharing between the \"patch\" and\n\"release\" builds resulting in much faster execution at runtime.\n\nMost patches on iOS should now run at speeds indistinguishable from releases.\nIf the toolchain detects a case where the patch will run slower, it will\nprovide a warning. If you see any of these warnings, please let us know!\n\nNote: `shorebird patch ios` now takes a little longer as it has to do\nmore work when building a patch.\n\nThis is probably our last iOS beta before we declare Shorebird Code Push 1.0.\nWe still have one more slowdown for unpatched builds we need to fix, but we\nexpect that to only take a couple days and be ready for a 1.0 next week.\n\n📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.28.0\n\n## 0.27.3 (March 26, 2024)\n\n🪟 Updates the Azure app used for Microsoft login.\n\n📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.27.3\n\n## 0.27.2 (March 22, 2024)\n\n🐦 Support for Flutter 3.19.4\n\n📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.27.2\n\n## 0.27.1 (March 22, 2024)\n\n🪟 Automatically detects a CI environment when running on an Azure pipeline.\n👀 Fixes a bug in `shorebird preview` where the command could fail if Flutter\nhad not downloaded the necessary dependencies.\n\n📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.27.1\n\n## 0.27.0 (March 21, 2024)\n\n🛑 Removes support for the `--force` flag for release and patch commands (see below)\n🚢 Adds --export-options-plist option to `patch ios` command.\n🤖 Fixes an issue where some Android builds were not able to find release\nartifacts due to a change in the artifact output location (see\nhttps://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/1798).\n\nIf you have previously used the `--force` flag for release or patch commands, now\nis a good time to revisit whether this is necessary. `--force` is _not_ required\nto run Shorebird on CI. If your patches include **known good** native code and/or\nasset changes, you can use `--allow-native-diffs` and/or `--allow-asset-diffs`\nas an argument to the patch command to bypass warnings. We caution against these,\nhowever, as native code or asset changes can cause crashes or other issues in\nyour app.\n\nIf you have any questions about this change, please feel free to reach out!\n\n📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.27.0\n\n## 0.26.7 (March 18, 2024)\n\n🐦 Support for Flutter 3.19.3\n🩹 Fixes an issue where the wrong version of Flutter was being used for some patches\n\n📚 Release notes can be found at https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.26.7\n\n## 0.26.6 (March 14, 2024)\n\n📝 Update iOS hybrid app workflow to use signed xcframeworks to comply with\nApple's privacy requirements.

The full fix required changes to upstream Dart which is why\nwe waited until Flutter 3.19.0 to release this fix.\n\nWe're now returning our focus to finishing 1.0.

prompts (thanks @rkishan516)!\n\nNote: Moving to Dart 3 is breaking. Dart 3 is not able to build apps that run\nin Dart 2.x (e.g. apps you released last week) and vice versa. Once you upgrade\nto Shorebird 0.2.0, you will not be able to push patches to releases made with\nShorebird 0.1.0 or earlier. You will need to make a new release with Shorebird\n0.2.0 to be able to push patches from Shorebird 0.2.0.\n\nWe can add support for multiple Flutter versions in the future:\nhttps://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/472\nLet us know if that's important to you.\n\n📚 Changelog\nhttps://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.2.0\n\n## 0.1.0 (May 6, 2023)\n\nWe've just released v0.1.0 of shorebird 🎉 :shorebird:\n\n✨ Highlights include:\n\n- 🍧 Support for Flavors\n- 🗑️ Support for deleting releases and their artifacts (shorebird releases delete)\n- 📝 Support for listing releases (shorebird releases list)\n- 🧑‍⚕️ Shorebird Doctor can now also apply fixes for some issues (shorebird doctor --fix)\n\n📚 Changelog\nhttps://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.1.0\n\n## 0.0.10\n\nWe've just released Shorebird CLI v0.0.10.\n\nWe discovered a bug in 0.0.9 that caused releases made from 0.0.9 with\na version name including build number (e.g. `1.0.0+1`) to fail to update.\n\n`shorebird release` would include the build number in the version name,\nbut the updater client would not include the build number in its request\nto the server.\n\nThe fix was to make the updater client always also include the build number\nwhich will make \"1.0.0+1\" and \"1.0.0+2\" correctly different versions.\n\nWhat else is new:\n\n- `shorebird run` now supports `-d` to specify a device ID.\n- Fixed `shorebird run` on linux x64 when `web` was enabled for the project.\n- Fixed Windows install script to work even when IE was not installed.\n- Fixed Windows install to add the correct path to the PATH variable.\n\nAs always, you can upgrade with `shorebird upgrade`.\n\nPlease let us know if we can help!\n\nEric\n\n## 0.0.9 - Open Beta\n\nWelcome to 0.0.9, big changes ahead!\n\nIf you're already using Shorebird, you can upgrade to the latest version\nwith `shorebird upgrade`.\n\nIt no longer requires an invite to use Shorebird. You can create and account\nand subscribe to the Open Beta directly from the command line. Instructions\nare available at our new docs site: https://docs.shorebird.dev/\n\nWhat's new:\n\n- New site: https://shorebird.dev/ and docs site: https://docs.shorebird.dev/\n- Windows support! https://docs.shorebird.dev now has instructions on how\n  to install Shorebird on Windows.\n- Updates no longer block launch. When available, updates are still applied\n  during app launch, but now on a background thread. This means that your\n  development flow to test your patches will involve launching your app\n  letting it update in the background, and then re-launching to see the patch\n  applied. This change was made to improve the experience for users\n  (there is no longer a synchronous network request during app startup) and\n  make apps resilient to unreliable networks during launch.\n\nAs always, please let us know if you see any issues.\n\n## Announcement for 0.0.8\n\nWe've just released Shorebird CLI v0.0.8 🎉\n\nWhat's new:\n\n- Updated to Flutter 3.7.12.\n- Updated Shorebird to use a specific revision of Flutter (rather than\n  \"latest stable in our fork\", making it possible to check out a specific\n  version of Shorebird from git and expect it to be able to build binaries\n  even months in the future).\n- Added (partial) support for Android build numbers.\n- Added `shorebird account create` and `shorebird account subscribe` to\n  automate our onboarding process for new trusted testers.\n- Improved the way we proxy Flutter artifacts (via download.shorebird.dev) to\n  greatly improve our speed of releasing new versions of Shorebird.\n\nLet us know if you see any issues!\n\n## Announcement for 0.0.7\n\nWe've just released Shorebird CLI v0.0.7 🎉\n\nWhat's new:\n\n- Fixed our backend to not error for large app releases.\n- `shorebird build` is now split into two subcommands:\n  - `shorebird build apk` (new)\n  - `shorebird build appbundle` (previously `shorebird build`)\n\nChangelog: https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/releases/tag/v0.0.7\n\n## Announcement for 0.0.6\n\nWe're happy to announce Shorebird 0.0.6!\n\nShorebird should be ready for production apps < 10k users.\n\nYou should be able to get test latest via `shorebird upgrade`\n\nWhat's new:\n\n- Fixed updates to apply when app installed with apk splits (as the Play\n  Store does by default). This was our last known production blocking issue.\n- `shorebird subscription cancel` now is able to cancel your monthly\n  Shorebird subscription. Your Shorebird account will keep working until\n  the end of your billing period. After expiration, your apps will continue\n  to function normally, just will no longer pull updates from Shorebird.\n- `shorebird cache clean` (Thanks @TypicalEgg!) will now clear Shorebird\n  caches.\n- Install script now pulls down artifacts as part of install.\n- Continued improvements to our account handling in preparation for supporting\n  self-sign-up.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- Shorebird is still using Flutter 3.7.10. We will update to 3.7.11 right\n  after this release:\n  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/305\n- Shorebird does not yet support Android versionCode, only versionName.\n  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/291\n\nPlease try shorebird in production and let us know how we can help!\n\nEric\n\n## Announcement for 0.0.5\n\nWe're happy to announce Shorebird 0.0.5!\n\nTL;DR: Shorebird should be ready for use in production for apps < 10k users.\n\nYou should be able to get the latest via `shorebird upgrade`.\n\nWhat's new:\n\n- Updates should now apply consistently (previously sometimes failed).\n  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/235. This was our\n  last-known production-blocking issue.\n- `shorebird doctor` and other commands now are a bit more robust in\n  their checks.\n- We did a ton of backend work (which shouldn't be visible), mostly\n  in terms of testing to make sure we're ready for production. We also\n  integrated our backend with Stripe (to make subscription management\n  possible).\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- Shorebird is still using Flutter 3.7.10. We will update to 3.7.11\n  in the next couple days. We've done the previous Flutter updates\n  manually, but we're working on automating updates so that Shorebird\n  can track Flutter versions as soon as minutes after they are released.\n  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/236\n\nYou can see what we're tracking for 0.0.6 here:\nhttps://github.com/orgs/shorebirdtech/projects/6/views/1\n\nWe've also wired up Stripe integration on the backend and will have some\nsubscription management (including ability to cancel) in our next release.\n\nWe expect you all will have requests as you try Shorebird in production\nplease don't hesitate to let us know! We're standing by to fix/add what\nyou need to help you be successful.\n\nPlease try shorebird in production and let us know how we can help!\n\nEric\n\n## Announcement for 0.0.4\n\nI'm happy to announce shorebird 0.0.4!\n\nThis one's a big one. Unfortunately it's also breaking.\n\nYou will both need to re-install shorebird and re-login to shorebird:\n\n```bash\nrm -rf ~/.shorebird\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shorebirdtech/install/main/install.sh -sSf | sh\n```\n\nThen you'll want to `shorebird login` and follow the prompts to authenticate\nwith a Google account.\n\nWe believe we've updated our database to mark all trusted testers as paid\naccounts after the auth migration, but if you see any issues, please let us\nknow, and we'll be happy to fix your account right away.\n\nWhat's new:\n\n- `shorebird` supports Android 32-bit and 64-bit devices!\n- `shorebird` works on Linux and Mac-Intel hosts!\n- `shorebird login` uses Google OAuth instead of API keys.\n- `shorebird doctor` does some basic validation.\n- `shorebird account` shows your login status.\n- Updated to Flutter 3.7.10.\n- We also automated our builds of the Shorebird engine.\n  While that won't affect your usage, it did make this release\n  possible and will allow us to keep up to date with Flutter more easily as\n  well as removing a source of human error in our processes.\n\nAs part of adding support for Android arm32 devices as well as Linux and\nMac-Intel hosts, we've changed how `shorebird` uses Flutter. Previously it used\nthe Flutter SDK already installed on your machine. Now it brings its own copy\nof `flutter`. This is due to the fact that our previous method of replacing the\nFlutter engine binaries on Android went in through a (hacky) development-only\npath, which only supported only a single architecture at a time (hence us\npreviously limiting `shorebird` only 64-bit Android devices).\n\nNow we use a fork of Flutter. The only change in our fork is the engine version\nit tries to fetch. When `shorebird` runs our forked `flutter`, we also tell it\nto fetch its engine artifacts from our server (download.shorebird.dev) instead\nof Google's (download.flutter.io). download.shorebird.dev knows how to replace\na few Android artifacts with Shorebird enabled ones and proxy all other requests\nto Google's servers. This is how we now support all platforms Flutter does\nsince it's using the same host binaries as an unmodified Flutter SDK.\n\nhttps://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/blob/main/FORKING_FLUTTER.md has more\ninformation on how we forked Flutter if you're curious.\n\nKnown issues:\n\n- We have had reports of patches sometimes failing to apply. We expect to have\n  a fix for this early next week.\n  https://github.com/shorebirdtech/shorebird/issues/235\n- Shorebird itself should work on Windows, but we haven't updated our installer\n  script to support it yet. https://github.com/shorebirdtech/install/issues/10\n\nPlease try out the new platforms and new auth flow and let us know what you\nthink.\n"
