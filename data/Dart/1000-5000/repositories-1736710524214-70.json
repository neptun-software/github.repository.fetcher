          "content": "# 问题列表与解决方案\n\n### 1.插件版本问题\n一般遇到这样的错误就可能是flutter版本与当前插件版本不适配，需要更改`pubspec.yaml`内的指定插件的版本，比如这里的插件是`extended_text`，\n实际所使用的版本号是`7.0.0`。\n\n```\n../../../.pub-cache/hosted/pub.flutter-io.cn/extended_text-7.0.0/lib/src/selection/extended_text_selection.dart:135:7: Error: The non-abstract class 'ExtendedTextSelectionState' is missing implementations for these members:\n- TextSelectionDelegate.copySelection\n- TextSelectionDelegate.cutSelection\n- TextSelectionDelegate.pasteText\n- TextSelectionDelegate.selectAll\n  Try to either\n- provide an implementation,\n- inherit an implementation from a superclass or mixin,\n- mark the class as abstract, or\n- provide a 'noSuchMethod' implementation.\n\nclass ExtendedTextSelectionState extends State<ExtendedTextSelection>\n```\n\n- 解决方案1：修改yaml内的插件版本：\n以下yaml内显示的版本列表，假如我们的flutter版本是`1.20`，那么我们就注释`extended_text: ^7.0.0`,取消注释`extended_text: 4.0.0`。\n```yaml\n#文本扩展显示\n#  extended_text: 1.0.1  #1.17版本Flutter用这个\n#  extended_text: 4.0.0 #1.20版本Flutter用这个\n#  extended_text: 4.0.1 #1.22.5版本Flutter用这个\n#  extended_text: ^6.0.5 #Flutter2用这个,,其他可注释\nextended_text: ^7.0.0 #flutter2.5用这个,,其他可注释\n```\n- 解决方案2：假如我们是最新flutter，yaml文件无我们想要的版本：\n这个时候我们就可以去`https://pub.flutter-io.cn/`搜索,查看版本列表，我搜索到的是`https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages/extended_text/versions`，\n  这个时候直接使用上面的与flutter版本发布时间贴近的插件版本，或者直接使用最新。\n  \n比如我的flutter版本是2.10.4\n```\n[✓] Flutter (Channel unknown, 2.10.4, on macOS 12.2.1 21D62 darwin-x64, locale\n    en-CN)\n    • Flutter version 2.10.4 at /opt/fvm/versions/2.10.4\n    • Upstream repository unknown\n    • Framework revision c860cba910 (9 weeks ago), 2022-03-25 00:23:12 -0500\n    • Engine revision 57d3bac3dd\n    • Dart version 2.16.2\n    • DevTools version 2.9.2\n    • Pub download mirror https://pub.flutter-io.cn\n    • Flutter download mirror https://storage.flutter-io.cn\n```\n我就可以把`extended_text: ^7.0.0`注释，新增一条`extended_text: ^9.0.0`\n\n\n### 2.yaml获取依赖版本错误\n```\n/opt/fvm/versions/2.10.4/bin/flutter --no-color pub get\nRunning \"flutter pub get\" in wechat_flutter...                  \nThe current Dart SDK version is 2.16.2.\n\nBecause extended_text >=9.1.0 requires SDK version >=2.17.0-0 <3.0.0 and extended_text >=9.0.0 <9.1.0 depends on extended_text_library ^9.0.0, extended_text >=9.0.0 requires extended_text_library ^9.0.0.\nSo, because wechat_flutter depends on both extended_text ^9.0.0 and extended_text_library ^7.0.0, version solving failed.\npub get failed (1; So, because wechat_flutter depends on both extended_text ^9.0.0 and extended_text_library ^7.0.0, version solving failed.)\nProcess finished with exit code 1\n```\n这个错误是我们改了`extended_text`插件版本，`extended_text >=9.0.0`需要依赖的是`extended_text_library ^9.0.0`，但我们yaml内写的是依赖`extended_text_library: ^7.0.0`。\n\n- 解决方案\n`extended_text_library: ^7.0.0`改为所需要的版本，这里是`extended_text_library ^9.0.0`。\n\n### 3.获取依赖时插件包过期\n```\nRunning \"flutter pub get\" in wechat_flutter...                      3.1s\nThe plugins `dim, flutter_image_compress, flutter_sound, image_picker, open_file, package_info, permission_handler` use a deprecated version of the Android embedding.\nTo avoid unexpected runtime failures, or future build failures, try to see if these plugins support the Android V2 embedding. Otherwise, consider removing them since a future release of Flutter will remove these deprecated APIs.\nIf you are plugin author, take a look at the docs for migrating the plugin to the V2 embedding: https://flutter.dev/go/android-plugin-migration.\nProcess finished with exit code 0\n```\n这个可以忽略不解决，不影响运行。\n\n- 解决方案\n这里以`package_info`为例子。\n  \n我们去`https://pub.flutter-io.cn/`搜索`package_info`插件，发现此插件停产`DISCONTINUED`\n  ![issues_0.png](assets/git/issues_0.png)\n进入插件的详情页面`https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages/package_info`后看到需要使用`package_info_plus`替换插件\n  ![issues_1.png](assets/git/issues_1.png)\n\n这个时候直接在yaml把`package_info: 0.4.0+2`改`package_info_plus: ^1.4.0`，然后dart文件就会有导包错误和使用类错误\n```\nerror: Target of URI doesn't exist: 'package:package_info/package_info.dart'. (uri_does_not_exist at [wechat_flutter] lib/http/api.dart:7)\n```\n```\nerror: Undefined name 'PackageInfo'. (undefined_identifier at [wechat_flutter] lib/http/api.dart:42)\n```\n我们直接把\n```\nimport 'package:package_info/package_info.dart';\n```\n改为\n```\nimport 'package:package_info_plus/package_info_plus.dart';\n```\n即可解决。\n\n\n"
