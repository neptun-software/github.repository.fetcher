I aim at getting familiar with Flutter during development. Devices I use include Android\nphone, Ipad and Windows computer. E-hentai apps I used before have several bugs, and I don't understand source code\nbecause I have no development\nexperience with Android or ios, so I choose JHenTai to become my first Flutter Project.\n\n2022.08.20 After five months of development, JHenTai has gradually become more and more strong, and I have completely\nrefactored some codes for gallery page, reading page, download, etc.\nwhich are written at the beginning stage. I tried my best to extract the commonality between different page and style to\nreduce coupling,\nin order to benefit the development of new features. I would be very grateful if any kind of you could give me some\nadvice on coding style,\ndesign patterns and anything related to Flutter development or participate in the development of JHenTai.\n\n2022.10.29 I have been more familiar with basic Flutter development, and I'll focus on another area from now on.\nSo updates for JHenTai will be less than previous, but I'll still handle bugs or issues in time。\n\n## References & Thanks\n\nLayout and style references:\n\n- [FEhviewer](https://github.com/honjow/FEhViewer) : Mainly\n- [EHPanda](https://github.com/tatsuz0u/EhPanda)\n- [EHViewer](https://gitlab.com/NekoInverter/EhViewer)\n\nTag translation:\n\n- [EhTagTranslation](https://github.com/EhTagTranslation/Database)\n\nTag order optimization:\n\n- [e-hentai-db](https://github.com/ccloli/e-hentai-db)\n- [e-hentai-tag-count](https://github.com/mokurin000/e-hentai-tag-count)\n- [EhSyringe](https://github.com/EhTagTranslation/EhSyringe)\n\nApp translation：\n\n- [andyching168](https://github.com/andyching168) [kenny03211](https://github.com/kenny03211) [NeKoOuO](https://github.com/NeKoOuO) 繁體中文(台灣)\n- [lucas-04](https://github.com/lucas-04) Português brasileiro\n- [qlife1146](https://github.com/qlife1146) 한국어\n\nmush thanks to these projects and people🙇‍\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Mobile Layout\n\n<img width=\"250\" src=\"screenshot/mobile_v2.jpg\"/>\n\n### Tablet Layout\n\n<img width=\"770\" src=\"screenshot/tabletV2.png\"/>\n\n### Desktop Layout\n\n<img width=\"770\" src=\"screenshot/desktop1.png\"/>\n\n### Gallery & Search\n\n<img width=\"250\" style=\"margin-right:10px\" src=\"screenshot/mobile_v2.jpg\"/><img width=\"250\" style=\"margin-right:10px\" src=\"screenshot/search.jpg\"/> \n\n### Gallery Detail\n\n<img width=\"250\" src=\"screenshot/detail.png\" style=\"margin-right:10px\" /><img width=\"250\" src=\"screenshot/archive.jpg\" style=\"margin-right:10px\" />\n\n### Setting & Download\n\n<img width=\"270\" src=\"screenshot/setting_en.jpg\" style=\"margin-right:10px\" /><img width=\"250\" src=\"screenshot/download.jpg\" style=\"margin-right:10px\" />\n\n### Read\n\n<img width=\"250\" src=\"screenshot/read.jpg\" /><img src=\"screenshot/read_double_column.png\" /><img src=\"screenshot/read_continuous_scroll.png\" />\n\n## Main Features\n\n-   [x] Mobile, tablet, desktop layout(3 kinds)\n-   [x] Vertical, horizontal, double column read page layout(4 kinds)\n-   [x] GalleryPage, Popular, Favorite, Watched, History, support multiple gallery list style\n-   [x] search, search suggestion, tap tag to search, file search, jump to a certain page\n-   [x] online reading and download, support restore download task, support synchronize updates after the uploader has\n    uploaded a new version\n-   [x] archive download and automatic unpacking and reading\n-   [x] support loading local images and read\n-   [x] support assign priority to download task manually\n-   [x] support assign group to gallery and archive\n-   [x] favorite, rating, torrent, archive, statistics, share\n-   [x] password login, Cookie login, web login\n-   [x] support EX site(domain fronting optional)\n-   [x] vote for Tag, watch and hidden tags\n-   [x] comment, vote for comment\n-   [x] Fingerprint unlock\n-   [x] Support shortcut keys like 'Tab' and 'Arrow keys' in desktop layout\n\n## Translation\n\n> [languageCode](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/validity/language.xml)\n>\n> [countryCode](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/validity/region.xml)\n\n1.

Modify k-v pairs in method `keys` ,translate values to your language\n\nNow you can submit your PR, I'll do the remaining things. Or you can go on with:\n\n4. Enter `/lib/src/l18n/locale_text.dart ` , add a new k-v pair in method `keys`\n   => `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {your_className}.keys()`\n5. Enter `/lib/src/consts/locale_consts.dart`, add a new k-v pair in\n   property `localeCode2Description`: `{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {languageDescription}` to describe your\n   language.\n\n## About compiling\n\n1. You need to manage your Android signing by yourself,\n   check https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#signing-the-app\n2.

下载Windows_xxx.zip后解压即可。\n\n- 如果你使用了代理服务器，在网络设置里配置代理地址。\n- 如果你使用的是Win11且出现打不开应用的情况， 请尝试右键更改jhentai.exe的属性，以兼容模式启动。\n- 如果Windows Defender报毒，请信任它。\n\nMacOS安装（不维护）： 下载dmg后安装即可。\n\n- 在系统设置-安全性与隐私中信任应用\n- 如果你使用了代理服务器，在网络设置里配置代理地址。\n\nLinux安装（不维护）：根据你的系统选择 Linux-amd64.deb 或 Linux-x86_64.AppImage，下载后安装运行即可。(视需要你可能需要安装webkit2gtk-4.1)\n\n- 如果你使用了代理服务器，在网络设置里配置代理地址。\n\n## 更新\n\n安卓更新： 下载对应自己设置架构的apk文件，直接覆盖安装即可。\n\niOS更新： 下载ipa文件后，使用[AltStore](https://altstore.io)、SideLoadly、爱思助手等任一工具进行自签名覆盖安装。\n\nWindows更新： 直接删除旧的解压出来的文件夹，下载最新的Windows_xxx.zip后解压使用即可。\n\nMacOS更新（不维护）： 直接删除旧包后，下载最新的包使用即可。\n\nLinux更新（不维护）： 直接删除旧包后，下载最新的包使用即可。\n\n## 开发动机\n\n学习flutter的第一个练手项目，用来熟悉flutter的开发流程和模式。\n\n我自己的使用设备包括安卓手机、iPad、Windows主机，之前用的E站其他App Bug较多，没接触过原生开发也改不动源码，就刚好选JHenTai来作为第一个项目。\n\n2022.08.20 经过五个月的开发，现在JHenTai已经初具雏形，也逐渐对初期编写的不成熟的画廊页、阅读页、下载等代码进行了完全的重构，\n尽力增内聚降耦合，方便新功能的开发。如果有同学能够对代码风格、设计模式、代码目录等Flutter开发相关进行指点，或者参与到JHenTai的开发中，我都会十分感谢。\n\n2022.10.29 目前对于Flutter项目的基础开发已经较为熟悉，之后学习的主要精力会转向其他方向，JHenTai进入低频率更新时期，但仍会对bug或issue进行及时处理。\n\n## 借鉴与感谢\n\n布局样式参考:\n\n- [FEhviewer](https://github.com/honjow/FEhViewer) : 主要\n-

[languageCode](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/validity/language.xml)\n>\n> [countryCode](https://github.com/unicode-org/cldr/blob/master/common/validity/region.xml)\n\n1. 复制 `/lib/src/l18n/en_US.dart` 一份并重命名为`{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode}.dart`\n2. 更改新文件的class name(可选)\n3. 修改keys方法返回的所有键值对，将value翻译为你的语言\n\n你可以只做以上步骤然后提交PR，我会补充其他的步骤，或者你自己可以继续：\n\n4. 在 `/lib/src/l18n/locale_text.dart`\n   的keys方法中增加一条键值对`{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {your_className}.keys()`\n5. 在 `/lib/src/consts/locale_consts.dart` 的 `localeCode2Description`\n   属性中增加一条键值对`{your_languageCode}_{your_countryCode} : {languageDescription}`，用于描述你的语言\n\n## 项目编译相关\n\n1. 你需要自己管理安卓签名文件，见https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#signing-the-app\n2. 使用IDEA或者VSCode直接运行即可\n\n## 主要dart依赖\n\n- [get](https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages/get): 依赖管理、状态管理、国际化、NoSQL\n- [dio](https://pub.flutter-io.cn/packages?q=dio): 网络\n-
