These APIs have evolved a lot, so we haven't cut a standard release in a long time. We're still evolving those APIs right now.\n  <br><br>\n  Rest assured, Super Editor and the other projects in this repo are under regular development. We're still here and working hard.\n  <br><br>\n  We're now starting to publish developer releases of Super Editor so that the community can see what we've been working on.\n  <br><br>\n  As a reminder, your project doesn't need to use Pub to use Super Editor. You can depend directly on this GitHub repository to keep up with the latest changes. Please check the section below about our Git branches.\n</p>\n\n<br>\n<hr>\n<br>\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <b>A Note on Branches:</b><br>\nDo you use Flutter's <b>stable</b> branch?

That's because we're not just building an editor. We're building a document editing toolkit. In fact, we're revolutionizing all text layout and editing with Flutter!

This project often makes changes to multiple packages within the mono-repo, which requires that you use the latest main or stable version of every package.\n\nYou can override your dependencies as follows:\n\n```yaml\ndependency_overrides:\n  super_editor:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/superlistapp/super_editor\n      path: super_editor\n      ref: stable # or \"main\"\n  super_editor_markdown:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/superlistapp/super_editor\n      path: super_editor_markdown\n      ref: stable\n  super_text_layout:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/superlistapp/super_editor\n      path: super_text_layout\n      ref: stable\n  attributed_text:\n    git:\n      url: https://github.com/superlistapp/super_editor\n      path: attributed_text\n      ref: stable\n```\n"

          "content": "# How to fund work with the Flutter Bounty Hunters\nMost development on `super_editor` and other [Flutter Bounty Hunter](https://flutterbountyhunters.com/) projects are funded by companies in the Flutter community. This document describes the protocol for identifying funders and budgeting the work.\n\nWork is funded at an hourly rate, on a per-ticket basis.\n\n## Identifying funders\nEach funded ticket is assigned a label for each company that chooses to fund that particular ticket. For example, if Superlist chooses to fund a ticket, the ticket will include a label that says `f:superlist`.\n\nMultiple funders can fund the same ticket. In fact, multiple funders per ticket is the ideal approach.\n\n## Setting a budget\nWork is budgeted by time. A funded ticket will include a label that describes the maximum number of hours that the funders are comfortable funding that ticket. For example, if the funders are willing to fund 10 hours or less of work, the ticket will have the label `maxHours:10`.\n\n## Setting a rate\nFlutter Bounty Hunter work falls into four buckets: junior development, senior development, specialist development, technical leadership. Each level has its own rate. Each ticket is assigned one of those levels with a tag, e.g., `bounty_junior`, `bounty_senior`, `bounty_specialist`, `bounty_lead`.\n"
