0\n                : event.cumulativeBytesLoaded / event.expectedTotalBytes,\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n      backgroundDecoration: widget.backgroundDecoration,\n      pageController: widget.pageController,\n      onPageChanged: onPageChanged,\n    )\n  );\n}\n```\n\nGallery sample in the example app: \n\n![In action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6718144/56463769-e93d1880-63b0-11e9-8586-55827c95b89c.gif)\n\nSee the code [here](https://github.com/bluefireteam/photo_view/blob/master/example/lib/screens/examples/gallery/gallery_example.dart).\n\n\n\n## Usage with controllers\n\nWhen you need to interact with PhotoView's internal state values, `PhotoViewController` and `PhotoViewScaleStateController` are the way to.\n\nControllers, when specified to PhotoView widget, enables the author(you) to listen for state updates through a `Stream` and change those values externally.\n\nRead more about controllers [here](https://pub.dartlang.org/documentation/photo_view/latest/photo_view/PhotoView-class.html#controllers).\n\nIn the example app, we can see what can be achieved with controllers: \n\n![In action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6718144/56464051-3328fd00-63b7-11e9-9c4d-73b04f72a81e.gif)\n\n### More screenshots\n\n\n| **Custom background, <br>small image <br>and custom alignment** | **Limited scale** | **Hero animation** |\n| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n| ![In action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6718144/56464128-ff4ed700-63b8-11e9-802e-a933b3e79ea3.gif) | ![In action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6718144/56464182-23f77e80-63ba-11e9-87a9-4838ef20af7e.gif) | ![In action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6718144/56464202-9700f500-63ba-11e9-9f47-14e8bf441958.gif) |\n| **Part of the screen** | **Custom child** |\n| ![In action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6718144/56464215-d92a3680-63ba-11e9-9c37-d4796e992123.gif) | ![In action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6718144/56464225-1b537800-63bb-11e9-9c5b-ea8632c99969.gif) |\n\n## Support us\n\nYou can support us by becoming a patron on Patreon, any support is much appreciated.\n\n[![Patreon](https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png)](https://www.patreon.com/fireslime)\n\n\n"
