Thanks for your contribution!\n\nPlease read our [code of conduct](code_of_conduct.md), which is based on\n[![Contributor Covenant](https://img.shields.io/badge/Contributor%20Covenant-2.0-4baaaa.svg)](code_of_conduct.md)\n\n\nFor small changes, especially documentation, you can simply use the \"Edit\" button\nto update the Markdown file, and start the\n[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.\nUse the preview tab in GitHub to make sure that it is properly\nformatted before committing. Please use conventional commits and follow the semantic PR format as documented \n[here](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/.github/blob/trunk/atGitHub.md#semantic-prs).\nA pull request will cause integration tests to run automatically, so please review\nthe results of the pipeline and correct any mistakes that are reported.\n\nIf you plan to contribute often or have a larger change to make, it is best to\nsetup an environment for contribution, which is what the rest of these guidelines\ndescribe. The atsign-foundation GitHub organization's conventions and configurations are documented\n[here](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/.github/blob/trunk/atGitHub.md).\n\n## Development Environment Setup\n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n   ``` sh\n   # show how to install the tools needed to work with the code here\n   ```\n\n\n### GitHub Repository Clone\n\nTo prepare your dedicated GitHub repository:\n\n1. Fork in GitHub https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_client_sdk\n2. Clone *your forked repository* (e.g., `git clone git@github.com:yourname/at_client_sdk`)\n3. Set your remotes as follows:\n\n   ```sh\n   cd at_client_sdk\n   git remote add upstream git@github.com:atsign-foundation/at_client_sdk.git\n   git remote set-url upstream --push DISABLED\n   ```\n\n   Running `git remote -v` should give something similar to:\n\n   ```text\n   origin  git@github.com:yourname/at_client_sdk.git (fetch)\n   origin  git@github.com:yourname/at_client_sdk.git (push)\n   upstream        git@github.com:atsign-foundation/at_client_sdk.git (fetch)\n   upstream        DISABLED (push)\n   ```\n\n   The use of `upstream --push DISABLED` is to prevent those\n   with `write` access to the main repository from accidentally pushing changes\n   directly.\n   \n### Development Process\n\n1. Fetch latest changes from main repository:\n\n   ```sh\n   git fetch upstream\n   ```\n\n1. Reset your fork's `trunk` branch to exactly match upstream `trunk`:\n\n   ```sh\n   git checkout trunk\n   git reset --hard upstream/trunk\n   git push --force\n   ```\n\n   **IMPORTANT**: Do this only once, when you start working on new feature as\n   the commands above will completely overwrite any local changes in `trunk` content.\n1. Edit, edit, edit, and commit your changes to Git:\n\n   ```sh\n   # edit, edit, edit\n   git add *\n   git commit -m 'A useful commit message'\n   git push\n   ```\n\n1. How to run tests:\n\n   ``` sh\n   # explain tests here\n   ```\n\n1. Open a new Pull Request to the main repository using your `trunk` branch"
