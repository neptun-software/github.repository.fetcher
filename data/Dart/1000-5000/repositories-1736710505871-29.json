We only ask a few things:\n\n  - Ensure your code contains no analyzer errors, e.g.\n    - Code is strong-mode compliant\n    - Code is free of lint errors\n  - Format your code with `dart format`\n  - Write tests for all new code paths, consider using the [Stream Matchers](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/test#stream-matchers) available from the test package.\n  - Write helpful documentation\n  - If you would like to make a bigger / fundamental change to the codebase, please file a lightweight example PR / issue, or contact us in [Gitter](https://gitter.im/ReactiveX/rxdart) so we can discuss the issue.\n\n## Advice when adding a new Stream\n\n  - Extend from `Stream`\n  - Add the new `Stream` to the exported `rx_streams` library\n  - If the Stream is not a broadcast stream, ensure it properly enforces the single-subscription contract\n  - Ensure the stream closes properly\n  - Add new tests to `tests/rxdart_test.dart`\n\n## Advice when adding a new operator\n\n  - Extend from the `StreamTransformer` class so it can be used independently\n  - Use the `StreamTransformer` in an `extension` method\n  - Add the new `StreamTransformer` to the exported `rx_transformers` library\n  - Ensure the `StreamTransformer` can be re-used\n  - Add new tests to `tests/rxdart_test.dart`\n"
