          "content": "# Contributing\n\nThanks for taking the time to contribute to drift!\n\n## Reporting issues\n\nFeel free to post any questions, bug reports or feature requests by creating an issue.\nIn any case, taking the time to provide some context on\n- what you were trying to do\n- what you would have expected to happen\n- what actually happened\n\nmost certainly helps to resolve the issue quickly.\n\n## Contributing code\nAll kinds of pull requests are absolutely appreciated! Before working on bigger changes, it\ncan be helpful to create an issue describing your plans to help coordination.\n\nWhen working on drift, its recommended to fork the `develop` branch and also target that\nbranch for PRs. When possible, we only use the `latest_release` branch to reflect the state\nthat's been released to pub.\n\nIf you have any question about drift internals that you feel are not explained well enough,\nyou're most welcome to create an issue or [chat via gitter](https://gitter.im/moor-dart/community).\n\n## Project structure\nThe project is divided into multiple modules:\n\n- `drift/`: Contains common APIs that will run on all platforms.\n  - `backends`: Common helper classes to make implementing backends easier. The idea is that a\n  backend only needs to know how to run prepared statements. This lets us port the library to\n  different database libraries without much trouble.\n  - `web.dart`: Experimental web implementation, built with `sql.js`.\n  - `native.dart`: FFI-based implementation around the `sqlite3` package.\n  - This is the biggest package, see the concepts section below on how drift works and what it\n    contains.\n- `moor_flutter/`: Contains a Flutter implementation for the database.\n- `drift_dev/`: Creates table, database and dao classes from the table structure and\n   compiled queries.\n- `sqlparser/`: Contains an SQL parser and analyzer that is mostly independent of drift,\n  but used by the generator for compiled custom queries.\n\n## Concepts\nFor each user-defined class that inherits from `Table` and appears in a `@UseMoor` or `@UseDao` annotation,\nwe generate three classes:\n\n1. A class that inherits from `TableInfo` (we call this the \"table class\"). It contains a structural representation\n   of the table, which includes columns (including name, type, constraints...), the primary key and so on. The idea is\n   that, if we have a `TableInfo` instance, we can create all kinds of SQL statements.\n2. A class to represent a fully loaded row of a table. We call this a \"data class\" and it inherits from `DataClass`.\n3. A class to represent partial data (e.g. for inserts or updates, where not all columns are set). This class was\n   introduced in moor 1.5 and is called a \"companion\".\n\nThis approach lets us write a higher-level api that uses the generated `TableInfo` classes to know what columns to\nwrite. For instance, the `Migrator` can write `CREATE TABLE` statements from these classes, an `UpdateStatement` will\nwrite `UPDATE` statements and so on. To write the query, we construct a `GenerationContext`, which contains a string\nbuffer to write the query, keeps track of the introduced variables and so on. The idea is that everything that can\nappear anywhere in an SQL statement inherits from `Component` (for instance, `Query`, `Expression`, `Variable`, `Where`,\n`OrderBy`). We can then recursively create the query by calling `Component.writeInto` for all subparts of a component.\nThis query is then sent to a `QueryExecutor`, which is responsible for executing it and returning its result. The\n`QueryExecutor` is the only part that is platform specific, everything else is pure Dart that doesn't import any\nrestricted libraries.\n\n### Important classes\nA `DatabaseConnectionUser` is the central piece of a drift database instance. It contains an `SqlTypeSystem` (responsible\nfor mapping simple Dart objects from and to SQL), the `QueryExecutor` discussed above and a `StreamQueryStore`\n(responsible for keeping active queries and re-running them when a table updates). It is also the super class of\n`GeneratedDatabase` and `DatabaseAccessor`, which are the classes a `@UseMoor` and `@UseDao` class inherits from.\nFinally, the `QueryEngine` is a mixin in `DatabaseConnectionUser` that provides the `select`, `update`, `delete` methods\nused to construct common queries.\n\n## Workflows\n\n### Debugging the builder\n\nTo debug the builder, run `pub run build_runner generate-build-script` in the `drift`\nsubdirectory (or any other directory you want to use as an input). This will generate\na `.dart_tool/build/entrypoint/build.dart`. That file can be run and debugged as a\nregular Dart VM app. Be sure to pass something like `build -v` as program arguments\nand use the input package as a working directory.\n\n### Releasing to pub\nMinor changes will be published directly, no special steps are necessary. For major\nupdates that span multiple versions, we should follow these steps\n\n1. Changelogs: The changelog of `drift_dev` should only mention changes to the generator,\n   most changes shuold be in `drift/CHANGELOG.md`. Generator changes should also be copied\n   into that file.\n2. Make sure each package has the correct dependencies: `drift_dev` version `1.x` should depend\n   on `drift` `1.x` as well to ensure users will always `pub get` drift packages that are compatible\n   with each other.\n3. Comment out the `dependency_overrides` section in `drift`, `drift/tool/analyzer_plugin`, `moor_flutter`,\n   `drift_dev` and `sqlparser`. Make sure that `useDebuggingVariant` is false in the\n   analyzer plugin.\n4. Create an annotated tag and a GitHub release for each package published. `drift` and `drift_dev` can be\n   merged into a single GitHub release.\n5. Publish packages in this order to avoid scoring penalties caused by versions not existing:\n   1. `drift`\n   2. `drift_dev`\n   3. (optional) `moor_flutter`\n\nThe `sqlparser` library can be published independently of drift.\n\n### Building the documentation\n\nWe use `build_runner` to build the documentation. The [readme](docs/README.md) contains everything\nyou need to know go get started.\n"

You can filter and order results\nor use joins to run queries on multiple tables. You can even use complex\nSQL features like `WITH` and `WINDOW` clauses.\n- __🔥 Feature rich__: Drift has builtin support for transactions, schema\nmigrations, complex filters and expressions, batched updates and joins. We\neven have a builtin IDE for SQL!\n- __📦 Modular__: Thanks to builtin support for daos and `import`s in SQL files, drift helps you keep your database code simple.\n- __🛡️ Safe__: Drift generates type-safe code based on your tables and queries. If you make a mistake in your queries, drift will find it at compile time and\nprovide helpful and descriptive lints.\n- __⚡ Fast__: Even though drift lets you write powerful queries, it can keep\nup with the performance of key-value stores like shared preferences and Hive. Drift is the only major persistence library with builtin threading support, allowing you to run database code across isolates with zero additional effort.\n- __Reactive__: Turn any SQL query into an auto-updating stream! This includes complex queries across many tables\n- __⚙️ Cross-Platform support__: Drift works on Android, iOS, macOS, Windows, Linux and the web. [This template](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/tree/develop/examples/app) is a Flutter todo app that works on all platforms.\n- __🗡️ Battle tested and production ready__: Drift is stable and well tested with a wide range of unit and integration tests. It powers production Flutter apps.\n\nWith drift, persistence on Flutter is fun!\n\n__To start using drift, read our detailed [docs](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/docs/getting-started/).__\n\nIf you have any questions, feedback or ideas, feel free to [create an\nissue](https://github.com/simolus3/drift/issues/new).

It\n   also contains a fully-featured SQL IDE for the Dart analyzer.\n- `sqlparser`: A SQL parser and static analyzer, written in pure Dart. This package can be used without drift to perform analysis on SQL statements.\nIt's on pub at\n[![sqlparser](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/sqlparser.svg)](https://pub.dev/packages/sqlparser)\n\nWe use [melos](https://melos.invertase.dev/) to manage the different packages\nin this repository.\n\nYou can install it with `dart pub global activate melos`. To activate it in this\nrepository, run `dart pub get` in this directory followed by `melos bootstrap`.\n\n"
