Contributing to a new\nproject can be hard: there's a lot of new code and practices to learn. This\ndocument is intended to get you up and running as quickly as possible. For\nmore information, see the\n[pub tool documentation](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/cmd).\n\nThe first step towards contributing is to contact the pub dev team and let us\nknow what you're working on, so we can be sure not to start working on the same\nthing at the same time. Open an [issue](http://github.com/dart-lang/pub/issues/new)\nletting us know that you're interested in contributing and what you plan on working on.\nThis will also let us give you specific advice about where to start.\n\n## Organization\n\nPub isn't a package, but it's organized like one. It has four top-level\ndirectories:\n\n* `lib/` contains the implementation of pub. Currently, it's all in `lib/src/`,\n  since there are no libraries intended for public consumption.\n\n* `test/` contains the tests for pub.\n\n* `bin/` contains `pub.dart`, the entrypoint script that's run whenever a user\n  types \"pub\" on the command line or runs it in the Dart editor. This is usually\n  run through shell scripts in `sdk/bin` at the root of the Dart repository.\n\nIt's probably easiest to start diving into the codebase by looking at a\nparticular pub command. Each command is encapsulated in files in\n`lib/src/command/`.\n\n## Running pub\n\nTo run pub from the Git repository, run:\n\n    dart bin/pub.dart\n\n## Testing pub\n\nBefore any change is made to pub, all tests should pass. To run a pub test, run:\n\n    dart tool/test.dart test/path/to_test.dart\n\nTo run all tests at once, run:\n\n    dart tool/test.dart\n\nChanges to pub should be accompanied by one or more tests that exercise the new\nfunctionality. When adding a test, the best strategy is to find a similar test\nin `test/` and follow the same patterns.\n\nPub tests come in two basic forms. The first, which is usually used to unit test\nclasses and libraries internal to pub, has many tests in a single file. This is\nused when each test will take a short time to run. For example,\n`test/version_test.dart` contains unit tests for pub's Version class.\n\nThe other form, used by most pub tests, is usually used for integration tests of\nuser-visible pub commands. Each test has a file to itself, which is named after\nthe test description. This is used when tests can take a long time to run to\navoid having the tests time out when running on the build bots. For example,\n`tests/get/hosted/get_transitive_test.dart` tests the resolution of transitive\nhosted dependencies when using `dart pub get`/`flutter pub get`.\n\n## Landing your patch\n\nAll patches to official Dart packages, including to pub, need to undergo code\nreview before they're submitted. The full process for putting up your patch for\nreview is [documented elsewhere][contributing].\n\n[contributing]: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\n"
