(Detailed reports [here](https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_smooth/benchmark))\n\n### Usage\n\nTwo possibilities:\n\n* **Drop-in replacements**: For common scenarios, add 6 characters (\"Smooth\") - `ListView` becomes `SmoothListView`, ``MaterialPageRoute`` becomes `SmoothMaterialPageRoute`.\n\n* **Arbitrarily flexible builder**: For complex cases, use `SmoothBuilder(builder: ...)` and put whatever you want to be smooth inside the `builder`.\n\n## 🚀 What's next\n\nThe documentation - https://fzyzcjy.github.io/flutter_smooth/, with usage, demo, benchmark, insights, and more.\n\n> **Note**\n> Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/fzyzcjy/flutter_smooth/issues) if you have any questions/problems. I usually reply quickly within minutes if not hours, except for sleeping :)\n\n## 💭 Current status\n\nNow I am working on pull requests to Flutter framework and engine (i.e. not directly modifying code in this repository), such that you can use this package with standard stable Flutter.
