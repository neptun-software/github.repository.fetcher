Installation and usage\n\n### Add the package in your `pubspec.yaml`\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  camerawesome: ^2.0.0-dev.1\n  ...\n```\n\n### Platform specific setup\n\n- **iOS**\n\nAdd these on `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:\n\n```xml\n<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Your own description</string>\n\n<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>\n<string>To enable microphone access when recording video</string>\n\n<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>\n<string>To enable GPS location access for Exif data</string>\n```\n\n- **Android**\n\nChange the minimum SDK version to 21 (or higher) in `android/app/build.gradle`:\n\n```\nminSdkVersion 21\n```\n\nIn order to be able to take pictures or record videos, you may need additional\npermissions depending on the Android version and where you want to save them.\nRead more about it in the\n[official documentation](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage).\n\n> `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is not included in the plugin starting with version\n> 1.4.0.\n\nIf you want to record videos with audio, add this permission to your\n`AndroidManifest.xml`:\n\n```xml\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n        package=\"com.example.yourpackage\">\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\" />\n\n  <!-- Other declarations -->\n</manifest>\n```\n\nYou may also want to save location of your pictures in exif metadata. In this\ncase, add below permissions:\n\n```xml\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n  package=\"com.example.yourpackage\">\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" />\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\" />\n\n  <!-- Other declarations -->\n</manifest>\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>⚠️ Overriding Android dependencies</summary>\n\nSome of the dependencies used by CamerAwesome can be overriden if you have a\nconflict. Change these variables to define which version you want to use:\n\n```gradle\nbuildscript {\n  ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'\n  ext {\n    // You can override these variables\n    compileSdkVersion = 33\n    minSdkVersion = 24 // 21 minimum\n    playServicesLocationVersion = \"20.0.0\"\n    exifInterfaceVersion = \"1.3.4\"\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\nOnly change these variables if you are sure of what you are doing.\n\nFor example, setting the Play Services Location version might help you when you\nhave conflicts with other plugins. The below line shows an example of these\nconflicts:\n\n```\njava.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found interface com.google.android.gms.location.ActivityRecognitionClient, but class was expected\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Import the package in your Flutter app\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:camerawesome/camerawesome_plugin.dart';\n```\n\n---\n\n## 👌 Awesome built-in interface\n\nJust use our builder. <br> That's all you need to create a complete camera\nexperience within your app.\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(\n  saveConfig: SaveConfig.photoAndVideo(),\n  onMediaTap: (mediaCapture) {\n    OpenFile.open(mediaCapture.filePath);\n  },\n),\n```\n\n![CamerAwesome default UI](docs/img/base_awesome_ui.jpg)\n\nThis builder can be customized with various settings:\n\n- A theme.\n- Builders for each part of the screen.\n- Initial camera setup.\n- Preview positioning.\n- Additional preview decoration.\n- And much more!\n\nHere is an example:\n\n![Customized UI](docs/img/custom_awesome_ui.jpg)\n\nCheck the\n[full documentation](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/getting_started/awesome-ui)\nto learn more.\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Creating a custom interface\n\nIf the `awesome()` factory is not enough, you can use `custom()` instead.\n\nIt provides a `builder` property that lets you create your own camera\nexperience. <br>\n\nThe camera preview will be visible behind what you will provide to the builder.\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.custom(\n  saveConfig: SaveConfig.photo(),\n  builder: (state, previewSize, previewRect) {\n    // create your interface here\n  },\n)\n```\n\n> See more in\n> [documentation](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/getting_started/custom-ui)\n\n### Working with the custom builder\n\nHere is the definition of our builder method.\n\n```dart\ntypedef CameraLayoutBuilder = Widget Function(CameraState cameraState, PreviewSize previewSize, Rect previewRect);\n```\n\n<br>\nThe only thing you have access to manage the camera is the cameraState.<br>\nDepending on which state is our camera experience you will have access to some different method. <br>\n`previewSize` and `previewRect` might be used to position your UI around or on top of the camera preview.\n<br>\n\n#### How do CamerAwesome states work ?\n\nUsing the state you can do anything you need without having to think about the\ncamera flow<br><br>\n\n- On app start we are in `PreparingCameraState`<br>\n- Then depending on the initialCaptureMode you set you will be\n  `PhotoCameraState` or `VideoCameraState`<br>\n- Starting a video will push a `VideoRecordingCameraState`<br>\n- Stopping the video will push back the `VideoCameraState`<br>\n  <br> Also if you want to use some specific function you can use the when\n  method so you can write like this.<br>\n\n```dart\nstate.when(\n  onPhotoMode: (photoState) => photoState.start(),\n  onVideoMode: (videoState) => videoState.start(),\n  onVideoRecordingMode: (videoState) => videoState.pause(),\n);\n```\n\n> See more in\n> [documentation](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/getting_started/custom-ui)\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n## 🐝 Listen to picture or video event\n\nUsing the onMediaCaptureEvent you can listen to any media capture event and do\nwhatever you want with it.\n\n```dart\nonMediaCaptureEvent: (event) {\n    switch ((event.status, event.isPicture, event.isVideo)) {\n        case (MediaCaptureStatus.capturing, true, false):\n            debugPrint('Capturing picture...');\n        case (MediaCaptureStatus.success, true, false):\n            event.captureRequest.when(\n                single: (single) {\n                debugPrint('Picture saved: ${single.file?.path}');\n                },\n                multiple: (multiple) {\n                multiple.fileBySensor.forEach((key, value) {\n                    debugPrint('multiple image taken: $key ${value?.path}');\n                });\n                },\n            );\n        case (MediaCaptureStatus.failure, true, false):\n            debugPrint('Failed to capture picture: ${event.exception}');\n        case (MediaCaptureStatus.capturing, false, true):\n            debugPrint('Capturing video...');\n        case (MediaCaptureStatus.success, false, true):\n            event.captureRequest.when(\n                single: (single) {\n                    debugPrint('Video saved: ${single.file?.path}');\n                },\n                multiple: (multiple) {\n                    multiple.fileBySensor.forEach((key, value) {\n                        debugPrint('multiple video taken: $key ${value?.path}');\n                    });\n                },\n            );\n        case (MediaCaptureStatus.failure, false, true):\n            debugPrint('Failed to capture video: ${event.exception}');\n        default:\n            debugPrint('Unknown event: $event');\n    }\n},\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🔬 Analysis mode\n\nUse this to achieve:\n\n-

It detects faces and draw their\ncontours.\n\nIt's also possible to use MLKit to read barcodes:\n\n![Barcode scanning](docs/img/barcode_overlay.gif)\n\nCheck `ai_analysis_barcode.dart` and `preview_overlay_example.dart` for examples\nor the\n[documentation](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/ai_with_mlkit/reading_barcodes).\n\n### How to use it\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(\n  saveConfig: SaveConfig.photo(),\n  onImageForAnalysis: analyzeImage,\n  imageAnalysisConfig: AnalysisConfig(\n        // Android specific options\n        androidOptions: const AndroidAnalysisOptions.nv21(\n            // Target width (CameraX will chose the closest resolution to this width)\n            width: 250,\n        ),\n        // Wether to start automatically the analysis (true by default)\n        autoStart: true,\n        // Max frames per second, null for no limit (default)\n        maxFramesPerSecond: 20,\n    ),\n)\n```\n\n> MLkit recommends using nv21 format for Android. <br> bgra8888 is the iOS\n> format For machine learning you don't need full-resolution images (720 or\n> lower should be enough and makes computation easier)\n\nLearn more about the image analysis configuration in the\n[documentation](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/ai_with_mlkit/image_analysis_configuration)\n.\n\nCheck also detailed explanations on how to use MLKit to\n[read barcodes](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/ai_with_mlkit/reading_barcodes)\nand\n[detect faces](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/ai_with_mlkit/detecting_faces).\n\n⚠️ On Android, some devices don't support video recording and image analysis at\nthe same time.\n\n- If they don't, image analysis will be ignored.\n- You can check if a device has this capability by using\n  `CameraCharacteristics .isVideoRecordingAndImageAnalysisSupported(Sensors.back)`.\n\n---\n\n## 🐽 Updating Sensor configuration\n\nThrough state you can access to a `SensorConfig` class.\n\n<br>\n\n| Function               | Comment                                                    |\n| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `setZoom`              | change zoom                                                |\n| `setFlashMode`         | change flash between NONE,ON,AUTO,ALWAYS                   |\n| `setBrightness`        | change brightness level manually (better to let this auto) |\n| `setMirrorFrontCamera` | set mirroring for front camera                             |\n\nAll of these configurations are listenable through a stream so your UI can\nautomatically get updated according to the actual configuration.\n\n<br>\n\n## 🌆 Photo live filters\n\nApply live filters to your pictures using the built-in interface:\n\n![Built-in live filters](docs/img/filters.gif)\n\nYou can also choose to use a specific filter from the start:\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(\n  // other params\n  filter: AwesomeFilter.AddictiveRed,\n  availableFilters: ...\n)\n```\n\nOr set the filter programmatically:\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.custom(\n  builder: (cameraState, previewSize, previewRect) {\n    return cameraState.when(\n      onPreparingCamera: (state) =>\n      const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),\n      onPhotoMode: (state) =>\n          TakePhotoUI(state, onFilterTap: () {\n            state.setFilter(AwesomeFilter.Sierra);\n          }),\n      onVideoMode: (state) => RecordVideoUI(state, recording: false),\n      onVideoRecordingMode: (state) =>\n          RecordVideoUI(state, recording: true),\n    );\n  },\n)\n```\n\nSee all available filters in the\n[documentation](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/widgets/awesome_filters).\n\n> [!TIP] By default the awesome ui setup has a filter list but you can pass an\n> empty list to remove it\n\n## 📷 📷 Concurrent cameras\n\n![Concurrent cameras](docs/img/concurrent_cameras.gif)\n\n> 🚧 Feature in beta 🚧 Any feedback is welcome!\n\nIn order to start using CamerAwesome with multiple cameras simulatenously, you\nneed to define a `SensorConfig` that uses several sensors. You can use the\n`SensorConfig.multiple()` constructor for this:\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(\n    sensorConfig: SensorConfig.multiple(\n        sensors: [\n            Sensor.position(SensorPosition.back),\n            Sensor.position(SensorPosition.front),\n        ],\n        flashMode: FlashMode.auto,\n        aspectRatio: CameraAspectRatios.ratio_16_9,\n    ),\n    // Other params\n)\n```\n\nThis feature is not supported by all devices and even when it is, there are\nlimitations that you must be aware of.\n\nCheck the details in the\n[dedicated documentation](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/getting_started/multicam).\n\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"https://apparence.io\">\n  <img\n    src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/master/docs/img/apparence.png\"\n    width=\"100%\"\n  />\n</a>\n"

启用/禁用前置摄像头镜像 | ✅ | ✅ |\n\n---\n\n## 📖&nbsp; 安装使用\n\n### 在你的 pubspec.yaml 中添加插件\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  camerawesome: ^1.3.0\n  ...\n```\n\n### 平台设置\n\n- **iOS**\n\n在 `ios/Runner/Info.plist` 中添加这些：\n\n```xml\n\n<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>\n<string>Your own description</string>\n\n<key>NSMicrophoneUsageDescription</key>\n<string>To enable microphone access when recording video</string>\n\n<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>\n<string>To enable GPS location access for Exif data</string>\n```\n\n- **Android**\n\n在 `android/app/build.gradle` 中将最低 SDK 版本更改为 21（或更高）：\n\n```\nminSdkVersion 21\n```\n\n为了能够拍照或录制视频，您可能需要额外的权限，具体取决于 Android 版本和您要保存它们的位置。\n在[官方文档](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage)中阅读更多相关信息.\n> `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` 不包含在从 1.4.0 版开始的插件中。\n\n\n如果您想录制附帶音频的视频，请将此权限添加到您的 `AndroidManifest.xml` 中：\n\n```xml\n\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n        package=\"com.example.yourpackage\">\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO\" />\n\n  <!-- Other declarations -->\n</manifest>\n```\n\n您可能还想将图片位置保存在 exif 元数据中。 在这种情况下，添加以下权限：\n\n```xml\n<manifest xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n  package=\"com.example.yourpackage\">\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\" />\n  <uses-permission android:name=\"android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\" />\n\n  <!-- Other declarations -->\n</manifest>\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>⚠️ 覆写 Android 依赖</summary>\n\n如果您有冲突，可以覆盖 CamerAwesome 使用的一些依赖项。\n更改这些变量以定义您要使用的版本：\n\n```gradle\nbuildscript {\n  ext.kotlin_version = '1.7.10'\n  ext {\n    // You can override these variables\n    compileSdkVersion = 33\n    minSdkVersion = 24 // 21 minimum\n    playServicesLocationVersion = \"20.0.0\"\n    exifInterfaceVersion = \"1.3.4\"\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n仅当您确定自己在做什么时才更改这些变量。\n\n例如，当您与其他插件发生冲突时，设置 Play Services Location 版本可能会有所帮助。\n下行显示了这些冲突的示例：\n\n```\njava.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError: Found interface com.google.android.gms.location.ActivityRecognitionClient, but class was expected\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### 在你的 Flutter 应用中导入插件\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:camerawesome/camerawesome_plugin.dart';\n```\n\n---\n\n## 👌 很棒的内置界面\n\n只需使用我们的构建器。 <br>\n这就是在应用中创建完整相机体验所需的全部内容。\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(\n  saveConfig: SaveConfig.image(\n    pathBuilder: _path(),\n  ),\n  onMediaTap: (mediaCapture) {\n    OpenFile.open(mediaCapture.filePath);\n  },\n),\n```\n\n![CamerAwesome default UI](docs/img/base_awesome_ui.jpg)\n\n可以使用各种设置自定义此构建器：\n\n- 一个主题\n- 屏幕每个部分的构建器\n- 初始相机设置\n- 预览定位\n- 额外的预览装饰\n- 和更多！\n\n这是一个例子：\n\n![Customized UI](docs/img/custom_awesome_ui.jpg)\n\n查看 [完整文档](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/getting_started/awesome-ui) 以了解更多信息。\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 创建自定义界面\n\n如果 `awesome()` 工厂不够用，您可以使用 `custom()` 代替。\n\n它提供了一个 `builder` 属性，可让您创建自己的相机体验。 <br>\n\n相机预览将在您提供给构建器的内容后面显示。\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.custom(\n  saveConfig: SaveConfig.image(pathBuilder: _path()),\n  builder: (state, previewSize, previewRect) {\n    // create your interface here\n  },\n)\n```\n\n> 在 [文档](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/getting_started/custom-ui) 中查看更多信息\n\n### 使用自定义构建器\n\n这是我们的构建器方法的定义。\n\n```dart\ntypedef CameraLayoutBuilder = Widget Function(CameraState cameraState, PreviewSize previewSize, Rect previewRect);\n```\n\n<br>\n您唯一有权管理相机的是 cameraState。<br>\n根据我们的相机状态，您可以使用一些不同的方法。 <br>\n`previewSize` 和 `previewRect` 可用于将 UI 放置在相机预览周围或之上。\n<br>\n\n#### CamerAwesome 状态如何工作？\n\n使用状态，可以做任何您需要的事情，而无需考虑相机流程<br>\n- 在应用程序启动时，我们处于 `PreparingCameraState`<br>\n- 然后根据您设置的 initialCaptureMode，您将是 `PhotoCameraState` 或 `VideoCameraState`<br>\n- 启动视频将推送 `VideoRecordingCameraState`<br>\n- 停止视频将推回 `VideoCameraState`<br>\n\n另外，如果你想使用一些特定的功能，你可以这样写。\n\n```dart\nstate.when(\n  onPhotoMode: (photoState) => photoState.start(),\n  onVideoMode: (videoState) => videoState.start(),\n  onVideoRecordingMode: (videoState) => videoState.pause(),\n);\n```\n\n> 在 [文档](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/getting_started/custom-ui) 查看更多信息\n\n<br>\n\n---\n\n## 🔬 分析模式\n\n使用它来实现：\n\n- 二维码扫描。\n- 面部识别。\n- 人工智能对象检测。\n- 实时视频聊天。\n- 还有更多🤩\n\n![Face AI](docs/img/face_ai.gif)\n\n您可以在 `example` 目录中使用 MLKit 示例。\n上面的例子来自 `ai_analysis_faces.dart`。 它检测人脸并绘制他们的轮廓。\n\n也可以使用 MLKit 读取条形码：\n\n![Barcode scanning](docs/img/barcode_overlay.gif)\n\n检查 `ai_analysis_barcode.dart` 和 `preview_overlay_example.dart` 以获取示例或查看 [文档](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/ai_with_mlkit/reading_barcodes)。\n\n### 如何使用它\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(\n  saveConfig: SaveConfig.image(\n    pathBuilder: _path(),\n  ),\n  onImageForAnalysis: analyzeImage,\n  imageAnalysisConfig: AnalysisConfig(\n        // Android specific options\n        androidOptions: const AndroidAnalysisOptions.nv21(\n            // Target width (CameraX will chose the closest resolution to this width)\n            width: 250,\n        ),\n        // Wether to start automatically the analysis (true by default)\n        autoStart: true,\n        // Max frames per second, null for no limit (default)\n        maxFramesPerSecond: 20,\n    ),\n```\n\n> MLkit 推荐安卓使用 nv21 格式。 <br>\n> bgra8888 是 iOS 格式\n> 对于机器学习，您不需要全分辨率图像（720 或更低的图像就足够了，并且使计算更容易）\n\n在 [文档](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/ai_with_mlkit/image_analysis_configuration) 中了解有关图像分析配置的更多信息.\n\n另请查看有关如何使用 MLKit [读取条形码](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/ai_with_mlkit/reading_barcodes) 和 [检测人脸](https://docs.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/ai_with_mlkit/detecting_faces) 的详细说明.\n\n⚠️ 在Android 上，部分设备不支持同时进行视频录制和图像分析。\n\n- 如果他们不这样做，图像分析将被忽略。\n- 您可以使用 `CameraCharacteristics.isVideoRecordingAndImageAnalysisSupported(Sensors.back)` 检查设备是否具有此功能。\n\n---\n\n## 🐽 更新传感器配置\n\n通过状态，您可以访问 `SensorConfig` 类。\n\n\n| 函式 | 描述 |\n| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |\n| setZoom | 改变缩放 |\n| setFlashMode | 在 NONE、ON、AUTO、ALWAYS 之间更改闪光灯 |\n| setBrightness | 手动更改亮度级别（最好让这个自动） |\n| setMirrorFrontCamera | 为前置摄像头设置镜像 |\n\n所有这些配置都可以通过流进行监听，因此您的 UI 可以根据实际配置自动更新.\n\n<br>\n\n## 🌆 照片实时滤镜\n\n使用内置界面将实时滤镜应用于您的图片：\n\n![Built-in live filters](docs/img/filters.gif)\n\n您还可以选择从一开始就使用特定的过滤器：\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.awesome(\n  // other params\n  filter: AwesomeFilter.AddictiveRed,\n)\n```\n\n或者以编程方式设置过滤器：\n\n```dart\nCameraAwesomeBuilder.custom(\n  builder: (cameraState, previewSize, previewRect) {\n    return cameraState.when(\n      onPreparingCamera: (state) =>\n      const Center(child: CircularProgressIndicator()),\n      onPhotoMode: (state) =>\n          TakePhotoUI(state, onFilterTap: () {\n            state.setFilter(AwesomeFilter.Sierra);\n          }),\n      onVideoMode: (state) => RecordVideoUI(state, recording: false),\n      onVideoRecordingMode: (state) =>\n          RecordVideoUI(state, recording: true),\n    );\n  },\n)\n```\n\n查看 [文档](https://doc.page/Apparence-io/camera_awesome/widgets/awesome_filters) 中的所有可用过滤器.\n\n<br>\n\n<a href=\"https://apparence.io\">\n  <img\n
