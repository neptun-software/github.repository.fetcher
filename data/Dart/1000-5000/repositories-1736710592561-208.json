Such weird behaviour should warn the user that there is no data to extract.\n- Equal structures are not detected yet (Equal classes are going to be created over and over).\n- Properties named with funky names (like \"!breaks\", \"|breaks\", etc) or keyword (like \"this\", \"break\", \"class\", etc) will produce syntax errors.\n- Array of arrays are not supported:\n\n```json\n[[{ \"isThisSupported\": false }]]\n```\n\n```json\n[{ \"thisSupported\": [{ \"cool\": true }] }]\n```\n"
