No more storing sensitive secrets on\nyour mobile phone, leaving your accounts vulnerable to takeovers. With the\nYubiKey and Yubico Authenticator you can raise the bar for security. No\nconnectivity needed!\n\nExperience security the modern way with the Yubico Authenticator.\nVisit https://yubico.com to learn more.\n\n=== Supported platforms\n\n*Supported* - these are platforms we build and test on and commit to supporting.\n\n*Best-effort* - the app is expected to work, but development is supported through community testing and full functionality cannot be guaranteed.\n\n|===\n||Supported|Best-effort\n\n|Windows\n|Windows 10 & above, x64\n|Windows 10 & above, x64\n\n|macOS\n|macOS 11 (Big Sur) & above\n|macOS 10.15 (Catalina)\n\n|Linux\n|Ubuntu 22.04 & above\n|Ubuntu 20.04 (or equivalent)\n\n|Android\n|Android 11 & above\n|Android 5 (Lollipop)\n|===\n\n=== Installation\nDownloads for all supported operating systems are available\nhttps://www.yubico.com/products/yubico-authenticator/[here].\n\n==== Linux\nOn Linux platforms you will need pcscd installed and running to be able to\ncommunicate with a YubiKey over the SmartCard interface. Additionally, you may\nneed to set permissions for your user to access YubiKeys via the HID\ninterfaces. The relevant permissions are described\nhttps://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/Device_Permissions.html[here].\n\nFor some configurations running Wayland, copying an OTP to clipboard only works\nwhen the app has focus. If you are unable to reliably copy to clipboard from\nthe systray icon, you can use a separate binary which take the payload to stdin\nby defining the environment variable `_YA_TRAY_CLIPBOARD`. Note that this must\nbe an absolute path to a binary owned by root:root, and should not be\nworld-writable.\nFor example: `_YA_TRAY_CLIPBOARD=/usr/bin/wl-copy`.\n\nNOTE: Only use a trusted binary, OTPs will be sent to this when copied to clipboard from the systray!\n\n=== Command line interface\nLooking for a command line option?
