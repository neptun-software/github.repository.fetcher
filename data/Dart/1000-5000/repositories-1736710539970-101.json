Extra project assets are in\n`assets` and `fonts`.\n\nAs well, this repo hosts a series of Firebase config files and cloud functions.\n\nThe documentation for Firebase part is inside the `firebase` folder.\n\n\n# Prerequisites & Getting Started\n\n## Client \n\nTo build and run the mobile apps you’ll need to install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and its dependencies. To verify your installation run in the project’s root directory:**‌**\n\n```\n$ flutter doctor\n```\n\nThe app is optimised for Android and iOS phones in portrait mode.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** The project only supports Flutter version 1.10.5, you will have to change your configuration to it.\nWe cannot make sure that other Flutter versions will work.\n\n```\n$ flutter version 1.10.5\n```\n\n**Note:** Additionally you’ll need to setup the backend and add the GoogleService-Info of your Firebase app to your clients as described below.\n\n## Backend (Firebase)\n\nThe backend is build using Firebase’s `node.js` SDK. All files are provided in the `firebase` folder. To deploy the code create an app and install the firebase CLI (See steps 1 & 2 in [Getting started](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/get-started)).\n\n*Note: The following steps assume you’re using Firebases’ free `Spark Plan`. Therefore we’re performing the configuration manually.*\n\n### B1. Setup sign-in method & adding users\n\nAn initial sign-in method needs to be configured.\n\n- Select your project in [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com). \n- Navigate to `Authentication` \n- Select `Sign-in methods` and activate `Email / Password`.\n\n**Adding a user**\n\nCurrently, users need to be added *manually*.  \n\n- In firebase navigate to `Authentication` and select `Users`. \n- Then `Add user`. \n\nPlease copy the `User-UID` of the created user. We’ll need to add this ID to a group in the next step.\n\n*Note: You’ll need to have at least one user configured to use the app.*\n\n### B2. Configure firebase app\n\nNext, you’ll need to configure your firebase app for Flutter as described in [Add Firebase to an App / Flutter](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)\n\n**iOS**\n\n- Enter iOS-Bundle-ID: `de.janoodle.circlesApp.debug`\n- Download and rename `GoogleService-Info.plist` to  `GoogleService-Info-Dev.plist`.\n- Copy file to `ios/Runner/Firebase`.\n\n*NOTE: If you’re building for release you’ll additionally need to add a GoogleService-Info-Prod.plist pointing to your production Firebase app.*\n\n**Android**\n\nFollow the instructions in `android/README.md`.\n\n### B3. Create and setup database\nIn the firebase console select `Database` under `Develop`  and create a Cloud Firestore Database. Setup database in `test mode` if you don't want to care about access permissions now.\n\nAt this point, **you need to run and perform login once** on the App, it will create a user document inside the `users` collection.\n\n**You will see an empty screen. To fix that, continue this setup.** You may need to restart the app after the setup is done.\n\n**Create group collection**\n\n- Select the database you’ve just created.\n- `Create collection` and name it `groups`.\n- Add your first group with the following properties:\n\n| name | type | value |\n|:--|:--|:--|\n| abbreviation | string | TE |\n| color | string | ffffff |\n| members | array | *User-UID we’ve retrieved in **Adding a user*** above |\n| name | string | test |\n\nWe’ve now setup our first test group. In addition to this step, we’ll need to setup a default `Channel` (e.g. something similar to `#general` in Slack).\n\n**Add the new created Group id to the User document**\n\n- Select the User you have now on your database.\n- Add a new field named `joinedGroups` and make it type `Array`\n- Add an entry in this array, with the value equal to the Group document id from Firestore.\n\n**Create channel sub-collection**\n\n- In the `groups` collection select the newly created group.  \n- `Create collection` within the group called `channels`.\n- Add your first channel with the following properties:\n\n| name | type | value |\n|:--|:--|:--|\n| name | string | general |\n| type | string | TOPIC |\n| visibility | string | OPEN |\n\n**Your Firestore database should look like this (with different ids)**\n\n![screenshots](./firestore-1.png)\n![screenshots](./firestore-2.png)\n![screenshots](./firestore-3.png)\n![screenshots](./firestore-4.png)\n\t\n### B4. Deploy firebase functions \n\nNavigate to the `firebase` directory and deploy all functions using:\n\n```\n$ firebase deploy --only functions\n```\n\nSome features of the app can be used without Cloud Functions running, but some others will not work.\nWe recommend you to perform this step to enjoy all features.\n\n### B5. Final steps\n\nLogin with the user you’ve created above.\n\nNext create your first `event` to setup the *calendar collection* in our backend. \n\n**Create an event**\n\n- In the app select the hamburger menu\n- Hit the `+` sign next to `Events`\n- Enter any data you like and hit `Create` \n\nAt the root level of your database you should now see a collection called `calendar` in your firebase console.\n\nNow we’re ready to deploy all other parts of our backend using:\n\n```\n$ firebase deploy\n```\n\n\n# Deployment\n\nThe app is setup to work with a development and production environment. We suggest you create a different Firebase app for each environment. \n\nWhen building for release the app will automatically use the production configuration that you’ve configured in step `B3`.\n\n# External resources\n\n- [Timy Messenger in itsallwidgets.com](https://itsallwidgets.com/timy-messenger)\n- [Building a Messaging App in Flutter — Part I: Project Structure](https://beltran.work/blog/building-a-messaging-app-in-flutter-part-i-project-structure/)\n- [Building a Messaging App in Flutter — Part II: Main Method](https://beltran.work/blog/building-a-messaging-app-in-flutter-part-ii-main-method/)\n- [Building a Messaging App in Flutter — Part III: Redux](https://beltran.work/blog/building-a-messaging-app-in-flutter-part-iii-redux/)\n\n# About\n\nThe concept for Timy was created and developed by [kaalita](https://github.com/kaalita) and [philippmoeser](https://github.com/philippmoeser).\nThe initial version is a MVP messaging app focusing on organising events among groups.\n\nWe hope this project can be a reference or building block for your next flutter app. 🚀\n"
