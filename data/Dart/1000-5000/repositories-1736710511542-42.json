While Aladdin Enterprises respects and supports the philosophy\nof the Open Source Definition, and shares the desire of the GNU project\nto keep licensed software freely redistributable in both source and object\nform, we feel that Open Source licenses unfairly prevent developers of\nuseful software from being compensated proportionately when others profit\nfinancially from their work. This License attempts to ensure that those\nwho receive, redistribute, and contribute to the licensed Program according\nto the Open Source and Free Software philosophies have the right to do\nso, while retaining for the developer(s) of the Program the power to make\nthose who use the Program to enhance the value of commercial products pay\nfor the privilege of doing so.\n\n0. Subject Matter\nThis License applies to the application know as \"KeyDecoder\", \nan application designed to help decoding a machanical key code using a picture. \nThe \"Program\", below, refers to such application. The Program is a copyrighted \nwork whose copyright is held by AT Security SAS, located in Lyon, France (the \"Licensor\"). \n\nA \"work based on the Program\" means either the Program or any derivative\nwork of the Program, as defined in the United States Copyright Act of 1976,\nsuch as a translation or a modification.\n\nBY MODIFYING OR DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAM (OR ANY WORK BASED ON THE\nPROGRAM), YOU INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THIS LICENSE TO DO SO, AND ALL\nITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTING OR MODIFYING THE PROGRAM\nOR WORKS BASED ON IT. NOTHING OTHER THAN THIS LICENSE GRANTS YOU PERMISSION\nTO MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM OR ITS DERIVATIVE WORKS. THESE ACTIONS\nARE PROHIBITED BY LAW. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS,\nDO NOT MODIFY OR DISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM.\n\n1. Licenses.\nLicensor hereby grants you the following rights, provided that you comply\nwith all of the restrictions set forth in this License and provided, further,\nthat you distribute an unmodified copy of this License with the Program:\n\n(a)\nYou may copy and distribute literal (i.e., verbatim) copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it throughout the world, in any medium.\n\n(b)\nYou may modify the Program, create works based on the Program and distribute\ncopies of such throughout the world, in any medium.\n\n\n2. Restrictions.\nThis license is subject to the following restrictions:\n\n(a)\nDistribution of the Program or any work based on the Program by a commercial\norganization to any third party is prohibited if any payment is made in\nconnection with such distribution, whether directly (as in payment for\na copy of the Program) or indirectly (as in payment for some service related\nto the Program, or payment for some product or service that includes a\ncopy of the Program \"without charge\"; these are only examples, and not\nan exhaustive enumeration of prohibited activities). The following methods\nof distribution involving payment shall not in and of themselves be a violation\nof this restriction:\n\n(i)\nPosting the Program on a public access information storage and retrieval\nservice for which a fee is received for retrieving information (such as\nan on-line service), provided that the fee is not content-dependent (i.e.,\nthe fee would be the same for retrieving the same volume of information\nconsisting of random data) and that access to the service and to the Program\nis available independent of any other product or service. An example of\na service that does not fall under this section is an on-line service that\nis operated by a company and that is only available to customers of that\ncompany. (This is not an exhaustive enumeration.)\n\n(ii)\nDistributing the Program on removable computer-readable media, provided\nthat the files containing the Program are reproduced entirely and verbatim\non such media, that all information on such media be redistributable for\nnon-commercial purposes without charge, and that such media are distributed\nby themselves (except for accompanying documentation) independent of any\nother product or service. Examples of such media include CD-ROM, magnetic\ntape, and optical storage media. (This is not intended to be an exhaustive\nlist.) An example of a distribution that does not fall under this section\nis a CD-ROM included in a book or magazine. (This is not an exhaustive\nenumeration.)\n\n(b)\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification of the Program\nare not subject to this License and they are outside its scope. Functional\nuse (running) of the Program is not restricted, and any output produced\nthrough the use of the Program is subject to this license only if its contents\nconstitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made\nby running the Program).\n\n(c)\nYou must meet all of the following conditions with respect to any work\nthat you distribute or publish that in whole or in part contains or is\nderived from the Program or any part thereof (\"the Work\"):\n\n(i)\nIf you have modified the Program, you must cause the Work to carry prominent\nnotices stating that you have modified the Program's files and the date\nof any change. In each source file that you have modified, you must include\na prominent notice that you have modified the file, including your name,\nyour e-mail address (if any), and the date and purpose of the change;\n\n(ii)\nYou must cause the Work to be licensed as a whole and at no charge to all\nthird parties under the terms of this License;\n\n(iii)\nIf the Work normally reads commands interactively when run, you must cause\nit, at each time the Work commences operation, to print or display an announcement\nincluding an appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no\nwarranty (or else, saying that you provide a warranty). Such notice must\nalso state that users may redistribute the Work only under the conditions\nof this License and tell the user how to view the copy of this License\nincluded with the Work. (Exceptions: if the Program is interactive but\nnormally prints or displays such an announcement only at the request of\na user, such as in an \"About box\", the Work is required to print or display\nthe notice only under the same circumstances; if the Program itself is\ninteractive but does not normally print such an announcement, the Work\nis not required to print an announcement.);\n\n(iv)\nYou must accompany the Work with the complete corresponding machine-readable\nsource code, delivered on a medium customarily used for software interchange.\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making\nmodifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means\nall the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface\ndefinition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation\nof the executable code. If you distribute with the Work any component that\nis normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\ncomponents (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which\nthe executable runs, you must also distribute the source code of that component\nif you have it and are allowed to do so;\n\n(v)\nIf you distribute any written or printed material at all with the Work,\nsuch material must include either a written copy of this License, or a\nprominent written indication that the Work is covered by this License and\nwritten instructions for printing and/or displaying the copy of the License\non the distribution medium;\n\n(vi)\nYou may not impose any further restrictions on the recipient's exercise\nof the rights granted herein.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering the equivalent\nability to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent ability\nto copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the\nsource code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source\ncode along with the object code.\n\n3. Reservation of Rights.\nNo rights are granted to the Program except as expressly set forth herein.\nYou may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except\nas expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,\nmodify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically\nterminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received\ncopies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses\nterminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.\n\n4. Other Restrictions.\nIf the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain\ncountries for any reason, Licensor may add an explicit geographical distribution\nlimitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted\nonly in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License\nincorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n5. Limitations.\nTHE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY. THERE IS NO\nWARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT\nLIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A\nPARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD PARTY RIGHTS. THE ENTIRE\nRISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD\nTHE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\nIN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL LICENSOR, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE\nPROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS\nOF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR\nTHIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY\nOF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n6. General.\nThis License is governed by the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., excluding choice of law rules.\n\nIf any part of this License is found to be in conflict with the law, that part shall be interpreted in its broadest meaning consistent with the law, and no other parts of the License shall be affected.\n\nFor United States Government users, the Program is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS. If you are a unit or agency of the United States Government or are acquiring the Program for any such unit or agency, the following apply:\n\nIf the unit or agency is the Department of Defense (\"DOD\"),\nthe Program and its documentation are classified as \"commercial computer\nsoftware\" and \"commercial computer software documentation\" respectively\nand, pursuant to DFAR Section 227.7202, the Government is acquiring the\nProgram and its documentation in accordance with the terms of this License.\nIf the unit or agency is other than DOD, the Program and its documentation\nare classified as \"commercial computer software\" and \"commercial computer\nsoftware documentation\" respectively and, pursuant to FAR Section 12.212,\nthe Government is acquiring the Program and its documentation in accordance\nwith the terms of this License.\n"

If you have unlawful intentions, you're are not allowed to use this application.\nTo limit the risk of illegal use, an ISO sized card is necessary to decode a mechanical key, and the key must be taken off from its keyring.\nWe will provide no help nor assistance to any user that we believe is willing to commit a crime or a felony. \n\n## Educational and Consulting use only.\n\nThis Key Decoding app is meant to be used by Pentesters during their audits, to explain to their clients how easily a criminal can duplicate keys (from picture, by molding, or simply by asking a local locksmith to make a duplicate). Fair use is allowed if used by security enthusiasts, to assess their own security, and discover the difficulty of making keys only using a picture. \nThe authors DO NOT ALLOW any users to sell keys created with the help of this app. Rulebreakers are subject to lawsuit.\n\n## Security advice.\n\nIf you want to protect yourself from having your keys duplicated without your consent (with a picture, or by molding, or more simply by someone asking a locksmith to make a copy), you are invited to apply the same best practices to your keys as you do with your Credit Card or your Password. Just like credit cards and passwords, you must not lend your keys, or leave them unattended.\n\n<p align=\"center\" style=\"font-size:30px\">\n<strong>Have Fun, Stay Legal, Hide your keys.</strong>\n</p>\n\n*****\n\n# Installation\n\n[<img src=\"https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/images/generic/en_badge_web_generic.png\"\n      alt=\"Get it on Google Play\"\n      height=\"70\">](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.keydecoder)\n\n## Build\n\n* To install Flutter, it is recommended to use [fvm](https://fvm.app/), a Flutter Version Management tool. But you can also use the official [Flutter installation guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).\n  * The project is built using Flutter `v3.13.6`\n\n### Android\n\n* Download [OpenCV-Android-SDK v4.3.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/4.3.0/opencv-4.3.0-android-sdk.zip) and extract it to a directory of your choice. (eg. `C:\\SDK\\OpenCV-android-sdk`)\n* Create the `local.properties` file under `android/`, providing the following settings :\n```sdk.dir=<Android SDK path>\nflutter.sdk=<Flutter SDK path>\nflutter.buildMode=release\nflutter.versionName=1.0.0\nflutter.versionCode=1\nopencv.sdk=<OpenCV Android SDK path>\n```\n* Copy the subdirectories in `C:\\...\\OpenCV-android-sdk\\sdk\\native\\libs` to the directory `C:\\...\\keydecoder\\android\\app\\src\\main\\jniLibs`\n* Build the project using `fvm flutter build apk`\n\n### IOS\n\n*IOS is not currently supported*\n\n## Releases\n\nThe most recent builds can be found in the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).\n\n# Usage\n\n## Take Picture\n\nTake a picture of a key, removed from its key ring, and place in the middle of an ISO/CEI 7810 ID-1 sized card (credit card, business card...). \nIt is very important that the card measures exactly 85,60 by 53,98 mm (3 3⁄8 in × 2 1⁄8 in).\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"assets/card_key.png\" width=\"400\">\n</p>\n\n*A well lightened and high res picture will give better results.*\n\n## Cropping\n\nUse the green lines to crop the image to only retain the card.\nYou can zoom to be more precise.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"assets/crop_card.png\" width=\"400\">\n</p>\n\n## Back line\n\nAlign the red line to match the back of the key.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"assets/back_key.png\" width=\"400\">\n</p>\n\n## Shoulder line\n\nAlign the blue line to the shoulder of the key.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"assets/shoulder_key.png\" width=\"400\">\n</p>\n\n## Measurements\n\nNow, you can place points in the middle of each cuts of your key.\nOnce done, you can validate and retrieve your measures on your project's page.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n <img src=\"assets/measure_key.png\" width=\"400\">\n</p>\n\n# FAQ\n\n## What is the purpose of this application?\nThis application is a key decoder tool helping you getting the depths and spaces for a key you own or have legally access to. The decoded data can then be used with the help of a locksmith to obtain a duplicate of the pictured key. \n\n## What is the intended public for using this app?\nThe KeyDecoder app is built for security professionnals such as Pentesters and other security enthusiasts to be able to decode their own keys, or keys of the location they have a legal contract for.\n\n\n## What do you do with my pictures and decoded data?\nNothing. \nWe do not transmit the pictures over the network, we do not retrieve any decoded data.\nEverything the user does with the app, is done locally on his/her phone. As a user, you are responsible for making sure that nobody else gets access to your pictures and decoded data.\n\n\n## Is this app helping criminals to copy my keys without my consent?\nNo. \nIf you make sure to handle your keys with the care they deserve, no criminal will be able to use this application to copy your keys.\nSame as a Password or a Credit Card, a mechanical Key is a sensitive data that you should not share with anybody, and that you should not leave unattended. Otherwise, someone can easily go to a nearby locksmith, or make a molding duplicate in seconds.\nAdditionnaly, the need for an ISO sized card as a dimensionnal reference prevents any decoding using a picture taken \"on the fly\". A criminal could copy your keys with this app only if you let them do it.\n\n****\n\n## LIMITED WARRANTY\nTHE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED TO YOU \"AS IS,\" WITHOUT WARRANTY.
