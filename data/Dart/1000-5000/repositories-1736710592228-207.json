Amplify codifies best practices through programmatic interfaces to help you effortlessly interact with cloud resources.\n\nFirst and foremost Amplify exposes to you WHAT things do and then HOW best to do them. The WHAT is at a functional use case with HOW being an opinionated implementation that you can override with “escape hatches.” This will allow you to have higher velocity and build better applications by focusing less on implementation choices. Secondly, Amplify should be a manifestation of The Rule of Least Power when developing against AWS. This means it encourages architectural and programmatic best practices and the ability to start quickly. This shows by encouraging certain services (API Gateway usage vs. direct DynamoDB interaction) or certain connection patterns (Circuit breaker, retry counts and throttle up/down).\n\nOpinionated implementations: There are many ways to interface with AWS Services. Certain service interactions are favored over others. For instance, if sending and receiving JSON, we would prefer an API Gateway endpoint to other mechanisms. Amplify will programmatically help optimize for cost and performance through library decisions.\n\nDeclarative actions: Amplify will provide you a reference to a generic client object and the ability to perform common actions. “RegisterUser”, “Login”, “SendObject”, “UpdateObject”, “StreamData”. By default you should not need to worry about AWS Service specific API operations like putItem() with a unique hash or even HTTP verbs.\n\nCascading service interactions: Certain actions in a declarative style can have overlapping or ambiguous AWS Service implementations. With an opinionated implementation, we can decide which Services are \"primary\" and which are \"secondary\" depending on what is configured. For instance, sending an image will prefer S3 over API Gateway.\n\nSimple, standard data objects: Sending & receiving data to AWS Services can have many parameters, which tend to show up in the SDKs. These are abstracted and inferred, where possible, with simple JSON that the implementation can reason about. Standard parameters (bucket names, stream names, partition keys, etc.) that are part of the implementation are extracted from a simplified configuration file and dynamically generated/updated in order to further allow focus on state and data types only.\n\n# Our Design\n\nAs more and more modules were introduced to AWS Amplify, it became necessary to modularize the library into smaller pieces so that users could avoid importing unnecessary parts into their app. The goal of this design is to make AWS Amplify modularized and also keep it backward-compatible to avoid breaking changes.\n\nModular import prevents unnecessary code dependencies from being included with the app, and thus decreases the bundle size while enabling added new functionality without the risk of introducing errors related to unused code.\n\nAmplify has established the concepts of categories and plugins. A category is a collection of api calls that are exposed to the client to do things inside that category. For example, in the storage category, generally one wants to upload and download objects from storage so the apis exposed to the client will represent that functionality. Because Amplify is pluggable, a plugin of your choosing will provide the actual implementation behind that api interface. Using the same example of Storage, the plugin we choose might be AWSStoragePlugin which would then implement each api call from the category with a service call or set of service calls to S3, the underlying storage provider of the AWS plugin.\n\n## Semantic versioning\n\nWe follow [semantic versioning](https://dart.dev/tools/pub/versioning#semantic-versions) for our releases.\n\n### Semantic versioning and enumeration cases\n\nWhen Amplify adds a new enumeration entry or sealed class subtype, we will publish a new **minor** version of the library.\n\nApplications that use a `switch` statement to evaluate all members of an enumerated type can add a `default` clause to prevent \nnew cases from causing compile warnings or errors.\n\n# Development Process\n\nOur work is done directly on Github and PR's are sent to the github repo by core team members and contributors. Everyone undergoes the same review process to get their changes into the repo.\n\n## Setting up for local development\n\nThis section should get you running with **Amplify Flutter** and get you familiar with the basics of the codebase.\n\nStart by [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) the main branch of [amplify-flutter](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter) and cloning the repo locally.\n\n```sh\n$ git clone git@github.com:[username]/amplify-flutter.git --recurse-submodules\n$ cd amplify-flutter\n```\n\n> Note: If you already cloned the project and forgot `--recurse-submodules`, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`.\n\n> Note: Make sure to always [sync your fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork) with main branch of amplify-flutter\n\nNext setup Amplify Flutter Repo Tool (aft). This can be installed using the following:\n\n```sh\n$ dart pub global activate -spath packages/aft\n```\n\nThen, from the root of the project, run `aft bootstrap` to link local packages together and install remaining dependencies.\n\n```sh\n$ aft bootstrap\n```\n\n> The bootstrap command creates `pubspec_override.yaml` files in each of the packages, overriding dependencies to use the local version\n> instead of the published one. This allows changes in one package to be instantly available in all others. It also means that commands\n> like `flutter pub get` will continue to work as expected.\n\n> The `aft` command provides useful tooling when developing within this repo. See `aft`'s [README](packages/aft/README.md) for more instructions on how to use `aft`.\n\n#### Packages inside Amplify Flutter\n\n- [amplify_flutter](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/amplify/amplify_flutter)\n- [amplify_auth_cognito](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/auth/amplify_auth_cognito)\n- [amplify_analytics_pinpoint](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/tree/main/packages/analytics/amplify_analytics_pinpoint)\n\n### Platform Setup\n\nSome platforms require additional setup. See below for details.\n\n#### Linux\n\n`libsecret` and `glib` are required for some plugins. They can be installed on Debian based linux distributions such as Ubuntu by running the command below.\n\n```sh\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install libsecret-1-dev libglib2.0-dev\n```\nFor RPM-based Linux distributions such as Fedora, CentOS, or RHEL, you can install `libsecret` and `glib` by running the following command:\n\n```sh\nsudo dnf update && sudo dnf install libsecret-devel glib2-devel\n```\n**VS Code Remote Container**\n\n[VS Code Remote Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) can be used for linux development. `/devcontainer` contains a Dockerfile that will install the required dependencies.\n\n## Steps towards contributions\n\nEach packages/[category] contains the following for testing:\n\n1. `example` folder with a Dart test app for testing that specific category. In order to run these apps, you must include your own `amplifyconfiguration.dart` file in the `lib` folder.\n2. `android/src/test/kotlin/.... Test.kt` file. This is where Android unit tests are written.\n3. `test/ ... test.dart` file. This is where Dart unit tests are written.\n\nThe general organization of the Flutter library is as follows:\n\n1. Each [category] has a corresponding `amplify_[category]_plugin_interface` where its public method set is defined.\n\n2. A given [category] can have multiple plugins corresponding to different AWS services. For example Analytics will have a Pinpoint and Kinesis plugin.\n\n3. The [category] plugins (ie. amplify_auth_cognito, amplify_storage_s3, etc.) is a Dart shell that uses the MethodChannel to communicate with native iOS and Android code which in turn calls the corresponding Amplify Android and Amplify iOS library code.\n\nContributing:\n\n1. To start contributing make a fork of this repo and create a branch where you will make your changes to a particular `packages/[category]`.\n\n2. Write unit tests in android and dart.\n\n3. Update the example app to use your new changes (if applicable) and to build the app on iOS and Android.\n\n4. Run the test suite\n\n5. Submit a PR\n\n# Pull Requests\n\nThis is mostly the same as GitHub's guide on creating a pull request.\n\n_[Skip step 1 to 3 if you have already done this]_\n\n1. Follow the steps in [Setting up for local development above](#setting-up-for-local-development-above)\n2. Within your fork, create a new branch based on the issue (e.g. Issue #123) you're addressing - `git checkout -b \"group-token/short-token-[branch-name]\"` or `git checkout -b \"short-token/[branch-name]\"`\n   - Use grouping tokens at the beginning of the branch names. \\_For e.g, if you are working on changes specific to `amplify-ui-components`, then you could start the branch name as `ui-components/...`\n   - short token\n     - feat\n     - chore\n     - bug\n   - use slashes to separate parts of branch names\n   - Hyphenate well defined branch name\n3. Once your work is committed and you're ready to share, run tests.\n   **Note:** Manually test your changes in a sample app with different edge cases and also test across different native platforms\n4. Then, Push your branch `git push origin -u`\n5. This previous step will give you a URL to view a GitHub page in your browser. Copy-paste this, and complete the workflow in the UI. It will invite you to \"create a PR\" from your newly published branch. Fill out the PR template to submit a PR.\n6. Finally, the Amplify team will review your PR. Add reviewers based on the core member who is tracking the issue with you or code owners.\n   _In the meantime, address any automated check that fail (such as linting, unit tests, etc. in CI)_\n\n# Release\n\nWe follow semantic versioning for our releases.\n\n## Finding contributions to work on\n\nLooking at the existing issues is a great way to find something to contribute on. As our projects, by default, use the default GitHub issue labels (enhancement/bug/duplicate/help wanted/invalid/question/wontfix), looking at any ['help wanted'](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/labels/help%20wanted) or ['good first issue'](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-flutter/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) is a great place to start.\n\nYou could also contribute by reporting bugs, reproduction of bugs with sample code, documentation and test improvements.\n\n## Related Repositories\n\nThe Amplify Framework runs on Android, iOS, and numerous JavaScript-based web platforms.\n\n1. [AWS Amplify for iOS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-ios)\n2. [AWS Amplify for Android](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-android)\n3. [AWS Amplify JS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-js)\n\nAWS Amplify plugins are built on top of the AWS SDKs. AWS SDKs are a\ntoolkit for interacting with AWS backend resources.\n\n1. [AWS SDK for Android](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-android)\n2. [AWS SDK for iOS](https://github.com/aws-amplify/aws-sdk-ios)\n3. [AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js)\n\n## Unit Tests\n\nTo run all the flutter unit tests for all plugins:\n\n```bash\n$ aft run test:unit:flutter\n```\n\nor run all unit tests for a given platform\n\n```bash\n$ aft run test:unit:android\n$ aft run test:unit:ios\n```\n\n## Integration Tests\n\nIn addition to unit tests which mock Amplify API interaction, this repository has integration tests which\ntest functionality with real Amplify back-ends. The integration test script will execute tests in example\napps which have integration tests written (skipping those that don't). It runs on Android and iOS simulators.\n\n**Note:** To run integration tests, you will need prerequisite Amplify resources in the example\napps where the tests run. The process for creating those is noted below. You will also need to install dependencies with `aft bootstrap`.\n\nTo run integration tests for a specific plugin, run:\n\n```bash\n$ aft exec flutter test integration_test --include <plugin-example-app>\n```\n\nFor example, to run the tests for the amplify_auth_cognito plugin, run:\n\n```bash\n$ aft exec flutter test integration_test --include amplify_auth_cognito_example\n```\n\n## Provision Resources For Integration Tests\n\n> Note: The provisioning script uses [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/getting_started.html) and the [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/usage/headless). You will need to have the following CLI tools installed before continuing:\n>\n> - [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)\n> - [Amplify CLI](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/)\n> - [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)\n> - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)\n\nAny app with integration tests will have an `integration_test` folder in the example app for that package. These tests run against real AWS resources which must be deployed before running.\n\nTo create all the backend environments, run:\n\n```bash\n$ tool/provision_integration_test_resources.sh\n```\n\nThis script can be re-run anytime the environments need to be updated. Further information can be found in the [infra](infra/README.md) package.\n\n## Screenshot Tests\n\nThe Amplify Authenticator package contains a screenshot test suite called `goldens`. If your changes include UI changes within this package please regenerate the goldens.\n\nTo regenerate, navigate to the root of the Authenticator package and run:\n\n```bash\n$ cd packages/authenticator/amplify_authenticator\n$ flutter test --update-goldens\n```\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the [Amazon Open Source Code of Conduct](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct).\nFor more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://aws.github.io/code-of-conduct-faq) or contact\nopensource-codeofconduct@amazon.com with any additional questions or comments.\n\n## Security issue notifications\n\nIf you discover a potential security issue in this project we ask that you notify AWS/Amazon Security via our [vulnerability reporting page](http://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting/).

This includes updating the dart and flutter SDK version.\n\n## Category / Platform Support\n\n| Category       | Android | iOS | Web | Windows | MacOS | Linux |\n| -------------- | :-----: | :-: | :-: | :-----: | :---: | :---: |\n| Analytics      |   ✅    | ✅  | ✅  |   ✅    |  ✅   |  ✅   |\n| API (REST)     |   ✅    | ✅  | ✅  |   ✅    |  ✅   |  ✅   |\n| API (GraphQL)  |   ✅    | ✅  | ✅  |   ✅    |  ✅   |  ✅   |\n| Authentication |   ✅    | ✅  | ✅  |   ✅    |  ✅   |  ✅   |\n| DataStore      |   ✅    | ✅  | 🔴  |   🔴    |  🔴   |  🔴   |\n| Storage        |   ✅    | ✅  | ✅  |   ✅    |  ✅   |  ✅   |\n| Notifications  |   ✅    | ✅  | 🔴  |   🔴    |  🔴   |  🔴   |\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Getting Started with Amplify Flutter](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/start/quickstart/)\n- [Amplify Framework](https://docs.amplify.aws/)\n- [Contributing to Amplify Flutter](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Flutter Development Guide\n\nAmplify for Flutter is an open-source project and welcomes contributions from the Flutter community, see [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)\n- Node.js v18.17 or later\n- npm v9 or later\n\n#### Getting Started With Amplify Flutter\n\n1.

Run the following to create an amplify project:\n\n    `npm create amplify@latest -y`\n\n4. To use the Authenticator, you need to add the following dependencies to your project:\n\n    ```yaml\n    dependencies:\n      amplify_auth_cognito: ^2.0.0\n      amplify_authenticator: ^2.0.0\n      amplify_flutter: ^2.0.0\n      flutter:\n        sdk: flutter\n    ```\n\n5. run `flutter pub get`\n\n6. Update your main.dart file to the following:\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:amplify_auth_cognito/amplify_auth_cognito.dart';\nimport 'package:amplify_authenticator/amplify_authenticator.dart';\nimport 'package:amplify_flutter/amplify_flutter.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\n\nimport 'amplify_outputs.dart';\n\nFuture<void> main() async {\n  try {\n    WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n    await _configureAmplify();\n    runApp(const MyApp());\n  } on AmplifyException catch (e) {\n    runApp(Text(\"Error configuring Amplify: ${e.message}\"));\n  }\n}\n\nFuture<void> _configureAmplify() async {\n  try {\n    await Amplify.addPlugin(AmplifyAuthCognito());\n    await Amplify.configure(amplifyConfig);\n    safePrint('Successfully configured');\n  } on Exception catch (e) {\n    safePrint('Error configuring Amplify: $e');\n  }\n}\n\nclass MyApp extends StatelessWidget {\n  const MyApp({super.key});\n  @override\n  Widget build(BuildContext context) {\n    return Authenticator(\n      child: MaterialApp(\n        builder: Authenticator.builder(),\n        home: const Scaffold(\n          body: Center(\n            child: Column(\n              mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,\n              children: [\n                SignOutButton(),\n                Text('TODO Application'),\n              ],\n            ),\n          ),\n        ),\n      ),\n    );\n  }\n}\n```\n\n7. Deploy your backend use Amplify's per-developer cloud sandbox. This feature provides a separate backend environment for every developer on a team, ideal for local development and testing. To run your application with a sandbox environment, you can run the following command:\n\n    `npx ampx sandbox --outputs-format dart --outputs-out-dir lib`\n\n8. Since Amplify Flutter supports 6 platforms with Flutter including iOS, Android, Web, and Desktop, some extra configuration may be required for each platform. Check out the [Platform Setup](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/start/platform-setup/) guide to make sure you've completed the necessary steps.\n\n9. Run `flutter run` to launch your app on the connected device.\n\nCongratulations, you've built your first Amplify app! 🎉\n\nFor further documentation and Amplify Category usage, see the [documentation](https://docs.amplify.aws/flutter/).\n\n---\n\nFlutter and the related logo are trademarks of Google LLC.

If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4.

Representation\n\nEach Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its\nContributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights\nto grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.\n\n2.6.

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional\ndisclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any\njurisdiction.\n\n4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nIf it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this\nLicense with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to\nstatute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with\nthe terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)\ndescribe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must\nbe placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered\nSoftware under this License.

Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4.

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4. Notices\n\nYou may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices\n(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,\nor limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of\nthe Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to\nthe extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.\n\n3.5.

However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on\nbehalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all\nend user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which\nhave been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License\nprior to termination shall survive termination.\n\n************************************************************************\n*                                                                      *\n*  6.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
