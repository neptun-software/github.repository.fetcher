The mechanism to propose such a change is a GitHub pull request.\nCollaborators review and merge (_land_) pull requests.\n\nTwo Collaborators must approve a pull request before the pull request can land.\n(One Collaborator approval is enough if the pull request has been open for more\nthan 7 days.) Approving a pull request indicates that the Collaborator accepts\nresponsibility for the change. Approval must be from Collaborators who are not\nauthors of the change.\n\nIf a Collaborator opposes a proposed change, then the change cannot land. The\nexception is if the TSC votes to approve the change despite the opposition.\nUsually, involving the TSC is unnecessary. Often, discussions or further changes\nresult in Collaborators removing their opposition.\n\n### Collaborator activities\n\n* Helping users and novice contributors\n* Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the project\n* Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests\n* Participation in working groups\n* Merging pull requests\n\nThe TSC can remove inactive Collaborators or provide them with _Emeritus_\nstatus. Emeriti may request that the TSC restore them to active status.\n\n### Collaborator nominations\n\nExisting Collaborators can nominate someone to become a Collaborator. Nominees should have significant and valuable contributions across the OpenWebF organization.\n\nTo nominate a new Collaborator, open an issue in the [openwebf/webf][] repository. Provide a summary of the nominee's contributions. For example:\n\n* Commits in the [openwebf/webf][] repository\n  * Use the link `https://github.com/openwebf/webf/commits?author=GITHUB_ID`\n* Pull requests and issues opened in the [openwebf/webf][] repository\n  * Use the link `https://github.com/openwebf/webf/issues?q=author:GITHUB_ID`\n* Comments on pull requests and issues in the [openwebf/webf][] repository\n  * Use the link `https://github.com/openwebf/webf/issues?q=commenter:GITHUB_ID`\n* Reviews on pull requests in the [openwebf/webf][] repository\n  * Use the link `https://github.com/openwebf/webf/pulls?q=reviewed-by:GITHUB_ID`\n* Pull requests and issues opened throughout the OpenWebF organization\n  * Use the link  `https://github.com/search?q=author:GITHUB_ID+org:openwebf`\n* Comments on pull requests and issues throughout the OpenWebF organization\n  * Use the link `https://github.com/search?q=commenter:GITHUB_ID+org:openwebf`\n* Help provided to end-users and novice contributors\n* Participation in other projects, teams, and working groups of the OpenWebF organization\n\nMention @openwebf/collaborators in the issue to notify other Collaborators about the nomination.\nThe nomination passes if no Collaborators oppose it after one week. Otherwise, the nomination fails.\n\n## Technical Steering Committee\n\nA subset of the Collaborators forms the Technical Steering Committee (TSC). The TSC is responsible for all technical development within the OpenWebF project, including:\n\n* Setting release dates.\n* Release quality standards.\n* Technical direction.\n* Project governance and process (including this policy).\n* GitHub repository hosting.\n* Conduct guidelines.\n* Maintaining the list of additional Collaborators.\n* Development process and any coding standards.\n* Mediating technical conflicts between Collaborators projects.\n* The TSC will define OpenWebF project’s release vehicles.\n\n### Establishment TSC\n\nThe TSC members will elect from Collaborators. TSC memberships are not time-limited. There is no maximum size of the TSC. The size is expected to vary in order to ensure adequate coverage of important areas of expertise, balanced with the ability to make decisions efficiently. The TSC must have at least three members.\n\nThere is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for TSC membership beyond these rules. The TSC may add additional members to the TSC by a standard TSC motion and vote. A TSC member may be removed from the TSC by voluntary resignation, by a standard TSC motion, or in accordance to the participation rules described below.\n\nChanges to TSC membership should be posted in the agenda, and may be suggested as any other agenda item.\n\nTSC members are expected to regularly participate in TSC activities. If a TSC member does not attend any meeting within three months, the TSC membership will automatically become invalid and removed.\n\n### TSC elections\n\nLeadership roles in the OpenWebF project will be peer elected representatives of the community.\n\nThe TSC will elect from amongst voting TSC members a TSC Chairperson to work on building an agenda for TSC meetings.\nThe TSC shall hold annual elections to select a TSC Chairperson and\nthere are no limits on the number of terms a TSC Chairperson.\n\nThe TSC will elect from amongst voting TSC members a TSC Chairperson to work\non building an agenda for TSC meetings.\nThe TSC shall hold annual elections to select a TSC Chairperson and\nthere are no limits on the number of terms a TSC Chairperson.\n\nFor election of persons (such as the TSC Chairperson), a multiple-candidate\nmethod should be used, such as:\n\n* [Condorcet][] or\n* [Single Transferable Vote][]\n\nMultiple-candidate methods may be reduced to simple election by plurality\nwhen there are only two candidates for one position to be filled. No\nelection is required if there is only one candidate and no objections to\nthe candidate's election. Elections shall be done within the projects by\nthe Collaborators active in the project.\n\n### TSC meetings\n\nThe TSC shall meet regularly using tools that enable participation by the community (e.g. weekly on a DingTalk online conference\n, or through any other appropriate means selected by the TSC). The meeting shall be directed by the TSC Chairperson. Responsibility for directing individual meetings may be delegated by the TSC Chairperson to any other TSC member. Minutes or an appropriate recording shall be taken and made available to the community through accessible public postings.\n\nThe TSC agenda includes issues that are at an impasse. The intention of the\nagenda is not to review or approve all patches. Collaborators review and approve\npatches on GitHub.\n\nAny community member can create a GitHub issue asking that the TSC review\nsomething. If consensus-seeking fails for an issue, a Collaborator may apply the\n`tsc-agenda` label. That will add it to the TSC meeting agenda.\n\nBefore each TSC meeting, the meeting chair will share the agenda with members of\nthe TSC. TSC members can also add items to the agenda at the beginning of each\nmeeting. The meeting chair and the TSC cannot veto or remove items.\n\nThe TSC may invite people to take part in a non-voting capacity.\n\nDuring the meeting, the TSC chair ensures that someone takes minutes. After the\nmeeting, the TSC chair ensures that someone opens a pull request with the\nminutes.\n\nThe TSC seeks to resolve as many issues as possible outside meetings using\n[the TSC issue tracker](https://github.com/openwebf/TSC/issues). The process in\nthe issue tracker is:\n\n* A TSC member opens an issue explaining the proposal/issue and @-mentions\n  @openwebf/tsc.\n* The proposal passes if, after 72 hours, there are two or more TSC approvals\n  and no TSC opposition.\n* If there is an extended impasse, a TSC member may make a motion for a vote.\n\n### TSC voting\n\nFor internal project decisions, Collaborators shall operate under [Lazy Consensus][].\nThe TSC shall establish appropriate guidelines for implementing Lazy Consensus\n(e.g. expected notification and review time periods) within the development process.\n\nThe TSC follows a [Consensus Seeking][] decision making model. When an agenda\nitem has appeared to reach a consensus the moderator will ask \"Does anyone object?\"\nas a final call for dissent from the consensus.\n\nIf an agenda item cannot reach a consensus a TSC member can call for either a\nclosing vote or a vote to table the issue to the next meeting.\nThe call for a vote must be seconded by a majority of the TSC or else the discussion will continue.\n\nFor all votes, a simple majority of all TSC members for, or against, the issue wins.\nA TSC member may choose to participate in any vote through abstention.\n\n\n[openwebf/webf]: https://github.com/openwebf/webf\n[Lazy Consensus]: https://community.apache.org/committers/lazyConsensus.html\n[Consensus Seeking]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making\n[Condorcet]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method\n[Single Transferable Vote]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote\n"

Craft bespoke HTML elements using Flutter Widgets or enhance your application by integrating a JavaScript API sourced from any Dart library on the `pub.dev` registry.\n\n- **Authentic Web Development Environment:** Experience a traditional web development setting with WebF. It facilitates DOM structure inspection, CSS style evaluations, and JavaScript debugging via Chrome DevTools.\n\n- **Craft Once, Deploy Everywhere:** Harness the versatility of WebF to design your web application and launch it across any Flutter-compatible device. What's more, maintain the flexibility to execute your apps within Node.js or web browsers, all from a unified codebase.\n\n## Join Our Mission\n\nWe envision providing web developers with an innovative web rendering engine, surpassing WebView in performance and adaptability across both mobile and desktop platforms.\n\nWebF's journey is ambitious and enduring. We believe in the strength of collective effort. If you share our dream of a superior alternative to WebView for the future, your expertise could be invaluable to us.\n\nFurther, financial contributions can pave the way for erstwhile members of the Kraken team to rejoin our mission, bolstering our developmental pace and potential.\n\nIf you or your team are interested in supporting us, please contact @andycall on our Discord channel.\n\n\n## How to use\n\n> All front-end frameworks based on the WhatWG DOM standard are supported; this time, we are using Vue as an example.\n\n### 1. Use vue-cli to generate your front-end project\n\n> ES6 modules are not supported yet, so Vite is not supported.\n\n```bash\nvue create app\ncd app\nnpm run serve\n```\n\nAnd the Vue development server will be hosted at `http://<yourip>:8080/`.\n\n### 2. Add webf as a dependency for your flutter apps.\n\n**packages.yaml**\n\n```yaml\ndependencies:\n  webf: <lastest version>\n```\n\n**import**\n\n```dart\nimport 'package:webf/webf.dart';\nimport 'package:webf/devtools.dart';\n```\n\n**init**\n\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n```\n\n\n### 3. Add the WebF widget to run your web applications.\n\n```dart\n@override\nWidget build(BuildContext context) {\n  final MediaQueryData queryData = MediaQuery.of(context);\n  final Size viewportSize = queryData.size;\n\n  return Scaffold(\n      body: Center(\n    child: Column(\n      children: [\n        WebF(\n          devToolsService: ChromeDevToolsService(), // Enable Chrome DevTools Services\n          viewportWidth: viewportSize.width - queryData.padding.horizontal, // Adjust the viewportWidth\n          viewportHeight: viewportSize.height - queryData.padding.vertical, // Adjust the viewportHeight\n          bundle: WebFBundle.fromUrl('http://<yourip>:8080/'), // The page entry point\n        ),\n      ],\n    ),\n  ));\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Run\n\n```bash\nflutter run\n```\n\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4409743/217754470-697b6998-4451-483c-b26e-bdb2740f3ea1.png\" width=\"800\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto;\" />\n\n\n## How it works\n\nWebF provides a rendering engine which follows the W3C standards like web browsers do. It can render HTML/CSS and execute JavaScript. It's built on top of the flutter rendering pipelines and implements its own layout and painting algorithms.\n\nWith WebF, Web Apps and Flutter Apps share the same rendering context. It means that you can use Flutter Widgets to define your HTML elements and embed your Web App as a Flutter Widget in your flutter apps.\n\n![Browser Engine Pipeline](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82b2ed53-f0d6-4f14-b22a-2fca50c697a5)\n\n\n\n\n## Contributors\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/openwebf/webf/graphs/contributors\"><img src=\"https://opencollective.com/webf/contributors.svg?width=890&button=false\" /></a>\n\n## 👏 Contributing [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/openwebf/webf/pulls)\n\nBy contributing to WebF, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its Apache-2.0 License.\n\nRead our [contributing guide](https://github.com/openwebf/webf/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and let's build a better WebF project together.\n\nThank you to all the people who already contributed to [OpenWebF](https://github.com/openwebf) and [OpenKraken](https://github.com/openkraken)!\n\nCopyright (c) 2022-present, The OpenWebF authors.\n"
