You can add more projects by clicking add project button on SideDrawer. From material color list you can specify any single color to the project\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/f01IjGz.gif)\n\n> You can assign only one project to a single task\n\n## Labels\nYou can add multiple labels by clicking add Labels button on SideDrawer. From material color list you can specify any single color to the label\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/tZQgEwW.gif)\n\n> You can assign multiple labels to a single task\n\n## Task\nYou can add task with multiple attributes. You must assign a project to task if not than by default it will be added in _Inbox_ project.\nTask can have zero or more to label assing to it\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/mNs0D3B.gif)\n\n## Swipe the Task\nYou can delete a task by swiping left-to-right or your can mark task as completed by swiping right-to-left. You can also undo a completed task by clicking on options menu where  it shows the list of all completed tasks there you can swipe right-to-left to undo the completed task\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/yU0gP1t.gif)\n\n## Sorting\nYou can sort your task with date i.e today and next 7 days and also acoording to project and labels\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/wzou22S.gif)\n\n\n## How to contribute?\n* Check out contribution guidelines 👉[CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/burhanrashid52/WhatTodo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n\n## What's next?\n\n - Editable Project,label and Task\n - Deletable Project and Label\n - Comment/Description in Task\n - Reminder with notification\n\n\n## Questions?🤔\nHit me on twitter [![Twitter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitter-%40burhanrashid52-blue.svg)](https://twitter.com/burhanrashid52)\n[![Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/Medium-%40burhanrashid52-brightgreen.svg)](https://medium.com/@burhanrashid52)\n[![Facebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Facebook-Burhanuddin%20Rashid-blue.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/Bursid)\n\n\n## Credits\n  - UI/UX inspired from [**Todoist**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.todoist&hl=en) app\n  - Flutter [**Documentation**](https://flutter.io/docs/)\n  - [**Collin Jackson**](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1463116/collin-jackson) answer's on stackoverflow :laughing:\n\n## License\nCopyright 2020 Burhanuddin Rashid\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
