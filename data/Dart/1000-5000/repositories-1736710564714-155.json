Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Data processing steps and mark shapes can be composed freely in a declarative specification, not limited to certain chart types. And shape draw methods are customizable.\n- **Interaction**: With the *event* and *selection* definition, the chart is highly interactive, such as highlighting selected items, popping a tooltip, or scaling the coordinate.\n- **Animation**: Mark transition animation can be set when a chart is built or changed. The entrance animation has various forms.\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee in the [documentation](https://pub.dev/documentation/graphic/latest/graphic/graphic-library.html).\n\n## Examples\n\nExample of charts can be seen in the [Example App](https://github.com/entronad/graphic/tree/main/example).
