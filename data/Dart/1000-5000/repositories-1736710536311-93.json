          "content": "# Contributing to Finamp\n\nThanks for your interest in contributing to Finamp! This document goes over how to get started on Finamp development, and other ways to contribute.\n\n## Setting up a Development Environment\n\nFinamp is a fairly standard Flutter app, so all you have to do is [install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install). Once Flutter is installed, you should be able to run Finamp on emulators/real devices.\n\n### Android Keys\n\nTo build release APKs, you need to set up a signing key for Android. To get that set up, follow [this guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#signing-the-app) from the Flutter documentation. Note that if you have Finamp installed already, your phone may panic because the key is different.\n\n### The Arcane Arts (Code Generation)\n\n![A conversation between me and Chaphasilor. I say \"did you try running (the Dart build command)?\" They reply \"I wasn't aware I need to use the arcane arts for this\"](assets/arcane-arts.png)\n\nBecause Dart doesn't support macros and stuff, a few dependencies rely on code generation which must be run manually. These dependencies are:\n\n* Hive - the database that Finamp uses for storing all data\n* `json_serializable` - For deserialising JSON into classes\n* Chopper - For talking to Jellyfin over HTTP\n    * This layer (`lib/services/jellyfin_api.dart`) is not used by the app directly. The user-facing API is located at `lib/services/jellyfin_api_helper.dart`.\n\nTo rebuild these files, run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`. This must be done when:\n\n* Modifying a class that is returned by Jellyfin (such as the classes in `lib/models/jellyfin_models.dart`)\n* Adding fields to a database class (annotated with `@HiveType`)\n\nIf you don't rebuild generated files, you will encounter:\n\n* Settings not persisting\n* Hive errors on startup\n* Missing data when converting JSON to classes\n\n### Hive\n\nAs said earlier, Finamp uses Hive for all data storage needs. If you're doing work that involves data storage, I recommend you read [the Hive docs](https://docs.hivedb.dev/#/). Please ensure that your changes work when upgrading Finamp from the current release to your changes, as not handling upgrades will cause the app to crash. When downgrading, you will have to wipe your app data if any changes were made to Hive.\n\nWhen creating new types, note that you'll also have to register an adapter in `main.dart`. After code generation, there should be a class called `[YourType]Adapter`, which you can initialise in `setupHive`.\n\n## The Redesign\n\nThe biggest main piece of work being done on Finamp at the moment is the redesign. The relevant issue can be found [here](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/issues/220). The `redesign` branch has diverged a lot from `main`, but I try to keep it updated. If you're struggling to decide what to work on, the redesign is a good place to look :)\n\n## Translating\n\nFinamp uses Weblate to manage translations: **https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/finamp/**\n\nFeel free to add new languages if yours isn't there yet. If you have any questions, such as the context of a string, you can ask in the [Translation Discussions](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/discussions/categories/translations).\n"

          "content": "# Finamp 1.0 Plan - Downloads Rewrite\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the core plan and motivation for Finamp 1.0. This change will need a major version bump as it will introduce breaking changes. As such, we will have to ensure that users are notified well in advance.\n\n## Motivations\n\nFinamp's downloading infrastructure is currently very poor. It was mostly written before I had any formal computer science experience. Because of this, it is very finnicky, and frequently breaks between updates. Some highlights include:\n\n* Download items being tracked across five key-value databases that all need to be kept in sync:\n    * `DownloadedItems` - stores downloaded song data.\n    * `DownloadedParents` - stores data about parents (albums, playlists), with links to children.\n        * By link, I mean a copy of the Jellyfin metadata stored in `DownloadedItems`. Syncing between the two is done manually.\n    * `DownloadIds` - a copy of the data stored in `DownloadedItems`, but indexed by the `flutter_downloader` download ID so that we can track the download ID back to the actual song.\n    * `DownloadedImages` - stores downloaded image data.\n    * `DownloadedImageIds` - same as `DownloadIds`, but for images.\n        * `DownloadIds` cannot be used for images, as it takes a `DownloadedSong` data type (yes, a complete copy).\n* In the past, I stored absolute paths. The `DownloadedSong` data-type has to account for this, and update as it goes along.\n    * This is especially problematic on iOS, where the internal app directory changes every update.\n* Off the top of my head, there is no clean way to add support for downloaded artists, or especially genres\n\nThe download system also makes use of the [flutter_downloader](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_downloader) package. In the new system, I will be replacing it with [background_downloader](https://pub.dev/packages/background_downloader) for the following reasons:\n\n* Desktop support - While downloading isn't 100% essential for desktop, it will be nice to have a complete version of Finamp on desktop. Desktop support will also be required for Linux phones.\n* Better looking API - `flutter_downloader` is extremely finnicky, especially around listening for updates. This is why download indicators have never really worked in Finamp.\n* Scoped storage support - Finamp's support for external directories is currently practically broken. It seems to be a pretty niche feature, but it would be nice to have working again.\n* Relative path handling by default - this will solve the absolute path issue I mentioned earlier.\n* Better stability - `flutter_downloader` has had a history of spurious bugs causing crashes and other issues. Most recently, [downloads on iOS failed to get marked as complete](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/issues/433), causing downloads to effectively break on iOS. I haven't tried `background_downloader` myself yet, but it has a much more rigid testing setup which should help it catch regressions like this.\n\nFinamp also uses [Hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive) for all of its databases. Hive is a great database, but it isn't intended for complex use-cases like this. The same people behind Hive have created [Isar](https://pub.dev/packages/isar), which supports more advanced use-cases. I didn't use this initially as it was still in early development during Finamp's initial development, but it is now stable. For downloads, it will allow me to actually model relations in the database to make adding and removing downloads more reliable. I will also likely replace Finamp's other Hive databases with Isar databases.\n\n## Impacts\n\nDoing all of this will be an extremely damaging breaking change. Finamp's last breaking change was [0.5.0](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/releases/tag/0.5.0), which required all users to clear their app data (loading databases from before 0.5.0 failed). This was almost acceptable back then - Finamp was still in its early days and hadn't yet been released on the App Store or Play Store (0.5.0 was the first release). Now, Finamp has roughly 25,000 downloads (thank you!). I can't just release an update that breaks everything without giving months of notice, especially since the app will be auto-updated to 1.0.\n\nWhile the app won't fail to launch like 0.5.0 did, it will effectively log the user out (as the user database will be replaced). Downloads will also be wiped by deleting the internal song directory. Users must be aware that this is happening - one of the first \"actions\" of this will be to add a visible warning to the app linking here (with a brief explanation at the top)."

However, the beta is **fully functional and should be stable** enough for daily use.\n\n---\n\n**Finamp** is a Jellyfin music player for Android and iOS. It's meant to give you a similar listening experience as traditional streaming services such as Spotify and Apple Music, but for the music that you already own. It's free, open-source software, just like Jellyfin itself.  \nSome of its features include:\n\n- A welcoming user interface that looks modern & unique, but still familiar\n- Downloading files for offline listening and saving mobile data. Can use transcoded downloads to save even more space.\n- Transcoded streaming for saving mobile data\n- Beautiful dynamic colors that adapt to your media\n- Audio volume normalization (\"ReplayGain\") (Jellyfin 10.9+)\n- Lyrics (Jellyfin 10.9+)\n- Gapless playback\n- Android Auto support (coming soon™)\n- Full support for Jellyfin's \"Playback Reporting\" feature and plugin, letting you keep track of your listening activity\n\n***You need your own Jellyfin server to use Finamp. If you don't have one yet, take a look at [Jellyfin's website](https://jellyfin.org/) to learn more about it and how to set it up.***\n\n## Getting Finamp\n\n<div style=\"display: flex; align-items: center;\" align=\"center\">\n\n[<img src=\"app-store-badges/fdroid.png\"\n    alt=\"Get it on F-Droid\"\n    height=\"80\">](https://f-droid.org/packages/com.unicornsonlsd.finamp/)\n\n[<img src=\"app-store-badges/play-store.png\"\n    alt=\"Get it on Google Play\"\n    height=\"80\">](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.unicornsonlsd.finamp)\n\n[<img style=\"margin-left: 15px;\" src=\"app-store-badges/app-store.svg\"\n    alt=\"Download on the App Store\"\n    height=\"55\">](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finamp/id1574922594)\n\n</div>\n\n<sup>Note: The F-Droid release may take a day or two to get updates because since [F-Droid only builds once a day](https://www.f-droid.org/en/docs/FAQ_-_App_Developers/#ive-published-a-new-release-why-is-it-not-in-the-repository).</sup>  \nThe app is also available as an APK from the [releases page](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/releases).\n\n### Frequently Asked Questions\n\n#### Before Installing\n\n##### Is Finamp free?\nAbsolutely! It costs nothing to use. We do appreciate voluntary contributions of any kind though, be that bug reports, code, designs, or ideas for new features. You can also donate to some of the developers to show your appreciation <3\n\n##### How can I install Finamp?\nOn Android, Finamp can be installed from the Google Play Store, F-Droid store, or directly by installing the APK file from GitHub.  \nOn iOS, you can install Finamp through Apple's App Store. Just click on the buttons above.\n\n##### Does Finamp support my media formats?\nFinamp should support all formats supported by Jellyfin. Some more advanced formats could cause issues for regular playback, but transcoding should fix these issues.\n\n##### Does Finamp support Android Auto / Apple CarPlay?\nTheoretically, but not yet. There is [an issue for this](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/issues/24) that contains a proof of concept for Android Auto in there, but it hasn't been tested yet. Maybe you could help out!\n\n##### Is Finamp legal?\nYes. Finamp is a *tool* that lets you interface with a Jellyfin server. Finamp does not come with any music, and will not connect to streaming services other than Jellyfin. You will need to bring your own media and add it to Jellyfin, for example by purchasing music online. This often also directly supports your favorite artists!\n\n#### After Installing\n\n##### I'm having trouble with Finamp, where can I find help?\nIf you're experiencing software bugs or other issues with Finamp, be sure to take a look at [Finamp's issue tracker](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/issues), especially the pinned issues at the top of the page. If you can't find anything related to your specific problem, please create a new issue (you will need a GitHub account).\n\n## Contributing\n\nFinamp is a community-driven project and relies on people like **you** and their contributions. To learn how you could help out with making Finamp even better, take a look at our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n### Tranlations\n\nYou can also contribute by helping to translate Finamp! This is done through our Weblate instance here: <https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/finamp/>. The current translation status is this:\n\n<a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/finamp/\">\n  <img src=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/finamp/finamp/horizontal-auto.svg\" alt=\"Translation status\" />\n</a>\n\n## Known Issues\n\nThis app is still a work in progress, and has some bugs/issues that haven't been fixed yet. Here is a list of currently known issues:\n\n- Reordering the queue while shuffle is enabled is not possible at the moment. It seems like this is an issue with a dependency of Finamp (`just_audio`), and is being tracked [here](https://github.com/ryanheise/just_audio/issues/1042)\n- If you have a very large library or an older phone, performance might not be great in some places\n\n## Planned Features\n\n- Improved Android Auto / Apple CarPlay support\n- Full redesign, adding more features and a home screen. See [this issue](https://github.com/jmshrv/finamp/issues/220) for more info\n- Better playlist editing\n- Multiple users/servers\n- More customization options\n\n## Screenshots (Stable Version, outdated)\n\n| | |\n|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|\n|<img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmshrv/finamp/master/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/1.png> | <img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmshrv/finamp/master/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/2.png>\n| <img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmshrv/finamp/master/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/3.png> | <img src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmshrv/finamp/master/fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/4.png> |\n\n\nName source: https://www.reddit.com/r/jellyfin/comments/hjxshn/jellyamp_crossplatform_desktop_music_player/fwqs5i0/\n"
