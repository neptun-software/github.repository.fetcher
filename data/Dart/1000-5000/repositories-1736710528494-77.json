All non-documentation pull requests must also include automated tests that cover the new code, including failure cases. If applicable, please update the documentation in the `docs/source` branch.\n\n## Running Tests\n\nTests will automatically be run when you submit a pull request, but you will need to run tests locally. You must have a local PostgreSQL server with a database created with the following:\n\n```bash\npsql -c 'create user dart with createdb;' -U postgres\npsql -c \"alter user dart with password 'dart';\" -U postgres\npsql -c 'create database dart_test;' -U postgres\npsql -c 'grant all on database dart_test to dart;' -U postgres\n```\n\nRun all tests with the following command:\n\n                pub run test -j 1\n"

The framework is composed of libraries for handling and routing HTTP requests, object-relational mapping (ORM), authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0 provider) and documentation (OpenAPI). These libraries are used to build scalable REST APIs that run on the Dart VM.\n\nIf this is your first time viewing Aqueduct, check out [the tour](https://aqueduct.io/docs/tour/).\n\n## Getting Started\n\n1. [Install Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/install).\n2. Activate Aqueduct\n\n        pub global activate aqueduct\n\n3. Create a new project.\n\n        aqueduct create my_project\n\nOpen the project directory in [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), [Atom](https://atom.io) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). All three IDEs have a Dart plugin. For IntelliJ IDEA users, there are [file and code templates](https://aqueduct.io/docs/intellij/) for Aqueduct.\n\n## Tutorials, Documentation and Examples\n\nStep-by-step tutorials for beginners are available [here](https://aqueduct.io/docs/tut/getting-started).\n\nYou can find the API reference [here](https://www.dartdocs.org/documentation/aqueduct/latest) or you can install it in [Dash](https://kapeli.com/docsets#dartdoc).\n\nYou can find in-depth and conceptual guides [here](https://aqueduct.io/docs/).\n\nAn ever-expanding repository of Aqueduct examples is [here](https://github.com/stablekernel/aqueduct_examples).\n"
