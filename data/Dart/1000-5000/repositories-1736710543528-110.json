          "content": "# Flutter Launcher Icons\n\n[![Flutter Community: flutter_launcher_icons](https://fluttercommunity.dev/_github/header/flutter_launcher_icons)](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/community)\n\n[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/flutter_launcher_icons.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/flutter_launcher_icons)\n\nA command-line tool which simplifies the task of updating your Flutter app's launcher icon. Fully flexible, allowing you to choose what platform you wish to update the launcher icon for and if you want, the option to keep your old launcher icon in case you want to revert back sometime in the future.\n\n## :book: Guide\n\n### 1. Setup the config file\n\nRun the following command to create a new config automatically:\n\n```shell\ndart run flutter_launcher_icons:generate\n```\n\nThis will create a new file called `flutter_launcher_icons.yaml` in your `flutter` project's root directory.\n\nIf you want to override the default location or name of the config file, use the `-f` flag:\n\n```shell\ndart run flutter_launcher_icons:generate -f <your config file name here>\n```\n\nTo override an existing config file, use the `-o` flag:\n\n```shell\ndart run flutter_launcher_icons:generate -o\n```\n\nOR\n\nAdd your Flutter Launcher Icons configuration to your `pubspec.yaml`.  \nAn example is shown below. More complex examples [can be found in the example projects](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons/tree/master/example).\n\n```yaml\ndev_dependencies:\n  flutter_launcher_icons: \"^0.14.2\"\n\nflutter_launcher_icons:\n  android: \"launcher_icon\"\n  ios: true\n  image_path: \"assets/icon/icon.png\"\n  min_sdk_android: 21 # android min sdk min:16, default 21\n  web:\n    generate: true\n    image_path: \"path/to/image.png\"\n    background_color: \"#hexcode\"\n    theme_color: \"#hexcode\"\n  windows:\n    generate: true\n    image_path: \"path/to/image.png\"\n    icon_size: 48 # min:48, max:256, default: 48\n  macos:\n    generate: true\n    image_path: \"path/to/image.png\"\n```\n\n### 2. Run the package\n\nAfter setting up the configuration, all that is left to do is run the package.\n\n```shell\nflutter pub get\ndart run flutter_launcher_icons\n```\n\nIf you name your configuration file something other than `flutter_launcher_icons.yaml` or `pubspec.yaml` you will need to specify\nthe name of the file when running the package.\n\n```shell\nflutter pub get\ndart run flutter_launcher_icons -f <your config file name here>\n```\n\nNote: If you are not using the existing `pubspec.yaml` ensure that your config file is located in the same directory as it.\n\nIf you encounter any issues [please report them here](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons/issues).\n\nIn the above configuration, the package is setup to replace the existing launcher icons in both the Android and iOS project\nwith the icon located in the image path specified above and given the name \"launcher_icon\" in the Android project and \"Example-Icon\" in the iOS project.\n\n## :mag: Attributes\n\nShown below is the full list of attributes which you can specify within your Flutter Launcher Icons configuration.\n\n### Global\n\n- `image_path`: The location of the icon image file which you want to use as the app launcher icon.\n\n### Android\n\n- `android`\n  - `true`: Override the default existing Flutter launcher icon for the platform specified\n  - `false`: Ignore making launcher icons for this platform\n  - `icon/path/here.png`: This will generate a new launcher icons for the platform with the name you specify, without removing the old default existing Flutter launcher icon.\n- `image_path`: The location of the icon image file which you want to use as the app launcher icon\n- `image_path_android`: The location of the icon image file specific for Android platform (optional - if not defined then the image_path is used)\n- `min_sdk_android`: Specify android min sdk value\n**The next two attributes are only used when generating Android launcher icon**\n\n- `adaptive_icon_background`: The color (E.g. `\"#ffffff\"`) or image asset (E.g. `\"assets/images/christmas-background.png\"`) which will\nbe used to fill out the background of the adaptive icon.\n- `adaptive_icon_foreground`: The image asset which will be used for the icon foreground of the adaptive icon\n*Note: Adaptive Icons will only be generated when both adaptive_icon_background and adaptive_icon_foreground are specified. (the image_path is not automatically taken as foreground)*\n- `adaptive_icon_foreground_inset`: This is used to add padding to the icon when applying an adaptive icon. The default value is `16`.\n- `adaptive_icon_monochrome`: The image asset which will be used for the icon\nforeground of the Android 13+ themed icon. For more information see [Android Adaptive Icons](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/launch/icon_design_adaptive#user-theming)\n\n### IOS\n\n- `ios`\n  - `true`: Override the default existing Flutter launcher icon for the platform specified\n  - `false`: Ignore making launcher icons for this platform\n  - `icon/path/here.png`: This will generate a new launcher icons for the platform with the name you specify, without removing the old default existing Flutter launcher icon.\n- `image_path_ios`: The location of the icon image file specific for iOS platform (optional - if not defined then the image_path is used)\n- `remove_alpha_ios`: Removes alpha channel for IOS icons\n- `image_path_ios_dark_transparent`: The location of the dark mode icon image file specific for iOS 18+ platform. *Note: Apple recommends this icon to be transparent. For more information see [Apple Human Interface Guidelines for App Icons](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/app-icons#iOS-iPadOS)*\n- `image_path_ios_tinted_grayscale`: The location of the tinted mode icon image file specific for iOS 18+ platform. *Note: This icon should be an grayscale image. Use `desaturate_tinted_to_grayscale_ios: true` to automatically desaturate the image provided here.*\n- `desaturate_tinted_to_grayscale_ios`: Automatically desaturates tinted mode icon image to grayscale, *defaults to false*\n- `background_color_ios`: The color (in the format \"#RRGGBB\") to be used as the background when removing the alpha channel. It is used only when the `remove_alpha_ios` property is set to true. (optional - if not defined then `#ffffff` is used)\n\n### Web\n\n- `web`: Add web related configs\n  - `generate`: Specifies whether to generate icons for this platform or not\n  - `image_path`: Path to web icon.png\n  - `background_color`: Updates *background_color* in `web/manifest.json`\n  - `theme_color`: Updates *theme_color* in `web/manifest.json`\n\n### Windows\n\n- `windows`: Add Windows related configs\n  - `generate`: Specifies whether to generate icons for Windows platform or not\n  - `image_path`: Path to web icon.png\n  - `icon_size`: Windows app icon size. Icon size should be within this constrains *48<=icon_size<=256, defaults to 48*\n  \n### MacOS\n\n- `macos`: Add MacOS related configs\n  - `generate`: Specifies whether to generate icons for MacOS platform or not\n  - `image_path`: Path to macos icon.png file\n\n*Note: iOS icons should [fill the entire image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26014461/black-border-on-my-ios-icon) and not contain transparent borders.*\n\n## Flavor support\n\nCreate a Flutter Launcher Icons configuration file for your flavor. The config file is called `flutter_launcher_icons-<flavor>.yaml` by replacing `<flavor>` by the name of your desired flavor.\n\nThe configuration file format is the same.\n\nAn example project with flavor support enabled [has been added to the examples](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons/tree/master/example/flavors).\n\n## :question: Troubleshooting\n\nListed a couple common issues with solutions for them\n\n### Generated icon color is different from the original icon\n\nCaused by an update to the image dependency which is used by Flutter Launcher Icons.\n\n```txt\nUse #AARRGGBB for colors instead of #AABBGGRR, to be compatible with Flutter image class.\n```\n\n[Related issue](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons/issues/98)\n\n### Image foreground is too big / too small\n\nFor best results try and use a foreground image which has padding much like [the one in the example](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons/blob/master/example/default_example/assets/images/icon-foreground-432x432.png).\n\n[Related issue](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons/issues/96)\n\n### Dependency incompatible\n\nYou may receive a message similar to the following\n\n```log\nBecause flutter_launcher_icons >=0.9.0 depends on args 2.0.0 and flutter_native_splash 1.2.0 depends on args ^2.1.1, flutter_launcher_icons >=0.9.0 is incompatible with flutter_native_splash 1.2.0.\nAnd because no versions of flutter_native_splash match >1.2.0 <2.0.0, flutter_launcher_icons >=0.9.0 is incompatible with flutter_native_splash ^1.2.0.\nSo, because enstack depends on both flutter_native_splash ^1.2.0 and flutter_launcher_icons ^0.9.0, version solving failed.\npub get failed (1; So, because enstack depends on both flutter_native_splash ^1.2.0 and flutter_launcher_icons ^0.9.0, version solving failed.)\n```\n\nFor a quick fix, you can temporarily override all references to a dependency: [See here for an example](https://github.com/fluttercommunity/flutter_launcher_icons/issues/262#issuecomment-879872076).\n\n## :eyes: Example\n\n[![Video Example](https://i.imgur.com/R28hqdz.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjNAxwcP3Tc)\n\nNote: This is showing a very old version (v0.0.5)\n\n### Special thanks\n\n- Thanks to Brendan Duncan for the underlying [image package](https://pub.dev/packages/image) to transform the icons.\n- Big thank you to all the contributors to the project. Every PR / reported issue is greatly appreciated!\n"
