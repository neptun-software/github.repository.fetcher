          "content": "# inKino - a multiplatform Dart project with code sharing between Flutter and web\n\n<img src=\"assets/screenshots/now_in_theaters.png\" width=\"32%\" /> <img src=\"assets/screenshots/showtimes.png\" width=\"32%\" /> <img src=\"assets/screenshots/event_details.png\" width=\"32%\" />\n\n## What is inKino?\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/roughike/inKino.svg?branch=development)](https://travis-ci.org/roughike/inKino)\n\ninKino is a _multiplatform_ Dart app for browsing movies and showtimes for Finnkino cinemas. \n\nInKino showcases Redux, has an extensive set of automated tests and **40% code sharing between Flutter and web**.\nThe Android & iOS apps are made with a single [Flutter](http://flutter.io) codebase. The progressive web app is made with [AngularDart](https://webdev.dartlang.org/angular). \nThis project is generally something that I believe is a good example of a multiplatform Dart project.\n\nI plan on doing a full article series on multiplatform Dart stuff, so you might want to [check out my blog](https://iirokrankka.com) and subscribe to it.\n\n<div>\n<a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.roughike.inkino'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='assets/screenshots/google_play.png' height='48px'/></a>\n<a href='https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/inkino/id1367181450'><img alt='Get it on the App Store' src='assets/screenshots/app_store.png' height='48px'/></a>\n<a href='https://inkino.app'><img alt='Get it on the App Store' src='assets/screenshots/launch_pwa.png' height='48px'/></a>\n</div>\n\n## Folder structure\n\nThere's three different folders. Each of them is a Dart project.\n\n* **core**: contains the pure Dart business logic, such API communication, Redux, XML parsing, sanitization, i18n, models and utilities. \nIt also has a great test coverage.\n* **mobile**: this is the Flutter project. It imports **core**, and it's a 100% shared codebase for the native Android & iOS apps that go on app stores.\n* **web**: the AngularDart progressive web app. Also imports **core**, and it's the thing that is live at https://inkino.app.\n\nTo work on these projects, open each one of them in an editor of your choice. \n\nFor example, if you want to do a new feature and you do it for the Flutter project first, you'd open both **core** and **mobile** in separate editor windows.\nTo clarify, you'd do `File -> Open...` for core and then `File -> Open...` again for mobile.\n\n## Development environment setup\n\n* [Install Dart for the web](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/sdk#install). The customized Dart version Flutter ships with is not suitable for web development.\n* Install [webdev](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/webdev) by running `pub global activate webdev`. This requires that you ran your Dart installation properly and Dart is part of your PATH.\n* Install an IDE. You can't go wrong with [WebStorm](https://webdev.dartlang.org/tools/webstorm). If that doesn't tickle your fancy, [there are other options too](https://www.dartlang.org/tools#ides).\n* Install the Dart plugin for your IDE.\n\nFinally, if you haven't already, [install Flutter](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/install).\nAnd the Flutter plugin for your IDE. \nAt the time of being, inKino is built with **Flutter 1.0**.\n\nIf you don't like IDEs, [you can apparently use Emacs or Vim too](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16822780).\n\n## Building the project\n\n### Renaming the TMDB configuration file\n\nYou don't need a TMDB API key, but the actor images won't load without it.\n\nIf you try to build the project straight away, you'll get an error complaining that a tmdb_config.dart file is missing.\nTo resolve that, run this on your terminal in the project root:\n\n```bash\ncd core/lib/src && mv tmdb_config.dart.sample tmdb_config.dart && cd ../../..\n```\n\n**OR**\n\nIf you don't trust in random bash scripts copied from the Internet, you can just rename the `tmdb_config.dart.sample` to `tmdb_config.dart` manually.\n\n### Building from source\n\nFirst, ensure that you followed the \"Development environment setup\" section above.\n\n* To run the **web project**, first run `pub get` initially, and then `webdev serve` in the root of the web project.\n* To run the **Flutter project**, open it in your editor and click the play button, or run `flutter run` on your terminal.\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! \nHowever, if it's going to be a major change, please create an issue first. \nBefore starting to work on something, please comment on a specific issue and say you'd like to work on it.\n\n## Thanks\n\nSpecial thanks to [Olli Haataja](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olli-haataja-46b96b120/) for the design. \n\nAdditional thanks for the initial release go to [Thibaud Colas](https://twitter.com/thibaud_colas), [Brian Egan](https://twitter.com/brianegan), [Alessandro Aime](https://twitter.com/aimealessandro) and [Juho Rautioaho](https://github.com/Jraut) for giving their extra pair of eyes for reviewing the source code.\n"
