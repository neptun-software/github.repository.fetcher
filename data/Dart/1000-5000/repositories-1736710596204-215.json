Cloning and setup\n\nMake sure that you are at least on **Dart SDK version 3.5.0**.\n\nClone the project with the following command:\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/schultek/jaspr.git\n```\n\nJaspr uses [Melos](https://github.com/invertase/melos) to manage the project and dependencies.\nTo install Melos, run the following command:\n\n```dart\ndart pub global activate melos\n```\n\nNext, at the root of your locally cloned repository run the bootstrap command:\n\n```dart\nmelos bootstrap\n```\n\nThe bootstrap command locally links all dependencies within the project without having to provide manual `dependency_overrides`. \nThis allows all packages, examples and tests to build from the local clone project.\n\n> You do not need to run `dart pub get` once bootstrap has been completed.\n\nThis also overrides the global `jaspr` command to use the local project, so you have the latest cli version.\nWhenever you change something in the `jaspr_cli` package and want to test it using the global `jaspr` command\nrun `melos activate:cli` to re-activate the package.\n\n### 2. Running tests and compute coverage\n\nTo run all tests across packages, run:\n\n```shell\nmelos run test\n```\n\nTo also compute the coverage and open the report in your browser, run:\n\n```shell\nmelos run coverage\n```\n\n### 3. Generate html component methods\n\nWhen you change something in the html component library, re-generate the component\nmethods by running:\n\n```shell\nmelos run generate:html\n```\n\n### 4. Generate cli scaffold\n\nWhen you change or add the `jaspr create` scaffold, re-generate the bundle for the cli by running:\n\n```shell\nmelos run generate:scaffold\n```\n\n## Pull Requests & Versioning\n\nPackages inside the /packages directory are versioned using the \n[semantic changelog](https://github.com/rrousselGit/semantic_changelog) approach.\n\nThat means that the owner of a pull request is responsible for declaring which package versions should be increased based\non the changes in the pull request. To mark a version change, edit the CHANGELOG.md file of the given package like this:\n\n```markdown\n## Unreleased <breaking/major/minor/patch>\n\n/_ insert description about the changes done by this PR _/\n\n## 1.2.3\n\n/_ content of the changelog before this PR _/\n```\n\nIf there is already a `Unreleased ...` section, simply add your changes to this section.\n\nIf you have changes in multiple packages, edit the changelogs of each affected package. Note that the `jaspr`, \n`jaspr_builder`, `jaspr_cli` and `jaspr_test` share a single changelog, so you only have to edit this once.\n\nFor a more detailed explanation of this, go to [semantic changelog](https://github.com/rrousselGit/semantic_changelog).\n"

Join our open [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/XGXrGEk4c6) of\n> developers around Jaspr and check out the [Contributing Guide](https://docs.page/schultek/jaspr/going_further/contributing).\n\n### Core Features\n\n- 💙 **Familiar**: Works with a similar component model to flutter widgets.\n- 🚀 **Powerful**: Comes with server side rendering out of the box.\n- ♻️ **Easy**: Syncs component state between server and client automatically.\n- ⚡️ **Fast**: Performs direct DOM updates only where needed.\n- 🎛 **Flexible**: Runs on the server, client or both with manual or automatic setup. You decide.\n\n> If you want to say thank you, star the project on GitHub and like the package on pub.dev 🙌💙\n\n### Online Editor & Playground\n\nInspired by DartPad, **Jaspr** has it's own online editor and playground, called **JasprPad**.\n\n[Check it out here!](https://jasprpad.schultek.de)\n\nYou can check out the samples, take the tutorial or try out jaspr for yourself, all live in the browser.\nWhen you want to continue coding offline, you can quickly download the current files bundled in a complete dart project, ready to start coding locally.\n\nJasprPad is also built with **Jaspr** itself, so you can [**check out its source code**](https://github.com/schultek/jaspr/tree/main/apps/jaspr_pad) to get a feel for how jaspr would be used in a larger app.\n\n![JasprPad Screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13920539/170837732-9e09d5f3-e79e-4ddd-b118-72e49456a7cd.png)\n\n## Differences to Flutter Web - Design Principles\n\nJaspr is an **alternative to Flutter Web**, when you want to **build any kind of website with Dart**.\n\nThe Flutter team itself has stated on multiple occasions that\n> Flutter Web is for building **Web-Apps**, not **Web-Sites**.\n\nThat just means that while Flutter Web is a great technology for sharing your apps across multiple\nplatforms including the web, it may not be suited for all types of websites that you want to build.\n\nJaspr works by giving you the familiar look and feel of the Flutter framework, while using native web\ntechnologies, like HTML, the DOM and CSS to enable you building **all** kinds of websites using **Dart**.\n\nInstead of trying to mirror every little thing from Flutter, `jaspr` tries to give a general Fluttery feeling\nby matching features where it makes sense without compromising on the unique properties of the web platform.\nRather it embraces these differences to give the best of both worlds.\n\n[More](https://docs.page/schultek/jaspr/jaspr-vs-flutter-web)\n\n## Directories\n\n- **/apps**: Production apps built with jaspr\n  - **/jaspr_pad**: Online Editor and Playground inspired by DartPad, built with jaspr.\n- **/docs**: Documentation hosted at [docs.page/schultek/jaspr](https://docs.page/schultek/jaspr)\n- **/examples**: Well-maintained and documented examples\n- **/experiments**: Experimental apps or features, that are not part of the core framework (yet?) (may be broken).\n- **/packages**:\n  - **/jaspr**: The core framework package.\n  - **/jaspr_builder**: Code-generation builders for jaspr.\n  - **/jaspr_cli**: The command line interface of jaspr.\n  - **/jaspr_flutter_embed**: Flutter element embedding bindings for jaspr.\n  - **/jaspr_lints**: A collection of lints and assists for jaspr projects.\n  - **/jaspr_riverpod**: Riverpod implementation for jaspr.\n  - **/jaspr_router**: A router implementation for jaspr.\n  - **/jaspr_test**: A testing package for jaspr.\n  - **/jaspr_tailwind**: A tailwind integration for jaspr.\n"
