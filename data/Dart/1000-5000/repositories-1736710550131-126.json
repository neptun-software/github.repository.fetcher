Below is our community code of conduct, which\napplies to our repos and organizations, issue trackers, Discord servers,\nblog content, and any other dahliaOS-supported communication group, as\nwell as any private communication initiated in the context of these\nspaces. This code of conduct must be followed by everyone contributing to\nthe dahliaOS project, regardless of affiliation or position.\n\nSimply put, community discussions should be\n\n * respectful and kind;\n * about software;\n * about features and code, not the individuals involved.\n\n## Be respectful and constructive.\n\nTreat everyone with respect. Build on each other's ideas. Each of us has the\nright to enjoy our experience and participate without fear of harassment,\ndiscrimination, or condescension, whether blatant or subtle. Remember that\ndahliaOS is a geographically distributed team and that you may not be\ncommunicating with someone in their primary language. We all get frustrated\nwhen working on hard problems, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn\ninto personal attacks.\n\n## Speak up if you see or hear something.\n\nYou are empowered to politely engage when you feel that you or others are\ndisrespected. The person making you feel uncomfortable may not be aware of what\nthey are doing - politely bringing their behavior to their attention is\nencouraged.\n\nIf you are uncomfortable speaking up, or feel that your concerns are not being\nduly considered, you can email the Project Integrity team at integrity@dahliaos.io to request involvement from a moderator. All\nconcerns shared with community managers will be kept confidential, but you may\nalso submit an anonymous report [here](dahlia-os.github.io/anon).\nPlease note that without a way to contact you, an anonymous report may be\ndifficult to act on. You may also create a throwaway account to report. In\ncases where a public response is deemed necessary, the identities of victims\nand reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us\notherwise.\n\nWhile all reports will be taken seriously, the Project Integrity Team may\nnot act on complaints that they feel are not violations of this code of\nconduct.\n\n## We will not tolerate harassment of any kind, including but not limited to:\n\n * Harassing comments\n * Intimidation\n * Arguing over subjective preference, e.g. text editors, nationality, religion, etc.\n * Encouraging a person to engage in self-harm.\n * Sustained disruption or derailing of threads, channels, lists, etc.\n * Offensive or violent comments, jokes or otherwise\n * Inappropriate sexual content\n * Unwelcome sexual or otherwise aggressive attention\n * Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease\n * Distribution or threat of distribution of people's personally identifying\n   information, AKA “doxing”\n\n## Consequences for failing to comply with this policy\n\nConsequences for failing to comply with this policy may include, at the sole\ndiscretion of the dahliaOS Project Integrity Team:\n\n * a request for an apology;\n * a private or public warning or reprimand;\n * a temporary ban from the Discord server, blog, dahliaOS repository or\n   organization, or other dahliaOS-supported communication group, including\n   loss of committer status;\n * a permanent ban from any of the above, or from all current and future\n   dahliaOS-supported communities, including loss of\n   committer status.\n\nParticipants warned to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply\nimmediately; failure to do so will result in an escalation of consequences.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Chromium Project Code of Conduct.\n\n## License\n\nThis Code of Conduct is available for reuse under the Creative Commons Zero\n(CC0) license.\n"

There are several methods to communicate with the core team:\n\n* [Discord](https://dahliaos.io/discord) - We use Discord for pinging people, sharing updates, quick and informal discussions, questions and answers, etc. It is OK to discuss your contribution, planned contribution, development idea, localization, documentation updates and similar topics in this server. Anyone interested in the project is welcome to join our Discord server and hang around.\n* [Telegram](https://dahliaos.io/telegram) - Same as Discord.\n* [Issues / pull requests](https://github.com/dahliaOS) - Most of the work is discussed here, including upgrades and proposals for upgrades, bug fixing and feature requests. For any of these, open an issue in the corresponding repository. If you are proposing code change, open a pull request.\n\nEach of them is intended for an specific purpose. Please understand that you may be redirected to some other mean if the communication you intend to have is considered to fit better elsewhere.\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by our Code of Conduct and no one is exempt.\nBy participating, you are expected to respect and value this code.\ndahliaOS Code of Conduct can be found [here](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\nIf you notice any unacceptable behaviour, we encourage you to report it to integrity@dahliaos.io\n\n## Contribute\n\nIn this document we've explained how you can contribute to our project, if you'd like to help out in a different way that is not documented here, you're always free to join our Discord and discuss other options you have in mind with our team.\n\nYou can contribute to the project by:\n\n* Reporting a bug.\n* Proposing new features.\n* Translating to your native language.\n* Submitting a fix.\n* Discussing the current state of code.\n* Becoming a maintainer.\n* Making a financial contribution.\n\n### Bug report\n\nIf you've experienced a bug and you'd like to report it, we highly recommend that you read [Before submitting a bug report](#before-submitting-a-bug-report) and [Writing a good bug report](#writing-a-good-bug-report) first, and that you also use our issue template.\n\nThere are 2 ways you can report a bug, either in our Discord server by **opening a ticket** or by **creating an issue** using the **bug report template** on GitHub.\n\n#### Before submitting a bug report\n\nBefore submitting a bug report, there are a few things you need to take in consideration:\n\n* Do a bit of research and check if a similar bug has already been reported.\n  * If it has been reported already, add a comment to the existing one instead of submitting a new one.\n\n#### Writing a good bug report\n\nWe have a few short tips for you on how to properly write a bug report so the developers can understand it better:\n\n* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue.\n* Describe the steps to reproduce the bug.\n* Describe what behaviour you observed after the bug occurred.\n* Explain what behaviour you expected to see instead and why.\n* If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before it happened.\n* Include screenshots of the bug.\n* Write what version of dahliaOS you were using.\n\nAnd the most important of all make sure to fill in as many fields as possible in our bug report template.\n\n#### Submitting a bug report\n\n* **GitHub**:\n    1. Click the **Issues** tab\n    1. Click **New issue**\n    1. Select the **Bug report** template\n    1. Fill in the fields\n* **Discord**:\n    1. Go to the **#bug-report** channel\n    1. Open a **ticket** and copy the **form**\n    1. Paste and fill in the form\n\n### Feature request\n\nIf you'd like to see something added to dahliaOS, we highly recommend that you read [Before submitting a feature request](#before-submitting-a-feature-request) and [Submitting a feature request](#submitting-a-feature-request) first, and that you also use our feature request template.\n\nTo submit a feature request, **create an issue** using the **feature request template** on GitHub.\n\n#### Before submitting a feature request\n\nBefore submitting a feature request, here are a few things you need to know:\n\n* Make sure the feature isn't already added.\n* Don't hesitate to express your knowledge.\n* Write a clear and descriptive title for the request.\n* Explain how the project could benefit of your request.\n\n#### Submitting a feature request\n\n* **GitHub**:\n    1. Click the **Issues** tab\n    1. Click **New issue**\n    1. Select the **Feature request** template\n    1. Fill in the fields\n\n### Pull request\n\nPull requests to our repositories are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, pull requests should:\n\n* Fix an existing issue or add a new feature.\n* Be accompanied by a complete pull request template (loaded automatically when a pull request is created).\n\nFor changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.\n\n#### Before submitting a pull request\n\nTo make sure that the pull request you want to submit is up to our standards, we've written a few dos and don'ts:\n\n**Dos**:\n\n* Provide a meaningful commit message.\n* The first line of the commit message should have the format \"Category: Brief description of what's being changed\". The \"category\" can be a subdirectory, but also something like \"POSIX compliance\" or \"ClassName\".\n* Write your commit messages in proper English, with care and punctuation.\n* Use the present tense (\"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\")\n* Use the imperative mood (\"Move cursor to...\" not \"Moves cursor to...\")\n* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less\n* You may want to create a topic branch for larger contributions.\n* Split your changes into separate commits.\n\n**Don'ts**:\n\n* Touch anything outside the stated scope of the pull request.\n* Use weasel-words like \"refactor\" or \"fix\" to avoid explaining what's being changed.\n\n#### How to submit a proper pull request\n\n1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account\n1. **Clone** the project to your machine\n1. Make your **changes**\n1. **Push** changes to your fork\n1. **Open a pull request** in our repository and **fill** in the pull request template\n\n#### After submitting a pull request\n\nWe kindly ask everyone who has submitted a pull request to be patient, we notice every new pull request so don't worry about it being ignored, we'll be on it as soon as possible.\n\n### Translations\n\nWe aim to provide our software in as many languages as possible so everyone could experience it in their own native language.\nFor submitting translations, we use Crowdin so please do not edit the files found in the repositories.\nIf you're interesting in translating our project, click [here](https://translate.dahliaos.io).\n**Note**: If the language you're looking to translate to is not added, let us know and we'll add it right away.\n\n#### Before making a translation\n\nBefore making a translation, please make sure that:\n\n* You're fluent in the language you're translating to.\n* You pay close attention to grammar.\n* You read the context (comments) some strings have.\n* You used the same punctuation as the source strings.\n\n#### How to translate\n\n1. Create a **Crowdin** account (if you already don't have one)\n1. Join our **workspace**\n1. Pick a **project** to translate\n1. Apply translations to the available strings\n\n### Code contributions\n\nTo make sure that the code you want to contribute is up to our standards, we've written a few dos and don'ts:\n\n**Dos**:\n\n* Choose expressive variable, function and class names, make it as obvious as possible of what the code is doing.\n\n**Don'ts**:\n\n* Submit code that's incompatible with the project license (Apache 2.0).\n* Include commented-out code.\n\n#### First code contribution\n\nIf you're not yet familiar with the development of dahliaOS, you can tackle tasks labeled with the \"good first issue\" label on our GitHub as they are more suited for newcomers looking to gain some experience.\n\n### Design contributions\n\nApart from code contributions, we also accept various kinds of design contributions.\n\nHere are a few repositories where you can contribute designs:\n\n* [wallpapers](https://github.com/dahliaos/wallpapers)\n  * Contribute your own wallpapers made for dahliaOS.\n* [icons](https://github.com/dahliaos/icons)\n  * Contribute/propose new or modified icons for dahliaOS.\n* [brand](https://github.com/dahliaos/brand)\n  * Contribute/propose new or modified logos of our brand.\n* [press-kit](https://github.com/dahliaos/press-kit)\n  * Contribute mockups, screenshots, graphics, marketing material and such for dahliaOS.\n\nWe love seeing concepts and designs, feel free to share them with us on our social media!\n\n### Financial contributions\n\ndahliaOS is an Apache 2.0-licensed free open source project that financially relies mainly on donations.\nDonations helps us pay the bills (web hosts, domains, software/hardware, etc.) to keep this project on its feet as long as possible.\nIf you're interested in sending a donation to dahliaOS, click [here](https://dahliaos.io/donate) to find out where you can do so. Another way you can find donation links is by clicking the Sponsors button in most of our GitHub repositories.\n\n### Finding tasks\n\nIf you're interested in contributing to dahliaOS but don't know what you can assist us with, you can find available tasks by:\n\n* Peeking at GitHub issues / projects\n* Asking in our Discord or Telegram\n\n## License\n\nBy contributing to dahliaOS, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [Apache 2.0](LICENSE) license.\n"

Install development tools\n\n1. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)\n2. Install an IDE of your choice (we recommend [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))\n    * We also recommend installing Dart and Flutter extensions if you're opting in for VSCode.\n    For other IDEs, please inform yourself.\n\n### Step 2. Run Pangolin\n\n**Note**: You can run Pangolin on any platform that Flutter supports but we recommend running it on Linux as some features of Pangolin are designed exclusively for Linux and won't work on other platforms.\n\nRun Pangolin by running:\n\n```\nmake run target=linux\n```\n\nList of targets:\n- linux\n- windows\n- macos\n\nFlutter has hot reloading so no need to restart the instance when it's running!\n\n## Contribute\n\nIf you're wondering how to contribute to the project, please refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md)\n\n## Translate\n\nIf you're interested in translating Pangolin, click [here](https://github.com/dahliaOS/pangolin_desktop/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#translations) for more information on how to do so!\n\n\n## License\n\n<p align=\"left\">\n  <img width=\"30%\" src=\"https://github.com/dahliaOS/brand/blob/main/dahliaOS/logotype/svg/logotype-dark.svg#gh-dark-mode-only\"/>\n  <img width=\"30%\" src=\"https://github.com/dahliaOS/brand/blob/main/dahliaOS/logotype/svg/logotype-light.svg#gh-light-mode-only\"/>\n</p>\n\nCopyright @ 2019-2023 - The dahliaOS Authors - contact@dahliaos.io\n\nThis project is licensed under the [Apache 2.0 license](/LICENSE)\n"
