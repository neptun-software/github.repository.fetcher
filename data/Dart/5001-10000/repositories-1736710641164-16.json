Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

[Here is a link to a good PR made to this repo.](https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/pull/130)\n1. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/issues) first, before filing an issue.\n1. **Make sure you follow the set standard as all other projects in this repo do**\n    > **Make sure the package name conforms to the format: `github.nisrulz.<app_name>`**\n\n## Extra\nSince the repo is pretty large now, I am sure many folks would like to download only some of the projects. To tackle that follow the steps below:\n  - Install `svn` using homebrew (Mac/Linux)\n    ```bash\n    brew install svn\n    ```\n  - Copy the name of the example folder in this repo i.e `simple_material_app`\n  - Next, replace `example_folder` in the below command:\n\n    ```bash\n    svn checkout https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/trunk/example_folder\n    ```\n    i.e Consider `simple_material_app` is the name of the example's folder, the command becomes:\n    ```bash\n    svn checkout https://github.com/nisrulz/flutter-examples/trunk/simple_material_app\n    ```\n  - Done! You should have the specific example all checked out!\n\n## Author & support\nThis project was created by [Nishant Srivastava](https://github.com/nisrulz/nisrulz.github.io#nishant-srivastava) but hopefully developed and maintained by many others.
