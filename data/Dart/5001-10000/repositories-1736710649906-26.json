To resolve that,\n\n1.  Open r\\Flutter-UI-Kit-master\\android\\app\\build.gradle file and comment following lines-\n\n```\n//keystoreProperties.load(new FileInputStream(keystorePropertiesFile))\n\nsigningConfigs {\n// release {\n// keyAlias keystoreProperties['keyAlias']\n// keyPassword keystoreProperties['keyPassword']\n// storeFile file(keystoreProperties['storeFile'])\n// storePassword keystoreProperties['storePassword']\n// }\n}\nbuildTypes {\n// release {\n// signingConfig signingConfigs.release\n// }\n}\n```\n\n2.  Open r\\Flutter-UI-Kit-master\\android\\local.properties and add -\n\n```\nflutter.versionName=1.0.0\nflutter.versionCode=1\nflutter.buildMode=release\n```\n\n### The stack & building from source\n\nThe project is currently built using the latest Flutter Master, with Dart 2 enabled.\n\nTo build the project, ensure that you have a recent version of the Flutter SDK installed. Then either run `flutter run` in the project root or use your IDE of choice.\n\n## Contribution Guide\n\nThis project is open to all kinds of contribution in all of its categories. **Together, we can make it the ultimate Flutter UIKit available for free, for everyone, forever.**\n\nFor resource contribution, just follow the following format: `[reference-name](link) - Description`, and raise a Pull Request. If you want to contribute multiple resources, raise separate PRs for each of them. Please consider adding resources maintaining the default sorting order of the category, like alphabetical sorting.\n\nIf you have any suggestion for including more categories, feel free to open a Github issue for us to have more discussion on it. Please **DO NOT** contribute low-quality, spammy or self-promotional stuff. **Let's keep this project clean and useful.**\n\nIf you feel that a particular resource(s)/template(s) available here is not a good fit for this project and should be removed, feel free to let me know by opening an issue.\n\n### :heart: Found this project useful?\n\nIf you found this project useful, then please consider giving it a :star: on Github and sharing it with your friends via social media.\n\n## Project Created & Maintained By\n\n### Pawan Kumar\n\nGoogle Developer Expert for Flutter.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.
