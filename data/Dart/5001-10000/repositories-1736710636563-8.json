You may utilize these plans to practice with a specific goal in mind. Any implementation is solely based on personal comprehension and learning. Should there be any superior implementation strategies, I welcome the opportunity for discussion.\n\n## Preview\n\nSome of the page effects are as follows:\n\n| ![](./preview/Screenshot_1.png)    |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_2.png)    | ![](./preview/Screenshot_3.png)   |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_4.png)   |\n| :--------------------------------: | :---------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------------:  |\n| ![](./preview/Screenshot_5.png)    |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_6.png)    | ![](./preview/Screenshot_7.png)   |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_8.png)   |\n| ![](./preview/Screenshot_9.png)    |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_10.png)   | ![](./preview/Screenshot_11.png)  |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_12.png)  |\n| ![](./preview/Screenshot_13.png)   |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_14.png)   | ![](./preview/Screenshot_15.png)  |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_17.png)  |\n| ![](./preview/Screenshot_18.png)   |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_19.png)   | ![](./preview/Screenshot_20.png)  |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_21.png)  |\n| ![](./preview/Screenshot_22.jpg)   |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_23.jpg)   | ![](./preview/Screenshot_24.jpg)  |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_25.jpg)  |\n| ![](./preview/Screenshot_26.jpg)   |  ![](./preview/Screenshot_27.jpg)   | ![](./preview/lottie.gif)         |  |\n\n**If you find this project satisfactory, kindly show your support by giving it a Star or Fork. Rest assured, this project is being continuously maintained and any issues can be brought to our attention by submitting an Issue.**\n\n## Realizing the content.\n\n* MVP pattern\n* State management using `provider` (version 6.x)\n* Network request encapsulation based on `dio` (version 5.x)\n* Integration testing and accessibility testing\n* Support for dark mode\n* Localization（Thanks to @ghedwards）\n* Implementation of complex scrolling effects using `Sliver` series components\n* Location selection using AMap (supports Web)\n* Encapsulation of common widgets handling\n* Pull-to-refresh and load-more functionality\n* Application update check\n* PopupWindow\n* QR code scanning functionality (using the qr_code_scanner plugin)\n* Menu switching animations (circular expansion, 3D flip)\n* Swipe-to-delete\n* City selection\n* Three-level linkage selection similar to JD's city selection\n* Various custom dialogs\n* Sticky header for lists\n* Password input keyboard\n* Verification code input box\n* Custom simple calendar\n* Line chart and [pie charts](https://dartpad.cn/d06f8f737d6eb2d87978eb2d14b87864)\n* Modularized route management\n* More demos (ripple animation, scratch card, lottie)\n* More detailed optimizations\n\nYou may download and experience it specifically by accessing the following links:\n\nFor the Android version, kindly click on the link provided: [Download here](https://www.pgyer.com/oEm8me), and enter the password: `111111`.\n\nAs for iOS, you will need to download and run the code on your own.\n\nFor web experience, please visit: https://simplezhli.github.io/flutter_deer/\n\n## The project's operational environment.\n\n[![flutter_deer driver](https://github.com/simplezhli/flutter_deer/actions/workflows/flutter-drive.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/simplezhli/flutter_deer/actions/workflows/flutter-drive.yml)\n\n    1. Flutter version 3.27.0\n\n    2. Dart version 3.6.0\n\n## Precautions to be taken.\n\n- In debug mode, there may be some lagging, which is considered a normal occurrence. A satisfactory experience requires the creation of a release package. To create a release version for iOS, execute the command `flutter build ios`. For Android, execute the command `flutter build apk`.\n\n- If there are any issues with the project's execution, please refer to the [iOS issue summary](./docs/iOS问题汇总.md) and [Android issue summary](./docs/Android问题汇总.md) for possible solutions.\n\n- Due to certain plugin limitations, this project is only available for preview on Windows and macOS. Those interested may run and experience it themselves.\n        \n- To view the functionality demonstration, execute the integration test command `flutter drive --target=test_driver/driver.dart`.\n\n- Due to the abundance of pages, it may be difficult to match the design at first. However, I have added the relative path of the design in the code comments, which can be searched or located for the corresponding page. I hope this will be helpful to you.\n\n- This project uses the [FlutterJsonBeanFactory](https://github.com/zhangruiyu/FlutterJsonBeanFactory) plugin to generate Beans.\n\n- Web performance may be slower due to large resource files such as js and deployment on Github.\n\n## Summary of Experience\n\n- [Flutter开发中的一些Tips(一)](https://weilu.blog.csdn.net/article/details/90546727)\n\n-

Flutter version 3.27.0\n\n    2. Dart version 3.6.0\n\n## 注意事项\n\n- `debug`模式下会有部分卡顿现象，这属于正常现象。良好的体验需要打`release` 包。\n    iOS可以执行命令`flutter build ios` 以创建`release`版本。\n    Android可以执行命令`flutter build apk` 以创建`release`版本。\n\n- 项目运行有问题可以在[iOS问题汇总](./docs/iOS问题汇总.md)、[Android问题汇总](./docs/Android问题汇总.md)中尝试寻找解决办法。\n\n- 由于部分插件的原因，本项目在Windows、macOS仅做预览（主要为原生功能方面，UI问题不大）。有兴趣的可自行运行体验。\n\n- 可以执行集成测试命令`flutter drive --target=test_driver/driver.dart` 查看功能演示。\n\n- 因为页面有点多，一开始可能会导致页面无法与设计图对应上。我在代码注释中有添加设计图的相对路径，可以搜索或查找到对应页面，希望对你有帮助。\n\n- 本项目使用[FlutterJsonBeanFactory](https://github.com/zhangruiyu/FlutterJsonBeanFactory)插件来生成Bean。\n\n- Web受制于js等资源过大和部署在Github上，访问会慢一些。\n\n## 心得总结（推荐阅读）\n\n-

部分使用的到的三方库没有适配3.0.0，flutter_swiper（flutter_swiper_null_safety_flutter3替代）、flustars（flustars_flutter3替代）、azlistview（升级scrollable_positioned_list）。\n\n- 3.10.0 已知存在问题(#105203 #113595)\n\n- 2.0.0 已知存在问题(#68571 #73351 #74890 #79773 #79931)\n\n- ListView在没有设置分割线的情况下，个别Item之间存在大约1像素的间隔（[像素对齐问题](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14288)）。\n\n- 其他历史问题见docs目录下的问题汇总。\n\n## Thanks For\n\n-
