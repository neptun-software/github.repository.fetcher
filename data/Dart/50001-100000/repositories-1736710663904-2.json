Please create an issue to notify us!\n\n- Traditional Linux distributions (Debian, Fedora, etc.)\n- (Your idea here)\n\n## Notes\n\nUseful notes.\n\n### Compile production APK\n\nYou will need the signing keys to generate an APK.\n\nEither generate one or use the debug signing options:\n\n```groovy\n// File: android/app/build.gradle\nbuildTypes {\n  release {\n    signingConfig signingConfigs.debug // using debug signing\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Bump Flutter\n\nSuppose we want to update flutter to `3.7.8` (see https://github.com/localsend/localsend/commit/7b95a7a5600db2742a9e05b956d0415d871239d5):\n\n1. Update flutter from fvm: `fvm use 3.7.8`\n2. Update flutter from submodule:\n   1. `git submodule update --init`\n   2. `cd submodules/flutter`\n   3. `git fetch`\n   4. `git checkout 3.7.8`\n   5. `cd ../..`\n   6. `git add submodules/flutter`\n3. Update flutter constraints:\n   1. In CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`\n   2. In pubspec: `pubspec.yaml`\n\n### Release\n\nMake sure to set up the self-hosted runner to compile arm64 linux binaries.\n\nTo set up the runner, follow the following instructions:\n\nInstall Flutter\n\n```bash\nsudo apt install git\ngit clone https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git $HOME/flutter\nnano $HOME/.bashrc\n```\n\nAdd the following to the end of the file:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:$HOME/flutter/bin\"\n```\n\nRestart the terminal.\n\n```bash\nflutter doctor\n```\n\nNext, follow the instructions to set up the GitHub runner.\n\nStart the \"Release Draft\" workflow from the \"Actions\" tab: https://github.com/localsend/localsend/actions/workflows/release.yml\n\nFinally, compile binaries not yet supported by the pipeline.\n"

However, if you are having trouble sending or receiving files, you may need to configure your firewall to allow LocalSend to communicate over your local network.\n\n| Traffic Type | Protocol | Port  | Action |\n|--------------|----------|-------|--------|\n| Incoming     | TCP, UDP | 53317 | Allow  |\n| Outgoing     | TCP, UDP | Any   | Allow  |\n\nAlso make sure to disable AP isolation on your router. It should be usually disabled by default but some routers may have it enabled (especially guest networks).\nSee [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for more information.\n\n**Portable Mode**\n\n(Introduced in v1.13.0)\n\nCreate a file named `settings.json` located in the same directory as the executable.\nThis file can be empty.\nThe app will use this file to store settings instead of the default location.\n\n**Start hidden**\n\n(Updated in v1.15.0)\n\nTo start the app hidden (only in tray), use the `--hidden` flag (example: `localsend_app.exe --hidden`).\n\nOn v1.14.0 and earlier, the app starts hidden if `autostart` flag is set, and the hidden setting is enabled.\n\n## How It Works\n\nLocalSend uses a secure communication protocol that allows devices to communicate with each other using a REST API. All data is sent securely over HTTPS, and the TLS/SSL certificate is generated on the fly on each device, ensuring maximum security.\n\nFor more information on the LocalSend Protocol, see the [documentation](https://github.com/localsend/protocol).\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo compile LocalSend from the source code, follow these steps:\n\n1. Install Flutter [directly](https://flutter.dev) or using [fvm](https://fvm.app) (see [version required](.fvmrc))\n2. Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)\n3. Clone the `LocalSend` repository\n4. Run `cd app` to enter the app directory\n5. Run `flutter pub get` to download dependencies\n6. Run `flutter run` to start the app\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> LocalSend currently requires an older Flutter version (specified in [.fvmrc](.fvmrc))\n> and thus build issues may be caused by a mismatch between the required and the (system-wide) installed Flutter version.  \n> To make development more consistent, LocalSend uses [fvm](https://fvm.app) to manage the project Flutter version.\n> After installing `fvm`, run `fvm flutter` instead of `flutter`.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe welcome contributions from anyone interested in helping improve LocalSend. If you'd like to contribute, there are a few ways to get involved:\n\n### Translation\n\nYou can help translate LocalSend into other languages. We use the [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/localsend/app) platform to manage translations.\n\nAlternatively, you can also contribute by forking this repository and adding translations manually.\n\nThe translations are located in the [app/assets/i18n](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/tree/main/app/assets/i18n) directory. Edit the `_missing_translations_<locale>.json` or `strings_<locale>.i18n.json` file to add or update translations.\n\n<a href=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/localsend/\">\n<img src=\"https://hosted.weblate.org/widget/localsend/app/multi-auto.svg\" alt=\"Translation status\" />\n</a>\n\n**_Take note:_ Fields decorated with `@` are not meant to be translated; they are not used in the app in any way, being merely informative text about the file or to give context to the translator.**\n\n### Bug Fixes and Improvements\n\n- **Bug Fixes:** If you find a bug, please create a pull request with a clear description of the issue and how to fix it.\n- **Improvements:** Have an idea for how to improve LocalSend? Please create an issue first to discuss why the improvement is needed.\n\nFor more information, see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/localsend/localsend/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n| Issue              | Platform (Sending) | Platform (Receiving) | Solution                                                                                                                                |\n|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Device not visible | Any                | Any                  | Make sure to disable AP-Isolation on your router.
