          "content": "# Vite Contributing Guide\n\nHi! We're really excited that you're interested in contributing to Vite! Before submitting your contribution, please read through the following guide. We also suggest you read the [Project Philosophy](https://vite.dev/guide/philosophy) in our documentation.\n\nYou can use [StackBlitz Codeflow](https://stackblitz.com/codeflow) to fix bugs or implement features. You'll see a Codeflow button on issues to start a PR to fix them. A button will also appear on PRs to review them without needing to check out the branch locally. When using Codeflow, the Vite repository will be cloned for you in an online editor, with the Vite package built in watch mode ready to test your changes. If you'd like to learn more, check out the [Codeflow docs](https://developer.stackblitz.com/codeflow/what-is-codeflow).\n\n[![Open in Codeflow](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_codeflow.svg)](https://pr.new/vitejs/vite)\n\n## Repo Setup\n\nTo develop locally, fork the Vite repository and clone it in your local machine. The Vite repo is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces. The package manager used to install and link dependencies must be [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).\n\nTo develop and test the core `vite` package:\n\n1. Run `pnpm i` in Vite's root folder.\n\n2. Run `pnpm run build` in Vite's root folder.\n\n3. If you are developing Vite itself, you can go to `packages/vite` and run `pnpm run dev` to automatically rebuild Vite whenever you change its code.\n\nYou can alternatively use [Vite.js Docker Dev](https://github.com/nystudio107/vitejs-docker-dev) for a containerized Docker setup for Vite.js development.\n\n> Vite uses pnpm v8. If you are working on multiple projects with different versions of pnpm, it's recommended to enable [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) by running `corepack enable`.\n\n### Ignoring commits when running `git blame`\n\nWe have a `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file to ignore formatting changes.\nTo make this file used by `git blame`, you need to run the following command.\n\n```sh\ngit config --local blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs\n```\n\n## Documentation\n\nTo develop the `docs/` site:\n\n1. Run `pnpm run build` in Vite's root folder. This will generate the types for `twoslash` to work in the code examples. If the types are not available, errors will be logged in step 2 but does not prevent the site from working.\n\n2. Run `pnpm run docs` in Vite's root folder.\n\n## Debugging\n\nTo use breakpoints and explore code execution, you can use the [\"Run and Debug\"](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) feature from VS Code.\n\n1. Add a `debugger` statement where you want to stop the code execution.\n\n2. Click the \"Run and Debug\" icon in the activity bar of the editor, which opens the [_Run and Debug view_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_run-and-debug-view).\n\n3. Click the \"JavaScript Debug Terminal\" button in the _Run and Debug view_, which opens a terminal in VS Code.\n\n4. From that terminal, go to `playground/xxx`, and run `pnpm run dev`.\n\n5. The execution will stop at the `debugger` statement, and you can use the [Debug toolbar](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_debug-actions) to continue, step over, and restart the process...\n\n### Debugging Errors in Vitest Tests Using Playwright (Chromium)\n\nSome errors are masked and hidden away because of the layers of abstraction and sandboxed nature added by Vitest, Playwright, and Chromium. In order to see what's actually going wrong and the contents of the devtools console in those instances, follow this setup:\n\n1. Add a `debugger` statement to the `playground/vitestSetup.ts` -> `afterAll` hook. This will pause execution before the tests quit and the Playwright browser instance exits.\n\n2. Run the tests with the `debug-serve` script command, which will enable remote debugging: `pnpm run debug-serve resolve`.\n\n3. Wait for inspector devtools to open in your browser and the debugger to attach.\n\n4. In the sources panel in the right column, click the play button to resume execution, and allow the tests to run, which will open a Chromium instance.\n\n5. Focusing the Chromium instance, you can open the browser devtools and inspect the console there to find the underlying problems.\n\n6. To close everything, just stop the test process back in your terminal.\n\n## Testing Vite against external packages\n\nYou may wish to test your locally modified copy of Vite against another package that is built with Vite. For pnpm, after building Vite, you can use [`pnpm.overrides`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides) to do this. Note that `pnpm.overrides` must be specified in the root `package.json`, and you must list the package as a dependency in the root `package.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"dependencies\": {\n    \"vite\": \"^6.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"pnpm\": {\n    \"overrides\": {\n      \"vite\": \"link:../path/to/vite/packages/vite\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nAnd re-run `pnpm install` to link the package.\n\n## Running Tests\n\n### Integration Tests\n\nEach package under `playground/` contains a `__tests__` directory. The tests are run using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) with custom integrations to make writing tests simple. The detailed setup is inside `vitest.config.e2e.js` and `playground/vitest*` files.\n\nSome playgrounds define variants to run the same app using different config setups. By convention, when running a test spec file in a nested folder in `__tests__`, the setup will try to use a config file named `vite.config-{folderName}.js` at the playground's root. You can see an example of variants in the [assets playground](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/playground/assets).\n\nBefore running the tests, make sure that [Vite has been built](#repo-setup). On Windows, you may want to [activate Developer Mode](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development) to resolve [issues with symlink creation for non-admins](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/7390). Also, you may want to [set git `core.symlinks` to `true` to resolve issues with symlinks in git](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/issues/5242).\n\nEach integration test can be run under either dev server mode or build mode.\n\n- `pnpm test` by default runs every integration test in both serve and build mode, and also unit tests.\n\n- `pnpm run test-serve` runs tests only under serve mode.\n\n- `pnpm run test-build` runs tests only under build mode.\n\n- `pnpm run test-serve [match]` or `pnpm run test-build [match]` runs tests in specific packages that match the given filter. e.g. `pnpm run test-serve asset` runs tests for both `playground/asset` and `vite/src/node/__tests__/asset` under serve mode.\n\n  Note package matching is not available for the `pnpm test` script, which always runs all tests.\n\n### Unit Tests\n\nOther than tests under `playground/` for integration tests, packages might contain unit tests under their `__tests__` directory. Unit tests are powered by [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). The detailed config is inside `vitest.config.ts` files.\n\n- `pnpm run test-unit` runs unit tests under each package.\n\n- `pnpm run test-unit [match]` runs tests in specific packages that match the given filter.\n\n### Test Env and Helpers\n\nInside playground tests, you can import the `page` object from `~utils`, which is a Playwright [`Page`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page) instance that has already navigated to the served page of the current playground. So, writing a test is as simple as:\n\n```js\nimport { page } from '~utils'\n\ntest('should work', async () => {\n  expect(await page.textContent('.foo')).toMatch('foo')\n})\n```\n\nSome common test helpers (e.g. `testDir`, `isBuild`, or `editFile`) are also available in the utils. Source code is located at `playground/test-utils.ts`.\n\nNote: The test build environment uses a [different default set of Vite config](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/playground/vitestSetup.ts#L102-L122) to skip transpilation during tests to make it faster. This may produce a different result compared to the default production build.\n\n### Extending the Test Suite\n\nTo add new tests, you should find a related playground to the fix or feature (or create a new one). As an example, static assets loading is tested in the [assets playground](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/playground/assets). In this Vite app, there is a test for `?raw` imports with [a section defined in the `index.html` for it](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/playground/assets/index.html#L121):\n\n```html\n<h2>?raw import</h2>\n<code class=\"raw\"></code>\n```\n\nThis will be modified [with the result of a file import](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/playground/assets/index.html#L151):\n\n```js\nimport rawSvg from './nested/fragment.svg?raw'\ntext('.raw', rawSvg)\n```\n\n...where the `text` util is defined as:\n\n```js\nfunction text(el, text) {\n  document.querySelector(el).textContent = text\n}\n```\n\nIn the [spec tests](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/main/playground/assets/__tests__/assets.spec.ts#L180), the modifications to the DOM listed above are used to test this feature:\n\n```js\ntest('?raw import', async () => {\n  expect(await page.textContent('.raw')).toMatch('SVG')\n})\n```\n\n## Note on Test Dependencies\n\nIn many test cases, we need to mock dependencies using `link:` and `file:` protocols. `pnpm` treats `link:` as symlinks and `file:` as hardlinks. To test dependencies as if they were copied into `node_modules`, use the `file:` protocol. Otherwise, use the `link:` protocol.\n\nFor a mock dependency, make sure you add a `@vitejs/test-` prefix to the package name. This will avoid possible issues like false-positive alerts.\n\n## Debug Logging\n\nYou can set the `--debug` option to turn on debugging logs (e.g. `vite --debug resolve`). To see all debug logs, you can set `vite --debug *`, but be warned that it will be quite noisy. You can run `grep -r \"createDebugger('vite:\" packages/vite/src/` to see a list of available debug scopes.\n\n## Pull Request Guidelines\n\n- Checkout a topic branch from a base branch (e.g. `main`), and merge back against that branch.\n\n- If adding a new feature:\n\n  - Add accompanying test case.\n  - Provide a convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally, you should open a suggestion issue first, and have it approved before working on it.\n\n- If fixing a bug:\n\n  - If you are resolving a special issue, add `(fix #xxxx[,#xxxx])` (#xxxx is the issue id) in your PR title for a better release log (e.g. `fix: update entities encoding/decoding (fix #3899)`).\n  - Provide a detailed description of the bug in the PR. Live demo preferred.\n  - Add appropriate test coverage if applicable.\n\n- It's OK to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR. GitHub can automatically squash them before merging.\n\n- Make sure tests pass!\n\n- No need to worry about code style as long as you have installed the dev dependencies. Modified files are automatically formatted with Prettier on commit (by invoking [Git Hooks](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks) via [simple-git-hooks](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks)).\n\n- PR title must follow the [commit message convention](./.github/commit-convention.md) so that changelogs can be automatically generated.\n\n## Maintenance Guidelines\n\n> The following section is mostly for maintainers who have commit access, but it's helpful to go through if you intend to make non-trivial contributions to the codebase.\n\n### Issue Triaging Workflow\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    start{Followed issue\n        template?}\n    start --NO--> close1[\"Close and ask to\n        follow template\"]\n    start --YES--> dupe{Is duplicate?}\n    dupe --YES--> close2[Close and point\n        to duplicate]\n    dupe --NO--> repro{Has proper\n      reproduction?}\n    repro --NO--> close3[Label: 'needs reproduction'\n        bot will auto close if no update\n        has been made in 3 days]\n    repro --YES--> real{Is actually a bug?}\n    real --NO--> intended{Is the intended\n        behaviour?}\n    intended --YES--> explain[Explain and close\n        point to docs if needed]\n    intended --NO--> open[Keep open for discussion\n        Remove 'pending triage' label]\n    real --YES--> real2[\"① Remove 'pending triage' label\n        ② Add related feature label if applicable\n        (e.g. 'feat: ssr')\n        ③ Add priority and meta labels (see below)\"]\n    real2 --> unusable{Does the\n        bug make Vite\n        unusable?}\n    unusable --YES--> maj{Does the bug\n        affect the majority\n        of Vite users?}\n    maj --YES--> p5[p5: urgent]\n    maj --NO--> p4[p4: important]\n    unusable --NO--> workarounds{Are there\n        workarounds for\n        the bug?}\n    workarounds --NO--> p3[p3: minor bug]\n    workarounds --YES--> p2[p2: edge case\n        has workaround]\n```\n\n### Pull Request Review Workflow\n\n```mermaid\nflowchart TD\n    start{Bug fix\n        or\n        feature}\n    start --BUG FIX--> strict_bug{\"Is this a 'strict fix'?\n        i.e. fixes an obvious oversight with no side effects\"}\n    start --FEATURE--> feature[• Discuss feature necessity\n        • Is there a better way to address the need?\n        • Review code quality\n        • Add labels\n        • Add to milestone\n        • Add to Team Board]\n    feature -.-> approve_non_strict[• Run vite-ecosystem-ci if needed\n        • Approve if you feel strongly that the PR is needed and add to milestone]\n    strict_bug --YES--> strict[• Verify the fix locally\n        • Review code quality\n        • Require test case if applicable\n        • Request changes if necessary\n        • Add labels]\n    strict_bug --NO--> non_strict[Discuss the potential side effects of the fix, e.g.\n        • Could it introduce implicit behavior changes in other cases?\n        • Does it introduce too much changes?\n        • Add labels\n        • Add to Team Board]\n    non_strict -.-> approve_non_strict\n    strict --> approve_strict[Approve if ready to be merged]\n    approve_strict --> merge_strict[Merge if approved by 2 or more team members]\n    approve_non_strict -.-> merge_non_strict[Merge if approved by 2 or more team members and the PR has been discussed in a team meeting]\n    merge_non_strict -.-> merge_extra\n    merge_strict --> merge_extra[\"• Use 'Squash and Merge'\n        • Edit commit message to follow convention\n        • In commit message body, list relevant issues being fixed e.g. 'fix #1234, fix #1235'\"]\n```\n\n## Notes on Dependencies\n\nVite aims to be lightweight, and this includes being aware of the number of npm dependencies and their size.\n\nWe use Rollup to pre-bundle most dependencies before publishing! Therefore, most dependencies, even those used in runtime source code, should be added under `devDependencies` by default. This also creates the following constraints that we need to be aware of in the codebase.\n\n### Usage of `require()`\n\nIn some cases, we intentionally lazy-require some dependencies to improve start-up performance. However, note that we cannot use simple `require('somedep')` calls since these are ignored in ESM files, so the dependency won't be included in the bundle, and the actual dependency won't even be there when published since they are in `devDependencies`.\n\nInstead, use `(await import('somedep')).default`.\n\n### Think Before Adding a Dependency\n\nMost deps should be added to `devDependencies` even if they are needed at runtime. Some exceptions are:\n\n- Type packages. Example: `@types/*`.\n- Deps that cannot be properly bundled due to binary files. Example: `esbuild`.\n- Deps that ship their own types that are used in Vite's own public types. Example: `rollup`.\n\nAvoid deps with large transitive dependencies that result in bloated size compared to the functionality it provides. For example, `http-proxy` itself plus `@types/http-proxy` is a little over 1MB in size, but `http-proxy-middleware` pulls in a ton of dependencies that make it 7MB(!) when a minimal custom middleware on top of `http-proxy` only requires a couple of lines of code.\n\n### Ensure Type Support\n\nVite aims to be fully usable as a dependency in a TypeScript project (e.g. it should provide proper typings for VitePress), and also in `vite.config.ts`. This means technically a dependency whose types are exposed needs to be part of `dependencies` instead of `devDependencies`. However, this also means we won't be able to bundle it.\n\nTo get around this, we inline some of these dependencies' types in `packages/vite/src/types`. This way, we can still expose the typing but bundle the dependency's source code.\n\nUse `pnpm run build-types-check` to check that the bundled types do not rely on types in `devDependencies`.\n\nFor types shared between client and node, they should be added into `packages/vite/types`. These types are not bundled and are published as is (though they are still considered internal). Dependency types within this directory (e.g. `packages/vite/types/chokidar.d.ts`) are deprecated and should be added to `packages/vite/src/types` instead.\n\n### Think Before Adding Yet Another Option\n\nWe already have many config options, and we should avoid fixing an issue by adding yet another one. Before adding an option, consider whether the problem:\n\n- is really worth addressing\n- can be fixed with a smarter default\n- has workaround using existing options\n- can be addressed with a plugin instead\n\n## Release\n\nIf you have publish access, the steps below explain how to cut a release for a package. There are two phases for the release step: \"Release\" and \"Publish\".\n\n\"Release\" is done locally to generate the changelogs and git tags:\n\n1. Make sure the git remote for https://github.com/vitejs/vite is set as `origin`.\n2. In the `vite` project root `main` branch, run `git pull` and `pnpm i` to get it up-to-date. Then run `pnpm build`.\n3. Run `pnpm release` and follow the prompts to cut a release for a package. It will generate the changelog, a git release tag, and push them to `origin`. You can run with the `--dry` flag to test it out.\n4. When the command finishes, it will provide a link to https://github.com/vitejs/vite/actions/workflows/publish.yml.\n5. Click the link to visit the page, and follow the next steps below.\n\n\"Publish\" is done on GitHub Actions to publish the package to npm:\n\n1. Shortly in the workflows page, a new workflow will appear for the released package and is waiting for approval to publish to npm.\n2. Click on the workflow to open its page.\n3. Click on the \"Review deployments\" button in the yellow box, a popup will appear.\n4. Check \"Release\" and click \"Approve and deploy\".\n5. The package will start publishing to npm.\n\n## Docs Translation Contribution\n\nTo add a new language to the Vite docs, see [`vite-docs-template`](https://github.com/tony19/vite-docs-template/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n"

It consists of two major parts:\n\n- A dev server that serves your source files over [native ES modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), with [rich built-in features](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html) and astonishingly fast [Hot Module Replacement (HMR)](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement).\n\n- A [build command](https://vite.dev/guide/build.html) that bundles your code with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org), pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.\n\nIn addition, Vite is highly extensible via its [Plugin API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-plugin.html) and [JavaScript API](https://vite.dev/guide/api-javascript.html) with full typing support.\n\n[Read the Docs to Learn More](https://vite.dev).\n\n## Packages\n\n| Package                                         | Version (click for changelogs)                                                                                                    |\n| ----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [vite](packages/vite)                           | [![vite version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vite.svg?label=%20)](packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md)                                    |\n| [@vitejs/plugin-legacy](packages/plugin-legacy) | [![plugin-legacy version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@vitejs/plugin-legacy.svg?label=%20)](packages/plugin-legacy/CHANGELOG.md) |\n| [create-vite](packages/create-vite)             | [![create-vite version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/create-vite.svg?label=%20)](packages/create-vite/CHANGELOG.md)               |\n\n## Contribution\n\nSee [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE).\n\n## Sponsors\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/yyx990803\">\n    <img alt=\"sponsors\" src=\"https://sponsors.vuejs.org/vite.svg?v2\">\n  </a>\n</p>\n"
