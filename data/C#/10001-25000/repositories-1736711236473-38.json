This guide will help you understand how to select the appropriate license for our library, based on your usage context.\n\nThe licensing options for QuestPDF include the MIT license (which is free), and two tiers of paid licenses: the Professional License and the Enterprise License.\n\n### License Equality\n\nWe believe in offering the full power of QuestPDF to all our users, regardless of the license they choose.

However, you're welcomed and encouraged to support the project by purchasing a paid license if you find the library valuable.\n\n### Non-profit Usage\n\nIf you represent an open-source project, a charitable organization, or are using QuestPDF for educational purposes or training courses, you can also use QuestPDF for free under the MIT license.\n\n### Small Businesses\n\nFor companies generating less than $1M USD in annual gross revenue, you can use QuestPDF under the MIT license for free.\n\n### Larger Businesses\n\nCompanies with an annual gross revenue exceeding $1M USD are required to purchase a paid license.
