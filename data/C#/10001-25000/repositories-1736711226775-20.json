By contrast,\nour General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to\nshare and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free\nsoftware for all its users.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthem if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you\nwant it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new\nfree programs, and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights\nwith two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer\nyou this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute\nand/or modify the software.\n\n  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that\nimprovements made in alternate versions of the program, if they\nreceive widespread use, become available for other developers to\nincorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and\nencouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of\nsoftware used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.\nThe GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and\nletting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its\nsource code to the public.\n\n  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to\nensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available\nto the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to\nprovide the source code of the modified version running there to the\nusers of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on\na publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source\ncode of the modified version.\n\n  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and\npublished by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is\na different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has\nreleased a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under\nthis license.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n  0. Definitions.\n\n  \"This License\" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.\n\n  \"Copyright\" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of\nworks, such as semiconductor masks.\n\n  \"The Program\" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this\nLicense.  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".  \"Licensees\" and\n\"recipients\" may be individuals or organizations.\n\n  To \"modify\" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work\nin a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an\nexact copy.  The resulting work is called a \"modified version\" of the\nearlier work or a work \"based on\" the earlier work.\n\n  A \"covered work\" means either the unmodified Program or a work based\non the Program.\n\n  To \"propagate\" a work means to do anything with it that, without\npermission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for\ninfringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a\ncomputer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,\ndistribution (with or without modification), making available to the\npublic, and in some countries other activities as well.\n\n  To \"convey\" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other\nparties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through\na computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.\n\n  An interactive user interface displays \"Appropriate Legal Notices\"\nto the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible\nfeature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)\ntells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the\nextent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the\nwork under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If\nthe interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a\nmenu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.\n\n  1. Source Code.\n\n  The \"source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work\nfor making modifications to it.  \"Object code\" means any non-source\nform of a work.\n\n  A \"Standard Interface\" means an interface that either is an official\nstandard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of\ninterfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that\nis widely used among developers working in that language.\n\n  The \"System Libraries\" of an executable work include anything, other\nthan the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of\npackaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major\nComponent, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that\nMajor Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an\nimplementation is available to the public in source code form.  A\n\"Major Component\", in this context, means a major essential component\n(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system\n(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to\nproduce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.\n\n  The \"Corresponding Source\" for a work in object code form means all\nthe source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable\nwork) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to\ncontrol those activities.  However, it does not include the work's\nSystem Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free\nprograms which are used unmodified in performing those activities but\nwhich are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source\nincludes interface definition files associated with source files for\nthe work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically\nlinked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,\nsuch as by intimate data communication or control flow between those\nsubprograms and other parts of the work.\n\n  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users\ncan regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding\nSource.\n\n  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that\nsame work.\n\n  2. Basic Permissions.\n\n  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of\ncopyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated\nconditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited\npermission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a\ncovered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its\ncontent, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your\nrights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.\n\n  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not\nconvey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains\nin force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose\nof having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you\nwith facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with\nthe terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do\nnot control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works\nfor you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction\nand control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of\nyour copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.\n\n  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under\nthe conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10\nmakes it unnecessary.\n\n  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.\n\n  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological\nmeasure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article\n11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or\nsimilar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such\nmeasures.\n\n  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid\ncircumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention\nis effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to\nthe covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or\nmodification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's\nusers, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of\ntechnological measures.\n\n  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.\n\n  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you\nreceive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and\nappropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;\nkeep intact all notices stating that this License and any\nnon-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;\nkeep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all\nrecipients a copy of this License along with the Program.\n\n  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,\nand you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.\n\n  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.\n\n  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to\nproduce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the\nterms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified\n    it, and giving a relevant date.\n\n    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is\n    released under this License and any conditions added under section\n    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to\n    \"keep intact all notices\".\n\n    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this\n    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This\n    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7\n    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,\n    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no\n    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not\n    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.\n\n    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display\n    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive\n    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your\n    work need not make them do so.\n\n  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent\nworks, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,\nand which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,\nin or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an\n\"aggregate\" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not\nused to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users\nbeyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work\nin an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other\nparts of the aggregate.\n\n  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.\n\n  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms\nof sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the\nmachine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,\nin one of these ways:\n\n    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the\n    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium\n    customarily used for software interchange.\n\n    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product\n    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a\n    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as\n    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product\n    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a\n    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the\n    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical\n    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no\n    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this\n    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the\n    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.\n\n    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the\n    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This\n    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and\n    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord\n    with subsection 6b.\n\n    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated\n    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the\n    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no\n    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the\n    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to\n    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source\n    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)\n    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain\n    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the\n    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the\n    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is\n    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.\n\n    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided\n    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding\n    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no\n    charge under subsection 6d.\n\n  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded\nfrom the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be\nincluded in conveying the object code work.\n\n  A \"User Product\" is either (1) a \"consumer product\", which means any\ntangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,\nor household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation\ninto a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,\ndoubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular\nproduct received by a particular user, \"normally used\" refers to a\ntypical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status\nof the particular user or of the way in which the particular user\nactually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product\nis a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial\ncommercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent\nthe only significant mode of use of the product.\n\n  \"Installation Information\" for a User Product means any methods,\nprocedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install\nand execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from\na modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must\nsuffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object\ncode is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because\nmodification has been made.\n\n  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or\nspecifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as\npart of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the\nUser Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a\nfixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the\nCorresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied\nby the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply\nif neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install\nmodified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has\nbeen installed in ROM).\n\n  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a\nrequirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates\nfor a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for\nthe User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a\nnetwork may be denied when the modification itself materially and\nadversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and\nprotocols for communication across the network.\n\n  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,\nin accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly\ndocumented (and with an implementation available to the public in\nsource code form), and must require no special password or key for\nunpacking, reading or copying.\n\n  7. Additional Terms.\n\n  \"Additional permissions\" are terms that supplement the terms of this\nLicense by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.\nAdditional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall\nbe treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent\nthat they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions\napply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately\nunder those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by\nthis License without regard to the additional permissions.\n\n  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option\nremove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of\nit.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own\nremoval in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place\nadditional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,\nfor which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you\nadd to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of\nthat material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:\n\n    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the\n    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or\n\n    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or\n    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal\n    Notices displayed by works containing it; or\n\n    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or\n    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in\n    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or\n\n    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or\n    authors of the material; or\n\n    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some\n    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or\n\n    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that\n    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of\n    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for\n    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on\n    those licensors and authors.\n\n  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered \"further\nrestrictions\" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you\nreceived it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is\ngoverned by this License along with a term that is a further\nrestriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains\na further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this\nLicense, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms\nof that license document, provided that the further restriction does\nnot survive such relicensing or conveying.\n\n  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you\nmust place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the\nadditional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating\nwhere to find the applicable terms.\n\n  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the\nform of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;\nthe above requirements apply either way.\n\n  8. Termination.\n\n  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly\nprovided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or\nmodify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under\nthis License (including any patent licenses granted under the third\nparagraph of section 11).\n\n  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your\nlicense from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)\nprovisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and\nfinally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright\nholder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means\nprior to 60 days after the cessation.\n\n  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is\nreinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the\nviolation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have\nreceived notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that\ncopyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after\nyour receipt of the notice.\n\n  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the\nlicenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under\nthis License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently\nreinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same\nmaterial under section 10.\n\n  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.\n\n  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or\nrun a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work\noccurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission\nto receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,\nnothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or\nmodify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do\nnot accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a\ncovered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.\n\n  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.\n\n  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically\nreceives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and\npropagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible\nfor enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.\n\n  An \"entity transaction\" is a transaction transferring control of an\norganization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an\norganization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered\nwork results from an entity transaction, each party to that\ntransaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever\nlicenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could\ngive under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the\nCorresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if\nthe predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.\n\n  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the\nrights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may\nnot impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of\nrights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that\nany patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for\nsale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.\n\n  11. Patents.\n\n  A \"contributor\" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this\nLicense of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The\nwork thus licensed is called the contributor's \"contributor version\".\n\n  A contributor's \"essential patent claims\" are all patent claims\nowned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or\nhereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted\nby this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,\nbut do not include claims that would be infringed only as a\nconsequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For\npurposes of this definition, \"control\" includes the right to grant\npatent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of\nthis License.\n\n  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free\npatent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to\nmake, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and\npropagate the contents of its contributor version.\n\n  In the following three paragraphs, a \"patent license\" is any express\nagreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent\n(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to\nsue for patent infringement).  To \"grant\" such a patent license to a\nparty means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a\npatent against the party.\n\n  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,\nand the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone\nto copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a\npublicly available network server or other readily accessible means,\nthen you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so\navailable, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the\npatent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner\nconsistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent\nlicense to downstream recipients.  \"Knowingly relying\" means you have\nactual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the\ncovered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work\nin a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that\ncountry that you have reason to believe are valid.\n\n  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or\narrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a\ncovered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties\nreceiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify\nor convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license\nyou grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered\nwork and works based on it.\n\n  A patent license is \"discriminatory\" if it does not include within\nthe scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is\nconditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are\nspecifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered\nwork if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is\nin the business of distributing software, under which you make payment\nto the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying\nthe work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the\nparties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory\npatent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work\nconveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily\nfor and in connection with specific products or compilations that\ncontain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,\nor that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.\n\n  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting\nany implied license or other defenses to infringement that may\notherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.\n\n  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.\n\n  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a\ncovered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may\nnot convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you\nto collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey\nthe Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this\nLicense would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.\n\n  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the\nProgram, your modified version must prominently offer all users\ninteracting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version\nsupports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding\nSource of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source\nfrom a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary\nmeans of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source\nshall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3\nof the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the\nfollowing paragraph.\n\n  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have\npermission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed\nunder version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single\ncombined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this\nLicense will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,\nbut the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version\n3 of the GNU General Public License.\n\n  14. Revised Versions of this License.\n\n  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of\nthe GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions\nwill be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\n  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the\nProgram specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General\nPublic License \"or any later version\" applies to it, you have the\noption of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered\nversion or of any later version published by the Free Software\nFoundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the\nGNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published\nby the Free Software Foundation.\n\n  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future\nversions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's\npublic statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you\nto choose that version for the Program.\n\n  Later license versions may give you additional or different\npermissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any\nauthor or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a\nlater version.\n\n  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.\n\n  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY\nAPPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT\nHOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY\nOF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,\nTHE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM\nIS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF\nALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  16. Limitation of Liability.\n\n  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS\nTHE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY\nGENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE\nUSE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF\nDATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD\nPARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),\nEVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF\nSUCH DAMAGES.\n\n  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.\n\n  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided\nabove cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,\nreviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates\nan absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the\nProgram, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a\ncopy of the Program in return for a fee.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nstate the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published\n    by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License\n    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\n  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer\nnetwork, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to\nget its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its\ninterface could display a \"Source\" link that leads users to an archive\nof the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different\nsolutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the\nspecific requirements.\n\n  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,\nif any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if necessary.\nFor more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see\n<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."

          "content": "# Bitwarden and Open Source\n\nThe source code for all Bitwarden software products is hosted on GitHub and we welcome everyone to review, audit, and contribute to the Bitwarden codebase.\n\nWe believe that making our source code open and available is a defining feature of Bitwarden, and that source code transparency offers critically important customer benefits for security solutions like Bitwarden.\n\nAs an open solution, Bitwarden publishes the source code for various modules under different licenses.  We're providing this License Statement and FAQ document as an overview of our licensing philosophy, the specifics of module licensing, and to answer common questions regarding our licenses.\n\n# Bitwarden Software Licensing\n\nWe have two tiers of licensing for our software. The core products are offered under one of the GPL open source licenses: GPL 3 and  A-GPL 3. A select number of features, primarily those designed for use by larger organizations rather than individuals and families, are licensed under a \"Source Available\" commercial license [here](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/blob/main/LICENSE_BITWARDEN.txt).\n\nOur current software products have the following licenses:\n\n*Bitwarden clients:* The core password management code for individual password vaults, including Desktop, Web, Browser, Mobile, and CLI versions, is available under the GPL 3.0 license.\n\n*Bitwarden server:* The main Bitwarden server code is licensed under the AGPL 3.0 license.\n\n*Commercial.Core and SSO integration:* Code for certain new modules that are designed and developed for use by larger\norganizations and enterprise environments is released under the Bitwarden License, a \"source available\" license. The\nBitwarden License provides users access to product source code for non-production purposes such as development and\ntesting, but requires a paid subscription for production use of the product, and environments supporting production.\nAdditionally the Api module by default includes Commercial.Core which is under the Bitwarden License, however this can\nbe disabled by using `/p:DefineConstants=\"OSS\"` as an argument to `dotnet` while building the module.\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n\n***How can I contribute to Bitwarden open source projects?***\n\nWe welcome new members of our developer community and there are many ways for you to contribute to our projects. For more information visit our [Community Resources](https://community.bitwarden.com/), specifically our Forum on GitHub Contributions.\n\n***In your GitHub repositories, how can I determine what license applies to a given software program?***\n\nEach Bitwarden repository contains a `LICENSE.txt` file that spells out which license applies to the code in that repository.\n\nIn the case of the [Bitwarden server repository](https://github.com/bitwarden/server), the files are organized into various directories. These directories are not only used for logical code organization, but also to clearly distinguish the license that a given source file falls under. All source files under the `/bitwarden_license` directory at the root of the server repository are subject to the Bitwarden License. If a file is not organized under the `/bitwarden_license` directory, the AGPL 3.0 license applies.\n\n***Can I offer a managed service based on Bitwarden products?***\n\nAny individual or organization considering offering Bitwarden \"as a service\" must be mindful of the strong \"copyleft\" attributes of our open source licenses, as well as the Bitwarden License. With respect to the server software available under the Bitwarden License, production use requires a separate commercial agreement with Bitwarden. With respect to the server software available under the AGPL license, as software professionals we cannot conceive a scenario in which the offering of Bitwarden \"as-a-service\" would not involve a modification to the applicable Bitwarden code, thereby triggering the strong copyleft provisions of the AGPL 3.0 license. We encourage anyone considering offering Bitwarden as a service to join the Bitwarden Partner Program for access to the comprehensive resources and support we make available to our authorized solutions partners. Please [contact us](https://bitwarden.com/contact/) for information.\n\n***What rights do I receive under the \"Source Available\" Bitwarden License?*** \n\nUsers of software licensed under the Bitwarden License receive a right to use the software source code for non-production purposes of internal development and internal testing. The right to use the software in a production environment, or environments directly supporting production, requires a paid Bitwarden subscription. This approach is modeled on the licensing approaches taken by other successful open source companies including Elastic (NYSE: ESTC) and Confluent (NASDAQ: CFLT).\n\n***Is Bitwarden open source?***\n\nAs detailed above, the Bitwarden password management clients for individual use, the main Bitwarden server, and many libraries are available under the GPL family of licenses. The GPL licenses are widely used open source licenses created by the Free Software Foundation and endorsed as \"open source\" by the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/history). The Bitwarden License does not qualify as an open source license under the OSI definition, but we believe that the license successfully balances the principles of openness and community with our business goals.\n\n***If I redistribute or provide services related to Bitwarden open source software can I use the \"Bitwarden\" name?***\n\nOur licenses do not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or logos of Bitwarden (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice requirements as applicable). The Bitwarden trademark is a trusted mark applied to products distributed by Bitwarden, Inc., owner of the Bitwarden trademarks and products. We have adopted and enforce strict rules governing use of our trademarks. Use of any Bitwarden trademarks must comply with Bitwarden [Trademark Guidelines](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/blob/main/TRADEMARK_GUIDELINES.md).\n\n***Bitwarden Trademark Usage***\n\nBecause Open Source plays a major part in how we build our products, we see it as a matter of course to give the same effort back to our community by creating valuable, free and easy-to-use software. We need to make sure our trademarks remain distinctive so you know what you're getting and from who.\n\n***Do I need permission to use the Bitwarden Trademarks?***\n\nYou don't need permission to use our marks when truthfully referring to our products, services or features, or to explain that your products or services are based on our open- source code so long as not misleading. Any other use requires our permission.\n\n***How should I use the Bitwarden Trademarks when allowed?***\n\nUse the Bitwarden Trademarks exactly as [shown](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/blob/main/TRADEMARK_GUIDELINES.md) and without modification. For example, do not abbreviate, hyphenate, or remove elements and separate them from surrounding text, images and other features. Always use the Bitwarden Trademarks as adjectives followed by a generic term, never as a noun or verb.\n\nUse the Bitwarden Trademarks only to reference one of our products or services, but never in a way that implies sponsorship or affiliation by Bitwarden. For example, do not use any part of the Bitwarden Trademarks as the name of your business, product or service name, application, domain name, publication or other offering – this can be confusing to others.\n\n***Where can I find more information?***\n\nFor more information on how to use the Bitwarden Trademarks, including in connection with self-hosted options and open-source code, see our [Trademark Guidelines](https://github.com/bitwarden/server/blob/main/TRADEMARK_GUIDELINES.md) or [contacts us](https://bitwarden.com/contact/).\n"

          "content": "# TRADEMARK GUIDELINES\n\nThis document outlines the policy for allowable uses of trademarks owned by Bitwarden, Inc.\n(“Bitwarden\") by other parties.\n\nBitwarden owns all Bitwarden-related trademarks, service marks, and logos and the names of\nall Bitwarden® projects are trademarks of Bitwarden.\n\nThe role of trademarks is to provide assurance about the source and quality of the products or\nservices with which the trademark is associated. We want to allow members of the Bitwarden\ncommunity to discuss our products and services and to accurately describe their affiliation with\nBitwarden. Bitwarden has established this Policy to encourage others to make accurate,\nnon-confusing use of the Bitwarden trademarks, while also ensuring that those trademarks\nmaintain their distinctiveness and strength as reliable indicators of the source and quality of\nBitwarden products and services. Although some Bitwarden projects may be available under\nfree and open licenses, those licenses cover copyright only and do not include any express or\nimplied right to use our trademarks. Bitwarden does not allow third parties to use its\ntrademarks without a written agreement or express permission. Thus, Bitwarden projects that\nare available under open source licenses may be copied, modified, distributed or sold by third\nparties in accordance with the terms of the applicable open source license, but they cannot be\nbranded or marketed with Bitwarden trademarks in the absence of a trademark license.\n\nWhile open-source licenses allow modification of copyrighted software and distribution in\noriginal or modified form, such distribution could be misleading if distributed under the same\nname as the source project. This could cause confusion among consumers of the software as to\nsource. The consumers may mistakenly believe they are receiving software that is produced or\nsupported by Bitwarden. This Policy describes the circumstances under which you may use our\ntrademarks, regardless of the type of license you may have from Bitwarden. In this Policy we\nare not trying to limit the lawful use of our trademarks, but rather describe for you what we\nconsider the parameters of lawful use to be. Trademark law can be ambiguous, so we hope to\nprovide enough clarity for you to understand whether we will consider your use licensed or\nnon-infringing.\n\n## Our Trademarks\n\nThis Policy covers the following non-exhaustive list of our trademarks:\n\n1. Our trademarks and service marks (the \"Marks\"):\n    \n    - Bitwarden®\n    - ![Logo](https://i.imgur.com/FIv4bYq.png)\n\n2. The unique visual styling of our website and elements used in or otherwise related to\n    the products and services we offer (the \"Trade Dress\"). See our Style Guide for further\n    information.\n\nThis Policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether Word Marks, Logos or Trade\nDress, which are collectively referred to as the \"Marks.\" Some Marks may not be registered, but\nregistration is not necessarily required for ownership of trademarks. This Policy covers our\nMarks whether they are registered or not.\n\n## Universal Considerations for All Uses\n\nThe following guidelines show proper (and improper) use of Marks. Any use of the Marks must\nbe licensed and comply with these guidelines. Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must\nalways do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about\nexactly what they are getting and from whom. For example, you cannot say you are distributing\nthe Bitwarden® software when you're distributing a modified version of it, because people\nwould be confused when they are not getting the same features and functionality they would\nget if they downloaded the software directly from us. You also cannot distribute Bitwarden®\nsoftware using the Marks if you do not have a license from us, because that would imply that\nyour distribution comes from or is supported by Bitwarden. You cannot use our Marks on your\nwebsite in a way that suggests that your website is an official website or that we endorse your\nwebsite, unless permitted in a written agreement with us. You can, though, say you like the\nBitwarden® software, say that you participate in the Bitwarden® community, or refer to\nBitwarden® products and services if these statements are true.\n\nThis fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from\nwhom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure\nabout how you are using the Marks.\n\n## Standards for Use\n\nAll uses of Bitwarden Marks must conform to the following principles:\n\n1. You may use the Marks only to identify and distinguish Bitwarden products and services.\n    Our Marks may not be applied to products or services provided by anyone else.\n\n2. If you are self-hosting the Bitwarden software or using the Bitwarden software\n    on-premise, in each case under a subscription or license agreement with Bitwarden, you\n    may use the Bitwarden Marks to describe or reference the password management\n    platform or use the Bitwarden login page shown below for your users or organization:\n    \n    ![Login page](https://i.imgur.com/J0o51cO.png)\n\n3. You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of your own\n    trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name,\n    service name or social media handle/account.\n\n4. Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to\n    ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of any of our Marks or any\n    phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or\n    compatible product or service. This includes combinations or integrations of all or\n    portions of the Marks in a way that the public may think of the use as a new mark (e.g.\n    SuperBitwarden, or Bitwarden2.0).\n\n5. You may not use the Marks in a way that disparages or harms Bitwarden or our products\n    or services. You also may not use our Marks in connection with harmful or\n    objectionable materials of any sort.\n\n6. We reserve the right to object to any use of our Marks that we view as non-compliant\n    with these Trademark Guidelines or applicable law. By using our brand materials, you\n    agree to take all necessary steps to resolve any objections we have. You also\n    acknowledge that Bitwarden is the sole owner of Bitwarden Marks and goodwill derived\n    from their use accrues only to Bitwarden.\n\n7. Provided that you have obtained a license from Bitwarden, you can use the word mark in\n    books and articles as long as the use does not suggest that we have published, endorse,\n    or agree with your work.\n\nYou agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any goodwill generated by\nyour use of the Marks inures solely to our benefit.\n\n## Proper Use of the Marks\n\nAlways use the Word Marks in a manner distinguished from surrounding text, with initial capital\nletters, and in the exact form with the correct spelling (neither abbreviated, hyphenated, or\ncombined with any other word or words).\n\n**Correct**\n\n- Bitwarden®\n\n**Incorrect**\n\n- BITWARDEN\n- BitWarden\n- Bitward\n\n### Use Marks as Proper Adjectives Followed by a Generic Term.\n\nTrademarks should be used as adjectives followed by a generic modifier, and not as nouns\nor verbs. For example:\n\n**Correct**\n\n- The Bitwarden® platform is widely used in many industries.\n- I was able to quickly gain control over my organization's sensitive data with Bitwarden®\n    password management software.\n- I use the Bitwarden® application to manage my passwords.\n\n**Incorrect**\n\n- Bitwarden® is widely used.\n\n### Do Not Use Marks in the Possessive Form.\n\nBecause trademarks are not nouns, they should not be used in the possessive form.\nFor example:\n\n**Correct**\n\n- The Bitwarden® platform safely stores and protects passwords.\n\n**Incorrect**\n\n- Bitwarden's platform safely stores and protects passwords.\n\n### Do Not Use Marks to Suggest Endorsement by Bitwarden.\n\n**Correct**\n\n- Our platform was developed using Bitwarden® open source software\n\n**Incorrect**\n\n- \"Open Bitwarden\"\n- XYZ ENTERPRISE 3.4.9 (FREE AND OPEN UNRESTRICTED BITWARDEN ENTERPRISE FORK)\n\n## Use of Logos\n\nYou may not use our logos unless you have obtained written permission. If you have obtained a\nseparate license to use our logos, you may not change any logo except to scale it proportionally.\nThis means you may not add decorative elements, change the colors, change the proportions,\ndistort it, add elements, or combine it with other logos. The logo may only be used displaying\nthe exact colors shown in our Style Guide.\n\n## Mark Attribution and Notices\n\nThe first or most prominent mention of a Mark on a webpage, document, packaging, or\ndocumentation should be accompanied by a symbol indicating whether the Mark is a registered\ntrademark (\"®\") or an unregistered trademark (\"™\"). Also, if you are using our Marks for uses\nfor which we are granting a separate license, please put the following notice at the foot of the\npage where you have used the Mark (or, if in a book, on the credits page), on any packaging or\nlabeling, and on advertising or marketing materials: \"Bitwarden is a trademark or registered\ntrademark of Bitwarden, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries.\"\n\n## Possible Infringement\n\nIf you are aware of any confusing use or misuse of the Marks in any way, we would appreciate\nyou bringing this to our attention. Please contact us at <support@bitwarden.com> so that we can\ninvestigate it further.\n\n## Updates\n\nBitwarden reserves the right to modify or update this Policy at any time. You should review this\nPolicy from time to time so that you will be aware of any modifications or updates as they will\napply as soon as they are posted on this page.\n\n## Further Information\n\nBitwarden has tried to make this Trademark Policy as comprehensive and understandable as\npossible. If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact us.\n"
