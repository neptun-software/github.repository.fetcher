          "content": "# Contributing to Moq\n\nMoq welcomes your contributions! :heart:\n\n\n## Asking usage questions\n\nThis repository's focus is on the development of Moq (i.e. fixing bugs and improving features; see above). Because the Moq team is rather small, our resources to answer usage questions is very limited. You might be better off asking usage questions over at [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) as your question will meet with a much larger audience. Please observe SO's rules and etiquette, and tag your question with `moq`.\n\n\n## Submitting a bug report (as an issue)\n\nIf you think you've found a bug, please start by searching [the changelog](https://github.com/moq/moq/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/moq/moq/issues) (both open and closed ones!) to see if the problem has already been addressed or documented in any way.\n\nIf you find nothing of relevance, [open a new issue](https://github.com/moq/moq/issues/new).\n\n\n**What to include:** Try to include the following information in it:\n\n * a brief summary\n * minimal, complete, and verifiable repro code (similar to what you'd have to prepare for a Stack Overflow question; see e.g. [their documentation on \"How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example\"](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve)\n * a description of the expected (correct) outcome\n * a description of the actual (incorrect) outcome\n * Moq version used\n\n\n## Submitting a pull request (PR)\n\nUnless for very simple and straightforward changes, please open an issue first to discuss the PR you're about to submit with the Moq team.\n\n\n**What to include:** Once you do submit a PR, please include the following:\n\n * Unit tests whenever you add a bug fix, new feature, or when you change an existing one.\n\n * Your merged PR title will be included automatically in the changelog of the next release\n   if labeled as a bug fix, documentation update or feature.\n   Make sure it's a good short explanation of the bug/feature for that purpose.\n\n**Structuring your PR commits (example):** One good way, but not the only one, of structuring your PR might be to follow a test-first approach:\n\n 1. Start with a commit that adds one or more failing unit tests.\n\n 2. Add one or more commits that make these unit tests pass.\n\n 3. Add a final commit with a new changelog entry.\n\nOf course, if your changes are small, you might combine all these steps into fewer or even a single commit.\n\n\n**When a reviewer requests changes to your PR,** we encourage (but don't require) you to keep your PR tidy using any Git facilities available: You can rewrite your PR branch's history by amending existing commits, rebasing, etc., then force-pushing the changed commits to your PR branch. If you are not familiar enough with Git to do all of this, simply adding more commits to make requested changes is fine. A Moq team member merging your PR may decide to \"squash\" them into a single commit to keep the repository's history more easily readable.\n\n\n## Code style rules\n\n**Indentation, line endings, etc.**: The project includes a [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/) file. Please make sure your IDE can read this file so that indentation, line endings, etc. is kept consistent across the whole code base. When submitting a PR, try to keep your commit diffs free of whitespace-only changes.\n\n\n**Copyright notice:** If you add a new file to the solution, please reproduce the short copyright notice found at the beginning of existing files.\n\n\n**.NET code conventions:** The Moq codebase follows the usual .NET code conventions as documented e.g. in [Framework Design Guidelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/design-guidelines/); so following the existing conventions should be no big issue when adding new code.\n"

And it supports mocking interfaces as well as classes. Its API is extremely simple and straightforward, and doesn't require any prior knowledge or experience with mocking concepts.\n\n## Why?\n\nThe library was created mainly for developers who aren't currently using any mocking library (or are displeased with the complexities of some other implementation), and who are typically [manually writing their own mocks](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920165817/http://blogs.clariusconsulting.net/kzu/mocks-stubs-and-fakes-its-a-continuum/) (with more or less \"fanciness\"). Most developers in this situation also happen to be [quite pragmatic and adhere to state](https://web.archive.org/web/20200414170510/http://blogs.clariusconsulting.net/kzu/state-testing-vs-interaction-testing/) (or classic) TDD. It's the result of feeling that the barrier of entry from other mocking libraries is a bit high, and a simpler, more lightweight and elegant approach is possible. Moq achieves all this by taking full advantage of the elegant and compact C# and VB language features collectively known as LINQ (they are not just for queries, as the acronym implies).\n\nMoq is designed to be a very practical, unobtrusive and straight-forward way to quickly setup dependencies for your tests. Its API design helps even novice users to fall in the \"pit of success\" and avoid most common misuses/abuses of mocking. \n\nWhen it was conceived, it was the only mocking library that went against the generalized and somewhat unintuitive (especially for novices) Record/Replay approach from all other libraries (and [that might have been a good thing](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920165939/http://blogs.clariusconsulting.net/kzu/whats-wrong-with-the-recordreplyverify-model-for-mocking-frameworks/) ;)).\n\nNot using Record/Replay also means that it's straightforward to move common expectations to a fixture setup method and even override those expectations when needed in a specific unit test.\n\nYou can read more about the \"why\" and see some nice screenshots at [kzu's blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20200920164302/http://blogs.clariusconsulting.net/kzu/why-do-we-need-yet-another-net-mocking-framework/).\n\n## Where?\n\nSee our [Quickstart](https://github.com/devlooped/moq/wiki/Quickstart) examples to get a feeling of the extremely simple API and install from [NuGet](http://nuget.org/packages/moq).\n\nRead about the announcement at [kzu's blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20201130233544/http://blogs.clariusconsulting.net/kzu/linq-to-mock-moq-is-born/). Get some background on [the state of mock libraries from Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/MoqLinqLambdasAndPredicatesAppliedToMockObjects.aspx).\n\n## Who?\n\nMoq was originally developed by [Clarius](http://www.clariusconsulting.net), [Manas](http://www.manas.com.ar) and [InSTEDD](http://www.instedd.org).\n\nMoq uses [Castle DynamicProxy](http://www.castleproject.org/projects/dynamicproxy/) internally as the interception mechanism to enable mocking.\n\n<!-- #features -->\n\n## Features at a glance\nMoq offers the following features:\n* Strong-typed: no strings for expectations, no object-typed return values or constraints\n* Unsurpassed VS IntelliSense integration: everything supports full VS IntelliSense, from setting expectations, to specifying method call arguments, return values, etc.\n* No Record/Replay idioms to learn. Just construct your mock, set it up, use it and optionally verify calls to it (you may not verify mocks when they act as stubs only, or when you are doing more classic state-based testing by checking returned values from the object under test)\n* VERY low learning curve as a consequence of the previous three points. For the most part, you don't even need to ever read the documentation.\n* Granular control over mock behavior with a simple [MockBehavior](https://www.fuget.org/packages/Moq/4.16.1/lib/netstandard2.1/Moq.dll/Moq/MockBehavior) enumeration (no need to learn what's the theoretical difference between a mock, a stub, a fake, a dynamic mock, etc.)\n* Mock both interfaces and classes\n* Override expectations: can set default expectations in a fixture setup, and override as needed on tests\n* Pass constructor arguments for mocked classes\n* Intercept and raise events on mocks\n* Intuitive support for ```out/ref``` arguments\n\nWe appreciate deeply any feedback that you may have!
