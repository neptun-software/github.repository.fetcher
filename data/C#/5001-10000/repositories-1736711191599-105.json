No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the\ndistribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.\nNotwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a\nContributor:\n\n(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;\n    or\n\n(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's\n    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its\n    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor\n    Version); or\n\n(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of\n    its Contributions.\n\nThis License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,\nor logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with\nthe notice requirements in Section 3.4).\n\n2.4.

You must inform recipients that the Source\nCode Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this\nLicense, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not\nattempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code\nForm.\n\n3.2. Distribution of Executable Form\n\nIf You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:\n\n(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code\n    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of\n    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code\n    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more\n    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and\n\n(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this\n    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the\n    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter\n    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.\n\n3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work\n\nYou may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,\nprovided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for\nthe Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered\nSoftware with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the\nCovered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this\nLicense permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software\nunder the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of\nthe Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered\nSoftware under the terms of either this License or such Secondary\nLicense(s).\n\n3.4.

You must make it absolutely clear that any\nsuch warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by\nYou alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any\nliability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,\nindemnity or liability terms You offer.

Termination\n--------------\n\n5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically\nif You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become\ncompliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular\nContributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such\nContributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an\nongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the\nnon-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have\ncome back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular\nContributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor\nnotifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the\nfirst time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License\nfrom such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after\nYour receipt of the notice.\n\n5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent\ninfringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,\ncounter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version\ndirectly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to\nYou by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section\n2.1 of this License shall terminate.\n\n5.3.

Miscellaneous\n----------------\n\nThis License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject\nmatter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent\nnecessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides\nthat the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter\nshall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.\n\n10.

Otherwise, you can download the *latest* nightly build [here](https://nightly.link/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor/workflows/master/master/LibreHardwareMonitor-net472.zip).\n\n## How can I help improve it?\nThe LibreHardwareMonitor team welcomes feedback and contributions!<br/>\nYou can check if it works properly on your motherboard. For many manufacturers, the way of reading data differs a bit, so if you notice any inaccuracies, please send us a pull request. If you have any suggestions or improvements, don't hesitate to create an issue.\n\n## Developer information\n**Integrate the library in own application**\n1. Add the [LibreHardwareMonitorLib](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibreHardwareMonitorLib/) NuGet package to your application.\n2. Use the sample code below.\n\n\n**Sample code**\n```c#\npublic class UpdateVisitor : IVisitor\n{\n    public void VisitComputer(IComputer computer)\n    {\n        computer.Traverse(this);\n    }\n    public void VisitHardware(IHardware hardware)\n    {\n        hardware.Update();\n        foreach (IHardware subHardware in hardware.SubHardware) subHardware.Accept(this);\n    }\n    public void VisitSensor(ISensor sensor) { }\n    public void VisitParameter(IParameter parameter) { }\n}\n\npublic void Monitor()\n{\n    Computer computer = new Computer\n    {\n        IsCpuEnabled = true,\n        IsGpuEnabled = true,\n        IsMemoryEnabled = true,\n        IsMotherboardEnabled = true,\n        IsControllerEnabled = true,\n        IsNetworkEnabled = true,\n        IsStorageEnabled = true\n    };\n\n    computer.Open();\n    computer.Accept(new UpdateVisitor());\n\n    foreach (IHardware hardware in computer.Hardware)\n    {\n        Console.WriteLine(\"Hardware: {0}\", hardware.Name);\n        \n        foreach (IHardware subhardware in hardware.SubHardware)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"\\tSubhardware: {0}\", subhardware.Name);\n            \n            foreach (ISensor sensor in subhardware.Sensors)\n            {\n                Console.WriteLine(\"\\t\\tSensor: {0}, value: {1}\", sensor.Name, sensor.Value);\n            }\n        }\n\n        foreach (ISensor sensor in hardware.Sensors)\n        {\n            Console.WriteLine(\"\\tSensor: {0}, value: {1}\", sensor.Name, sensor.Value);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    computer.Close();\n}\n```\n\n**Administrator rights**\n\nSome sensors require administrator privileges to access the data. Restart your IDE with admin privileges, or add an [app.manifest](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests) file to your project with requestedExecutionLevel on requireAdministrator.\n\n\n## License\nLibreHardwareMonitor is free and open source software licensed under MPL 2.0.
