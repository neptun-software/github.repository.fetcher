Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License.

ASP.NET Core MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.\n\nASP.NET Core MVC includes support for building web pages and HTTP services in a single aligned framework that can be hosted in IIS or self-hosted in your own process.\n\nSee the [ASP.NET Core MVC documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/).\n\nRelated community projects:\n* [AspNet.Mvc.TypedRouting](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/AspNet.Mvc.TypedRouting): A collection of extension methods providing strongly typed routing and link generation for ASP.NET Core MVC projects.\n* [ASP.NET MVC Boilerplate](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/6cf50a48-fc1e-4eaf-9e82-0b2a6705ca7d): Rich templates for ASP.NET Core MVC.\n* [MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc](https://github.com/ivaylokenov/MyTested.AspNetCore.Mvc): Powerful fluent testing framework for ASP.NET Core MVC.\n* [MvcDeviceDetector](https://github.com/laskoviymishka/MvcDeviceDetector): Device detection mechanism to create mobile web applications.\n* [XmlResult](https://github.com/Wallsmedia/XmlResult): XML formatter extensions to allow defining the XML serializer type.\n* [AspNetCoreImageTagHelper](https://github.com/ignatandrei/AspNetCoreImageTagHelper): Tag helper for rendering images as inline base64 data.\n\nThis project is part of ASP.NET Core. You can find samples, documentation and getting started instructions for ASP.NET Core at the [AspNetCore](https://github.com/aspnet/AspNetCore) repo.\n\n## Building from source\n\nTo run a complete build on command line only, execute `build.cmd` or `build.sh` without arguments.
