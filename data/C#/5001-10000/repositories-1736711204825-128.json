ScottPlot 4.1.4-beta\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2021-01-25_\n* User controls have been extensively redesigned (#683)\n  * All user controls are almost entirely logic-free and pass events to `ScottPlot.Control`, a shared common back-end module which handles mouse interaction and pixel/coordinate conversions.\n  * Controls no longer have a `Configure()` method with numerous named arguments, but instead a `Configuration` field with XML-documented public fields to customize behavior.\n  * Renders occur automatically when the number of plottables changes, meaning you do not have to manually call `Render()` when plotting data for the first time. This behavior can be disabled in the configuration.\n  * Avalonia 0.10.0 is now supported and uses this new back-end (#656, #700) @bclehmann\n  * Events are used to provide custom right-click menu actions.\n  * The right-click plot settings window (that was only available from the WinForms control) has been removed.\n* New methods were added to `ScottPlot.Statistics.Common` which efficiently find the Nth smallest number, quartiles, or other quantiles from arrays of numbers (#690) @bclehmann\n* New tooltip plot type (#696) @bclehmann\n* Fixed simple moving average (SMA) calculation (#703) @Saklut\n* Improved multi-axis rendering (#706) @bclehmann\n* Improved `SetSourceAsync()` for segmented trees (#705, #692) @jl0pd and @StendProg\n* Improved layout for axes with rotated ticks (#706, #699) @MisterRedactus and @bclehmann\n* ScottPlot now multi-targets more platforms and supports the latest C# language version on modern platforms but restricts the language to C# 7.3 for .NET Framework projects (#691, #711) @jl0pd\n* Improved project file to install `System.ValueTuple` when targeting .NET Framework 4.6.1 (#88, #691)\n\n## ScottPlot 4.1.3-beta\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-12-27_\n* Scott will make a document to summarize 4.0 → 4.1 changes as we get closer to a non-beta release\n* Fixed rendering bug affecting axis spans when zoomed far in (#662) @StendProg\n* Improved Gaussian blur performance (#667) @bclehmann\n* Largely refactored heatmaps (#679, #680) @bclehmann\n* New `Colorbar` plot type (#681)\n* Improved SMA and Bollinger band generators (#647) @Saklut\n* Improved tick label rounding (#657)\n* Improved setting of tick label color (#672)\n* Improved fill above and below for scatter plots (#676) @MithrilMan\n* Additional customizations for radar charts (#634, #628, #635) @bclehmann and @SommerEngineering\n\n## ScottPlot 4.1.0-beta\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-11-29_\n* In November, 2020 ScottPlot 4.0 branched into a permanent `stable` branch, and ScottPlot 4.1 began development as beta / pre-release in the main branch. ScottPlot 4.0 continues to be maintained, but modifications are aimed at small bugfixes rather than large refactoring or the addition of new features. ScottPlot 4.1 merged into the master branch in November, 2020 (#605). Improvements are focused at enhanced performance, improved thread safety, support for multiple axes, and options for data validation.\n* Most plotting methods are unchanged so many users will not experience any breaking changes.\n* Axis Limits: Axis limits are described by a `AxisLimits` struct (previously `double[]` was used)\n* Axis Limits: Methods which modify axis limits do not return anything (previously they returned `double[]`)\n* Axis Limits: To get the latest axis limits call `Plot.AxisLimits()` which returns a `AxisLimits` object\n* Multiple Axes: Multiple axes are now supported! There is no change to the traditional workflow if this feature is not used.\n* Multiple Axes: Most axis methods accept a `xAxisIndex` and `yAxisIndex` arguments to specify which axes they will modify or return\n* Multiple Axes: Most plottable objects have `xAxisIndex` and `yAxisIndex` fields which specify which axes they will render on\n* Multiple Axes: You can enable a second Y and X axis by calling `YLabel2` and `XLabel2()`\n* Multiple Axes: You can obtain an axis by calling `GetXAxis(xAxisIndex)` or `GetYAxis(yAxisIndex)`, then modify its public fields to customize its behavior\n* Multiple Axes: The default axes (left and bottom) both use axis index `0`\n* Multiple Axes: The secondary axes (right and top) both use axis index `1`\n* Multiple Axes: You can create additional axes by calling `Plot.AddAxis()` and customize it by modifying fields of the `Axis` it returns.\n* Layout: The layout is re-calculated on every render, so it automatically adjusts to accommodate axis labels and ticks.\n* Layout: To achieve extra space around the data area, call `Layout()` to supply a minimum size for each axis.\n* Layout: To achieve a frameless plot where the data area fills the full figure, call `LayoutFrameless()`\n* Naming: The `Plottable` base class has been replaced with an `IPlottable` interface\n* Naming: Plottables have been renamed and moved into a `Plottable` namespace (e.g., `PlottableScatter` is  now `Plottable.ScatterPlot`)\n* Naming: Several enums have been renamed\n* Settings: It is still private, but you can request it with `Plot.GetSettings()`\n* Settings: Many of its objects implement `IRenderable`, so their customization options are stored at the same level as their render methods.\n* Rendering: `Bitmap` objects are never stored. The `Render()` method will create and return a new `Bitmap` when called, or will render onto an existing `Bitmap` if it is supplied as an argument. This allows controls to manage their own performance optimization by optionally re-using a `Bitmap` for multiple renders.\n* Rendering: Drawing is achieved with `using` statements which respect all `IDisposable` drawing objects, improving thread safety and garbage collection performance.\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.46\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-12-11_\n* Improved ticks for small plots (#724) @Saklut\n* Improved display of manual ticks (#724) @bclehmann\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.45\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-11-25_\n* Fixed a bug that affected very small plots with the benchmark enabled (#626) @martin-brajer\n* Improved labels in bar graphs using a yOffset (#584)Terbaco\n* Added `RenderLock()` and `RenderUnlock()` to the Plot module to facilitate multi-threaded plot modification (#609) @ZTaiIT1025\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.44\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-11-22_\n* Improved limits for fixed-size axis spans (#586) @Ichibot200 and @StendProg\n* Mouse drag/drop events now send useful event arguments (#593) @charlescao460 and @StendProg\n* Fixed a bug that affected plots with extremely small (<1E-10) axis spans (#607) @RFIsoft\n* `Plot.SaveFig()` now returns the full path to the file it created (#608)\n* Fixed `AxisAuto()` bug affecting signal plots using min/max render indexes with a custom sample rate (#621) @LB767\n* Fixed a bug affecting histogram normalization (#624) @LB767\n* WPF and Windows Forms user controls now also target .NET 5\n* Improved appearance of semi-transparent legend items (#567)\n* Improved tick labels for ticks smaller than 1E-5 (#568) @ozgur640\n* Improved support for Avalonia 0.10 (#571) @bclehmann and @apkrymov\n* Improved positions for base16 ticks (#582, #581) @bclehmann\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.42\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-09-27_\n* Improved DPI scaling support when using WinForms in .NET Core applications (#563) @Ichibot200\n* Improved DPI scaling support for draggable axis lines and spans (#563) @Ichibot200\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.41\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-09-26_\n* Improved density of DateTime ticks (#564, #561) @StendProg and @waynetheron\n* Improved display of DateTime tick labels containing multiple spaces (#539, #564) @StendProg\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.40\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-09-20_\n* Added user control for Avalonia (#496, #503) @bclehmann\n* Holding shift while left-click-dragging the edge of a span moves it instead of resizing it (#509) @Torgano\n* CSV export is now culture invariant for improved support on systems where commas are decimal separators (#512)Daniel\n* Added fill support to scatter plots (#529) @AlexFsmn\n* Fix bug that occurred when calling `GetLegendBitmap()` before the plot was rendered (#527) @el-aasi\n* Improved DateTime tick placement and added support for milliseconds (#539) @StendProg\n* Pie charts now have an optional hollow center to produce donut plots (#534) @bclehmann and @AlexFsmn\n* Added electrocardiogram (ECG) simulator to the DataGen module (#540) @AteCoder\n* Improved mouse scroll wheel responsiveness by delaying high quality render (#545, #543, #550) @StendProg\n* `Plot.PlotBitmap()` allows Bitmaps to be placed at specific coordinates (#528) @AlexFsmn\n* `DataGen.SampleImage()` returns a sample Bitmap that can be used for testing\n* Bar graphs now have a hatchStyle property to customize fill pattern (#555) @bclehmann\n* Support timecode tick labels (#537) @vrdriver and @StendProg\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.39\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-08-09_\n* Legend now reflects LineStyle of Signal and SignalXY plots (#488) @bclehmann\n* Improved mouse wheel zoom-to-cursor and middle-click-drag rectangle zoom in the WPF control for systems that use display scaling (#490) @nashilnik\n* The `Configure()` method of user controls now has a `lowQualityAlways` argument to let the user easily enable/disable anti-aliasing at the control level. Previously this was only configurable by reaching into the control's plot object and calling its `AntiAlias()` method. (#499) @RachamimYaakobov\n* SignalXY now supports parallel processing (#500) @StendProg\n* SignalXY now respects index-based render limits (#493, #500) @StendProg and @envine\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.38\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-07-07_\n* Improved `Plot.PlotFillAboveBelow()` rendering of data with a non-zero baseline (#477) @el-aasi\n* Added `Plot.PlotWaterfall()` for easy creation of waterfall-style bar plots (#463, #476) @bclehmann\n* Axis tick labels can be displayed using notations other than base 10 by supplying `Plot.Ticks()` with `base` and `prefix` arguments, allowing axes that display binary (e.g., `0b100110`) or hexadecimal (eg., `0x4B0D10`) tick labels (#469, #457) @bclehmann\n* Added options to `PlotBar()` to facilitate customization of text displayed above bars when `showValue` is enabled (#483) @WillemWever\n* Plot objects are colored based on a pre-defined set of colors. The default colorset (category10) is the same palette of colors used by matplotlib. A new `Colorset` module has been created to better define this behavior, and `Plot.Colorset()` makes it easy to plot data using alternative colorsets. (#481)\n* Fixed a bug that caused instability when a population plot is zoomed-out so much that its fractional distribution curve is smaller than a single pixel (#480) @HowardWhile\n* Added `Plot.Remove()` method to make it easier to specifically remove an individual plottable after it has been plotted. `Plot.Clear()` is similar, but designed to remove classes of plot types rather than a specific plot object. (#479) @cstyx and @Resonanz\n* Signal plots can now be created with a defined `minRenderIndex` (in addition to the already-supported `maxRenderIndex`) to facilitate partial display of large arrays (#474) @bclehmann\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.37\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-06-22_\n* Fixed a long-running issue related to strong assembly versioning that caused the WPF control to fail to render in the Visual Studio designer in .NET Framework (but not .NET Core) projects (#473, #466, #356) @bhairav-thakkar, @riquich, @Helitune-RobMcKay, and @iu2kxv\n* User controls now also target `net472` (while still supporting `net461` and `netcoreapp3.0`) to produce a build folder with just 3 DLLs (compared to over 100 when building with .NET Framework 4.6.1)\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.36\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-06-22_\n* `PlotSignal()` and `PlotSignalXY()` plots now have an optional `useParallel` argument (and public property on the objects they return) to allow the user to decide whether parallel or sequential calculations will be performed. (#454, #419, #245, #72) @StendProg\n* Improved minor tick alignment to prevent rare single-pixel artifacts (#417)\n* Improved horizontal axis tick label positions in ruler mode (#453)\n* Added a `Statistics.Interpolation` module to generate smooth interpolated splines from a small number of input data points. See advanced statistics cookbook example for usage information. (#459)Hans-Peter Moser\n* Improved automatic axis adjustment when adding bar plots with negative values (#461, #462) @bclehmann\n* Created `Drawing.Colormaps` module which has over a dozen colormaps for easily converting a fractional value to a color for use in plotting or heatmap displays (#457, #458) @bclehmann\n* Updated `Plot.Clear()` to accept any `Plottable` as an argument, and all `Plottable` objects of the same type will be cleared (#464) @imka-code\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.35\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-06-09_\n* Added `processEvents` argument to `formsPlot2.Render()` to provide a performance enhancement when linking axes of two `FormsPlot` controls together (by calling `Plot.MatchAxis()` from the control's `AxesChanged` event, as seen in theLinked Axes demo application) (#451, #452) @StendProg and @robokamran\n* New `Plot.PlotVectorField()` method for displaying vector fields (sometimes called quiver plots) (#438, #439, #440) @bclehmann and @hhubschle\n* Included an experimental colormap module which is likely to evolve over subsequent releases (#420, #424, #442) @bclehmann\n* `PlotScatterHighlight()` was created as a type of scatter plot designed specifically for applications where \"show value on hover\" functionality is desired. Examples are both in the cookbook and WinForms and WPF demo applications. (#415, #414) @bclehmann and @StendProg\n* `PlotRadar()` is a new plot type for creating Radar plots (also called spider plots or star plots). See cookbook and demo application for examples. (#428, #430) @bclehmann\n* `PlotPlolygons()` is a new performance-optimized variant of `PlotPolygon()` designed for displaying large numbers of complex shapes (#426) @StendProg\n* The WinForms control's `Configure()` now has a `showCoordinatesTooltip` argument to continuously display the position at the tip of the cursor as a tooltip (#410) @jcbeppler\n* User controls now use SHIFT (previously ALT) to lock the horizontal axis and ALT (previously SHIFT) while left-click-dragging for zoom-to-region. Holding CTRL+SHIFT while right-click-dragging now zooms evenly, without X/Y distortion. (#436) @tomwimmenhove and @StendProg\n* Parallel processing is now enabled by default. Performance improvements will be most noticeable on Signal plots. (#419, #245, #72)\n* `Plot.PlotBar()` now has an `autoAxis` argument (which defaults `true`) that automatically adjusts the axis limits so the base of the bar graphs touch the edge of the plot area. (#406)\n* OSX-specific DLLs are now only retrieved by NuGet on OSX (#433, #211, #212)\n* Pie charts can now be made with `plt.PlotPie()`. See cookbook and demo application for examples. (#421, #423) @bclehmann\n* `ScottPlot.FormsPlotViewer(Plot)` no longer resets the new window's plot to the default style (#416)  @StendProg\n* Controls now have a `recalculateLayoutOnMouseUp` option to prevent resetting of manually-defined data area padding\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.34\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-05-18_\n* Improve display of `PlotSignalXY()` by not rendering markers when zoomed very far out (#402) @gobikulandaisamy\n* Optimized rendering of solid lines which have a user-definable `LineStyle` property. This modification improves grid line rendering and increases performance for most types of plots. (#401, #327) @bukkideme and @Ichibot200\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.33\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-05-18_\n* Force grid lines to always draw using anti-aliasing. This compensates for a bug in `System.Drawing` that may cause diagonal line artifacts to appear when the user controls were panned or zoomed. (#401, #327) @bukkideme and @Ichibot200\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.32\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-05-17_\n* User controls now have a `GetMouseCoordinates()` method which returns the DPI-aware position of the mouse in graph coordinates (#379, #380) @bclehmann\n* Default grid color was lightened in the user controls to match the default style (#372)\n* New `PlotSignalXY()` method for high-speed rendering of signal data that has unevenly-spaced X coordinates (#374, #375) @StendProg and @LogDogg\n* Modify `Tools.Log10()` to return `0` instead of `NaN`, improving automatic axis limit detection (#376, #377) @bclehmann\n* WpfPlotViewer and FormsPlotViewer launch in center of parent window (#378)\n* Improve reliability of `Plot.AxisAutoX()` and `Plot.AxisAutoY()` (#382)\n* The `Configure()` method of FormsPlot and WpfPlot controls now have `middleClickMarginX` and `middleClickMarginY` arguments which define horizontal and vertical auto-axis margin used for middle-clicking. Setting horizontal margin to 0 is typical when plotting signals. (#383)\n* `Plot.Grid()` and `Plot.Ticks()` now have a `snapToNearestPixel` argument which controls whether these lines appear anti-aliased or not. For static images non-anti-aliased grid lines and tick marks look best, but for continuously-panning plots anti-aliased lines look better. The default behavior is to enable snapping to the nearest pixel, consistent with previous releases. (#384)\n* Mouse events (MouseDown, MouseMove, etc.) are now properly forwarded to the FormsPlot control (#390) @Minu476\n* Improved rendering of very small candlesticks and OHLCs in financial plots\n* Labeled plottables now display their label in the ToString() output. This is useful when viewing plottables listed in the FormsPlot settings window #391 @Minu476\n* Added a Statistics.Finance module with methods for creating Simple Moving Average (SMA) and Bollinger band technical indicators to Candlestick and OHLC charts. Examples are in the cookbook and demo program. (#397) @Minu476\n* Scatter plots, filled plots, and polygon plots now support Xs and Ys which contain `double.NaN` #396\n* Added support for line styles to Signal plots (#392) @bukkideme\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.31\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-05-06_\n* Created `Plot.PlotBarGroups()` for easier construction of grouped bar plots from 2D data (#367) @bclehmann\n* Plot.PlotScaleBar() adds an L-shaped scalebar to the corner of the plot (#363)\n* Default grid color lightened from #D3D3D3 (Color.LightGray) to #EFEFEF (#372)\n* Improved error reporting for scatter plots (#369) @JagDTalcyon\n* Improve pixel alignment by hiding grid lines and snapping tick marks that are 1px away from the lower left edge (#359)\n* PlotText() ignores defaults to upperLeft alignment when rotation is used (#362)\n* Improved minor tick positioning to prevent cases where minor ticks are 1px away from major ticks (#373)\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.30\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-05-04_\n* `Plot.PlotCandlestick()` and `Plot.PlotOHLC()`\n  * now support `OHLC` objects with variable widths defined with a new `timeSpan` argument in the OHLC constructor. (#346) @Minu476\n  * now support custom up/down colors including those with transparency (#346) @Minu476\n  * have a new `sequential` argument to plot data based on array index rather than `OHLC.time`. This is a new, simpler way to display unevenly-spaced data (e.g., gaps over weekends) in a way that makes the gaps invisible. (#346) @Minu476\n* Fixed a marker/line alignment issue that only affeced low-density Signal plots on Linux and MacOS (#340) @SeidChr\n* WPF control now appears in Toolbox (#151) @RalphLAtGitHub\n* Plot titles are now center-aligned with the data area, not the figure. This improves the look of small plots with titles. (#365) @Resonanz\n* Fixed bug that ignored `Configure(enableRightClickMenu: false)` in WPF and WinForms user controls. (#365) @thunderstatic\n* Updated `Configure(enableScrollWheelZoom: false)` to disable middle-click-drag zooming. (#365) @eduhza\n* Added color mixing methods to ScottPlot.Drawing.GDI (#361)\n* Middle-click-drag zooming now respects locked axes (#353) @LogDogg\n* Improved user control zooming of high-precision DateTime axis data (#351) @bukkideme\n* Plot.AxisBounds() now lets user set absolute bounds for drag and pan operations (#349) @LogDogg\n* WPF control uses improved Bitmap conversion method (#350)\n* Function plots have improved handling of functions with infinite values (#370) @bclehmann\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.29\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-04-11_\n* `Plot.PlotFill()` can be used to make scatter plots with shaded regions. Giving it a single pair of X/Y values (`xs, ys`) lets you shade beneath the curve to the `baseline` value (which defaults to 0). You can also give it a pair of X/Y values (`xs1, ys1, xs2, ys2`) and the area between the two curves will be shaded (the two curves do not need to be the same length). See cookbook for examples. (#255) @ckovamees \n* `DataGen.Range()` now has `includeStop` argument to include the last value in the returned array.\n* `Tools.Pad()` has been created to return a copy of a given array padded with data values on each side. (#255) @ckovamees\n* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) style can be activated using `Plot.Style(Style.Seaborn)` (#339)\n* The `enableZooming` argument in `WpfPlot.Configure()` and `FormsPlot.Configure()` has been replaced by two arguments `enableRightClickZoom` and `enableScrollWheelZoom` (#338)Zach\n* Improved rendering of legend items for polygons and filled plots (#341) @SeidChr\n* Improved Linux rendering of legend items which use thick lines: axis spans, fills, polygons, etc. (#340) @SeidChr\n* Addded `Plot.PlotFillAboveBelow()` to create a shaded line plot with different colors above/below the baseline. (#255) @ckovamees\n* Improved rendering in Linux and MacOS by refactoring the font measurement system (#340) @SeidChr\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.28\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-04-07_\n* `Ticks()` now has arguments for numericStringFormat (X and Y) to make it easy to customize formatting of tick labels (percentage, currency, scientific notation, etc.) using standard [numeric format strings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-numeric-format-strings). Example use is demonstrated in the cookbook. (#336) @deiruch\n* The right-click menu can now be more easily customized by writing a custom menu to `FormsPlot.ContextMenuStrip` or `WpfPlot.ContextMenu`. Demonstrations of both are in the demo application. (#337) @Antracik\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.27\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-04-05_\n* `Plot.Polygon()` can now be used to plot polygons from X/Y points (#255) @ckovamees\n* User controls now have an \"open in new window\" item in their right-click menu (#280)\n* Plots now have offset notation and multiplier notation disabled by default. Layouts are automatically calculated before the first render, or manually after MouseUp events in the user controls. (#310)\n* `Plot.Annotation()` allows for the placement of text on the figure using pixel coordinates (not unit coordinates on the data grid). This is useful for creating custom static labels or information messages. (#321) @SeidChr\n* `FormsPlot.MouseDoubleClicked` event now passes a proper `MouseEventArgs` instead of `null` (#331) @ismdiego\n* Added a right-click menu to `WpfPlot` with items (save image, copy image, open in new window, help, etc.) similar to `FormsPlot`\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.26\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-04-05_\n* The `ScottPlot.WPF` package (which provides the `WpfPlot` user control) now targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 (in addition to .NET Core 3.0), allowing it to be used in applications which target either platform. The ScottPlot demo application now targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 which should be easier to run on most Windows systems. (#333)\n* The `ScottPlot.WinForms` package (which produves the `FormsPlot` control) now only targets .NET Framework 4.6.1 and .NET Core 3.0 platforms (previously it also had build targets for .NET Framework 4.7.2 and .NET Framework 4.8). It is important to note that no functionality was lost here. (#330, #333)\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.25\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-03-29_\n* `PlotBar()` now supports displaying values above each bar graph by setting the `showValues` argument.\n* `PlotPopulations()` has extensive capabilities for plotting grouped population data using box plots, bar plots, box and whisper plots, scatter data with distribution curves, and more! See the cookbook for details. (#315)\n* `Histogram` objects now have a `population` property.\n* `PopulationStats` has been renamed to `Population` and has additional properties and methods useful for reporting population statistics.\n* Improved grid rendering rare artifacts which appear as unwanted diagnal lines when anti-aliasing is disabled. (#327)\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.24\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-03-27_\n* `Plot.Clear()` has been improved to more effectively clear plottable objects. Various overloads are provided to selectively clear or preserve certain plot types. (#275) @StendProg\n* `PlotBar()` has been lightly refactored. Argument order has been adjusted, and additional options have been added. Error cap width is now in fractional units instead of pixel units. Horizontal bar charts are now supported. (#277, #315) @bonzaiferroni\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.23\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-03-23_\n* Interactive plot viewers were created to make it easy to interactively display data in a pop-up window without having to write any GUI code: `ScottPlot.WpfPlotViewer` for WPF and `ScottPlot.FormsPlotViewer` for Windows Forms\n* Fixed bug that affected the `ySpacing` argument of `Plot.Grid()`\n* `Plot.Add()` makes it easy to add a custom `Plottable` to the plot\n* `Plot.XLabels()` and `Plot.YLabels()` can now accept just a string array (x values are auto-populated as a consecutive series of numbers).\n* Aliased `Plot.AxisAuto()` to `Plot.AutoAxis()` and `Plot.AutoScale()` to make this function easier to locate for users who may have experience with other plot libraries. (#309) @Resonanz\n* Empty plots now render grid lines, ticks, and tick labels (#313)\n* New plot type: Error bars. They allow the user to define error bar size in all 4 directions by calling `plt.PlotErrorBars()`. (#316) @zrolfs\n* Improve how dashed lines appear in the legend\n* Improved minor tick positions when using log scales with `logScaleX` and `logScaleY` arguments of `plt.Ticks()` method\n* Fixed bug that caused the center of the coordinate field to shift when calling `Plot.AxisZoom()`\n* Grid line thickness and style (dashed, dotted, etc) can be customized with new arguments in the `Plot.Grid()` method\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.22\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-03-17_\n* Added support for custom horizontal axis tick rotation (#300) @SeidChr\n* Added support for fixed grid spacing when using DateTime axes (#299) @SeidChr\n* Updated ScottPlot icon (removed small text, styled icon after emoji)\n* Improved legend font size when using display scaling (#289)\n* Scroll wheel zooming now zooms to cursor (instead of center) in WPF control. This feature works now even if display scaling is used. (#281)\n* Added `Plot.EqualAxis` property to make it easy to lock axis scales together (#306) @StendProg\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.21\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-03-15_\n* Created new cookbook and demo applications for WinForms and WPF (#271)\n* The `FormsPlot.MouseMoved` event now has `MouseEventArgs` (instead of `EventArgs`). The purpose of this was to make it easy to access mouse pixel coordinates via `e.X` and `e.Y`, but this change may require modifications to applications which use the old event signature.\n* WpfPlot now has an `AxisChanged` event (like FormsPlot)\n* Fixed bug that caused `Plot.CoordinateFromPixelY()` to return incorrect value\n* Fixed bug causing cursor to show arrows when hovered over some non-draggable objects\n* Improved support for WinForms and WpfPlot transparency (#286) @StendProg and @envine\n* Added `DataGen.Zeros()` and `DataGen.Ones()` to generate arrays filled with values using methods familiar to numpy users.\n* Added `equalAxes` argument to `WpfPlot.Configure()` (#272)\n* Fixed a bug affecting the `equalAxes` argument in `FormsPlot.Configure()` (#272)\n* Made all `Plot.Axis` methods return axis limits as `double[]` (previously many of them returned `void`)\n* Added overload for `Plot.PlotLine()` which accepts a slope, offset, and start and end X points to make it easy to plot a linear line with known formula. Using PlotFormula() will produce the same output, but this may be simpler to use for straight lines.\n* Added `rSquared` property to linear regression fits (#290) @bclehmann and @StendProg\n* Added `Tools.ConvertPolarCoordinates()` to make it easier to display polar data on ScottPlot's Cartesian axes (#298) @bclehmann\n* Improved `Plot.Function()` (#243) @bclehmann\n* Added overload for `Plot.SetCulture()` to let the user define number and date formatting rather than relying on pre-made cultures (#301, #236) @SeidChr\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.19\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-02-29_\n* Improved how markers are drawn in Signal and SignalConst plots at the transition area between zoomed out and zoomed in (#263) @bukkideme and @StendProg\n* Improved support for zero lineSize and markerSize in Signal and SignalConst plots (#263, #264) @bukkideme and @StendProg\n* Improved thread safety of interactive graphs (#245) @StendProg\n* Added `CoordinateFromPixelX()` and `CoordinateFromPixelY()` to getdouble precision coordinates from a pixel location. Previously only SizeF (float) precision was available. This improvement is especially useful when using DateTime axes. (#269)Chris\n* Added `AxisScale()` to adjust axis limits to set a defined scale (units per pixel) for each axis.\n* Added `AxisEqual()` to adjust axis limits to set the scale of both axes to be the same regardless of the size of each axis (#272) @gberrante\n* `PlotHSpan()` and `PlotVSpan()` now return `PlottableHSpan` and `PlottableVSpan` objects (instead of a `PlottableAxSpan` with a `vertical` property)\n* `PlotHLine()` and `PlotVLine()` now return `PlottableHLine` and `PlottableVLine` objects (instead of a `PlottableAxLine` with a `vertical` property)\n* MultiPlot now has a `GetSubplot()` method which returns the Plot from a row and column index (#242) @Resonanz and @StendProg\n* Created `DataGen.Range()` to make it easy to create double arrays with evenly spaced data (#259)\n* Improved support for display scaling (#273) @zrolfs\n* Improved event handling (#266, #238) @StendProg\n* Improved legend positioning (#253) @StendProg\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.18\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-02-07_\n* Added `Plot.SetCulture()` for improved local culture formatting of numerical and DateTime axis tick labels (#236) @teejay-87\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.17\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-02-06_\n* Added `mouseCoordinates` property to WinForms and WPF controls (#235) @bukkideme\n* Fixed rendering bug that affected horizontal lines when anti-aliasing was turned off (#232) @StendProg\n* Improved responsiveness while dragging axis lines and axis spans (#228) @StendProg\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.16\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-02-02_\n* Improved support for MacOS and Linux (#211, #212, #216) @hexxone and @StendProg\n* Fixed a bug affecting the `ySpacing` argument in `Plot.Grid()` (#221) @teejay-87\n* Enabled `visible` argument in `Title()`, `XLabel()`, and `YLabel()` (#222) @ckovamees\n* AxisSpan: Edges are now optionally draggable (#228) @StendProg\n* AxisSpan: Can now be selectively removed with `Clear()` argument\n* AxisSpan: Fixed bug caused by zooming far into an axis span (#226) @StendProg\n* WinForms control: now supports draggable axis lines and axis spans\n* WinForms control: Right-click menu now has \"copy image\" option (#220)\n* WinForms control: Settings screen now has \"copy CSV\" button to export data (#220)\n* WPF control: now supports draggable axis lines and axis spans\n* WPF control: Configure() to set various WPF control options\n* Improved axis handling, expansion, and auto-axis (#219, #230) @StendProg\n* Added more options to `DataGen.Cos()`\n* Tick labels can be hidden with `Ticks()` argument (#223) @ckovamees\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.14\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-01-24_\n* Improved `MatchAxis()` and `MatchLayout()` (#217) @ckovamees and @StendProg\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.13\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-01-21_\n* Improved support for Linux and MacOS @hexxone\n* Improved font validation (#211, #212) @hexxone and @StendProg\n\n## ScottPlot 4.0.11\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2020-01-19_\n* User controls now have a `cursor` property which can be set to allow custom cursors.

It responds faster and has improved controls to adjust plot settings.\n* Plots can now be saved in BMP, PNG, JPG, and TIF format\n* Holding `CTRL` while click-dragging locks the horizontal axis\n* Holding `ALT` while click-dragging locks the vertical axis\n* Minor ticks are now displayed (and can be turned on or off with `Ticks()`)\n* Legend can be accessed for external display with `GetLegendBitmap()`\n* anti-aliasing is turned off while click-dragging to increase responsiveness (#93) @StendProg\n* `PlotSignalConst` now has support for generics and improved performance using single-precision floating-point math. @StendProg\n* Legend draws more reliably (#104, #106) @StendProg\n* `AxisAuto()` now has `expandOnly` arguments\n* Axis lines with custom lineStyles display properly in the legend\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.9\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-08-12_\n* New Plot Type: `PlotSignalConst` for extremely large arrays of data which are not expected to change after being plotted. Plots generated with this method can be much faster than `PlotSignal`. (#70) @StendProg\n* Greatly improved axis tick labels. Axis tick labels are now less likely to overlap with axis labels, and it displays very large and very small numbers well using exponential notation. (#47, #68) @Padanian\n* Parallel processing support for `SignalPlot` (#72) @StendProg\n* Every `Plot` function now returns a `Plottable`. When creating things like scatter plots, text, and axis lines, the returned object can now be used to update the data, position, styling, or call plot-type-specific methods.\n* Right-click menu now displays ScottPlot and .NET Framework version\n* Improved rendering of extremely zoomed-out signals \n* Rendering speed increased now that `Format32bppPArgb` is the default PixelFormat (#83) @StendProg\n* `DataGen.NoisySin()` was added\n* Code was tested in .NET Core 3.0 preview and compiled without error. Therefore, the next release will likely be for .NET Core 3.0 (#85, #86) @petarpetrovt\n* User controls now render graphs with anti-alias mode off (faster) while the mouse is being dragged. Upon release a high quality render is performed.\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.8\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-08-04_\n* WPF User Control: A ScottPlotWPF user control was created to allow provide a simple mouse-interactive ScottPlot control to WPF applications. It is not as full-featured as the winforms control (it lacks a right-click menu and click-and-drag functions), but it is simple to review the code (<100 lines) and easy to use.\n* New plot type: `plt.AxisSpan()` shades a region of the graph (semi-transparency is supported)\n* Ticks: Vertical ticks no longer overlap with vertical axis label (#47) @bukkideme\n* Ticks: When axis tick labels contain very large or very small numbers, scientific notation mode is engaged\n* Ticks: Horizontal tick mark spacing increased to prevent overlapping\n* Ticks: Vertical tick mark spacing increased to be consistent with horizontal tick spacing\n* Plottable objects now have a `SaveCSV(filename)` method. Scatter and Signal plot data can be saved from the user control through the right-click menu.\n* Added `lineStyle` arguments to Scatter plots\n* Improved legend: ability to set location, ability to set shadow direction, markers and lines are now rendered in the legend\n* Improved ability to use custom fonts\n* Segoe UI is now the default font for all plot components\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.7\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-07-27_\n* New plot type: `plt.PlotStep()`\n* New plot type `plt.PlotCandlestick()`\n* New plot type `plt.PlotOHLC()`\n* `plt.MatchPadding()` copies the data frame layout from one ScottPlot onto another (useful for making plots of matching size)\n* `plt.MatchAxis()` copies the axes from one ScottPlot onto another (useful for making plots match one or both axis)\n* `plt.Legend()` improvements: The `location` argument allows the user to place the legend at one of 9 different places on the plot. The `shadowDirection` argument allows the user to control if a shadow is shown and at what angle.\n* Custom marker shapes can be specified using the `markerShape` argument.\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.6\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-06-30_\n* Bar plot: The plot module now has a `Bar()` method that lets users create various types of bar plots\n* Histogram: The new `ScottPlot.Histogram` class has tools to create and analyze histogram data (including cumulative probability)\n* Step plot: Scatter plots can now render as step plots. Use this feature by setting the `stepDisplay` argument with `PlotScatter()`\n* Manual grid spacing: Users can now manually define the grid density by setting the `xSpacing` and `ySpacing` arguments in `Grid()`\n* Draggable axis lines: Axis lines can be dragged with the mouse if the `draggable` argument is set to `true` in `PlotHLine()` and `PlotHLine()`. Draggable axis line limits can also be set by defining additional arguments.\n* Using the scrollwheel to zoom now zooms to the cursor position rather than the center of the plot area\n* `ScottPlot.DataGen.RandomNormal()` was created to create arbitrary amounts of normally-distributed random data\n* Fixed bug causing axis line color to appear incorrectly in the legend\n* `AxisAuto()` is now called automatically on the first render. This means users no longer have to call this function manually for most applications. This simplifies quickstart programs to just: instantiate plot, plot data, render (now 3 lines in total instead of 4).\n* Throw exceptions if scatter, bar, or signal data inputs are null (rather than failing later)\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.5\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-06-23_\n* Improved pan and zoom performance\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.4\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-06-23_\n* Bar graphs: New `plotBar()` method allow creation of bar graphs. By customizing the `barWidth` and `xOffset` arguments you can push bars together to create grouped bar graphs. Error bars can also be added with the `yError` argument.\n* Scatter plots support X and Y error bars: `plotScatter()` now has arguments to allow X and Y error bars with adjustable error bar line width and cap size.\n* Draggable axis lines: `plotHLine()` and `plotVLine()` now have a `draggable` argument which lets those axis lines be dragged around with the mouse (#11) @plumforest\n* Fixed errors caused by resizing to 0px\n* Fixed a capitalization inconsistency in the `plotSignal` argument list\n* `axisAuto()` now includes positions of axis lines (previously they were ignored)\n* Fixed an that caused SplitContainer splitters to freeze (#23) @bukkideme\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.3\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-05-29_\n* Update NuGet package to depend on System.Drawing.Common\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.2\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-05-28_\n* Changed target from .NET Framework 4.5 to 4.7.2 (#15) @plumforest\n\n## ScottPlot 3.0.1\n_Published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/ScottPlot) on 2019-05-28_\n* First version of ScottPlot published on NuGet\n\n"
