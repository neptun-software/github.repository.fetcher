          "content": "# How to contribute\n\nOne of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions on GitHub issues. At this point in the tye project we welcome anyone's feedback on where tye help you to succeed or caused you trouble. \n\nYou can also contribute by submitting pull requests with code changes to address an open issue or improve documentation.\n\n## General feedback and discussions?\n\nCreate a [feedback issue](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/issues/new?template=feedback.md).\n\nWe know that there's a lot of diversity in how people work, think, and organize projects. We'd love to know if tye is a good fit for the way that you do your best work.\n\nIf we don't have follow up discussions or questions, we'll probably close your issue with a simple \"Thanks!\" and link it to some other issues that we're tracking. Getting feedback in the form of issues is helpful to the team, regardless of whether its negative or positive.\n\n---\n\nOr if there's a top if you want to discuss, create a [discussion issue](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/issues/new?template=discussion.md).\n\nFeel free to create discussion issues if there's something you want to ask about. We may close your issue if there's an easy answer, or we may leave it open so that others are encouraged to comment and share their point of view.\n\n## Bugs and feature requests?\n\nFor non-security related bugs, log a new [bug issue](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/issues/new?template=bug.md). \n\nKeep in mind that tye is an experimental project. We do care about the quality of the features that we're building, but we don't plan to address every bug quickly because the lifespan of the project is short.\n\n---\n\nFor feature requests, log a new [idea issue](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/issues/new?template=idea.md).\n\nTye is an experimental project with a short roadmap. We plan to at least be honest about what ideas we think we can accomplish within the scope of the project. We might say no, or \"not now\" to lots of ideas as a result.\n\n## Reporting security issues and bugs\n\nSecurity issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC)  secure@microsoft.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the [Security TechCenter](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/ff852094.aspx).\n\n## Contributing code and content\n\nWe accept fixes and features! Here are some resources to help you get started on how to contribute code or new content.\n\n* Look at the [Developer documentation](/docs/developer_guide.md) to get started on building the source code on your own.\n* [\"Help wanted\" issues](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/labels/help%20wanted) - these issues are up for grabs. Comment on an issue if you want to create a fix.\n* [\"Good first issue\" issues](https://github.com/dotnet/tye/labels/good%20first%20issue) - we think these are a good for newcomers.\n\n### Before you send a pull request\n\nWe prefer to have a discussion via an issues before reviewing a PR especially if the changes are extensive or if the PR adds a feature that we haven't agreed to add. \n\nIf you are sending a PR for an existing issue, please comment on the issue so that others can see that someone is working on it. It may not be a bad idea to comment before you start work, because the team might have suggestions.\n\nWe don't expect an issue for minor improvements like:\n\n- Correcting grammar or spelling\n- Correcting documentation mistakes\n\n### Submitting a pull request\n\nYou will need to sign a [Contributor License Agreement](https://cla.dotnetfoundation.org/) when submitting your pull request. To complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), you will need to follow the instructions provided by the CLA bot when you send the pull request. This needs to only be done once for any .NET Foundation OSS project.\n\nIf you don't know what a pull request is read this article: https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests. Make sure the repository can build and all tests pass. \n\nFamiliarize yourself with the [developer guide](/docs/developer_guide.md) for information about how to work with the repository.\n\n### Tests\n\nTye is a new project with lots of aspects that are difficult to test. We don't currently have many tests as part of the repository and expect to increase the test coverage over time. For right now, try to understand if the area you're working in is already covered by tests, and expand them if possible.\n\n## .NET Foundation\n\nTye is a [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects) project.\n\nThis project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) to clarify expected behavior in our community.

Project Tye includes a local orchestrator to make developing microservices easier and the ability to deploy microservices to Kubernetes with minimal configuration. \n\nTye can:\n\n- Simplify microservices development by making it easy to:\n  - Run many services with one command\n  - Use dependencies in containers\n  - Discover addresses of other services using simple conventions\n- Deploy .NET applications to Kubernetes by:\n  - Automatically containerizing .NET applications\n  - Generating Kubernetes manifests with minimal knowledge or configuration\n  - Using the same conventions as development to keep it consistent\n\nWant to learn more? Check out our [FAQ](docs/FAQ.md) or [documentation](docs/README.md).\n\n## Current Status\n\nProject Tye is an open source experiment at the moment. We are using this time to try radical ideas to improve microservices developer productivity and see what works. \n\nWe plan to do releases with new features roughly every 4 weeks.\n\nFor the duration of the experiment, consider every part of the tye experience to be volatile. We will frequently make additions and changes to features that seem polished. We welcome feedback from anyone who's willing to be an early-adopter with tye; the team wants to know what's working well, and what's missing to build a whole-package .NET microservices developer productivity suite.\n\n---\n\n[![Build Status](https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/public/_apis/build/status/dotnet/tye/dotnet-tye-ci-public?branchName=main)](https://dnceng.visualstudio.com/public/_build/latest?definitionId=796&branchName=main)\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\nSee the getting started instructions and tutorials [here](/docs/getting_started.md).\n\n\n## How to Engage, Contribute, and Give Feedback\n\nSome of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file issues, join in design conversations, and make pull-requests.\n\n- Download our latest daily builds\n- Try tutorials and working with your own projects\n- Log issues if you find problems, or if you have suggestions.\n- Log an issue if you have feedback you want to share with the team.\n\nCheck out the [contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md) page to see the best places to log issues and start discussions.\n\nThank you for trying out Project Tye! We highly encourage you to provide feedback to help us continue to improve the tool, so we would love to learn more about your experience. Please let us know what you think by filling out our [survey](https://aka.ms/tyesurvey).\n\n## Reporting security issues and bugs\n\nTye is an experimental project, and as such we expect all users to take responsibility for evaluating the security of their own applications.\n\nSecurity issues and bugs should be reported privately, via email, to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) secure@microsoft.com. You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Further information, including the MSRC PGP key, can be found in the Security TechCenter.\n\n## .NET Foundation\n\nTye is a [.NET Foundation](https://www.dotnetfoundation.org/projects) project.\n\nThis project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/) to clarify expected behavior in our community. For more information, see the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](http://www.dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).\n\nGeneral .NET OSS discussions: [.NET Foundation forums](https://forums.dotnetfoundation.org)\n\n"
