It's a wrapper around `HttpClient`, not a full-fledged client on \nits own.\n\nWhat RestSharp adds to `HttpClient`:\n- Default parameters of any kind, not just headers\n- Add a parameter of any kind to requests, like query, URL segment, header, cookie, or body\n- Multiple ways to add a request body, including JSON, XML, URL-encoded form data, multipart form data with and \n  without files\n- Built-in serialization and deserilization of JSON, XML, and CSV, as well as the ability to add custom serializers\n- Rich support for authentication\n\n## Compatibility note\n\nRestSharp 107 was a major release that brings a lot of changes. We've removed a lot of legacy code and added new \nfeatures. Finally, RestSharp has moved to `HttpClient`. We also deprecated the following:\n- SimpleJson in favour of `System.Text.Json.JsonSerialzer`\n- `IRestRequest`, and `IRestResponse` in favour of implementing classes\n- Everything `Http` and `IHttp` as those are just wrappers\n- Client configuration moved to `RestClientOptions` to make the client thread-safe\n- `IRestClient` interface surface substantially reduced\n\nMost of the client and some of the request options are now in `RestClientOptions`.\n\nCheck [v107+ docs](https://restsharp.dev/v107) for more information.\n\n## Packages\n\n| Package                                | What it's for                                                                        |\n|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `RestSharp`                            | The core library, including `System.Text.Json` serializer and basical XML serializer |\n| `RestSharp.Serializers.NewtonsoftJson` | Use `Newtonsoft.Json` as a JSON serializer                                           |\n| `RestSharp.Serializers.Xml`            | Use custom RestSharp XML serializer for XML                                          |\n| `RestSharp.Serializers.CsvHelper`      | Use `CsvHelper` as a CSV serializer                                                  |\n\n## Code of Conduct\n\nThis project has adopted the code of conduct defined by the Contributor Covenant to clarify expected behavior in our community.\nFor more information see the [.NET Foundation Code of Conduct](https://dotnetfoundation.org/code-of-conduct).\n\n**Users violated the aforementioned code of conduct will be blocked.**\n\n## Support\n\nRestSharp is an open-source project with a single maintainer.
