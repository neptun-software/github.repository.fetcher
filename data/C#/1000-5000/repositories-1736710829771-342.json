          "content": "## 8.8.3 (2024-12-15)\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Resolve issue with static web assets and content files in nuget packages\n\n## 8.8.2 (2024-12-15)\n\n### Features\n\n- New `services.AddApplicationPartsFeatureToggles` extension that should be used in Startup instead of `services.AddFeatureToggles`. This also scans enum types with [FeatureKeySet] attribute in application parts, and disables features that have a [DefaultValue(false)] attribute on them by default. It also discovers dependencies between features themselves (for example a DataAuditLog_Services sub feature might depend on a DataAuditLog feature, e.g. disabling it also disables all sub features) so it is recommended to switch to AddApplicationPartsFeatureToggles.\n- Add ability to declare dependencies between feature flags themselves by adding RequiresFeature attribute to the FeatureKeys enum members, or the enum itself. For it to work, AddApplicationPartsFeatureToggles should be used, or the dependencyMap argument of AddFeatureToggles must be passed manually.\n- Add a new argument (disabledByDefault) to AddFeatureToggles method to pass a list of feature toggle keys (enums or strings) to disable by default without having to set in configuration. The default will be used if the flag is not specified in the configuration, e.g. it will not override the configuration setting. It is also possible to pass [\"*\"] to disable all features by default, but is not recommended as it would mean when we add a new feature flag in the future (not necessarily a new feature, just a new toggle to disable some part of a feature), all users would have to enable it manually in configuration.\n- Take distinct over assemblies for classic type source (DefaultTypeSource) if the passed enumerable of assemblies is an array.\n- Automatically add common namespaces like System.Collections.Generic, Serenity, Serenity.ComponentModel etc. to usings from Serenity.Net.Web.targets (e.g. any project referencing Serenity.Web) unless SerenityUsings property is explicitly set to false. This means most `Using` items from StartSharp/Serene projects might be removed.\n- Add a helper function (GetDataConnectionString) to get data connections string from IConfiguration in Startup where IConnectionStrings is not yet available. Use it only for initialization of exception log.\n- Remove react patching function that checks React is loaded after corelib, as we no longer use global react object\n- Only create databases under App_Data for SqlLocalDB (e.g. `(localdb)`), not for local SQL server etc.\n- Use MySqlConnector instead of MySql.Data which should be faster\n- Add code generation support for Oracle to Sergen\n- Create Northwind tables via fluent syntax instead of manually written SQL scripts. There is no separate autoincrement ID column in Customers table now (e.g. only CustomerID which is a string), and space in \"Order Details\" is removed, so there are some breaking changes. Northwind sample database should be recreated.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Remove invalid RequiresFeature attribute from Pro.Extensions assembly.\n- Side effect import Region dialog from TerritoryGrid to resolve issue with clicking secondary edit link on Region\n\n## 8.8.1 (2024-12-01)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix casing for `Corelib` during build (should not be `CoreLib`) which happened during switch to cake frosting, affecting case sensitive file systems\n\n## 8.8.0 (2024-11-30)\n\n### Features\n\n- Added a new [File Explorer sample](https://demo.serenity.is/AppSamples/FileExplorer) (Pro.AdvancedSamples).\n- Introduced a new [FullCalendar integration sample](https://demo.serenity.is/AppSamples/Calendar) (Pro.AdvancedSamples).\n- Implemented a feature toggle system (`IFeatureToggles`) with `RequiresFeatureAttribute` and `FeatureBarrierAttribute` to disable features at runtime. Features can be toggled via the `FeatureToggles` configuration section, which:\n  - Returns 404 for disabled pages.\n  - Removes navigation links, permissions, and UI elements related to those features.\n  - Initially applied to `DataAuditLog` and `EmailQueue` features, now merged into the `Pro.Extensions` package. These individual features can now be disabled using feature flags.\n  - **Setup note**: Register the feature flags service in `Startup.cs` and ensure the type source references it. See the updated `Startup.cs` for guidance.\n  \n- **Breaking Changes**:\n  - **Package Mergers**:\n    - `Serenity.Net.Data` and `Serenity.Net.Entity` packages are now merged into `Serenity.Net.Services`. Remove references to these packages and update `TypeSource` implementations accordingly. Switching to `ApplicationPartsTypeSource` is recommended.\n    - `Serenity.Pro.DataAuditLog` and `Serenity.Pro.EmailQueue` are merged into the `Serenity.Pro.Extensions` package. Remove their assembly references if using a classic type source.\n    - `Serenity.Pro.Theme` package contents are merged into `Serenity.Pro.Extensions`. Update references in `appsettings.bundles.json`:\n      - Replace `~/Serenity.Pro.Theme/pro-theme.js` with `~/Serenity.Pro.Extensions/pro-theme.css`.\n      - Replace `~/Serenity.Pro.Theme/pages/dashboard.css` with `~/Serenity.Pro.Extensions/pages/dashboard.css`.\n      - Replace `~/Serenity.Pro.Theme/pro-theme{.rtl}.css` with `~/Serenity.Pro.Extensions/pro-theme{.rtl}.css`.\n      - Remove `~/Serenity.Pro.Extensions/pro-extensions{.rtl}.css`, as it is merged into `pro-theme.css`.\n    - `Serenity.Pro.Organization` is merged into `Serenity.Pro.Meeting`. Remove its references from your project and `TypeSource`.\n    \n  - **Excel Report Generator**:\n    - Transitioned from EPPlus to ClosedXML due to licensing issues. The change primarily affects `ExcelReportGenerator` users, with updates to helper function arguments and return types (e.g., `XLWorkbook` instead of `ExcelPackage`). The only impacted screen was the `ProductExcelImport` sample. Other Excel export and report functionalities remain unaffected. If EPPlus is still required, manually add its reference and retain a copy of the old `ExcelReportGenerator`.\n    \n  - **Localization Updates**:\n    - `ILocalizationRow.CultureIdField` type is changed to `StringField` (culture codes like `en`, `en-GB`, etc., instead of integers). Update your `XYZLangRow` definitions and database types accordingly. A migration script (`NorthwindDB_20241120_1203_LanguageIdToCode.cs`) is provided for guidance. Language-related UI and database mapping improvements are included to streamline localization processes.\n    \n- Added `FieldLocalizationListBehavior` to support localization during list requests. Currently, only `ServiceLookupEditor` can display localized dropdowns.\n- Enhanced localization UI by adding a dropdown to select the target language, displaying inputs for the selected language only. The selection persists in local storage.\n- Introduced `TranslationConfig` class with `getLanguageList` and `translateTexts` configuration options, enabling machine translation features in forms. Update your `ScriptInit.ts` or `languages-init.ts` to use this new configuration.\n- Introduced a `Localize` property in `ListRequest` to support localization during list requests.\n- Added `IListMapFieldExpressionBehavior` for custom field expression mappings in list requests.\n- Enhanced AI-powered translation for entity localization.\n- Updated `ILanguageFallbacks.GetLanguageFallbacks` arguments and return type for improved fallback calculations.\n- Refactored entity dialog tool button properties into reusable functions (`saveAndCloseToolButton`, `applyChangesToolButton`, etc.).\n- Enhanced `onSaveSuccess` functionality to display success messages and identify the action initiator.\n- Updated `StringField.ValueFromJson` to consider the ISO date converter from Newtonsoft.Json.\n- Added a `ref` option to `ToolButtonProps` for improved button handling in `EntityDialog`.\n- Merged `MultipleFileUploadBehavior` into `FileUploadBehavior` to unify handling of both single and multiple file uploads.\n- Removed legacy request/response types: `SaveRequestWithAttachment`, `SaveWithLocalizationRequest`, `RetrieveLocalizationRequest`, and `RetrieveLocalizationResponse`.\n- Updated translations for all 23 supported languages.\n- Dependency updates:\n  - Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild to 5.7.1\n  - Microsoft.Data.Sqlite to 9.0.0\n  - Scriban to 5.12.0\n  - Microsoft.Extensions.* packages to 9.0.0\n  - System.Text.Json to 9.0.0\n  - NUglify to 1.21.10\n  - Selenium.WebDriver to 4.27.0\n  - PuppeteerSharp to 20.0.5\n\n### BugFixes\n\n- Fix check for NPM version in sergen doctor\n- Seems like browsers changed the logic for beforeunload event, we need to call preventDefault to get a confirmation when navigating away from the page.\n- Fix date time range quick filter end date pick does not trigger change event due to extra dot in \".change\"\n- Fix issue with TwoFactorAuthenticator preprocessor directives\n\n## 8.7.9 (2024-11-12)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix records cannot be added to the grid editor for in-memory mode\n\n## 8.7.8 (2024-11-12)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix issue when document.documentElement.lang is empty string\n\n## 8.7.7 (2024-11-12)\n\n### Features\n\n- Use texts.__.json as a file name for template texts, instead of texts.json, and change the comment to clarify intent.\n- Prefix field name with @ if the generated private field member name is a C# reserved keyword, e.g. for properties like `return`, `int` etc.\n- Add IsReservedKeyword method to `ISqlDialect`, and implement it for dialects. There is also an `SqlSyntax.IsReservedKeywordForAny` method that returns if an identifier is reserved in any of the known dialects. \n- Add AutoQuotedIdentifiers to the ISqlDialect interface which is null by default. If null, its value is determined from SqlSettings.DefaultDialect.AutoQuotedIdentifiers or SqlSettings.AutoQuotedIdentifiers. This will make changing this setting per connection / dialect possible by subclassing one of the dialects. Regardless of this setting, keywords will always be quoted by `SqlSyntax.AutoBracket` and `SqlSyntax.AutoBracketValid` methods. If this is not desired for some reason, dialect might return false for its IsReservedKeyword method.\n- Set `SqlSettings.AutoQuotedIdentifiers` to `true` by default. This had been set to true in both the templates for years and running Serenity tests in the same context should be better for consistency. The setting was originally introduced as a workaround for Postgres, and the way FluentMigrator quotes identifiers in migrations by default, so probably it may even be no longer necessary.\n- Modify EditorUtils.setReadonly so that it supports both widgets and elements. It also auto searches for an attached widget if an element is passed in. EditorUtils.setReadOnly and EditorUtils.setReadonly now point to the same function. There is also corelib's getElementReadOnly and setElementReadOnly functions but they only accept elements and don't search for widgets. All widgets deriving from EditorWidget now also has a readOnly property that is directly settable instead of using EditorUtils.\n- Sort OrganizationEditor items by their display texts\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix TimeSpanEditorAttribute having wrong key so it is generated as TimeEditor\n\n## 8.7.6 (2024-11-04)\n\n### Features\n\n- Add checks for common issues encountered while developing an in-memory grid editor. Throw an error from GridEditorBase.getDialogType() method if it is not overridden. Check if the dialog type returned from getDialogType() is a subclass of GridEditorDialog, not EntityDialog.  Ensure that id property name returned from getIdProperty() methods of the GridEditorDialog and GridEditorBase are same.\n- Add ability to use connected mode (e.g. calling services) for in-memory grid editors by setting connectedMode to true. This may be used with some grid editors so that if the parent dialog is in edit mode (e.g. the master id is available) the grid editor directly loads and updates the records directly via the service (without waiting for the main dialog to save). For this to work, the grid editor and its dialog must both return the actual ID property from their getIdProperty method or use getRowDefinition. Also, the grid editor should have a masterId property that in its setter should set itself to connectedMode if the masterId is assigned. See changes in Northwind OrderRow, Order Dialog / OrderDetailsEditor and its OrderDetailDialog for a sample.\n- Add getCreateServiceMethod, getUpdateServiceMethod, getDeleteServiceMethod, getRetrieveServiceMethod functions to entity dialog to override individual services if required.\n- Add protected getServiceMethod and getServiceUrl methods to entitygrid to customize List service url without having to override getViewOptions.\n- Split Serene/StartSharp Texts class into small targeted classes\n- Only export generic `Texts` constant from `Texts.ts` if there is a class with name \"Texts\" is available. This should prevent mixing up Texts classes from other packages.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix missing user.GetIdentifier() causing cached roles to mixed up in BasePermissionService<T> implementation\n\n## 8.7.5 (2024-10-31)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix element returned from format function gets prepended to inner html of slick cell if the formatter also returns one of addClass, addAttrs, or tooltip properties.\n\n## 8.7.4 (2024-10-30)\n\n### Features\n\n- Introduce a new ApplicationPartsTypeSource which gets list of assemblies from ApplicationPartManager and concats Serenity.Net assemblies. This will make manually written type source implementations obsolete and will allow dynamically including assemblies by adding to application parts. Note that even though it sorts assemblies topologically, the order of assemblies might not exactly match a manually written type source, which may have some side effects for code that expects a specific order, for example service behaviors.\n- Add ExtensionsTypeSource and ProExtensionsTypeSource that may be used in Serene/StartSharp typeSource. They also include Serenity.Net.* and Serenity.Extensions assembly reference properties. ApplicationPartsTypeSource is preferred over them, but you may subclass them in your TypeSource if you want to preserve previous assembly order.\n- Use queueMicrotask only for dialog types, as only they may have circular dependencies via forms causing swc to fail in tests.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix auto column tooltip plugin not working without jQuery\n- Fix uploader not reading multiple property from the input element properly (#7276)\n- Fix scroll bar for full-height pages in Serene (#7277)\n\n## 8.7.3 (2024-10-26)\n\n### Features\n\n- Use better marker types in TypeSource.cs that are less likely to move between assemblies in the future\n- Removed .sln files and use .slnf files (solution filters) generated from a single Serenity.sln at root for partial builds. Use Serenity.sln instead of Serene.sln.\n- Add a BaseDynamicDataGenerator that may be used in other projects to create dynamic-data folder for javascript tests\n- Moved dynamic script abstractions up to Serenity.Core and base types to Serenity.Services\n- Added a SetSergenTransformArgs target to Serenity.Net.Web.targets and use that instead of setting SergenTransformArgs in Feature.Build.targets and template .csproj files\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed toolbar button with disabled class still clickable via its .button-inner element (#7272)\n\n## 8.7.2 (2024-10-23)\n\n### Features\n\n- The Serene repository has been merged into the Serenity repository as a subfolder at `/serene`.\n- The common features repository has been merged into the Serenity repository as a subfolder at `/common-features`.\n- The `Toolbar.createButton` method has been made public and static again, as it is still being used.\n- Moved rules from `common-style.css` to `common-theme.css`. The `common-style.css` file can now be removed from `Serene's appsettings.bundles.json`.\n- Introduced a new `BasePermissionKeyLister` class, which can be overridden in Serene/StartSharp by `PermissionKeyLister` classes to reduce the amount of code in templates and apps.\n- Introduced a new `BaseUserRetrieveService` to simplify the implementation of `UserRetrieveService`.\n- Introduced a new `BaseRolePermissionService` to simplify the implementation of `RolePermissionService` in Serene/StartSharp.\n- Added an `IUserProvider` abstraction that combines `IUserAccessor`, `IImpersonator`, `IUserClaimCreator`, `IUserRetrieveService`, and `IUserCacheInvalidator`. Use the generic version of the `AddUserProvider` extension to register it and its dependencies in one step, e.g., `services.AddUserProvider<AppServices.UserAccessor, AppServices.UserRetrieveService>()`.\n- Added an `IRemoveCachedUser` abstraction to replace the static method used for removing cached users from `IUserRetrieveService`. The static method was not accessible from other service implementations in referenced libraries.\n- Shared code between the MVC source generator and MVC command. Now generates partial static classes and always uses the project root namespace, avoiding a top-level `.MVC` namespace. It also generates internal instead of public MVC/ESM classes if `MVC:InternalAccess` is true in sergen.json, to prevent naming conflicts that could break the build.\n- Introduced new `IdentityKey` and `AutoIncrement` migration builder extensions, which should be used instead of `CreateTableWithId32/64` (now deprecated). These extensions also resolve issues with how identity and primary key columns are handled differently in Oracle and MySQL.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed an issue in `SlickFormatting.treeToggle` related to formatters returning elements.\n- Resolved data migration issues for Oracle and MySQL servers.\n\n## 8.7.1 (2024-10-16)\n\n### Features\n\n- `ComboboxEditor` now preserves the order during `initSelection` for async/sync sources.\n- Added an optional hook for `fetchScriptData` to intercept script data loading via fetch/xhr (sync), primarily for testing purposes.\n- Utilized `queueMicrotask` for side-effect imports of referenced types, preventing issues with circular dependencies (noticed with SWC-based Jest tests).\n- Enabled passing `callback` and `fail` arguments to `loadByIdAndOpenDialog`.\n- Introduced an `Html.ModulePageInit` extension that generates a `pageInit` script and automatically includes related CSS if it exists.\n- Added the `Html.AutoIncludeModuleCss` extension to auto-include an ES module's related CSS file (generated by esbuild) into pages, e.g., `GridPage`.\n- Added a `layout` option to grid/panel page extensions.\n- Implemented esbuild's CSS import/bundling functionality in samples like Northwind. Page-specific CSS rules are split into their own `XYZPage.css` files and imported by `XYZPage.ts`.\n- Configured the TSBuild clean plugin to delete extra `.css` and `.css.map` files generated by esbuild.\n- Updated various dependencies:\n  - `Microsoft.Extensions.Caching.Memory` to 8.0.1\n  - `System.Text.Json` to 8.0.5\n  - `Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild` to 5.6.2\n  - `FluentMigrator` to 6.2.0\n  - `MailKit` to 4.8.0\n  - `Mono.Cecil` to 0.11.6\n  - `Npgsql` to 8.0.4\n  - `Selenium.WebDriver` to 4.25.0\n  - `xunit` to 2.9.2\n  - `@swc/core` to 1.7.26\n  - `typescript` to 5.6.2\n  - `dompurify` to 3.1.7\n  - `preact` to 10.24.2\n  - `tsbuild` to 8.7.4\n\n## 8.7.0 (2024-10-07)\n\n### Features\n\n- Completely rewritten 2FA authentication system supporting Email, SMS, Authenticator apps, and other methods by implementing relevant interfaces in `Serenity.Pro.Extensions`.\n- Introduced a new 2FA settings UI to configure, enable, and disable 2FA methods for the current user.\n- Added a `TwoFactorData` field to the Users table. This migration also removes the `MobilePhoneVerified` and `TwoFactorAuth` columns, as they are no longer used.\n- New `Authenticator` two-factor method (`Serenity.Pro.TwoFactorAuthenticator`) allows using Authenticator apps (TOTP) for 2FA (available only in Business/Enterprise versions).\n- Rewritten `~/Serenity.Extensions/common-style.css` and `~/Serenity.Extensions/common-theme.css` to align closely with the premium theme. These now include SlickGrid, Select2, and jQuery File Upload styles. Serene users should remove `slick.grid.css`, `jquery.fileupload.css`, and `select2.css` from their `appsettings.bundles.json` files.\n- Added AI translation options to the Translation page. The default implementation works with any local or remote API compatible with OpenAI. Other APIs can be integrated by implementing an interface.\n- Built-in types from corelib and SleekGrid are now included in the code generation process (Sergen/Pro.Coder). This reduces the occurrence of errors when dependencies are missing, such as when `npm install` fails or isn't run.\n- Added more checks to the `sergen doctor` command, including version mismatches between `Serenity.Net.*` and `sergen`.\n- Updated various libraries: Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to 5.2.2, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite to 8.0.8, MailKit to 4.7.1.1, X.PagedList.Mvc.Core to 10.1.2, Bogus to 35.6.1, @swc/core to 1.7.23, esbuild to 0.23.1, rollup to 4.21.2, terser to 5.31.6, tslib to 2.7.0, typescript to 5.5.4, chart.js to 4.4.4, dompurify to 3.1.6, tsbuild to 8.6.6, @preact/signals to 1.3.0, and preact to 10.23.2.\n- Switched to `X.Web.PagedList` from `X.PagedList.Mvc.Core`, as the latter is deprecated.\n- Replaced `StackExchange.Exceptional.AspNetCore` with a custom fork, `Serenity.Exceptional.AspNetCore` (https://github.com/serenity-is/exceptional), removing the remaining `System.Data.SqlClient` reference. This reduces platform-specific assemblies under `bin/runtime` by about 4MB.\n- Removed the `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite` reference from `StartSharp.Web`. Users can add the reference manually if needed, saving 20MB of platform-specific assemblies.\n- Sergen now generates an ESM helper (e.g., ESM entry points generator in Pro.Coder) in addition to an MVC helper with the `MVC` command.\n- Shortcut constants are now generated directly under the ESM helper class for entry points with unique filenames matching root folders.\n- Sergen now processes `.mts` files when parsing TypeScript code.\n- You can now extend default EntryPoints in `sergen.json` by specifying `\"+\"` as the first item.\n- Added a generic version of the `GridPage` extension that retrieves the page title from the Row type.\n- Set `moduleResolution` to `bundler` (supported in TypeScript 5.0.2+) since esbuild/rollup are used for bundling.\n- Added an `itemId` function to `DataGrid` that returns the ID property value of a given item.\n- `ToolButton` now accepts `HTMLElement` as a title, simplifying the rendering of Bootstrap dropdowns and other buttons in the toolbar.\n- Converted most corelib code using `document.createElement`/Fluent to JSX syntax.\n- Set `ServerTypings` to use `PreferRelativePaths = true` (defaults@6.6.0) to avoid issues when no `@/*` mapping is found in `tsconfig.json`, or it is defined in a base file in another directory without a `baseUrl: \".\"` configuration.\n- Code is now generated for abstract types (like base endpoints) that have a `ScriptInclude` attribute.\n- Switched the `Texts.ts` declaration class to use the `texts` namespace instead of the root namespace.\n- Generated shortcut constants for individual nested local text classes in `Texts.ts`, such as `ValidationTexts`, in addition to just `Texts`.\n- Introduced a `TransformInclude` interface in corelib. When extended by an interface, it allows generating client types for those types during transformation, useful for compile-time checking of page props and other script interfaces referenced server-side.\n- Improved class member ordering in code generation for source generators when a service/row class is split into partial files by ordering members by originating source file.\n- Added distributed cache support to `Throttler`.\n- Added a `Config.defaultReturnUrl` setting and `getReturnUrl` function in corelib, which can be used on the login page to get the return URL from the query string or fallback to a default. The `Config.defaultReturnUrl` function can be overridden for custom logic.\n- Added a `ValidationError` constructor that accepts `localizer` and `local text message` arguments.\n- Added `DataProtectorBinaryTokenExtensions` to streamline `IDataProtector` usage with `BinaryReader/BinaryWriter` and `Base64UrlEncode/Base64UrlDecode`, reducing repeated code when encoding/decoding tokens.\n- Added a new `FunctionCallCriteria` base type and an `UpperFunctionCriteria` subclass to handle LIKE statements in case-sensitive databases by automatically applying `UPPER` for `StringField` types.\n- Added several SleekGrid samples to `Serenity.Demo.AdvancedSamples`.\n- Removed the direct dependency of `Serenity.Data` on `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient` by using reflection where necessary.\n- Switched to esbuild for generating `corelib/wwwroot/index.global.js` instead of Rollup.\n- Added `IconClassAttribute` to specify icons for UI elements, currently used for the 2FA interface.\n\n### Breaking Changes\n\n- Removed legacy namespace-based server typings generation support for Sergen/Pro.Coder. Existing generated files under `Imports/ServerTypings` will not be deleted, but migrating to modern ESM modules is strongly recommended.\n- Removed legacy namespace mode code generation support in Sergen. It now only generates ESM-style code, even in projects with namespace-based code.\n- The legacy Open Sans font under `~/Serenity.Assets/Content/font-open-sans.css` has been removed. Serene users should update `appsettings.bundles.json` to reference `~/Serenity.Assets/fonts/open-sans/open-sans.css`.\n- The legacy `~/Serenity.Assets/Content/font-awesome.css` has been removed. Serene users should replace it with `~/Serenity.Assets/line-awesome/css/line-awesome-fa.min.css` to switch to the Line Awesome font.\n- Removed unused assets such as `bootstrap-icons`, `tabler-icons`, `jquery.fileupload.css`, `jspdf.js`, `jquery.autoNumeric.js`, `jquery.validate.js`, and legacy font versions. \n- Removed `toastr.css` and `toastr.js` from `Serenity.Assets`. They are now integrated into corelib and pro-theme/common-style files.\n- Removed `select2.css` and related files from `Serenity.Assets`. They are now integrated into pro-theme/common-style files.\n- Sergen no longer supports the \"restore\" command as all assets are delivered as static web assets or via npm. Legacy namespace typings restore is no longer supported.\n\n### Bug Fixes\n\n- Fixed an issue where `this.time` could be null when `DateTimeEditor` uses flatpickr or the browser's default input.\n- Fixed a script error in the `BasicProgressDialog` cancel function.\n\n## 8.6.4 (2024-08-29)\n\n### Features\n\n- A new `dotnet sergen doctor` command that will check a project for issues related to environment and NPM/NuGet package versions.\n- Update jsx-dom to 8.1.5\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Fix conversion issue with Sql VarBinary columns and setting to null (Implicit conversion from data type nvarchar to varbinary(max) is not allowed. Use the CONVERT function to run this query). This could effect SqlUploadStorage.\n\n## 8.6.3 (2024-08-24)\n\n### Features\n\n- Introducing a new `ServiceEndpointModelBinderProvider` that can be added to `options.ModelMetadataDetailsProviders` in `Startup.cs` as `options.ModelMetadataDetailsProviders.Add(new ServiceEndpointBindingMetadataProvider());` instead of using `options.ModelBinderProviders.Insert(0, new ServiceEndpointModelBinderProvider());`.\n- Added a `sanitizeUrl` method that can be used with JSX `href` attributes to sanitize URLs rendered from user content.\n- Added a third optional `options` argument for extensions of `GridPage` and `PanelPage`.\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Fixed an issue where `DateTimeEditor` couldn't be set back to `readonly=false`.\n- Corrected the text for the validation rule of lowercase characters in passwords.\n\n## 8.6.2 (2024-08-11)\n\n### Features\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** Enhanced security against XSS attacks: HTML strings returned from formatters and format functions are now automatically sanitized by default. While formatters should already use `ctx.escape()` to handle any user-provided or dynamic content, this change adds an extra layer of protection. The default sanitizer is a basic regex-based solution, but if DOMPurify is available globally, it will be used instead. You can also specify a custom sanitizer by setting `gridDefaults.sanitizer` (in `@serenity-is/sleekgrid`) via `ScriptInit.ts`. Keep in mind that most sanitizers will strip out unsafe content, including JavaScript URLs like `javascript:void(0)`. To ensure security and compatibility, it is recommended to update existing formatters to use `jsx-dom` or `Fluent` instead of returning raw HTML strings. If necessary (though not advised), you can disable sanitization by setting `gridDefaults.sanitizer` to a pass-through function, such as `(dirtyHtml: string) => dirtyHtml`.\n- Sergen now generates files with a `.tsx` extension instead of `.ts` for `Dialog`, `Grid`, and `Page` components, simplifying the use of JSX syntax (e.g., jsx-dom) in your projects.\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Fixed Pro.Coder ESM/MVC source generators do not operate properly with Visual Studio in some cases.\n- Fixed an issue where the tooltip toggle method did not return the instance if it was disposed.\n\n## 8.6.1 (2024-08-07)\n\n### Features\n- Add SleekGrid option to renderAllRows, similar to renderAllCels for columns, which effectively disables virtualization and preserves natural cell / row order when both is true, though it can be expensive for many rows / cells\n- Set the default for SleekGrid useLegacyUI to false\n- Use declare for class fields to avoid them becoming properties (e.g. defineProperty) when useDefineForClassFields is true (https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#the-usedefineforclassfields-flag-and-the-declare-property-modifier)\n- Update TypeScript Scanner code to TypeScript current main (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/commit/9757109cafcb771a35ad9fe09855373cdd82005a)\n- Move service implementations under StartSharp.AppServices namespace to Modules/Common/AppServices folder, and move abstractions and models to Modules/Common/AppServices/Abstractions and Modules/Common/AppServices/Models folders\n- Added Bootstrap buttons sample under UI Samples\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Fix frozen columns not rendered when scrolling vertically if horizontal scroll is bigger than frozen cols\n\n## 8.6.0 (2024-07-13)\n\n### Features\n- Updated esbuild to 0.23.0 in tsbuild 8.6.0 which is necessary for modern (non experimental) decorator support in TypeScript. Please remove experimentalDecorators line from tsconfig.json after updating \"@serenity-is/tsbuild\" to 8.6.0 or later and update Visual Studio (for TypeScript update).\n- Added experimental editor addon support, which provides ability to add content like icons, text, buttons inside and next to editors. See [Editor Addons Sample](https://demo.serenity.is/AdvancedSamples/EditorAddons) for more info.\n- New EditorCssClass attribute that adds a css class to the editor element.\n- Added value option to PropertyGrid, which if not \"false\", loads the given value as initial entity\n- PropertyGrid is divided into functional sub components like PropertyFieldElement, PropertyFieldCaption, PropertyGridCategory, PropertyTabs etc.\n- PropertyGrid defaultCategory and categoryOrder options which was unused\n- Remove first-category class from the property grid's first as it can be done via css\n- Add a vertical gap between categories\n- Remove category links generation in property grid (they were hidden before)\n- Aded data-category attribute to category divs in property grid\n- Allow passing editor type to the propertygrid item via its type reference instead of string\n- Removed unused toastr options like closeMethod, closeDuration, closeEasing, showDuration, hideDuration etc. which was related to animation but were not implemented.\n- By setting timeOut option to -1 for toastr, the notification can be made sticky. It required setting both timeOut and extendedTimeOut to 0 before.\n- Add ability to lazily load types via Config.lazyTypeLoader callback. For it to work getOrLoad / tryGetOrLoad functions of corresponding type registry (e.g. DialogTypeRegistry / FormatterTypeRegistry etc.) should be used instead of get/tryGet which may result in async behavior that should be handled by the caller.\n- Handle passive event listener warnings for combobox editor\n- Try to avoid Router closing dialogs when clicking a hash link that does not look like a handled route (e.g. #edit/..., #new etc.)\n- Drag drop in tree grid sample no longer requires jquery.event.drag\n- Determine the default editor type as TimeSpanEditor for TimeSpan typed properties. (#7206). Add multiplier option to legacy TimeEditor (integer value) that allows storing seconds or milliseconds instead of the minutes which was the default.\n- Avoid signal aborted without reason errors in console for service calls\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Fix criteria DateTimeOffset and DateTime JSON parsing (#7180) caused by difference in System.Text.Json\n- DateTimeFormatter does not use the passed DisplayFormat.\n- Don't return empty string for Fluent.val on non-existing inputs, e.g. when this.el is null. Return undefined instead like it was for jQuery.\n- Fix filter display value not showing for enum editor, #7193\n- Add back css for .drag-helper which is used in drag drop in tree grid sample\n\n## 8.5.6 (2024-06-13)\n\n### Features\n- Replace the internal \"remove\" event, triggered by Fluent when an element is cleaned up (e.g., by calling `remove()` on itself or `empty()` on its parent), with a new \"disposing\" event. Note: This may be a breaking change if you were using this undocumented event.\n- Enable the space key in the date-time editor to set the current date and time again (only when the field is empty or all text is selected).\n- Added support for `ByteArrayField` and `RowField` in the `GenerateRowFields` attribute.\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Fix the esbuild minifier locks for empty code blocks.\n- Resolve the issue where the column picker dialog closes when dragging and dropping.\n\n## 8.5.5 (2024-06-08)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix static Dialog.onClose for modals when the modal is not initialized as the event triggered on body is not regular bs modal events\n\n## 8.5.4 (2024-06-08)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fix assigned fields array for more than 64 fields is not cleared during clone if only one of the first 64 fields were assigned before cloning\n\n## 8.5.3 (2024-06-07)\n\n### Features\n\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** Moved image processing methods like `ScaleImage` from `UploadStorageExtensions` to `DefaultUploadProcessor` as virtual methods. Removed `FileUploadBehavior.CheckUploadedImageAndCreateThumbs` and used the existing `IUploadProcessor` interface instead.\n- Added additional metadata such as `EntityType` (row full name), `EntityTable` (table name), `EntityId` (ID property value), `EntityField`/`EntityProperty` (field/property where the upload editor is placed) to enable tracing files back to their original entities. Also set generated `ImageSize` and `ThumbSize` as metadata to avoid loading image files to get actual sizes when required. This prepares for adding custom metadata like tags, descriptions, etc., to files if desired.\n- `IUploadProcessor` no longer returns a `Success` flag and raises an exception instead. The check for `.Success` should be removed from `FilePage` after updating to Serenity 8.5.3+. The property still exists but is obsolete and will always return true, so this is not a breaking change.\n- There is no need to set the original name in `FilePage` as the upload processor handles it now.\n- Improved handling of situations where a script or CSS file is locked by a process when trying to get the content hash.\n- Made EsBuild the default script/CSS minifier, as Nuglify has issues with some script syntax.\n- Added `allStart` / `allStop` events to the uploader and triggered `allStart`, `allStop`, `batchStart`, `batchStop` events on upload input if available.\n- Updated Google Maps editor sample for the latest API changes.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed an issue where the widget constructor would fail when an empty array is passed as an element.\n\n## 8.5.2 (2024-06-05)\n\n### Features\n\n- Added a \"More Information\" link (https://serenity.is/docs/av) for the failed AV scan message.\n- Improved the combobox editor by attempting to transfer the text typed into the inplace-add dialog, if the dialog provides a name property via its getNameProperty function.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed an issue where upload editors did not display errors returned from TemporaryUpload and incorrectly assumed the upload was successful, even in cases of blacklist or other validation errors.\n- Resolved a problem where the data audit log migration added in version 8.5.1 failed in SQLite (e.g., tests/Linux) due to SQLite's lack of support for altering columns.\n\n## 8.5.1 (2024-06-04)\n\n### Features\n\n- Added optional generic type arguments to several Fluent functions, such as `closest`.\n- `Fluent.findEach` now passes the index as the second argument to the callback.\n- Introduced static versions of `Dialog.onOpen` and `Dialog.onClose` that function even when the dialog is not yet initialized, as the mode (modal, panel, UI) is unknown at that time.\n- Added `onOpen` and `onClose` methods to `BaseDialog` to attach event handlers for dialogs, which operate even before the dialog is initialized.\n- Changed the second argument (previously `before`) to an options object for `Dialog.onOpen` and `Dialog.onClose` to allow the `oneOff` option. This change may be breaking if the second argument, such as `before`, was used.\n- Switched to using a bitmask instead of a boolean array for assigned field tracking. If the number of fields is less than 64, this reduces the amount of allocations.\n- Released `tsbuild` 8.5.0, which updates esbuild to 0.21.4. After updating `tsbuild`, the `experimentalDecorators` option in `tsconfig.json` is no longer needed when using TypeScript 5.0+.\n- Added a context argument to the `Serenity` decorator function to support JavaScript decorators in addition to TypeScript experimental decorators.\n- Utilized `CSS.escape` to prevent issues when a field name contains special characters while searching for quick filters.\n- Enabled pending changes confirmation to work even when the dialog is not yet initialized. Normally, `DialogUtils.pendingChangesConfirmation` should be called from the `initDialog` method, but some instances call it from the constructor where the dialog is not yet created.\n- Increased the size of the `TableName`, `RecordId`, and `FieldName` columns to 200 in the `DataAuditLog` table (StartSharp).\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed: Replaced `select *` with `select datname` in PostgreSQL database queries for data migrations.\n\n## 8.5.0 (2024-05-16)\n\n### Features\n\n- Allow `permissionService` to be passed as `null` to the `TransientGrantingPermissionService`. This enables wrapping within another permission service. If `permissionService` is `null` and no transient permissions are granted, it returns `false`.\n- Add `ITransientGrantor` interface to `LogicOperatorPermissionService` to ensure the wrapped permission service retains transient granting support.\n- Add `ITransientGrantor` interface to `OpenIdScopePermissionWrapper` to preserve the `ITransientGrantor` interface if the wrapped permission service implements it (StartSharp).\n- Add `ITransientGrantor` support to the default `IPermissionService` implementation (`PermissionService`), eliminating the need for separate configuration in `Startup.cs`.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** Added `IsAllGranted` and `GetGranted` methods to the `ITransientGrantor` interface. Custom implementations not using `TransientGrantingPermissionService` should be updated to include these methods.\n- Add impersonation/transient grant support during report callback execution based on current user/transient granting status. This is useful for background task report generation.\n- Introduce `AddSingletonWrapped` extension to simplify wrapping services like `IPermissionService`.\n- Added `AsObjectNoCheck` function to skip `TrackWithChecks` errors for behaviors, etc. Use with caution.\n- Add `FileName` property to `ReportRenderResult` to determine the download name from the result without accessing the rendered report.\n- Introduce `IReportCallbackInterceptor` interface.\n- Allow passing `bubbles`/`cancelable` via event args through `Fluent.trigger`.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** Rename previously exported `SleekGrid` compat editor types, such as changing `IntegerEditor` to `IntegerCellEdit`, to avoid clashes with corelib editor types. These legacy editor types are rarely used in Serenity apps, so this change should not cause issues.\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fixed batch ending condition in the `Uploader` class affecting multiple uploads (#7139).\n- Added support for jQuery UI tabs active/link selectors in `TabExtensions` methods.\n- Restored color application to category titles as previously implemented.\n\n## 8.4.8 (2024-05-03)\n\n### Features:\n\n- New AuditedAttribute which when placed on a row property like Audited(false), can skip auditing for that particular field\n- Add option to prefer relative paths in sergen.json (\"../ServerTypes/\" instead of \"@/ServerTypes/\") which is better when directly referencing TypeScript source code in feature projects from Jest tests etc.\n- Hide category links in Serene just like in StartSharp. Category links are deprecated and will be eventually removed.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Remove extra folder for RequestHandlers while generating code with sergen\n- Fix clicking on category link click closing dialog, due to renderContents called before derived initializers (e.g. arrow functions) run, causing this.categoryLinkClick to be undefined.\n- Fix upload issue in Serene due to HandleUploadRequest in FilePage returning ServiceResponse type instead of UploadResponse, resulting in missing value in JSON serialization.\n\n## 8.4.7 (2024-04-27)\n\n### Features:\n\n- Introduced a new IInitializeLocalTexts abstraction, which should be used in Startup.cs instead of an InitializeLocalTexts method by calling services.AddLocalTextInitializer() in ConfigureServices, and calling app.InitializeLocalTexts in Configure method.\n- Add option to show service errors as notification by passing third arg as true. Show errors in slick remote view as notification instead of alert dialog like it was before. \n- Made messages shown in showServiceError function localizable\n- Set UseHardlinksIfPossible to true for copying files under node_modules/.dotnet\n- Removing get_entity/set_entity/get_entityId/set_entityId methods in entity/property dialogs, which were remaining from Saltaralle times and using properties instead\n- Moved byId and findById methods up to Widget class as preparation for obsoleting/removing TemplatedWidget\n- Removing TemplateScript type and registration. .Template.html and ts.html files were already deprecated before along with getTemplate which will be removed soon.\n- TemplatedWidget is deprecated, use Widget instead. TemplatedPanel is deprecated, use BasePanel. TemplatedDialog is deprecated, use BaseDialog. These changes reflect deprecating legacy template mechanism in 8.2.0. Use renderContents method to return markup via tsx/jsx-dom, or Fluent(...).getNode(). Even though legacy getTemplate() will be supported internally, it is not recommended.\n- Allow passing editorType as type in addition to string for PromptDialog\n- Pad column names with spaces to avoid unique column errors while exporting to Excel (if multiple columns has the same display name), and also add _numbers to table names\n- Set IgnoreHTTPSErrors to true for PuppeteerHtmlToPdf to overcome development certificate issues\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Fix TemporaryFileHelper.TryDeleteOrMark not working properly with virtual file systems\n- Fix prompt dialog validateValue callback\n- Fix SqlFileSystem null reference exception during GetFiles\n- Fix impersonation links sometimes failing due to base64 / url encoding and caching issues\n- Add missing top/left to select2-offscreen which was in the original css. This was causing unnecessary scroll bars.\n\n## 8.4.6 (2024-04-16)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Fix sortablejs removing draggable attribute from .slick-resizable-handle after columns change, stopping column resizing\n- DataExplorer might fail on Postgres as migrator create ID field with quotes\n- Fix sorting issue when data explorer grid is sorted manually by ID, and clear sort columns when changing table\n- Missing brackets in DisplayName expression for EmailQueueRow causing issue in Postgres due to the way FluentMigrator quotes field names by default\n\n## 8.4.5 (2024-04-16)\n\n## Features:\n\n- Update SixLabors.ImageSharp to 2.1.8 (2.1.7 seems to have a vulnerability)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Contains operator not working properly in filter dialog\n- Select2 positioning does not work inside a modal when page is scrolled down\n\n## 8.4.4 (2024-04-06)\n\n### Features:\n\n- Improve drag drop group by handling StartSharp\n- Added an unhandledRejectionHandler which should be installed via ScriptInit.ts or errorhandling-init.ts file via `window.addEventListener(\"unhandledrejection\", ErrorHandling.unhandledRejectionHandler);` so that it does not result in unhandled promise errors for serviceCall/serviceFetch methods.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** As jsx-dom has recently fixed an issue (before version 8.1.4) where ref callbacks were not executed for React style class components like Serenity Widgets, we will no longer call the ref callback from the Widget itself to avoid double execution. This might cause problems when an older version of jsx-dom is used. So, after updating to Serenity 8.4.4+, please update jsx-dom in your package.json to 8.1.4+ and run npm install.\n- Widget.element is no longer deprecated, it just returns a Fluent object wrapping this.domNode\n- Added a Fluent.findEach function that executes a callback for each element found with a Fluent object\n- Added Fluent.after and Fluent.before methods similar to jQuery ones.\n- Added frequently used click/focus methods to Fluent to make it easier to port from jQuery\n- Add static versions of Fluent.findAll, Fluent.findEach, Fluent.findFirst that works with the document\n- Removing typings for jQuery extensions getWidget and tryGetWidget as they are causing a global jQuery object to be available in TypeScript context even if it doesn't. The methods are still there. If you still use them cast jQuery object to any or add a global.d.ts with contents of old jquery-globals.d.ts that is removed in the commit.\n- Message dialog types are now ignored for routing, e.g. they don't modify the URL hash when opening/closing\n- Updated System.Text.Json to 8.0.3, Dapper to 2.1.35, Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to 5.2.0, System.IO.Abstractions.TestingHelpers, coverlet.collector, Selenium.WebDriver and db connectors in sergen\n- Updated SleekGrid to 1.8.0\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Select2 input was not readonly for multi select even if the select itself is readonly\n- Fix select all button function in CheckLookupEditor\n- Label style width was set to XYZpxpx instead of XYZpx breaking form label widths\n- Missing parens in coalesce for vMin calculation in IntegerEditor\n- Allow clearing by backspace in autonumeric based editors when minValue > 0\n\n## 8.4.3 (2024-03-25)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Fix possible closure variable issue with edit link formatting\n\n## 8.4.2 (2024-03-24)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Fix select2 null ref error in some cases\n\n## 8.4.1 (2024-03-22)\n\n### Features:\n\n- The url method in jquery validate port made functional again.\n- JsonField.ValueFromJson is now be able to read from non string fields just like Newtonsoft version did before the System.Text.Json switch\n\n## 8.4.0 (2024-03-20)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Panel root element is not removed on destroy\n\n## 8.3.9 (2024-03-20)\n\n### Bugfixes\n\n- Fluent.getWidget and Fluent.tryGetWidget uses wrong target and fails\n- Order for reason / message in service call / fetch Promise reject reason\n\n## 8.3.8 (2024-03-19)\n\n### Features:\n\n- Improve generated dynamic script code behavior when Serenity is not pre-loaded\n- Make getWidget and tryGetWidget available on Fluent. It was normally available but declaration merging did not properly change \"@serenity-is/base\" to \"@serenity-is/corelib\" although base was bundled into corelib\n- Improve router resolve handling when pending requests are in progress\n- **`[Breaking change]`** Panel events will fire at the .panel-body instead of .s-Panel. This will make it compatible with ui dialog behavior and will allow attaching panelopen events before the panel body is wrapped with a s-Panel. We also now fire new modalbeforeopen modalopen etc. events at .modal-body for Bootstrap modal to make behavior consistent between all dialog types. This is required as it is possible for our dialogs to be opened later as a panel, ui-dialog or modal, but this information is not available on Dialog class creation and the body element is not yet wrapped with any of dialog types yet.\n\n## 8.3.7 (2024-03-10)\n\n### Features:\n- Added `Fluent.matches` method which is like $.is but don't support any custom selectors and calls element.matches\n- Added `Fluent.class` method which directly sets the className property. This should be preferred to addClass for element creation\n- Added a `Fluent.isDefaultPrevented` helper to overcome issues when jQuery exists or not so that we don't have to check both e.defaultPrevented and e.isDefaultPrevented?.()\n- Added a `Fluent.eventProp` helper to read a property from event, event.originalEvent or event.detail as jQuery does not pass custom properties like route etc. to the synthetic event.\n- `SubDialogHelper.bindToDataChange` auto extracts the original event if used with jQuery so that data change info can be easily accessed\n- Also trigger ajaxStart/ajaxStop events on document when jquery is not available\n- NProgress works when jQuery is not available (StartSharp)\n- Allow directly passing formatSelection and formatResult from ComboboxOptions to Select2, so that providerOptions don't need to be set explicitly.\n\n## 8.3.6 (2024-03-03)\n\n### Features:\n- Add Fluent.byId which is shortcut for Fluent(document.getElementById)\n- Add Fluent.each and Fluent.style which executes a callback with the node or css style declaration if element is not null\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Column resizing does not work in Firefox without jQuery resizable due to longstanding Firefox issue\n\n## 8.3.5 (2024-02-28)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Avoid using js reserved words while generating variable names for compacting property item scripts\n- Fix code for disabling combobox inplace button dialog's delete button via Fluent (https://github.com/serenity-premium/startsharp/issues/915)\n\n## 8.3.4 (2024-02-24)\n\n### Features:\n\n- New actions dropdown in grid sample for StartSharp.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- ComboboxEditor.get_text returning `[object Object]` affecting inline editing etc.\n- CKEditor container class assignment\n- Fix Drag Drop in Tree Grid sample which requires jquery and jquery.event.drag scripts.\n\n## 8.3.3 (2024-02-21)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Fix select2/combobox paging more results calculation\n\n## 8.3.2 (2024-02-20)\n\n### Features:\n\n- Implemented the use of AsyncLocal instead of ThreadLocal for ImpersonatingUserAccessor and TransientGrantingPermissionService. This change enables background tasks to work with async code even when HttpContext is unavailable.\n- Changed event handling from touchstart/mousedown to click for mobile browsers, preventing the select2 dropdown from opening while touch scrolling.\n- Applied focus to select2 when the hidden input is focused, such as by clicking its label.\n- Removed left/top rules from select2-offscreen to prevent the hidden input from scrolling to the top of the page when its label is clicked.\n- Updated the following packages:\n  - Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to 5.1.5\n  - Dapper to 2.1.28\n  - Nuglify to 1.21.4\n  - System.Text.Json to 8.0.2\n  - Microsoft.Data.Sqlite to 8.0.2\n  - Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild to 5.3.3\n  - Markdig to 0.35.0\n  - Bogus to 35.4.0\n  - PuppeteerSharp to 14.1.0\n  - Updated Sergen's references Scriban, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite, MySqlConnector, Npgsql, Spectre.Console to the latest versions.\n  - Several packages in test projects including Selenium.WebDriver to 4.17.0, WebDriverManager to 2.17.2, System.IO.Abstractions.TestingHelpers to 2.0.15.\n- Added `fullscreen-lg-down` class to FilterDialog.\n- Updated OpenIddict to 5.2.0 in StartSharp.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** Removed external Select2 script usage since 8.3.0 and embedded it. Replaced Select2.util.stripDiacritics with the `stripDiacritics` method from `@serenity-is/corelib`.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Ensured destruction of flatpickr instance for dateeditor/datetimeeditor.\n- Fixed Flatpickr clearing the input value on focus out of readonly input as disable returns true for the current date.\n- Addressed an issue where some nodes may not have the hasChildNodes method (https://github.com/orgs/serenity-is/discussions/7080) and Fluent.empty is called on the wrong element in Select2.\n- Resolved a scenario where Comboboxeditor was sometimes returning `more: true` while there are no more pages.\n- Corrected WarningDialog to show WarningTitle instead of SuccessTitle (#7082).\n- Added a check for null before Fluent.prependTo.\n- Applied class toggle for category collapse icon in propertygrid.ts (#7084).\n\n## 8.3.1 (2024-02-09)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Fix potential stack overflow with Fluent.remove\n\n## 8.3.0 (2024-02-09)\n\n### Features:\n\n- In this version, we are removing the jQuery dependency, along with other scripts like `Select2`, `jQuery Validate`, `autoNumeric`. These three plugins have been converted to TypeScript without jQuery dependencies and are embedded into Serenity Corelib. The jQuery mask input plugin and Colorbox are also removed, but they do not have any alternatives, and we do not plan to introduce any. MaskedInput is not used anywhere in our templates/samples and had very limited usage. Colorbox was used for viewing larger images by clicking upload editor thumbnails, but they will simply open in a new tab for now.\n- Fluent removes the attribute if the value passed to the Fluent.setAttribute is null.\n- Added prevSibling and nextSibling functions to Fluent, which work similarly to prevAll and nextAll except for a single element, and when the selector is null, they act like .prev/.next.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** jQuery Validator is converted to TypeScript by removing jQuery dependency and is embedded in the Serenity corelib. You should remove the one in appsettings.bundles.json as it will no longer be used.\n- The default date format for upload format date is `yyyyMMddhhmmss` if not specified. (#7067)\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** Select2 is converted to TypeScript by removing jQuery dependency and is embedded in the Serenity corelib. You should remove the one in appsettings.bundles.json as it will no longer be used.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** The base Select2Editor is renamed to `ComboboxEditor`, and a `Combobox` abstraction class is introduced. This change will make it possible to replace Select2 with another library in the future if desired. Several Serenity specific types like Select2SearchQuery etc. are renamed to `ComboboxSearchQuery` and similar. Some methods like getSelect2Options etc are renamed to `getComboboxOptions`. To pass Select2 specific options, you should override that method and provide a `getProviderOptions` callback.\n- Flatpickr will no longer open on click by default, only on button click just like it was the case with UI datepicker. Flatpickr options can be changed for DateEditor/DateTimeEditor by overriding the getFlatpickrOptions method.\n- Bootstrap Modal does not allow focusing on any element outside the modal, so any inputs in flatpickr/ui datepicker/select2 etc. could not be focused while inside a modal. We applied some workarounds/patches to those components and Bootstrap itself.\n- Use Fluent.toggle for hiding grid field in the property grid instead of toggling the hidden class, so that it can be shown with Fluent.toggle again (https://github.com/serenity-premium/startsharp/issues/892).\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** jquery.autoNumeric is converted to TypeScript by removing jQuery dependency and is embedded in the Serenity corelib (We evaluated the latest version of autoNumeric which does not have jQuery dependency, but it is almost 10 times the size). You should remove the one in appsettings.bundles.json as it will no longer be used.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** MaskedEditor, which depends on a very old jquery.maskedinput plugin, is deprecated. You may still use it by including jQuery and the plugin, but it is not recommended. The option is to add a validation rule or find another mask input library.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** Colorbox is removed from StartSharp/Serene as we no longer have jQuery. You may still use it by including it together with jQuery, but it is not recommended. Currently, the images will open in a new tab for upload editor thumbnails.\n- Added Tooltip.isAvailable method to check if bootstrap tooltip is available.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** `@Decorators.option` is deprecated and will be removed completely in a future version as it is not compatible with JSX. Please convert them to regular constructor options/props.\n- Replaced several jQuery plugins used in StartSharp Dashboard with other options like Sortable.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n\n- Fix TextAreaEditor displaying undefined on new record mode.\n- Bootstrap 5 Tooltip display issue when jQuery is not loaded.\n- The flatpickr trigger button now has type \"button\" so that it does not cause submit/validation.\n- Space key does not set the date editor to today with flatpickr.\n\n\n## 8.2.2 (2024-01-21)\n\n### Features:\n\n- Change autoOpen to true for Dialog class (not TemplatedDialog/EntityDialog etc.)\n- Support returning false or a promise that return false from Dialog button click event to prevent closing for dialog with buttons that have a \"result\"\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Wrong check for getting readonly state in select2editor\n\n## 8.2.1 (2024-01-20)\n\n- This release incorporates significant changes, notably the removal of jQuery UI dependency from our libraries. Although jQuery is still employed for select2, validation, and a few other widgets, these will also be replaced or removed in the near future. Please refer to the release notes at [https://serenity.is/docs](https://serenity.is/docs) for guidance on migrating your code.\n- Introducing a `Fluent` object/function, similar to `jQuery` but designed for a single element, offering a subset of functions. Its aim is not 100%, not even half compatibility, and it serves to simplify the migration of existing code. The Widget's `element` property now returns a `Fluent` object instead of a `jQuery` object. It is recommended to use `.domNode` instead of the `.element` property where possible, with the latter marked as deprecated for easier identification of its usage.\n- Serenity widgets can now be seamlessly used with jsx-dom without requiring wrapping. Widget components can be created without passing a jQuery element, as the component will automatically create its element, akin to calling `Widget.create`.\n- The TypeScript scanner and parser are entirely rewritten based on the latest TypeScript source code, passing over 12,000 test cases and resulting in the same set of tokens/AST nodes.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** SleekGrid scripts (e.g., `slick.core.js`, `slick.grid.js`, etc.) will now be shipped via the new `Serenity.SleekGrid` package instead of `Serenity.Assets`. Update all references from `~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/slick.*` to a single reference of `~/Serenity.SleekGrid/index.global.js` containing all those scripts bundled together.\n- The outdated `jquery.fileupload.js`, which had a jQuery UI dependency, is no longer required as we now have a custom uploader component. Remove it from `appsettings.bundles.json`.\n- Introducing `~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/jquery-ui-datepicker.js`, which should replace `~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/jquery-ui.js`. It exclusively contains the jQuery DatePicker widget. StartSharp users should refer to the latest source code to integrate flatpicker instead.\n- SleekGrid column formatters now support returning HTML elements, either through `document.createElement` or jsx-dom. This feature is currently experimental.\n- Merged the `jQuery.dialogExtendQ` plugin into corelib. Remove the inclusion in `appsettings.bundles.json`.\n- Implemented a compact version of the column/property script bundle, reducing uncompressed script size by about 65%.\n- Introducing `faIcon` and `fabIcon` helpers providing autocompletion for `Line Awesome` (Font Awesome) icons.\n- Added `gridPageInit` and `panelPageInit` functions for use in GridPage and PanelPage, replacing `initFullHeightGridPage`.\n- Sergen now has limited support for type literals and intersection types for options/props in addition to simple type aliases and interfaces.\n- Introduced `IPasswordStrengthValidator` interface for abstraction of password strength rules and validation (#7054).\n- To obtain widgets directly from an HTML element, use the new `tryGetWidget` and `getWidgetFrom` helpers instead of their jQuery counterparts.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** All dialogs deriving from `EntityDialog` are panels by default. Add `@Decorators.panel(false)` to make one open as a modal/dialog. All those deriving from `GridEditorDialog`/`PropertyDialog` are modal/dialog by default.\n- Panels can now have dialog buttons. Use `@Decorators.staticPanel` to remove dialog buttons inherited from `PropertyDialog`, along with the close button.\n- Adjusted `TabExtensions` to handle Bootstrap tabs when jQuery UI is not available.\n- Ensure that if another reset password token is requested, the prior one becomes invalid by updating the `LastUpdateDate` of the user.\n- Also handle `SingleField` in Pro.Coder `RowFields` source generator.\n- Hide category links by default. Use CSS `.category-links { display: flex }` if you want to bring them back.\n- Improved wrapping behavior of toolbar buttons. The extra divs with `.buttons-outer`, `.buttons-inner`, `.button-outer` are all removed.\n- - **`[Breaking Change]`** Templates, e.g. `.Template.html` or `.ts.html` files are deprecated. Use tsx and `renderContents`. Even though it is still possible to use `getTemplate()` method for now, it will be removed in the next version. TemplatedDialog, TemplatedPanel etc. classes will be removed or replaced with versions that does not use templates.\n\n## 8.1.5 (2023-12-14)\n\n### Features:\n- Removing jQuery.blockUI.js and toastr.js from Serenity.Assets as we no longer use them. Please remove them from appsettings.bundles.json if you still have them there.\n- Include source maps of base and base-ui in corelib\n- No need for \"file:\" prefix in package.json for \"./node_modules/dotnet/\"\n\n## 8.1.4 (2023-12-13)\n\n### Features:\n- Use lowercase version of folder name while restoring to node_modules/.dotnet\n- Set @serenity-is/corelib to file:./node_modules/.dotnet/serenity.corelib so that it uses the same version of the Serenity.Corelib NuGet package referenced in the project.\n\n## 8.1.3 (2023-12-13)\n\n### Features:\n- **`**`[Breaking Change]`**`** Replacing Serenity.Scripts with a new `Serenity.Corelib` package which will be a NuGet version of the NPM package `@serenity-is/corelib`. Replace \"Serenity.Scripts/Serenity.Corelib.js\" in appsettings.bundles.json with \"Serenity.Corelib/index.global.js\".\n- When a module is not found, for example when npm install is not run, try to resolve modules via \"file:\" mappings configured in dependencies and also NuGet package folders.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Fix jquery ui datepicker culture not working\n\n## 8.1.2 (2023-12-10)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Remove extra comma in generated package.json files, causing failure only with pnpm\n\n## 8.1.1 (2023-12-10)\n\n### Features:\n- Implemented a better method for installing node types from NuGet packages and project references. Just remove \"prepare\" script in package.json and add \"preinstall\": \"dotnet build -target:RestoreNodeTypes\". Serenity will automatically install nuget/package refs to node_modules/.dotnet directory and patch your package.json so that there is a reference to every library that is referenced by your project. This will improve TypeScript experience. As the folder name under .dotnet will be created with the project/nuget package names (not npm package id) alternative path mapping for `@serenity-is/*` suggested in 8.0.9 will not be useful, and `@serenity-is/*` path mapping can be removed after upgrading.\n\n## 8.1.0 (2023-12-10)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Reverted running RestoreNodeTypes in design time build as it might be breaking NuGet restore order\n\n## 8.0.9 (2023-12-10)\n\n### Features:\n- Also restore node types for project/package references to \"./node_modules/.dotnet/\" so that these files don't get erased during npm install, leading to typescript compilation warnings during initial project creation. \n- Try to run RestoreNodeTypes target also in design time builds. It is recommended to replace `\"prepare\": \"dotnet build -target:RestoreTypings\"` line with `\"prepare\": \"dotnet build -target:RestoreNodeTypes\"` if you only use modular code.\n- Changed fetchScriptData logic to better handle exceptions. Increase test coverage for lookup and scriptdata methods.\n\n## 8.0.8 (2023-12-09)\n\n### Features:\n- Replace E-Mail with Email and e-mail with email in texts for consistency and it seems like it is now the accepted norm\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Fix error in uiPickerZIndexWorkaround\n- Fix MailboxLoginView demo and predefined logins in Serenity.Pro.EmailClient\n\n## 8.0.7 (2023-12-07)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Special case for distinct lookup scripts returning array of values instead of objects, causing distinct lookup scripts to fail displaying properly when fetched via DynamicData endpoint\n- Enum flags editor was broken after recent updates\n\n## 8.0.5 (2023-12-04)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Issue with async fetch not returning data properly, causing async lookup loading to fail\n\n## 8.0.4 (2023-12-04)\n\n### Features:\n- Trigger jQuery ajaxStop and ajaxStart events and increase/decrease jQuery.active during fetch requests so that processes like NProgress can be notified until we implement our own events\n\n## 8.0.3 (2023-12-04)\n\n### Features:\n- Using MSBuild's new command-line build property extraction feature in Sergen for .NET 8+ to determine properties like OutDir, TargetFramework, etc. in a more consistent way.\n- Made it possible to pass MSBuild properties to Sergen so that it does not have to parse property items from the project file. This helps with cases where it cannot determine a property correctly, such as output path, configuration, etc. This may also speed up transforms as Sergen does not have to parse properties itself. Refer to Directory.Build.targets in the common-features repository for a sample and `-prop` syntax.\n- Implemented finding tsconfig extends from node_modules folders when the extends property contains a non-relative path. This is similar to how TypeScript implements extends via the node resolution algorithm.\n- Improved Sergen's algorithm for discovering included files from tsconfig.json to match TypeScript itself as closely as possible.\n- Cached file system for TypeScript parsing transformations, speeding up transform times in Sergen.\n- Added an option to ignore null value for `[Unique]` constraint on a single field.\n- Q.serviceCall / Q.serviceRequest methods and generated services now return `PromiseLike` instead of `JQueryXHR`. This is preparation for the replacement of jQuery ajax with fetch in the future. It is still possible to cast the return type to JQueryXHR for now, but don't rely on it always returning such type.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** `IFileSystem` has a new `GetLastWriteTimeUtc` property. This is done to remove the extra `IGeneratorFileSystem` interface and the same property from `ITemporaryFileSystem`. If you have a custom implementation for `IFileSystem`, you should also implement the `GetLastWriteTimeUtc` method.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** No longer shipping TypeScript's `tslib` functions (e.g., helpers) along with Serenity.CoreLib.js. If you still have namespaces (non-modular) TypeScript code, please remove the `\"noEmitHelpers\": true` line from your tsconfig.json.\n- The `localText` function now accepts a second optional parameter that will be used as default if a translation is not found in the registry.\n- Moved more functions into the base library from corelib. Removing usages of `Q.isEmptyOrNull`, `Q.startsWith`, `Q.endsWith`, `Q.some`, etc. functions as JavaScript has better alternatives.\n- Corelib and templates will target ES2017 instead of ES5. No issues are expected as ES2017 support in browsers is at 98%, and the remaining 2% mostly includes IE, which we haven't supported for a long time.\n- `ScriptData` functions like `getLookup`, `getForm`, `getColumns`, etc., will use `~/DynamicData` (e.g., JSON loading) instead of `~/DynJS.axd` (script loading) by default. This will avoid calling `eval`, which is considered harmful, while dynamically loading lookups, etc.\n- Using `fetch` instead of jQuery ajax/XHR for async versions of `ScriptData` functions like `getLookupAsync`, etc.\n- JSON.NET serialized enums as numbers by default, while we used `JsonStringEnumConverter` with `System.Text.Json`, which broke handling in some cases. We implemented a new `EnumJsonConverter` that is more compatible with the JSON.NET behavior.\n- In tsconfig.json, `jsx-dom/min` is set as the default `jsxImportSource` in common-features and pro-features projects, in addition to StartSharp itself.\n- Serenity no longer uses the legacy jQuery blockUI plugin even if it is loaded.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- `GetRelativePath` workaround for Pro.Coder is not working exactly the same as `System.IO.Path.GetRelativePath`, which is not available in .NET Standard 2. This was causing strange paths in transformed files from time to time.\n- `PopulateObject` failed when the generic type is an interface, causing reports with parameters to not work properly.\n- Fixed NullReferenceException during impersonation.\n\n## 8.0.2 (2023-11-22)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n  - Sergen not able to read connection strings from appsettings.json due to handling difference by System.Text.Json\n\n## 8.0.1 (2023-11-22)\n\n### Features:\n- We are migrating from `Newtonsoft.Json` to `System.Text.Json`, as it is the recommended and more performant library in .NET. To make the switch, please remove the `.AddNewtonsoftJson` statement from `Startup.cs`, add the line `services.Configure<JsonOptions>(options => JSON.Defaults.Populate(options.JsonSerializerOptions));`, and optionally remove `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson` from the project file. The transition should go smoothly as we've addressed many compatibility issues between the two JSON libraries. You only need to add `System.Text.Json` specific attributes, such as `JsonPropertyName`, to properties/classes that already have `Newtonsoft.Json` specific attributes. For more information, refer to https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity/issues/7021.\n- Serenity and feature package sources have been updated to leverage C# 12 features like primary constructors and collection initializers.\n- The StartSharp dashboard page has been rewritten using jsx-dom. All HTML markup in the `DashboardIndex.cshtml` file has been converted into functional components. This serves as a useful sample for jsx-dom and will simplify the creation/customization of your own dashboards.\n- Our sample pages now utilize the `jsx-dom/min` runtime, as full SVG support in jsx-dom is typically unnecessary. We will soon change the default jsx runtime in `tsconfig.json` for new StartSharp/Serene projects to `jsx-dom/min` and remove the explicit pragma statement from our sample pages. This change won't affect your existing projects. However, be aware that our samples will assume this jsx runtime by default. So, if you copy-paste our samples into your application but have a different jsx runtime configured in your `tsconfig.json`, such as preact, remember to add `/** jsxImportSource jsx-dom/min */` to those `.tsx` files. Alternatively, you can change your `jsxImportSource` in `tsconfig.json` to `jsx-dom/min`.\n- We are currently developing a new `@serenity-is/base` NPM package that will include core functions and classes from `@serenity-is/corelib`, mostly from the old `Q` namespace. This new base library will be shared between `@serenity-is/corelib` and a new UI library that we plan to develop. The upcoming UI library, likely named `@serenity-is/ui`, is in the planning phase and will probably be based on `jsx-dom`, with no dependencies on `jQuery` or `jQuery UI`. Presently, `@serenity-is/base` is packed into `@serenity-is/corelib`, so no changes are required in this release.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Addressed an issue with esbuild watch not functioning in the latest versions of tsbuild. Please update `tsbuild` to version 8.0.1 or later in your `package.json` file.\n\n## 8.0.0 (2023-11-16)\n\n### Features:\n- This is a major update that supports .NET 8. Before switching to this version, ensure that your Visual Studio 2022 version is `17.8.0` or later. .NET SDK 8 should be installed through the Visual Studio update or manually if you are not using VS. In your project file, change the target to `net8.0`:\n  - `<TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>`\n  \n  Next, update the following packages to at least the listed versions below:\n  ```xml\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.NewtonsoftJson\" Version=\"8.0.0\" />\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.Sqlite\" Version=\"8.0.0\" />\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.Data.SqlClient\" Version=\"5.1.4\" />\n  ```\n\n  Next, update Serenity and Pro packages to version 8.0. This should be enough to transition to .NET 8 as there aren't many breaking changes affecting Serenity-based applications.\n  \n  Note that Serenity 8.0+ will no longer support .NET 6/.NET 7. \n  \n  We won't release a .NET 8 version of Serene yet, as most users who download it won't have the required Visual Studio 17.8.0 update, causing issues for newcomers. Serene users should apply the changes noted in these release notes to their apps after updating their Visual Studio.\n\n- Updated `Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild` to 5.2.2, now the recommended TypeScript version.\n- Updated several NuGet package references to their latest versions, including `Newtonsoft.Json`, `Scriban`, `Mono.Cecil`, `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`, `Dapper`, `MailKit`, `Nuglify`, `SixLabors.ImageSharp`, etc.\n- **`[Breaking Change]`** `serenity.css` is moved to `Serenity.Extensions` as a static asset for easy updates. After updating, delete `wwwroot/Content/serenity/serenity.css` and replace the `serenity.css` reference in your `appsettings.json` with `~/Serenity.Extensions/common-style.css`. Serene users should also replace their `~/Content/site/common-theme.css` reference with `~/Serenity.Extensions/common-theme.css`. These changes will make it easier for Serene users to update their core CSS files.\n- Removed the following legacy scripts and CSS files from the Serenity.Assets package: \n  - `Content/aristo/aristo.css`\n  - `Content/bootstrap-theme.css` (Bootstrap 3)\n  - `Content/bootstrap.css` (Bootstrap 3)\n  - `Content/ionicons.css`\n  - `Content/page.css`\n  - `Content/simple-line-icons.css`\n  - `Content/slick-default-theme.css`\n  - `Content/slick.columnpicker.css`\n  - `Content/slick.headerbuttons.css`\n  - `Content/slick.headermenu.css`\n  - `Content/slick.pager.css`\n  - `Scripts/bootstrap.js` (Bootstrap 3)\n  - `Scripts/jquery/jquery.slim.js`\n  - `Scripts/jquery.cropzoom.js`\n  - `Scripts/jquery.iframe-transport.js`\n  - `Scripts/jquery.json.js`\n  - `Scripts/jquery.scrollintoview.js`\n  - `Scripts/jquery.slimscroll.js`\n  - `Scripts/jsrender.js`\n  - `Scripts/pace.js`\n  - `Scripts/react*.js`\n  - `Scripts/rsvp.js`\n  - `Scripts/saltarelle/linq.js` \n  - `Scripts/saltarelle/mscorlib.js`\n\n  These files have not been used by Serene/StartSharp for a long time. If you still have references to any of the above files in your `appsettings.bundles.json`, remove those references or install those files via `libman.json` or similar.\n- Updated jQuery to 3.7.1\n- Removed jQuery 3.5.1 files from Serenity.Assets. If you still have a reference in your `appsettings.bundles.json` like `\"~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/jquery-{version}.js\"`, please change it to `\"~/Serenity.Assets/jquery/jquery.js\"` or install it via libman.\n- Removed the full version of jQuery UI from Serenity.Assets, e.g., `jquery-ui-1.12.1.js`, as it does not have the patches we applied to `jquery-ui.js`, which is our trimmed custom version. If you still have a reference in `appsettings.bundles.json` like `\"~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/jquery-ui-{version}.js\"`, replace it with `\"~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/jquery-ui.js\"` or install it via libman/npm (though you won't have our patches in that case).\n- Updated CKEditor to 4.22.1, the last open-source version. Switched to moono-lisa skin, which is flatter than moono.\n- Updated Bootstrap to 5.3.2, offering more customization options via CSS variables and supporting a dark theme.  \n- Updated esbuild to 0.19.15, which has some breaking changes related to watch mode. Please update tsbuild to `8.0.0` and apply changes in StartSharp repository's `tsbuild.js` to your project.\n- TSBuild now has a type definition so that you can see what options it provides. Serenity.Pro.Theme rules are updated to comply with this change. Apply changes in `_Layout.cshtml` and `_LayoutHead.cshtml` so that a `data-bs-theme=\"dark\"` attribute is added to the HTML element when the `cosmos-dark` or another similar dark theme is used.\n- Implemented Select2 localization using Q.localText and Q.format functions. Removing the Select2-locales folder from Serenity.Assets, as they were not suitable to use with Serenity localization.\n- StartSharp template now comes with a `.gitignore` file with ignore patterns suitable for general Serenity applications.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n- Allow `Fields.XYZ` while determining the `IsActive` property and others in addition to `fields.XYZ`, but the `Fields` property is only there for compatibility and is effectively obsolete.\n- Background image was not shown in no-layout pages like login in the glassy-light theme.\n- Add the hidden class to wizard dialog panes so that validation doesn't run for inactive steps, unlike usual tab forms.\n- PuppeteerHtmlToPdf fix affecting Base64 data URIs.\n\n\n## 6.9.6 (2023-11-09)\n\n### Features:\n\n- The default ignore option for jQuery validation has been changed to include elements matching `[style*=\"display:none\"], [style*=\"display: none\"] *, .hidden *, input[type=hidden], .no-validate`. This change replaces the previous default of `:hidden, .no-validate`. The reason for this update is that the previous default settings required a workaround for validating inputs in hidden tabs. The workaround involved altering the visibility of hidden tabs by setting their display properties to `flex` or `block`, and visibility property to `hidden` to make them considered as `not(:hidden)`. However, this approach occasionally caused issues, especially when dealing with inputs in inactive tabs, as they were not effectively hidden due to the display property manipulation. Simply setting the ignore rule to empty and validating all inputs was not a viable solution, as some fields may intentionally be hidden using methods like `.hide()`, indicating that they should not be subject to validation. This change also necessitated modifications in `serenity.css`, `pro-theme.css`, and `jquery-ui`, so make sure to update your versions of `Serenity.Pro.Theme`, `Serenity.Assets`, and `Serenity.Scripts` accordingly.\n- Enhancements have been made to improve the performance of methods utilized by source generators, such as `EnumerateBaseClasses`, `IsOrSubClassOf`, and `IsAssignableFrom`.\n- An experimental `IDiskUploadFileSystem` implementation in `Serenity.Pro.Extensions` package has been introduced. This implementation enables the storage of files and directories in a database table named `FileSystem`. Additionally, a `SqlUploadStorage` implementation has been provided, which leverages the aforementioned `IDiskUploadFileSystem` for file uploads.\n- A new attribute, `HideLabelAttribute`, has been added. It corresponds to the `LabelWidth(\"0\", JustThis = true)` setting.\n\n### Bug Fixes:\n- The `BasedOnRowPropertyNameAnalyzer` has been enhanced to also process properties of the base entity class.\n- A bug where switching to an inactive jQueryUI/Bootstrap tab with validation errors occurred has been resolved.\n\n## 6.9.5 (2023-10-28)\n\n### Features:\n  - New BasedOnRowPropertyNameAnalyzer and its associated fix that raises an error in development time if a column/form type with `BasedOnRow` and `CheckNames = true` has a property that does not match any property name in the row type. It offers to add ``[IgnoreName]`` attribute as a fix, or if only the case mismatch, renaming to the correct property name (Serenity.Pro.Coder/StartSharp).\n  - New RowPropertyAccessorsAnalyzer that can generate getters/setters of style `fields.SomeField[this]` at development time if the property is a simple `{ get; set; }`, `{ get; }` or just empty braces `{}`. It can also convert a simple field member like `SomeProperty;` to a field accessor property. The analyzer also raises errors if the accessors use a mismatching field (Serenity.Pro.Coder/StartSharp). See 6.9.5 release notes for more information about these analyzers and code fixes.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n  - Name property determined from existing entity uses \"Field\" instead of \"StringField\"\n  - Fix typo in chunking authentication cookie handling\n\n## 6.9.4 (2023-10-26)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n  - Workaround in HtmlReportCallbackUrlBuilder for ASP.NET chunking cookies when authentication cookie contains too many claims\n  - Missing line break while sergen updates module exports under ServerTypes\n\n## 6.9.3 (2023-10-22)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n  - Improve the declaration of classic namespace Q in Serenity.Corelib.d.ts via declare import Q = Serenity;\n\n## 6.9.2 (2023-10-22)\n\n### Bugfixes:\n  - Issue with new Serenity.CoreLib.d.ts while using classic namespace mode (non modular)\n  - Don't generate column properties in classic namespace mode (non modular) as it is causing some issues\n  - Try Serenity.LookupEditor first instead of Serenity.Lookup while generating form properties\n\n## 6.9.1 (2023-10-22)\n\n### Features:\n  - Sergen now utilizes the `IncludeGlobalUsings` property when specified in `sergen.json` during client type generation.\n  - Removed unused `System.Collections` references from generated client type files.\n  - Introduced a new `MigrationKeyAttribute` that derives from `MigrationBaseAttribute`, offering a direct option for migrations, eliminating the need for defining a local `MigrationAttribute`.\n  - Added the `TargetDBAttribute` and `DefaultDBAttribute`, allowing for simplified usage without the necessity of locally defining a `DefaultDBAttribute` class.\n  - Relocated the logic for the `EnsureDatabase` function to the `MigrationUtils` class within Serenity.Extensions, enabling calls from `DataMigrations.cs`.\n  - Transferred all feature-specific migrations in StartSharp to their respective projects.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n  - Fixed a missing equal sign in the `Service typing Methods` constant.\n\n## 6.9.0 (2023-10-20)\n\n### Features:\n\n- ****`[Breaking Change]`**** Removed the \"@serenity-is/corelib/q\" and \"@serenity-is/corelib/slick\" submodules. After updating the corelib NPM package and Serenity packages to 6.9.x, please search and replace them with \"@serenity-is/corelib\" in all *.ts and *.tsx files within your project. All types from those modules are now available in the `@serenity-is/corelib` module. This change simplifies migration from namespaces in TypeScript, as the previous structure was causing confusion.\n\n- **Sergen Enhancements:**\n  - Sergen now reuses existing entities when generating code for a new entity.\n  - When generating code for multiple entities simultaneously, Sergen can also reuse information from rows that are going to be generated.\n  - Sergen generates `ForeignKey(typeof(ExistingRow))` instead of `ForeignKey(\"ExistingTable\", \"SomeId\")` for foreign key (FK) properties if the primary key (PK) entity is already available.\n  - Sergen generates `Origin(jSome, nameof(SomeRow.SomeField))` instead of `Expression(\"jSome.[SomeFieldName]\")` if the origin entity and property are available.\n  - Sergen can automatically determine the name property of the joined table related to an FK property if the PK entity is available and has a `[NameProperty]`.\n  - Sergen automatically adds a `LookupEditor` attribute to the generated property if the primary key entity has a `LookupScript` attribute, using `ServiceLookupEditor` if no lookup script attribute is present.\n  - Sergen adds a `ServiceLookupPermission` attribute to generated rows, allowing fine-tuning of access to lookup columns via ServiceLookupEditor.\n  - `Columns.ts` files generated by Sergen and Pro.Coder now include all properties as `Column<TRow>`, making it easy to access them. For example, you can create `var columns = new SomeColumns(super.getColumns())` in a grid and access a property like `columns.MyProperty` without searching by field name. Columns classes also include a static `Fields` property similar to `XYZRow.Fields`.\n  - Added a `MigrationAttributeBase` class that can be reused by feature packages to define their specific `MigrationAttribute` classes while checking for migration version correctness.\n\n- **User Experience Improvements:**\n  - The \"_What to Generate_\" option is now preselected during code generation.\n  - Generated import statements are ordered similarly to how Visual Studio Code's \"Organize Imports\" does.\n\n- **Added Features:**\n  - Added a \"ConfigureSections\" extension that can automatically configure all settings with the \"DefaultSectionKey\" attribute by discovering them from a type source. This eliminates the need to manually call \"Configure\" or \"ConfigureSection\" for each package and Serenity packages to 6.9.x.\n  - Optimized calls to `loadScriptAsync` so that calling `getLookupAsync` multiple times successively results in only one service call.\n\n- **StartSharp Updates:**\n  - Moved the DataAuditLog migration to its own project. Changed the version key, as if an existing project already has the same migration, FluentMigrator would raise an error.\n  - Changed the key for Email Queue Job in appsettings to `\"EmailQueueJob\"` from `\"MailingService,\"` which was incorrect.\n  - Prefer IMAP/SMTP username instead of the user's email for Email Client.\n\n- **Other Updates:**\n  - Updated SleekGrid to version 1.6.2.\n  - Added `*`, `?`, `<`, and `>` to the list of invalid characters for file and path names in Linux, especially for use in uploads.\n\n### Bugfixes:\n  - Addressed an issue with Brotli compression if .NET 7 Runtime is used, as it no longer allows custom compression levels.\n\n## 6.8.3 (2023-10-09)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Don't generate ListExcel method if only Row & Services are selected as Columns type is not available\n  - Date editor persist / restore results in dates in format yyyy-MM-dd\n\n## 6.8.2 (2023-10-05)\n\nFeatures:\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** Changed namespace of IRolePermissionService from Serenity.Serenity.Net.Core.Authorization to Serenity.Abstractions\n  - Used single line getter/setter style for rows, also for sergen\n  - Switching to tags instead of namespace for determining which migrations to run. So, instead of checking for a particular namespace like \"Serenity.Demo.Northwind.Migrations\", checking if the migration has \"NorthwindDB\" tag. For \"Default\" database, we allow migrations with \"DefaultDB\" tag, in addition to migrations without any tags to avoid skipping legacy migrations or migrations that user added but forgot to add a tag.\n  - Removed migration skipping feature when database name does not match what was expected, as it seems to have helped no-one, while causing confusion for users that are not aware of it\n  - Updated Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 7.0.11 and Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to 5.1.1\n  - Updated Microsoft.TypeScript.MSBuild to 4.9.5, which is the last version before v5\n  - Made use of C# global usings feature both in Serene and StartSharp. Please note that while generating code, Sergen can't yet parse global usings. So, if you expect generated code to omit such usings you need to set them manually in sergen.json for now.\n  - Switched to file scoped namespaces also in Serene\n  - Defined a new TypeSource class implementing ITypeSource, and used that instead of listing assemblies in Startup.cs `(StartSharp)`\n  - Moved application specific service implementations into AppServices namespace.\n  - Set RootNamespace instead of AssemblyName in project file, so that newly added files don't include \".Web\" suffix.\n  - Backported account password and some other changes to Serene from StartSharp.\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Fix click event in Card View sample\n\n## 6.8.1 (2023-09-23)\n\nFeatures:\n  - New GenerateFields attribute that can be used instead of RowTemplate, and more stable as it does not need to copy properties and their attributes from the template class to the Row class `(StartSharp)`. This is now the recommended approach, though RowTemplate still work but may be removed in the future. Set `EnableGenerateFields` to true in sergen.json to use this while generating code via sergen (recommended for Pro users). You still need to write getters and setters as usual instead of a simple `{ get; set; }`, until C# introduces partial properties.\n  - Changed the base class for UploadResponse to ServiceResponse.\n  - Added more tests for corelib including formatters.\n  - New `IRolePermissionService` interface abstraction allowing checking a role's permission separately.\n  - New experimental code generator for Flutter apps (StartSharp/Enterprise) for transforming form / columns etc. from C# to Dart/Flutter code similar to what sergen does for TypeScript/C#.\n  - New OpenId Scope to Permission mapping so that external apps connecting via a user account can be limited to a subset of permissions (StartSharp). You will need to register `IRolePermissionService` implementation and `OpenIdScopePermissionWrapper` for it to work. See `Startup.cs` and `RolePermissionService.cs` in latest StartSharp code.\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Some Editor/formatter type parameters could not be passed from the RowTemplate to the source generated Row class, as the row fields source generator could not access the code generated by client types source generator, causing Roslyn to error. Workaround was to internally call the client types source generator, but the recommended way is to use new GenerateFields.\n\n## 6.8.0 (2023-08-14)\n\nFeatures:\n  - New Serenity.Pro.OpenIdClient Package which is exclusively available to Business/Enterprise customers, this update introduces the Serenity.Pro.OpenIdClient package, enabling seamless external login via Google, Microsoft, GitHub, and more. The implementation includes robust account link and unlink actions. `(StartSharp)`\n  - **Warning!** To thwart potential XSS attacks via email links, a critical security measure has been implemented. The `LoginPage.tsx` now incorporates a defensive check to only accept return URLs that begin with a forward slash (`/`). Our gratitude to Tasfaout Abderrahim for bringing this to our attention. Please apply the check in `LoginPage.tsx` that looks like `if (returnUrl && /^\\//.test(returnUrl)) {`.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** The `SettingStorage` module has undergone modifications to enhance performance and security. The `getItem` and `setItem` methods may now return Promises, eliminating synchronous XHR calls. Consequently, similar adjustments extend to the `DataGrid`'s `restoreSettings`, `persistSettings`, and `getPersistedSettings` methods. Users with custom code using these methods must ensure compatibility with the Promise return type (e.g., utilize async operations). Furthermore, a new `restoreSettingsFrom` method takes precedence over `restoreSettings` in mixins, derived classes, etc. It's important to note that `restoreSettingsFrom` does not handle null settings parameters. **`[Breaking Change]`**\n  - Added .mpp (MS Project), .vsd, .vsdx (Visio) to default extension whitelist\n  - Set SameSite.Lax for CSRF-TOKEN cookie\n  - Enhanced `initFullHeightGridPage` with flex layout and responsive handling instead of trying to calculate grid height from other divs in page\n  - Adapted pro theme css for new `initFullHeightGridPage` version\n  - Added a setHeight option for cases where initFullHeightGridPage is used with another container type like in split master detail sample\n  - Implemented reCAPTCHA for signup form `(StartSharp)`\n  - Restored reCAPTCHA functionality with a special property processor. Need to `services.ConfigureSection<RecaptchaSettings>(Configuration);` in Startup.cs, and set Recaptcha:SiteKey and Recaptcha:SecretKey in appsettings.json by generating them from https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin (use v2 ones, not sure newer ones work). Unless they are set, Recaptcha property will be made invisible in the form. See Signup form in StartSharp for an example.\n  - Enhanced form item handling by clearing category when lacking Category but having Tab attribute\n  - Also get base row type properties with BasedOnRow attribute\n  - Introduced IUserClaimCreator interface and its default implementation DefaultUserClaimCreator. You should register it in Startup.cs and use it instead of the static implementation in UserRetrieveService class. If you have any custom claims you can inherit DefaultUserClaimCreator and override AddClaims method then register your class instead of DefaultUserClaimCreator.\n  Replace UserRetrieveService.CreatePrincipal with IUserClaimCreator dependency whereever it is used.\n  - Applied patch for jquery ui touch events so that grid columns can be dragged in mobile\n  - New HandleControllerExceptionAttribute that can redirect errors to ValidationError page.\n  - Generated a more compact and merge friendly version of Texts.ts file.\n  - Introduced IHasPassword interface that allows to check if user has a password set via IUserDefinition\n  - Added a LocalTextPrefix property to FormScript and ColumnsScript attribute that may be used to override the local text prefix calculated from form key and namespace\n  - Updated jsx-dom to 8.0.7\n  - If reportParams is passed as null, JSON serialize the report instance in HTML report callback url builder\n  - Set Content-Disposition header for preview as well so save name for the generated pdf will not be Render.pdf always\n  - Moved password related page / service codes like Forgot/Reset/Change password to Serenity.Extensions to make them easier to update and reduce amount of code in StartSharp/Serene.\n  - Introduced an IElevationHandler and RequiresElevation attribute so that user will have to enter password again before performing some critical actions.\n  - Added hidden-xs css rule for compatibility with bs4\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Fix sergen code generation errors for form, columns etc. in non-modular projects\n  - Fix several invalid source links in Demo\n  - Don't auto fill demo username/pass for activation page\n  - Possible issue with Postgress in SqlErrorStore while inserting exceptions\n  - Fix styling for grouping bar when group columns are longer than the width via x-scrolling\n\n## 6.7.6 (2023-05-24)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Abstracted script and css minifier dependencies, so that another minifier can be used instead of NUglify for bundling\n  - Added experimental `esbuild` based minifier `(StartSharp)`\n  - Updated preact in Serenity.Assets to 10.14.1\n  - Added `/** jsxImportSource jsx-dom */` to files where jsx-dom are used, so that it can understood which library is used without relying on the default in tsconfig.json\n  - Rewrote EmailClient with ES modules and preact, removed Serenity.Pro.UI package as it was only ever used by EmailClient. `(StartSharp)`\n  - Improve look and feel of e-mail client `(StartSharp)`\n  - Added a mock IMAP server implementation to EmailClient for demo purposes\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** `Serenity.Pro.UI` package is now obsoleted as it was only used by the old email client. It will not get any new versions and you should remove its reference from your project file.\n  - Changed default jsxImportSource back to `preact` in tsconfig.json `(StartSharp)`\n  - `<environmentVariable name=\"ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT\" value=\"Development\" />` line which was in `web.config` for development purposes is removed. If you deploy to IIS and did not remove that line in your production site after publishing, you should.\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Resolve issue with enum / select editors causing display text to be saved instead of value in dropdown editors `(StartSharp)`\n\n## 6.7.5 (2023-05-21)\n\nFeatures:\n  - added ExtensionBlacklistInclude, ExtensionBlacklistExclude, ExtensionWhitelistInclude and ExtensionWhitelistExclude that allows including, excluding extensions from defaults without having to write all the extensions again\n  - update bootstrap icons to 1.10.5\n\nBugfixes:\n  - email client now working due to preact not included in appsettings.bundles.json `(StartSharp)`\n  - enable System.Drawing.Common 6.0 in linux by adding runtimeconfig.template.json file `(StartSharp)`\n  - fix failing source gen tests caused by line endings `(StartSharp)`\n  \n## 6.7.2 (2023-05-13)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Generated API documentation for `@serenity-is/corelib` and `@serenity-is/sleekgrid` packages via `TypeDoc` and made them available at `https://serenity.is/docs` under `Api Reference (TypeScript)` section.\n  - Added `jsx-dom` integration which is a library similar to React. but which directly creates HTML elements instead of using a `VDOM`. It offers better compatibility with existing Serenity `Widget` structure that use `jQuery` and contains code that modify `DOM` directly. It will mostly be used in `renderContents()` method instead of the `getTemplate()` so that events can be bound at widget creation, and references to elements can be acquired. There is currently no dependency to `jsx-dom` in `@serenity-is/corelib` itself but it exposes a `jsxDomWidget` method than can be used to create a `jsx-dom` compatible functional component from a widget type, like `var StringEditor_ = jsxDomWidget(StringEditor); <StringEditor_ readonly={true} maxlength={50} />`.\n  - Switched to JSX automatic runtime (https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#jsxImportSource) in `StartSharp` by setting `\"jsx\": \"react-jsx\"` and `\"jsxImportSource\": \"jsx-dom\"` in `tsconfig.json`. If you need to use `React` or `Preact` etc. in one your `.tsx` files, you may switch the runtime by adding a pragma comment on top of the file like `/** @jsxImportSource react */`.\n  - `**/*Page.tsx` files are also considered as ESM entry points for `esbuild` in `tsbuild` and `sergen`.\n  - Adapted membership page codes in StartSharp to use `jsx-dom` by renaming them first from `XYZPage.ts` to `XYZPage.tsx` and using `renderContents` instead of `getTemplate`.\n  - Added `useIdPrefix()` and `Widget.useIdPrefix()` methods to make it easier to generate unique ID's based on the Widget's idPrefix in `jsx-dom` based code similar to `~_` prefix in classic templates.\n  - `findElementWithId` method can optionally accept a context parameter that controls where the search is performed. This is useful for detached elements (e.g. not added to document yet) created by `jsx-dom` to locate cascading etc. elements.\n  - Replaced `toastr` with an embedded version rewritten in TypeScript adapted from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JPeer264/toastr2/master/src/Toastr.ts`. This will make it possible to show notifications which failed when `toastr.js` is not loaded in the page. You may remove `toastr.js` from `appsettings.bundles.json` but leave `toastr.css` for now as it is still required.\n  - CardViewMixin can accept `jsx-dom` based card templates in addition to React ones.\n  - Moved `corelib` and `tsbuild` to root `packages/` folder from `src/Serenity.Scripts/` in Serenity repository.\n  - Improved `globalExternals` optimization in `tsbuild` so that it generates less number of chunks on build.\n  - Increased test coverage for `@serenity-is/corelib/q` methods and refactored test files (`.spec.ts`) to be next to the files (`.ts`) they have tests for.\n  - Added async versions of Authorization script methods like `Q.Authorization.userDefinitionAsync` which should be preffered over sync counterparts where possible.\n  - IExceptionLogger interface is obsolete! Please log exceptions directly via .NET's ILogger interface and its LogError method. StartSharp users should replace `app.UseExceptional()` line with `app.UseExceptionLogger()` in Startup.cs, which also enables implicit logging to `StackExchange.Exceptional` via `InformationalException` type.\n  - Added InformationalException type that will be used to log via ILogger interface to Exceptional\n  - Updated `@serenity-is/sleekgrid` to 1.6.0.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** parseDate and parseISODateTime functions returns an Invalid Date instance (e.g. its `.valueOf()` method returns `NaN`) instead of \"false\" or \"null\" as they used to be, which was a wrong decision at time. It was causing invalid dates to be considered equal to empty dates sometimes. Javascript `Date` constructor also returns a Date instance with `NaN` value for invalid dates.\n  - Round calculated width when scale / delta parameters are specified in DataGrid, which is true for latest theme.\n  - Normalized all the line endings to LF in Serenity, common-features and StartSharp repository via a `.gitattributes` file.\n  - Made DefaultRowTypeRegistry use typeSource on every call to the AllRowTypes (#6776) so that if the ITypeSource implementation returns a dynamic list of types, it can pick them.\n  - Introduced new `UI Elements` sample pages containing Bootstrap components, Icon classes etc. `(StartSharp)`\n  - Removed RuntimeCompilation as Hot Reload does the same thing `(StartSharp)`\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Referencing generic types in generated form type short name assignments which caused problems with `Widget<any>` in TypeScript\n  - AutoValidateAntiforgeryIgnoreBearerFilter were logging another message when antiforgery validation failed\n  - Fix lazy android check in jquery.maskedinput.js introduced a few versions back.\n\n## 6.7.1 (2023-04-07)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Added IUploadFileResponder interface, whose default implementation will only send text/plain, application/pdf, and ones whose mime type starting with image/ as inline, and rest as application/octet-stream with content-disposition attachment for security purposes. Please use it in your FilePage.cs Read method. See the latest `FilePage.cs` in StartSharp/Serene repository.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** moving ExtensionBlacklist to UploadSettings from IUploadOptions. Added an ExtensionWhitelist that only allows usual extensions by default (.3gp;.7z;.ai;.avi;.bmp;.csv;.doc;.docx;.eps;.jpg;.jpeg;.json;.gif;.gz;.ico;.mpg;.mpeg;.mp3;.mp4;.mkv;.pdf;.png;.ppt;.pptx;.psd;.rar;.rtf;.svg;.tif;.tiff;.txt;.wav;.webm;.webp;.xls;.xlsx;.xml;.xps;.zip;). You'll need to override them in appsettings.json if you need more extensions (UploadSettings:ExtensionWhitelist, UploadSettings:ExtensionBlacklist)\n  - updated missing translations in Serene/StartSharp/Serenity\n  - use ASP.NET Core's FileExtensionContentTypeProvider instead of manually listing known mime types\n\n## 6.7.0 (2023-04-06)\n\nFeatures:\n\n  - ****Warning!**** This release focuses on addressing potential security issues that were recently discovered by Fabian Densborn from SEC Consult. Serene/StartSharp users must either create a new project from the 6.7.0+ template or manually apply the relevant changes from this commit to their existing applications after updating Serenity packages to 6.7.0+: https://github.com/serenity-is/serene/commit/6dce8162f4382badd429a9f0f1470acb64e8c4fd\n    \n  - Serenity.is would like to express gratitude to Fabian Densborn for his discovery, analysis, and coordination, as well as the SEC Consult Vulnerability Lab (https://www.sec-consult.com) for responsibly reporting the identified issues and collaborating with us as we addressed them.\n    \n  - Added the option to use ClamAV (https://www.clamav.net/) as an antivirus scanner for temporary uploads. To enable it, add `services.ConfigureSection<Serenity.Extensions.ClamAVSettings>(Configuration);` and `services.AddSingleton<IUploadAVScanner, Serenity.Extensions.ClamAVUploadScanner>();` to your Startup.cs after upgrading to Serenity/Serenity.Extensions 6.7.0+. Consult ClamAV documentation on how to install it on your platform. This feature will be enabled by default once these changes have been made in Startup.cs. If you want to disable it for development purposes, set ClamAV:Enabled to false in your appsettings.Development.json (not recommended for production!).\n    \n  - Added extensionless and `.htm`/`.html` to the upload file extensions blacklist by default. An attacker can include malicious scripts in such an HTML file, send an administrative user a link to that file via email, and if the administrative user is already logged in to the site while clicking the link, the script can call services, perform actions, etc. on behalf of the user as the cookies are sent by the browser.\n    \n  - Ensured that the Forgot password page does not reveal information to identify whether a user with the entered email exists.\n    \n  - Ensured that reset password tokens can only be used once. They already expired in 3 hours, but if an attacker could see the link within that time frame (e.g., by eavesdropping), they could use it to change the password again.\n\n## 6.6.6 (2023-04-04)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Fix empty text can't be used as DisplayName in forms/columns\n\n## 6.6.5 (2023-04-04)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** removing legacy AsyncLookupEditor from corelib as it is getting mixed up with AsyncLookupEditorAttribute in server side which is just a LookupEditor with Async = true\n  \n## 6.6.4 (2023-04-03)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Added default support for new languages including Arabic, Bangla, Czech, French, Hindi, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Romanian, Swedish, Chinese Traditional. Used machine translation for all these languages in addition to the existing languages. As these may not always be the best possible translations, any pull requests with improved texts are welcome.\n  - Used embedded resources under texts/resources folder for JSON translation files instead of static web assets under wwwroot/texts as these files are not meant to be directly accessed via web. This will also reduce number of published files, and simplify deployment.\n  - Introduced quick filter option in Translations page to show/hide user translated and text that has any translation in the target language. There are also buttons to export translated values / original values to make translation easier. Each translation resource folder also contains a template JSON file in English language that can be used as source.\n  - ITypeSource may return its assemblies if available via the new IGetAssemblies interface\n  - Introduce LanguageIdKeyPair to use as dictionary key in LocalTextRegistry.\n  - Added IGetAllTexts interface to LocalTextRegistry to return all registered texts\n  - Added ILanguageFallbacks interface for LocalTextRegistry to get/set language fallbacks.\n  - Added initialization support to LocalText directly, so that readonly localtexts can be used in nested text classes without having analyzer warnings\n  - PropertyItemsLocalTextRegistration to register texts defined implicitly via DisplayName, Tab, Category, Hint, Placeholder attributes in Forms/Columns so that they can be seen/translated in Translations page\n  - Also handle Hint, Placeholder, Category, Tab attributes for Row/Entity local text registration\n  - NavigationLocalTextRegistration to register texts for navigation items from attributes\n  - Moved NavigationItemAttribute down to Serenity.Core from Serenity.Web\n  - Site local text package has a default regex that will be included in addition to anything you define in appsettings.bundles.json, so you may remove LocalTextPackages section from your appsettings.json unless you included some additional texts there.\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Fix fields without displayname attributes are shown with their local text keys in grids/forms. Use the propertyname as implicit display name.\n  - Crash in Arabic culture in the constructor of ScriptCulture\n\n## 6.6.3 (2023-03-24)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Adjust brotli and gzip compression levels based on content length, caching duration and bundle type etc. as brotli with its default level is too slow, sometimes 100 times slower than gzip default level\n  - Add getRowDefinition() method to return row type and read idProperty etc. from there.\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Inline editing required fields that does not have NotNull/Required flag.\n\n## 6.6.2 (2023-03-23)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Generated navigation link referred to the old page class name ending with Controller\n\n## 6.6.1 (2023-03-18)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Criteria parser with params failed in some cases, especially with IN statements like 'a in @values'. Note that you can't use parens there, e.g. `a in (@values)` is invalid unlike SQL.\n\n## 6.6.0 (2023-03-14)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Added a new Criteria builder functionality, so that criteria can be defined easier without having to remember the JSON array structure. E.g. instead of `[['SomeField'], Criteria.Operator.in, [[1, 2, 3]]]` you can write `Criteria('SomeField').in([1, 2, 3])`, or instead of `[Criteria.Operator.isNull, ['SomeField']]` you can write `Criteria('SomeField').isNull()` with intellisense support.\n  - Introduced ability to parse criteria from an SQL like expression at client side, e.g. `request.Criteria = Criteria.and(request.Criteria, Criteria.parse('A = 'b' and B > 5 and (C in (1, 2, 3) or D like 'x%'))`\n  - It can also parse parameterized expressions similar to Dapper: `Criteria.parse(\"xyz = @p1 and abc like @p2\", { p1: 5, p2: 'test%' })`\n  - There is also a third recommended option using tagged string literals: `` Criteria.parse`xyz = ${15} and abc like ${'b%'}` ``\n  - Converted all basic samples pages (Serenity.Demo.BasicSamples) to fully modular code, e.g. ESM\n  - Converted all advanced samples pages (Serenity.Demo.AdvancedSamples) to fully modular code, e.g. ESM `(StartSharp)`\n  - Renamed all page controllers so that they use Page.cs suffix instead of Controller suffix. This made it more consistent, as their file names ended with Page.cs while the type they contained was named Controller.\n  - Renamed all service endpoint controllers so that they use Endpoint.cs suffix\n  - ServiceEndpoint now derives from ControllerBase instead of Controller as services should not normally return views. If you returned view from a service endpoint for any reason, you'll need to move it to a controller. The endpoints generated by Sergen will have Endpoint suffix instead of Controller suffix. Similarly, pages will have Page suffix.  \n  - Updated sergen and Pro.Coder so that it works fine with controllers without Controller suffix, e.g. XYZPage or XYZEndpoint\n  - There is now a new source generator in `Serenity.Pro.Coder` that generates full paths to ESM modules, just like MVC does it for view paths. This will allow referencing ESM module scripts with compile time check and intelli-sense `(StartSharp)`.\n  - Sergen now has a `ForeignFieldSelection` option that defaults to `All`. When it is `NameOnly` it will bring only the name field from foreign rows instead of all fields, so that your entities will be smaller and will cause less issues when a joined row's fields are renamed / removed. When it is `None` no foreign view fields will be generated.\n  - There is now a `IncludeForeignFields` option in sergen.json that allows including more fields by their field names, when the `ForeignFieldSelection` is `None` or `Name`.\n  - Added `FileScopedNamespaces` option to sergen.json so that the generated code can use the file scoped namespace feature in C# 10.\n  - Added `DeclareJoinConstants` option to sergen.json. When true generated rows will have join constants like `const string jCustomer = nameof(Customer)` and it will be used in expressions. This will make it easier to rename a join alias and use Origin etc. attributes.\n  - Added `EnableRowTemplates` option to sergen.json so that the generated row will define the `RowTemplate` class supported by `Serenity.Pro.Coder` `(StartSharp)`\n  - Added `OmitDefaultSchema` option to sergen.json. When it is true, the default schema name, e.g. \"dbo\" for SQL Server won't be emitted in generated field expressions in Row.cs\n  - Added `SaveGeneratedTables` option to sergen.json. When set to false, sergen will not save connection settings and table options like Identifier, Module etc. back to sergen.json after code generation.\n  - Added TSBuild -> EntryPoints setting to sergen.json. This is a list of globs for ESM entry points which defaults to `**/*Page.ts` and `**/*ScriptInit.ts`. This globs if specified are read by `tsbuild` script and the new ESM module paths source generator.\n  - There is a new JSON schema for sergen.json that will be picked up by Visual Studio automatically so that you can have intellisense support and descriptions while editing sergen.json files.\n  - It is now possible to use \"Extends\" function in sergen.json similar to tsconfig.json to extend the settings from a base file.\n  - A special type of extends value can be used to extend from defaults. E.g. when you set `\"Extends\": \"defaults@6.6.0\"` your settings will be extended from the defaults we set for 6.6.0 version of Sergen. The values for `defaults6.6.0` are: `DeclareJoinConstants: true, EndOfLine: LF, FileScopedNamespaces: true, ForeignFieldSelection: NameOnly, OmitDefaultSchema: true, SaveGeneratedTables: false, Restore: Exclude Files/Typings, ServerTypings -> LocalTexts: true`. This way you can use modern recommended defaults, while keeping backward compatibility for those who still want to use old defaults.\n  - Simplified scriban templates in Sergen\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** CKEditorBasePath default is changed to \"~/Serenity.Assets/Scripts/ckeditor/\" instead of the obsolete one \"~/Scripts/ckeditor/\".\n- Added more hooks and injection points in `GridEditController` so that it is now possible to dynamically set editor parameters, use a different editor type in a column for different rows, implement cascaded dropdowns etc. `(StartSharp)`\n  - Moved GridPage related extensions and types to Serenity.Extensions so that it can be used in feature projects\n  - It is now recommended to remove GridPageModel, GridPage.cshtml from your Serene/StartSharp and use the one in Serenity.Extensions instead\n  - The module for GridPage, e.g. SomePage.ts should have a default export function pageInit() instead of a jQuery ready script so that it can be passed options from controller/model and tested properly. jQuery ready is also generally not necessary for ES modules.\n  - There is now a PanelPage extension that creates a PanelDiv instead of a GridDiv.\n  - GridPage and PanelPage uses ModelPage extension which accepts a ModulePageModel that includes additional parameters like HtmlMarkup, Options to pass to the default export in page module, Layout, PageId etc. parameters.\n  - Obsoleted EnvironmentSettings.IsPublicDemo and used preprocessor directives instead\n  - Introduced s-site-logo-img class which allows specifiying the site logo for a img via its content property, so that the site logo for all pages like login, sidebar etc. can be changed from one location by overriding css rule like .s-site-logo-img { content: url(.../mylogo.png); } etc.\n  - There is also a s-form-title-logo class that adjusts the look of logo in the forms, e.g. rounded with sidebar band background. It might be used to adjust logo styling by overriding its css rules.\n  - Removed all the .cshtml files for membership related pages like Login, Signup, Reset etc. and moved their script code into Page.ts files so that it can be checked at compile time.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** There is no longer a globally defined Q.Lookup interface while using ES modules. If you referenced it in some modular code, you should `import { Lookup } from \"serenity-is/corelib/q\"` and replace `Q.Lookup` with `Lookup` in your project.\n  - IEditDialog.load methods fail argument made optional. It was normally optional but did not seem so in the typing.\n  - Arrange method in dialog type made public instead of protected\n  - Sergen prefers importing from `@serenity-is/corelib/q` instead of `@serenity-is/corelib` for types that are exported from both modules, like ServiceResponse, PropertyItem etc. This helps with `dts-generator` tool as it has problems with types with same names that are imported from multiple modules.\n  - Introduced DefaultSectionKeyAttribute so that settings can be configured by their default section key via the new ConfigureSection extension\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Fixed styling for EntityGridDialog panel\n  - jQuery UI datepicker was showing under the dialog when using it in a inline editing grid inside a dialog `(StartSharp)`\n  - Remove loading class from parent element as select2 will only remove the class from the input\n  - fix error when trying to to use Q.formatDate outside of 10:00 and 19:59 with format 'dd.mm.yyyy hh:mm' (#6723)\n\n## 6.5.4 (2023-02-28)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Implemented OpenID Authorization Code Flow, e.g. logging via the web site instead of with user/password in mobile / desktop apps ``(StartSharp)``.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** The services required for OpenIdAuthorizationControllerBase is changed, so you should get latest version of `OpenIdAuthorizationController.cs` from the StartSharp repository if you have that in your project.\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Handle the case where select2 is destroyed before the request is completed or timer fires\n  - Fixed icon for FileDownloadFormatter\n  - SelectEditor with async source should not update/clear its items when cascade value change etc.\n  - Resolve issue with group by in oracle due to alias starting with underscore\n\n## 6.5.3 (2023-02-27)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Add virtual methods / protected members to DefaultSqlConnections / DefaultConnectionStrings for better extensibility\n  - Changed update button text in german to Aktualisieren instead of Bearbeitung which was reported to be incorrect (#6689)\n  \nBugfixes:\n  - Fix field size not set to the correct variable, possibly affecting precision/scale\n  - BasePermissionAttribute should accept null values for compatibility\n\n## 6.5.2 (2023-02-21)\n\nFeatures:\n  - Added SqlNow, SqlUtcNow, SqlDateTimeOffset, Case, CaseSwitch, Coalesce dynamic expression attributes\n  - Added ability to use another type of expression attribute as arguments to the dynamic expression attributes, e.g. use SqlNow etc. in a DateDiff attribute like: `[DateDiff(DateParts.Day, typeof(SqlNowAttribute), \"t0.ReleaseDate\")]`\n  - Add ability to get/set the groupitemmetadataprovider in RemoteView\n  - DraggableGroupingMixin will try to create and auto register GroupItemMetadataProvider itself if it is not already registered and pass it to the view\n  - Make SqlConnections available to use for the derived classes of RowLookupScripts\n  - Added `ISiteAbsoluteUrl` abstraction to access web site's internal (local) and external (public) url's and `EnviromentSettings:InternalSiteUrl` setting that takes precedence over request's base URI, and SiteExternalUrl for report callbacks.  \n  - Refactored HTML to PDF conversion process via new `IHtmlToPdfConverter`, `IHtmlReportPdfRenderer`, `IHtmlReportRenderUrlBuilder` abstractions\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** To register the default implementations for `IHtmlToPdfConverter`, `IHtmlReportPdfRenderer` etc. services.AddReporting should be called instead of services.AddExcelExporter in Startup.cs.\n  - Added new `HtmlToPdfOptions` class that implements `IHtmlToPdfOptions` like the converters.\n  - Completely redesigned and refactored reporting system and abstractions via new `IReportFactory`, `IReportRenderer`, `IReportRetrieveHandler`, `IReportTreeFactory` interfaces. Make sure to call `services.AddReporting()` in Startup.cs.\n  - Added Puppeteer based HTML to PDF converter implementation with Chrome and experimental Firefox option `(StartSharp)`. `services.AddPuppeteerHtmlToPdf` should be called before `services.AddReporting` line to use Puppeteer instead of WKHtmlToPdf. To make some old reports keep using old WKHtmlToPdf based converter, add `[UseWKHtmlToPdf(true)]` attribute on the report classes.\n  - `TemplateHelper.RenderViewToString` can access the current request/action context if available\n  - Added experimental `HtmlReportFileUrlBuilder` that can use a temporary folder, instead of a callback for HTML report rendering.\n\nBugfixes:\n  - MultipleUploadEditor should selecting multiple files in upload dialog\n  - Fix Criteria.Exist for sqlite as it does not like double parenthesis (#6687)\n  - Group summaries was not displayed in some cases like when the group item metadata provider is not passed to the view options\n  - File watcher should not try to create watcher if the directory does not exist\n  - Add section.content for proper layout when opening panels if the navigation is hidden e.g. hideNav=1\n\n## 6.5.1 (2023-02-03)\n\nFeatures:\n - Introduced new BaseExpressionAttribute which allows inherited expression attributes to perform translation based on target dialect. Also the dialect itself can customize the translation by implementing the new ISqlExpressionTranslator interface.\n - New ConcatAttribute, DatePartAttribute and DateDiffAttribute dynamic SQL expression types that generates expression based on server type.\n - Optional Format for expression attribute types\n - Allow overriding field size via attribute\n - Allow specifying join alias in OriginAttribute indirectly via propery name of a property with LeftJoinAttribute\n - New useCssVars option in SleekGrid that allows using inline css variables at grid container element to position columns instead of a CSS stylesheet appended to the head\n - Don't swallow exception in source generators so that issues can be identified if any `(StartSharp)`\n \nBugfixes:\n  - LookupScriptRegistration should not try to run for abstract classes.\n  - Fix typo in Sum aggregator name and aggregator display texts\n\n## 6.5.0 (2023-01-26)\n\nFeatures:\n - **`[Breaking Change]`** Updating Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to 5.1.0. As Encrypt=true became the default in 4.x+ (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-4-0/ba-p/2983346) it may cause connections to fail. Please see the linked doc, and either install a trusted certificate in your SQL server (recommended!), or set TrustServerCertificate=true or Encrypt=false in your connection strings both in development and deployment/production!\n - Updated packages including Newtonsoft.json to 13.0.2, SixLabors.ImageSharp to 2.1.3, NUglify to 1.20.4, Microsoft.Build to 17.3.2, Spectre.Console to 0.46.0, Npgsql to 7.01, MySqlConnector to 2.2.5, Microsoft.Data.Sqlite to 7.0.2, FirebirdSql.Data.FirebirdClient to 9.11, Scriban to 5.5.2\n - Html encode jquery validator messages in showLabel function\n - Updated SleekGrid to 1.5.3 which includes useCssVars option to use css vars for cell positioning instead of dynamic stylesheet (up to 50 columns). This should reduce amount of css reflows on page load etc. It is not enabled by default yet.\n\n## 6.4.10 (2023-01-24)\n\nBugfixes:\n - propertygrid should htmlEncode field captions\n - draggabble grouping mixin should htmlEncode grouped column captions\n\n## 6.4.9 (2023-01-21)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - **Warning!** If htmlEncode is not called when using local texts in ascript method (e.g. `<div>{ text(\"SomeKey\") }</div>` instead of `<div>{htmlEncode(text(\"SomeKey\")) }</div>`, like getTemplate etc. an attackermay use the translations screen to inject javascript. This affected partsof our demo as everyone can login as admin and can use the translationscreen. The translations are reset every 30 mins in our demo so it was nota big issue. But you are strongly recommended to check your own code inaddition to standard screens like login, reset password etc. See ourlatest commits in Serene/StartSharp/Common Features, etc. repositories forfixes we applied. Even if no one other than the admin can entertranslations screen, it is still a good idea to mitigate the risk as youshould not trust translators, even the admin himself. We can't change the\"text\" or \"tryGetText\" functions to htmlEncode by default, as they may beused by others in contexts other than HTML like functions which expectsraw text like notify messages, dialog titles, column titles etc., whichwould result in double HTML encoding. Prefer localText() function insteadof obsolete text() function for better discoverability (but it does notencode as well)\n\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** htmlEncode now also encodes single and double quotes just like attrEncode. This is done to avoid cases where a developer might use htmlEncode in an attribute instead of attrEncode by mistake.\n\n## 6.4.8 (2023-01-18)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - set Widget.idPrefix to the value passed from property grid options, https://github.com/serenity-is/common-features/issues/21, so that the invalid examples in common-features like OtherFormInTab etc. work\n  \n## 6.4.7 (2023-01-16)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - fix sleekgrid groupitemmetadataprovider group header totals\n\n## 6.4.6 (2023-01-16)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - fix sleekgrid groupitemmetadataprovider colspan calculation\n\n## 6.4.4 (2023-01-08)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - Removed corelib/coverage folder from Serenity.Scripts nuget contents\n  \n\n## 6.4.3 (2023-01-07)\n\n> Release Notes: https://serenity.is/docs/release-notes/6.4.3\n\nFeatures:\n  - Flutter based mobile applications for Android/iOS `(StartSharp Enterprise)`\n  - OpenIddict integration and JWT authentication options `(StartSharp)`\n  - Introduced AutoValidateAntiforgeryIgnoreBearerFilter attribute which can be used in place of AutoValidateAntiforgeryAttribute and will skip anti-forgery validation when the request contains an `Authentication: Bearer` header and there are no cookie headers.\n  - New Glassy Light theme `(StartSharp)`\n  - Improved handling for type registries like `EnumTypeRegistry`, `EditorTypeRegistry`, and `FormatterTypeRegistry`. Improved error messages that are displayed when a type cannot be found. They can now discover types that are registered after the type initialization process is completed. Use a common base type registry for all type registries to make it consistent.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** `Q.getTypeName` is renamed to `Q.getTypeShortName`. Got rid of some static type properties like __typeName$, __metadata$ etc. that is no longer necessary. Used defineproperty for system related props like __typeName etc. to make them non enumerable\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** toastr notification functions like `Q.notifyError` and `Q.notifyInfo` will escape HTML by default. This is to avoid possible script injection attacks. Pass `escapeHtml: false` if you need the old behavior.\n  - Removed jQuery ScrollIntoView hard-coded dependency and use it only if it is available. You may remove `jquery.scrollintoview.js` from `appsettings.bundles.json`.\n  - Removed `jquery.iframe-transport.js` dependency. You may remove it from your `appsettings.bundles.json` as it is only used by jquery.upload plugin for very old browsers like IE9 etc.\n  - Serenity.Pro.UI.js dependency as it is only used for legacy `EmailClient` sample.\n  - Removed TemplateBundle from `appsettings.bundles.json`, introduced ColumnAndFormBundle that combines `ColumnsBundle` and `FormBundle`.\n  - Rewrote Dashboard with ES Modules `(StartSharp)`\n  - GroupItemMetadataProvider SleekGrid plugin is ported to ES Modules. Slick.Data.GroupItemMetadataProvider is now obsolete, use GroupItemMetadataProvider from \"@serenity-is/sleekgrid\" or Slick.GroupItemMetadataProvider\n  - Q.alert, Q.confirm, etc. methods are suffixed with `Dialog` to avoid mixing up with the browser methods, e.g. `Q.alertDialog`, `Q.confirmDialog`. Old methods are still available but obsolete.\n  - TsBuild trigger argument is now obsolete. You should change `prepare` script in `package.json` file with `dotnet build -target:RestoreTypings`\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** Some row properties are only available via IRow or IEditableRow interface. Introduced IEditableRow and instead of making desktop UI editing (e.g. WPF INotifyPropertyChanged, IsAnyFieldChanged, IsEditing) etc. related properties / methods of row instances only accessible via this interface. They were confusing and polluting the row interface in web applications where they were almost never used. Cast the row instance like ((IEditableRow)row).BeginEdit() etc to access them if ever used. Similary, \"IdField, IgnoreConstraints, NameField, Table, TrackAssignments, TrackWithChecks, GetDictionaryData, GetDictionaryDataKeys, SetDictionaryData\" properties and fields can only be accessed via IRow interface. This is done to avoid polluting intellisense list as they are very rarely used, and as a preparation to fix swagger / apiexplorer integration\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** rename MethodChainingExtensions to ChainableExtensions and only support single action overload as that is the only one which is used anywhere so far\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** make rarely used ValidateEnum and ValidateDateRange methods non-extension methods so they don't come up in the intellisense for rows. Not a breaking change unless you used them as extension methods.\n  - improved binding convention of IDbConnection and IUnitOfWork and ServiceRequest types in ServiceEndpoints so that api browsers like swagger etc. can analyse it better and not crash\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** `Slick.Event` is renamed to `Slick.EventEmitter`, and `Slick.EventHandler` is renamed to `Slick.EventSubscriber`, `Slick.Handler` is renamed to `Slick.EventListener` to avoid mixing up with browser types with same names.\n  - Introduced TransactionSettingsAttribute and added a TransactionSettings which can be configured via options pattern. ServiceEndpoint will check the attribute or transaction settings like IsolationLevel. The attribute, settings and the UnitOfWork object has a DeferStart option that defers starting the transaction until the Connection is opened. This flag might have undesired side effects, so use it at your own risk if you know what you are doing.\n  - Added the TransactionlessUnitOfWork which is an implementation of IUnitOfWork that does not actually start any transaction. Should only be used in edge cases to call methods that expect a IUnitOfWork instance, but you are sure that the whole operation will be readonly, or you don't really need a transaction. If using with save handlers etc it might be risky. Make sure there are no service behaviors that run behind the scenes which may write or require a transaction.\n  - Improved `TSTypeLister` performance by making it not dive into huge directories like `node_modules` if not needed.\n  \nBugfixes:\n  - use Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty and fix field proxy detected as class\n  - fix handling for dynamic property, https://github.com/serenity-is/Serenity/issues/6624\n\n## 6.4.2 (2022-12-09)\n\n> Release Notes: https://serenity.is/docs/release-notes/6.4.2\n\nBugfixes:\n  - fix script null reference issue with MultipleFileUploadEditors\n  - include source maps for some pro nuget packages in static web assets which were missing them (StartSharp)\n  - the key sent to IFilenameFormatSanitizer contained \"|\" chars\n\n## 6.4.1 (2022-12-09)\n\nFeatures:\n  - added AutoValidateAntiforgeryIgnoreBearerAttribute which can be used instead of AutoValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute to skip AntiForgery validation when cookie header is not present and Authorization header is Bearer (e.g. JWT etc). use it in place of AutoValidateAntiforgeryTokenAttribute in Startup.cs to try.\n  - implemented OpenIddict integration for OpenID / JWT authentication schemes in Serenity.Pro.OpenIddict (StartSharp)\n  - added LocalTextDataScript to access local text as a JSON object from mobile apps etc. by specifying package name with \"pack\" and language ID with \"lang\" query string parameters via DynJS.axd/RemoteData.LocalText or DynamicData/RemoteData.LocalText\n  - introduced IFilenameFormatSanitizer interface which can be used in place of default sanitizing logic in upload filename formatting by implementing it in a custom upload editor attribute by deriving from default ones or\n  injecting the implementation via DI.\n  - added StringHelper.SanitizeFilePath and made StringHelper.SanitizeFilename handle more invalid filename chars returned from Path.GetInvalidFilenameChars.\n  - serenity demo is moved to https://demo.serenity.is, old https://serenity.is/demo urls are redirected so it is not expected to cause a problem\n  - StartSharp repository is moved to https://github.com/serenity-premium/startsharp\n\nBugfixes:\n  - AllowNonImage in UploadOptions should be true, as it is mainly used for temporary uploads\n\n## 6.4.0 (2022-12-05)\n\nFeatures:\n  - switch to pnpm for Serenity and feature projects (Serene / StartSharp still use npm)\n  - also use state store for script type registry\n  - allow mocking Q.debounce function in corelib for testing purposes\n  - use jquery event bindings in SleekGrid where possible for better compatibility with legacy plugins\n  - make sure interface checks via Q.isAssignableFrom etc. succeed by checking via __typeName even if the same interface is bundled into multiple scripts\n  - abstracted SixLabors.ImageSharp dependency via new IImageProcessor interface, that might allow replacing that library with another in the future\n  - ThumbnailGenerator class is now obsolete, use it via DI by IImageProcessor interface\n  - abstracted upload processor via IUploadProcessor interface\n  - UploadProcessor is now obsolete, inject and use IUploadProcessor interface via DI\n  - abstracted upload file and image validation with new IUploadValidator interface.\n  - introduced IUploadOptions interface and UploadOptions class for keeping default upload options and using in FilePage\n  - reorganized upload editor attributes through new abstract class BaseUploadEditorAttribute\n  - image validation is now only performed for the extensions specified in ImageExtensions which is \".gif;.jpg;.jpeg;.png;\" by default\n  - default extension black list can now be modified via ExtensionBlackList property of upload editor attributes\n  - added UploadIntent property to upload editor attributes, which is a string that is passed to the upload editors and as a query string back to FilePage during temporary upload. This can be used to customize default thumbnail size, validations etc. in upload method based on intent.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** IUploadStorage.CopyFrom and IUploadStorage.WriteFile methods accept OverwriteOption enum instead of bool? autoRename flag which was confusing\n  - introduced full set of undelete handler related types and behaviors\n  - completed XML documentation for Serenity.Services and Serenity.Web\n  - switched to typescript modules also in Serene\n  - update bootstrap, bootstrap-icons and jquery. \n  - updated sleekgrid to 1.4.4\n  - jquery is now at Serenity.Assets/jquery/jquery.js instead of Serenity.Assets/Scripts/jquery-3.5.1.js, you should update your includes in appsettings.bundles.json\n  - updated movie tutorial for typescript modules\n  - updated serenity docs like introduction, di, configuration, authentication, localization, caching for latest serenity version\n  - updated serenity docs api reference to include descriptions for all serenity libs\n\nBugfixes:\n  - fix row selection mixin select all button state not updated for some cases\n  - corelib/slick had an embedded corelib/q copy because of esbuild configuration issue\n  - initially generated modular ServiceTyping by sergen contained invalid method URLs with Administration/User\n  - sleekgrid: auto column hints plugin were not working properly because of jquery event binding difference\n  - sleekgrid: fix rtl mode scroll column rendering\n  - sleekgrid: old column filter row headers are not deleted before creating new ones\n\n## 6.3.6 (2022-11-15)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - null for ImportClause in TSTypeLister\n\n## 6.3.5 (2022-11-15)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - better detection for formatters type in clienttypes transformation\n\n## 6.3.4 (2022-11-15)\n\nFeatures:\n  - add option to disable module re-exports (or indexes) for servertypings transform in sergen.json under ServerTypings/ModuleReExports\n\n## 6.3.3 (2022-11-14)\n\nFeatures:\n  - change TOptions generic argument for Widget to default to any\n\n## 6.3.2 (2022-11-14)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - fix group totals is not displayed\n\n## 6.3.1 (2022-11-08)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - possible null reference exception in sergen when combination types used as interfaces\n\n## 6.3.0 (2022-11-06)\n\n> Release Notes: https://serenity.is/docs/release-notes/6.3.0\n\nFeatures:\n  - ported all common features projects to ES modules, including Serenity.Extensions, Serenity.Demo.BasicSamples, Serenity.Demo.Northwind\n  - ported all pro features projects to ES modules, including Serenity.Pro.Extensions, Serenity.Demo.AdvancedSamples, Serenity.Pro.Meeting etc. `(StartSharp)`\n  - moved CSHTML views for feature packages to `/Areas/ProjectName` and code files to `/Modules` instead of `/ProjectName/`\n  - added simplified IFileSystem base interface which removes dependency to System.IO.Abstractions, but it can still be used in tests\n  - upload behavior refinements, remove hard coded dependency to editor attributes and use interfaces instead\n  - allow upload attributes other than ImageUploadEditor / MultipleImageUploadEditor to be also handled by upload behaviors by implementing some interfaces\n  - renamed MultipleImageUploadEditor to MultipleFileUploadEditor, ImageUploadBehavior to FileUploadBehavior\n  - testable disk upload storage via IDiskUploadFileSystem abstraction. it can also be used to create a custom disk upload storage.\n  - ported several tests including local texts, globalfilter written in .NET framework for Serenity.Core\n  - use LookupEditorBaseAttribute / ServiceLookupEditorBaseAttribute for editors defined in modules as well\n  - replace const enums with normal enums to comply with isolatedModules option\n  - export Formatter interface from @serenity-is/corelib in additional to @serenity-is/corelib/slick\n  - enable tsbuild clear plugin by default only when splitting is true. it is still possible to enable it by specifying clean: true\n  - delete only .js / .js.map files when clean plugin is enabled for tsbuild\n  - don't use const enum for es modules service method exports, but use const object instead\n  - better handling for enum types in es modules \n  - better handling for Razor SDK projects that use ProjectName dir instead of Modules folder\n  - improve imports for external module types in code / source generators\n  - moved ui overrides to serenity corelib from pro.extensions\n  - create new buttons-inner divs when a toolbar has separator, instead of creating a separator div\n  - specify full names for more classes including QuickSearchInput, TemplatedDialog etc.\n  - Areas/ProjectName is also scanned by MVC generator for views / strip view parts\n  - set buttontext as icon font only for < jquery ui 1.12.1 as 1.13x does not allow html in button text\n  - reuse editor type finding for external libs as long as their namespace match with project name. this improves type discovery for modules, as typescript does not preserve decorators in .d.ts files. make sure your namespaces match the project name, e.g. an editor with key 'MyLib.MySome.MyEditor' should be exported from a 'MyLib.MySome' project (mylib.mysome npm package) with 'MyEditor' classname.\n  - extends support for tsconfig.json in source / code generator\n  - better determination of module name in TSModuleResolver for node_modules packages\n  - also restore dist/index.js for project references to node_modules in addition to dist/index.ts\n  - auto fake import enums in form.ts / columns.ts if possible, to avoid errors when such types are in a different module\n  - add ResolveWithHash to HtmlScriptExtensions so it can be used to avoid caching issues while importing module page scripts under esm/..\n  - instead of removing a property from the form.ts when the editor type can't be discovered, assume it as a widget so it can be understood something is wrong and \"as any\" etc can be used to reference the form field in such cases\n  - adapt email client css for BS5 theme `(StartSharp)`\n\nBugfixes:\n  - output directory for Razor SDK projects should use ProjectName dir instead of Modules\n  - fix RowSelectionModel plugin export\n  - fix executeOnceWhenVisible alias in corelib typings\n  - fix GlobFilter regex based matching for `Modules/**/*` style patterns\n  - fix TSFileLister does not work exactly like tsconfig for patterns, as TypeScript considers all patterns to start at root unlike gitignore patterns\n  - fix deepClone does not work properly with Date and several other types of objects (used https://github.com/angus-c/just)\n  - also check for \"None\" in addition to \"none\" or other cases for module / namespace detection\n  - fix email client script error `(StartSharp)`\n\n## 6.2.9 (2022-10-22)\n\nFeatures:\n  - add tests for es module editor option generation\n  - don't generate row type if it has ScriptSkip attribute, even if it is referenced by something else. \n  - don't generate row / other type members if it has scriptskip or ignore attribute\n  - use export for nested permission key namespaces\n\n## 6.2.8 (2022-10-22)\n\nBugfixes:\n  - fix options for editors defined in es modules not generated in client types\n\n## 6.2.7 (2022-10-22)\n\nFeatures:\n  - try to import formatter types used by columns to Columns.ts so that modular formatters can be registered from the grids that they are used from\n  - add option to disable particular transform in source generator with sergen.json MVC/SourceGenerator and ClientTypes/SourceGenerator settings by using false.\n  - go back to non-incremental source generator for clienttypes as it breaks syntax highlighting when referencing .ts files as AdditionalTexts, and there is no single output .Web.js for modules `(StartSharp)`\n  - disable source generator when SourceGeneratorTransform is false in project file `(StartSharp)`\n  - read MVC/StripViewPaths from sergen.json in ViewPathsSourceGenerator if available `(StartSharp)`\n\n## 6.2.6 (2022-10-17)\n\nFeatures:\n  - published @serenity-is/tsbuild npm package which will be used from tsbuild.js\n  - added NodeScriptRunner for running tsbuild in watch mode (imported from .NET SpaServices)\n  - added startnodescripts settings in appsettings.Development to npm run tsbuild:watch in development at startup (StartSharp)\n  - try to import dialog types used by inplace add editors to Form.ts so that modular dialogs can be registered from the dialogs that these editors are used from\n  - include full name of class in registerClass calls for code generated by sergen \n  - removed maximizable dialog from sergen scriban templates as it is not a part of core and not used anymore\n  - send an empty source map with 202 status, instead of 403, to avoid seeing warnings when SourceMapSecurityMiddleware is enabled\n  - handling for root namespace in client types source generator (StartSharp)\n  - made add button functional in dashboard task list (StartSharp)\n  - reverted back to Microsoft.Data.SqlClient to 3.1.1 from 4.1.0 in sergen, as Encrypt=true became the default in 4.x+ (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server-blog/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-4-0/ba-p/2983346) which is a **`[Breaking Change]`** causing connections to fail.

EditorTypes.tt now uses full namespace to avoid confusion.\n  - embed bootstrap / jquery ui button conflict resolution to Serenity.Externals.js\n  - added tests and xml doc comments for service locator, configuration, authorization, caching features.\n  - TwoLevelCache now has a Get overload that takes only one expiration instead of two.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** moved ILocalTextRegistry interface to Serenity.Abstraction for consistency\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** renamed ApplicationConfigurationRepository to AppSettingsJsonConfigRepository and moved it to Serenity.Data (from Serenity.Web)\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** removed unused DevelopmentSettings and used ASP.NET settings like compilation debug=true,\n    customErrors etc.\n  - **`[Breaking Change]`** Distributed.Set now takes a TimeSpan instead of DateTime, for consistency with LocalCache class.\n\nBugfixes:\n\n  - fixed an interop problem with glimpse for service endpoints (ServiceModelBinder should be registered)\n  - PropertyGrid is no longer an async initialized widget. It will be async widget's own responsibility to attach to another async widget.\n  - EntityConnectionExtension First and Single methods no longer require an entity with IIdRow interface.\n\n\n## 1.3.1 (2014-10-14)\n\nBugfixes:\n\n  - dialog fills page correctly when maximized (breaking change in jQuery UI 1.11)\n  - make select editor non-abstract. required for enums to work\n\n\n## 1.3.0 (2014-10-09)\n\nFeatures:\n\n  - add ability to define grid columns server side (just like form definitions)\n  - extensible column formatter objects (string, number, enum, date etc.)\n  - reduce number of attributes and repetitive code required in service endpoints (JsonFilter, Result<T>, etc) through new ServiceEndpoint base class.\n  - new EnumKey attribute for enum types so same enum names in different namespaces doesn't get mixed\n  - async versions versions of Q.GetLookup, Q.GetForm etc.\n  - include promise library for async operations (make sure your LayoutHead.cshtml contains ~/Scripts/rsvp.js before jQuery)\n  - widgets that do async initialization. TemplatedWidget, EntityDialog, DataGrid etc. supports this new system.\n    to provide backward compability, this feature is only enabled by adding IAsyncInit interface to a widget class.\n  - allow criteria objects to be used on client side too (with some limitations to prevent SQL injections etc.)\n  - list requests can now specify filtering through client side criteria\n  - generate field names with entity classes in ServiceContracts.tt\n  - merge ServiceContracts.tt and ServiceEndpoints.tt (refer to Serene sample to update your own ServiceContracts.tt file)\n  - upgrade to Saltarelle Compiler 2.6.0\n  - upgrade to jQuery UI 1.11.1, jQuery Validation 1.13, FontAwesome 4.2, Bootstrap 3.2\n\nBugfixes:\n  - enum editors use integer keys instead of string keys\n  - fix slick grid column sort indicators in firefox\n"
