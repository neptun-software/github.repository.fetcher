By default, Windows doesn't support this feature. To work around this scenario, please run the PowerShell script `<root>/src/ensure-symlinks.ps1` as an administrator. This usually only needs to be run once.\n\n    **N.b., using symbolic links in Windows requires the drive be formatted as NTFS.**\n\nThis project depends on .NET 7.0. Before working on the project, check that the .NET prerequisites have been met:\n\n- [Prerequisites for .NET on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/windows?tabs=net70#dependencies)\n- [Prerequisites for .NET on Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux?tabs=net70#dependencies)\n- [Prerequisites for .NET on macOS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos?tabs=net70#dependencies)\n\n### First build\n\nThe first build must be executed on the command line (see below for details), but subsequent builds can be done directly within Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code.\n\n### Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code\n\nThis project supports [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.com) and [Visual Studio for Mac](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/visual-studio-mac/). Any version, including the free Community Edition, should be sufficient, as long as you install Visual Studio support for .NET development.\n\nThis project also supports using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). Install the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp) and install the [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) to get started.\n\n### Build and test (command line)\n\nYou can also build this project on the command line by running the following scripts in the root of the repo:\n\nWindows:\n\n```console\n    > .\\build.cmd\n```\n\nLinux or macOS:\n\n```console\n    $ ./build.sh\n```\n\nYou can both build and run the tests for the project by running the scripts with the following option:\n\nWindows:\n\n```console\n    > .\\build.cmd -test\n```\n\nLinux or macOS:\n\n```console\n    $ ./build.sh --test\n```\n\nFor additional options, you can get help as follows:\n\nWindows:\n\n```console\n    > .\\build.cmd -help\n```\n\nLinux or macOS:\n\n```console\n    $ ./build.sh --help\n```\n\n### Install your local build\n\nTo build and then install your developer build of the `dotnet-interactive` tool, you can run the PowerShell script\n\n```console\n    pwsh src/dotnet-interactive/build-and-install-dotnet-interactive.ps1\n```\n\nPowerShell for .NET Core is required. This will uninstall any previous version of `dotnet-interactive` you might have installed.\n\n### Arcade build system\n\n.NET Interactive is built with the support of the [Arcade](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade) build system. The Arcade tools provide common infrastructure for building, testing, and publishing .NET Foundation projects. This build system is not required for local development work, but using it will provide a higher fidelity\n\nIf you prefer a development environment that's more consistent with the out-of-the-box .NET experience, you can set the environment variable `DisableArcade` to `1`.\n\n## Building the Polyglot Notebooks extension for Visual Studio Code\n\nIn order to build the Polyglot Notebooks extension for Visual Studio Code, please follow the instructions below. Note that it's not necessary to use a local build of `dotnet-interactive` in order to work on the Visual Studio Code extension.\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nTo get started, you'll need:\n\n1. [Visual Studio Code Insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).\n\n2. [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).\n\n3. The LTS version of [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n\n### Build and test\n\n1. (*Windows only*) Open a PowerShell terminal as administrator and run `<REPO-ROOT>/src/ensure-symlinks.ps1`.\n\n2. Follow the regular build instructions as given above.\n\n3. Open the `<REPO-ROOT>/src/polyglot-notebooks-vscode-insiders` directory in Visual Studio Code Insiders. (From your terminal, you can run `code-insiders <REPO-ROOT>/src/polyglot-notebooks-vscode-insiders`.)\n\n4. Make the desired source code changes.\n\n5. Press F5 to launch the Visual Studio Code Extension Development Host.\n\n6. Run `Polyglot Notebook: Create new blank notebook` or open a file with the `.ipynb` extension.\n\n### Use a local build of the `dotnet-interactive` tool\n\nIf you've made changes to `dotnet-interactive` and want to try them out with Visual Studio Code, follow these steps:\n\n1. Make appropriate changes and build the `<REPO-ROOT>/src/dotnet-interactive/dotnet-interactive.csproj` project.\n\n2. In an instance of Visual Studio Code Insiders that has the extension installed (either via the marketplace or through the steps above), change the launch settings for the `dotnet-interactive` tool:\n\n   a. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl-Shift-P` on Windows or `Cmd-Shift-P` on macOS) and run `Preferences: Open Settings (Json)`.\n\n   b. In the file that opens, add the following:\n\n      ```json\n        \"dotnet-interactive.kernelTransportArgs\": [\n            \"{dotnet_path}\",\n            \"/PATH/TO/REPO/ROOT/artifacts/bin/dotnet-interactive/Debug/net8.0/Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.App.dll\",\n            \"[vscode]\",\n            \"stdio\",\n            \"--log-path\",\n            \"/path/to/a/folder/for/your/kernel-logs/\",\n            \"--verbose\",\n            \"--working-dir\",\n            \"{working_dir}\"\n        ],\n\n        \"dotnet-interactive.notebookParserArgs\": [\n            \"{dotnet_path}\",\n            \"/PATH/TO/REPO/ROOT/artifacts/bin/dotnet-interactive/Debug/net8.0/Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.App.dll\",\n            \"notebook-parser\",\n            \"--log-path\",\n            \"/path/to/a/folder/for/your/parser-logs/\",\n        ]\n      ```\n\n3. Save `settings.json`.\n\n4. Restart VS Code.\n\n5. To revert back to the original settings, delete the settings added in step 2 above and restart VS Code.\n\n### Use a local build of a Polyglot Notebooks extension\n\nIf you've made changes to the Polyglot Notebooks extension and want to try your changes locally, follow these steps:\n\n1. Run `build.cmd -pack`/`./build.sh --pack` to create the Nuget packages for the extensions\n\n2. Ensure that there aren't any kernels running for the extension in question. It's generally best to close all notebooks opened in VS Code as they might be locking some of these files.\n\n3. Run the `Polyglot Notebook: Create a new blank notebook` command in VS Code. Select `.dib` or `.ipynb` as the extension and any language as default.\n\n4. Save the notebook anywhere you like\n\n5. Run the `Polyglot Notebook: Restart the current Notebook's kernel` command\n\n6. In the first code cell, paste this code\n   - In the FolderName, give the path to the nuget cache. This should be `%userprofile%\\.nuget\\packages` on Windows and `~/.nuget/packages` on Mac/Linux\n   - Also replace `EXTENSIONNAME` with the name of the extension (e.g. `microsoft.dotnet.interactive.sqlserver`)\n   - On the `#i` line, fill in the path to the `dotnet-interactive` repo root\n   - On the `#r` line, use the same `EXTENSIONNAME` above, and then look in the `artifacts\\packages\\Debug\\Shipping` folder for the package you're using and get the version number from the name. e.g. a package named `Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.SqlServer.1.0.0-dev.nupkg` would result in this line `#r \"nuget: Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.SqlServer, 1.0.0-dev\"`\n\n    ```powershell\n    #!powershell\n\n    $FolderName = \"\\PATH\\TO\\NUGET\\CACHE\\packages\\microsoft.dotnet.interactive.<EXTENSIONNAME>\"\n    if (Test-Path $FolderName) {\n\n        Remove-Item $FolderName -Recurse -Force\n    }\n    else\n    {\n        Write-Host \"Folder Doesn't Exist\"\n    }\n\n    #!csharp\n\n    #i \"nuget: \\PATH\\TO\\REPO\\ROOT\\artifacts\\packages\\Debug\\Shipping\"\n\n    #r \"nuget: Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.<EXTENSIONNAME>, <EXTENSIONVERSION>\"\n    ```\n\n7. Run the cell\n   - If you get an error about access being denied, ensure that all other notebooks are closed and then restart the kernel again as in step 5.\n\n8. Now, use the kernel as you normally would. You should see your local changes being used by the extension.\n\n\n### Set up full suite of tests to run\n\nSome tests require additional setup or will be skipped. `JupyterKernel` tests for example are set up to have the same test run against a Jupyter server, directly against the Jupyter kernel over ZMQ, and with a simulation of the messages. Jupyter server and Jupyter kernel tests require the following setup or will be skipped. The simulation tests can be run without additional steps. \n\n### Run tests with a local Jupyter Server\n\n1. Install [Jupyter server](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/install.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)\n\n2. [Install R kernel](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/using-r-language/) for R tests by calling the following in Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or the terminal (Mac/Linux)\n```\nconda install -c r r-irkernel\n```\n3. Start the server locally as mentioned [here](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html). You can use any random string or guid for your_token value.\n```\njupyter notebook --no-browser --NotebookApp.token=<your_token> --port=8888\n```\n4. Set an environment variable `TEST_DOTNET_JUPYTER_HTTP_CONN` pointing to the server and the token you are using for the Jupyter server as \n```\n--url http://localhost:8888 --token <your_token>\n```\n5. The tests will now use the environment variable to connect to your server. \n\n### Run tests with a Jupyter Kernel over ZMQ\n\n1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution)\n\n2. [Install R kernel](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/using-r-language/) for R tests by calling the following in Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or the terminal (Mac/Linux) \n\n    ```console\n    conda install -c r r-irkernel\n    ```\n\n3. Set an environment variable `TEST_DOTNET_JUPYTER_ZMQ_CONN` pointing to conda installation and environment that has jupyter installed\n```\n--conda-env base\n```\n\n4. The tests will now use the environment variable to connect to your server. \n\n### Run tests directly against the language handler scripts\n\nThese tests can be run directly against the language handler scripts. This is useful for when making changes on the scripts sent to the jupyter kernel without needing a full integration.\n\n1. Python tests can be run directly in the Anaconda Prompt with IPython by calling `src\\Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.Jupyter.Tests\\LanguageHandlerTests\\run_python_tests.bat`\n\n2. R tests can be run directly in the Anaconda Prompt with RScript by calling `src\\Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.Jupyter.Tests\\LanguageHandlerTests\\run_r_tests.bat`\n\n3. Both Python and R tests can be run together in the Anaconda Prompt by calling `src\\Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.Jupyter.Tests\\LanguageHandlerTests\\run_tests.bat`\n\n"

          "content": "# Links for internal team members.\n\n## Test Script\n\nThe test script notebook is used to verify hard-to-automate end-to-end scenarios.\n\nTo use it, open the [test script notebook](vscode-insiders://ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode/openNotebook?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fdotnet%2Finteractive%2Fmain%2FNotebookTestScript.dib) in VS Code - Insiders\n\nIf the URL provided does not end in the notebook file's extension, you can specify the `notebookFormat` query parameter as an override with the supported values of `.dib` and `.ipynb`m e.g.:\n\n```\nvscode-insiders://ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode/openNotebook?notebookFormat=ipynb&url=https://contoso.com/myNotebook\n```\n\nURL redirects are supported by this scenario and the extension and/or `notebookFormat` parameter will be pulled from the final resolved URL.\n\n## PR Build Definition\n\nThe PR build definition can be found [here](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng-public/public/_build?definitionId=71) or by nagivating through an existing PR.\n\n## Signed Build Definition\n\n[Signed build definition](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_build?definitionId=743&_a=summary)\n\n## NuGet Package Upload\n\nNuGet packages produced from every build of `main` are auto-published to the NuGet feed `https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet-tools/nuget/v3/index.json`\n\n## Consuming NPM Packages\n\nThe signed build and CI machines aren't allowed to access npmjs.org directly.  If you add or update a Node package and your PR fails with:\n\n```\nBuilding NPM in directory src\\polyglot-notebooks-vscode-insiders\nnpm ERR! code E401\nnpm ERR! Unable to authenticate, your authentication token seems to be invalid.\nnpm ERR! To correct this please trying logging in again with:\nnpm ERR!     npm login\n\nnpm ERR! A complete log of this run can be found in:\nnpm ERR!     C:\\Users\\cloudtest\\AppData\\Local\\npm-cache\\_logs\\2023-03-07T20_48_41_356Z-debug.log\n```\n\n...then you'll need to ensure the new packages are added to the internal NPM mirror.\n\nTo do this:\n\n(this part only happens once)\n\n1. Navigate to the internal NPM package feed: https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_artifacts/feed/dotnet-public-npm\n2. Click \"Connect to Feed\".\n3. Select \"npm\".\n4. Follow the \"Project setup\" instructions shown.\n\n(this part may need to happen multiple times)\n\n1. Clear your local NPM cache with `npm cache clean --force`.\n2. Delete the `node_modules` directory in the directory where you added/updated the packages.\n3. Re-run `npm install` in the directory where you added/updated the packages.\n\nWhen you do this locally while authenticated, any packages _not_ on the internal mirror will be copied from npmjs.org.\n\n## Publish VS Code Extension\n\nThe signed build produces three versions of the VS Code extension, 2 against Stable VS Code and 1 against Insiders.  Both versions against Stable append a `\"0\"` character to the extension version number and Insiders appends a `\"1\"` character.\n\n### Prerequisite to publish\n\nThis is **temporary**. Before you invoke any of the pipelines below: \n\n* Create a new PAT token with the following scope [here](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/_usersSettings/tokens):\n\n   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87f2ad02-594c-440d-bbec-92332b12d864) \n\n* In the variable group [`dotnet-interactive-api-keys`](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_apps/hub/ms.vss-distributed-task.hub-library?itemType=VariableGroups&view=VariableGroupView&variableGroupId=107&path=dotnet-interactive-api-keys), replace the value of `vscode-marketplace-dotnet-tools-publish-token`. *Please make sure to set it as a secret!* These PAT tokens hold good for 7 days. \n**NOTE**: You should have access to publish to VS Marketplace for your PAT to work.\n\n* If publish fails because a PAT has expired, a new build will be needed after updating the PAT.\n\n### Stable with locked tool version\n\nThe Stable extension with the locked tool version can be published via [this](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_release?_a=releases&view=mine&definitionId=86) release definition.  **This will also immediately publish the corresponding Insiders version of the extension.**\n\n### Stable with latest tool\n\nThe Stable extension with the latest tool can be published via [this](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_release?_a=releases&view=mine&definitionId=115) release definition.  **This will also immediately publish the corresponding Insiders version of the extension.**\n\n### Insiders with latest tool\n\nThe Insiders extension with the latest tool can be published via [this](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_release?_a=releases&view=mine&definitionId=103) release definition.\n\nOnce any of those release definitions are invoked, the new extension will appear in the VS Code marketplace approximately 10 minutes later, after the marketplace has run their own internal validation.\n\nThe publish/verification script is located in this repo at [`eng/publish/PublishVSCodeExtension.ps1`](eng/publish/PublishVSCodeExtension.ps1).\n\n### Setting up a branch for package publishing\n\n1. (One time) Install the Arcade DARC tool by running `eng/common/darc-init.ps1` from a `pwsh` prompt.\n2. (One time) Run the command `darc authenticate`.  A text file will be opened with instructions on how to populate access tokens.\n3. (Side note) The help system in the `darc` tool is very good.  You can either run `darc --help` or `darc COMMAND --help` to get help on any command.\n4. View the current channel publishing configuration by running `darc get-default-channels --source-repo dotnet/interactive`.  You will see several entries that look look like this:\n\n   ```\n   (2459) https://github.com/dotnet/interactive @ main -> .NET Core Tooling Dev\n   ```\n\n   This means that the `main` branch of `dotnet/interactive` is publishing packages to the `.NET Core Tooling Dev` channel.\n5. Set the new branch to publish to the appropriate channel by running `darc add-default-channel --channel \"THE CHANNEL NAME\" --branch \"feature/the-new-feature\" --repo https://github.com/dotnet/interactive`.  The channel name you'll most likely use is `.NET Core Experimental` which corresponds to the `https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet-tools/nuget/v3/index.json` NuGet feed.  To determine the name of any channel, see the below section.\n6. Re-run step 3 to verify that the new branch is publishing to the correct channel.\n7. Any new build from that branch will publish packages to the specified channel.\n8. Be sure to update the appropriate `dotnet-interactive.interactiveToolSource` settings in the VS Code extension's `package.json` for both stable and insiders.\n\n### Mapping a channel name to a NuGet package feed.\n\nThe mapping between a channel name and the corresponding NuGet package feed, e.g., `.NET Core Tooling Dev` => `https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/dnceng/public/_packaging/dotnet-tools/nuget/v3/index.json` isn't straight forward.  I'll use the above values as an example.\n\n1. View the [`PublishingConstants.cs`](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/main/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed/src/model/PublishingConstants.cs) file in the `dotnet/arcade` repo on GitHub.\n2. Search for the channel name, e.g., `.NET Core Tooling Dev`.  As of this writing the definition is [here](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/c0e25012be6fc00d0e5d1480b2ee4610f490e735/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed/src/model/PublishingConstants.cs#L694-L703).\n3. Notice the `targetFeeds` parameter points to the `DotNetToolsFeeds` variable.\n4. The `DotNetToolsFeeds` variable is defined [here](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/c0e25012be6fc00d0e5d1480b2ee4610f490e735/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed/src/model/PublishingConstants.cs#L175-L181) and it's entry for shipping packages lists another variable, `FeedDotNetTools`.\n5. The [`FeedDotNetTools`](https://github.com/dotnet/arcade/blob/c0e25012be6fc00d0e5d1480b2ee4610f490e735/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Build.Tasks.Feed/src/model/PublishingConstants.cs#L85) variable lists the NuGet package feed.\n\n### Rolling back to an older version of the VS Code Extension\n\nTo roll back to a previous build, you'll need to:\n\n1. Find the build you'd like to roll back to.\n2. Copy the commit's SHA.\n3. Start a new signed build with that SHA.\n4. Use that build to publish like normal.\n\nThis ensures that the version number of the extension is always increasing to pass the VS Code Marketplace verification.\n\n## Internal Code Mirror\n\nThe public GitHub code is internally mirrored [here](https://dev.azure.com/dnceng/internal/_git/dotnet-interactive) to enable signed builds.  You'll likely never need to do anything with this.\n"

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n    7.

In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n    APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5.

Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions.

In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

          "content": "# .NET Interactive\n\n## What is .NET Interactive?\n\n.NET Interactive is an engine and API for running and editing code interactively, including:\n\n* Running code and getting its results.\n* Evaluating code to provide language services such as completions and diagnostics.\n* Sharing data and variables between multiple languages and across remote machines.\n\nWhile typically associated with notebook technologies such as Jupyter and the [Polyglot Notebooks extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode), .NET Interactive has other uses as well, such as building REPLs and embedded script engines.\n\nThe following languages are supported by Polyglot Notebooks and .NET Interactive:\n\n| Language                      | Variable sharing |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|\n| C#                            |        ✅       |\n| F#                            |        ✅       |   \n| PowerShell                    |        ✅       |          \n| JavaScript                    |        ✅       |          \n| SQL                           |        ✅       |   \n| KQL ([Kusto Query Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/))    |        ✅       |  \n| [Python](docs/jupyter-in-polyglot-notebooks.md)  |        ✅       |\n| [R](docs/jupyter-in-polyglot-notebooks.md)       |        ✅       |      \n| HTML                         |        ⛔         |     \n| HTTP                         |        ✅         | \n| [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/)         |        ⛔       |        \n\n### Polyglot Notebooks\n\nSince .NET Interactive is capable of running as a kernel for notebooks, it enables a polyglot (multi-language) notebook experience. When using the .NET Interactive kernel, you can use different languages from one cell to the next, share variables between languages, and dynamically connect new languages and remote kernels within a notebook. There's no need to install different Jupyter kernels, use wrapper libraries, or install different tools to get the best experience for the language of your choice. You can always use the best language for the job and seamlessly transition between different stages of your workflow, all within one notebook.\n\nFor the best experience when working with multi-language notebooks, we recommend installing the [Polyglot Notebooks](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.dotnet-interactive-vscode) extension for Visual Studio Code. While the full .NET Interactive feature set is available in Jupyter, many features are only usable via code, whereas the Polyglot Notebooks extension provides additional features including a language/kernel picker for each cell, enhanced language services, a multi-kernel variable viewer, and more.\n\n### Jupyter\n\nThe most popular notebook platform is Jupyter, and .NET Interactive is a fully supported Jupyter kernel that you can use with Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, nteract, and other Jupyter frontends. You can read more about using .NET Interactive as a Jupyter kernel [here](docs/NotebookswithJupyter.md).\n\n### REPLs\n\n.NET Interactive can be used as the execution engine for REPLs as well. The experimental [.NET REPL](https://github.com/jonsequitur/dotnet-repl) is one example of a command line REPL built on .NET Interactive. In addition, .NET REPL can be used for automated command line execution of notebooks.\n\n### Small factor devices\n\n.NET Interactive supports running on devices like Raspberry Pi and [pi-top [4]](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-top-4-.NET-Core-API). You can find instructions [here](docs/small-factor-devices.md).\n\n## FAQ\n\nFor more information, please refer to our [FAQ](./docs/FAQ.md). \n\n## Acknowledgements \n\nThe multi-language experience of .NET Interactive is truly a collaborative effort among different teams at Microsoft and in the community. We'd like to thank the following teams for contributing their time and expertise to helping bring support for other languages:\n\n- **PowerShell Team:** PowerShell support\n- **Azure Data Team:** SQL and KQL support\n- **Azure Notebooks Team**: Python, R, and Jupyter subkernel support\n\n## Telemetry\n\nTelemetry is collected when the `dotnet-interactive` tool is started. (If you are using the .NET Interactive libraries directly, they do not emit telemetry.) Once `dotnet-interactive` is running, it emits the names of packages imported into the notebook and the languages used to run individual cells. This data is hashed, allowing us to count unique values, but the pre-hashed values cannot be obtained from the telemetry. We do not collect any additional code or clear text from cells. All telemetry is anonymous. In addition, `dotnet-interactive` reports the usage for a specific subset of the verbs in the .NET Interactive CLI. Those verbs are:\n\n* `dotnet interactive jupyter`\n* `dotnet interactive jupyter install`\n* `dotnet interactive stdio` \n\n### How to opt out\n\nThe .NET Interactive telemetry feature is enabled by default. To opt out of the telemetry feature, set the `DOTNET_INTERACTIVE_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable to `1` or `true`.\n\n### Disclosure\n\nThe .NET Interactive tool displays text similar to the following when you first run one of the .NET Interactive CLI commands (for example, `dotnet interactive jupyter install`). Text may vary slightly depending on the version of the tool you're running. This \"first run\" experience is how Microsoft notifies you about data collection.\n\n```console\nTelemetry\n---------\nThe .NET Core tools collect usage data in order to help us improve your experience.The data is anonymous and doesn't include command-line arguments. The data is collected by Microsoft and shared with the community. You can opt-out of telemetry by setting the DOTNET_INTERACTIVE_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT environment variable to '1' or 'true' using your favorite shell.\n```\n\nTo disable this message and the .NET Core welcome message, set the `DOTNET_INTERACTIVE_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE` environment variable to `true`. Note that this variable has no effect on telemetry opt out.\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\n\nYou can contribute to .NET Interactive with issues and pull requests. Simply filing issues for problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing code improvements is greatly appreciated.
